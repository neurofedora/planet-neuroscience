	<content:encoded>Active intracellular transport of organelles relies on the coordinated activities of cytoplasmic dynein and kinesin, ATP-dependent microtubule motor proteins. While axonemal dynein was discovered during the mid-1960s, it was not until the mid-1980s that kinesin was discovered by Ron Vale and colleagues, as reported in 1985. Their research demonstrated that the newly identified protein, isolated from both squid axoplasm and bovine brain, was independently capable of driving microtubule gliding or organelle movement.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The ability of central synapses to undergo long-term potentiation (LTP) still captures the imagination of scientists and has become one of the most fascinating and deeply studied questions in modern neuroscience. By the mid-1990s, however, the field was deeply ensnarled in trying to answer a passionately dichotomous question: is LTP expressed by a pre- or a postsynaptic mechanism? Experimental results that could only be seen by many as being incontrovertibly contradictory presented a perplexing conundrum.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Is an amygdala necessary to experience and perceive fear? Intriguing evidence comes from patient S.M. who lost her left and right amygdalae to disease. Initial testing suggested that S.M.’s most defining symptom was an inability to recognize fear in other people’s facial expressions. A fascinating paper by Adolphs and colleagues in 2005 examined one potential mechanism for this impairment: a failure to spontaneously attend to widened eyes, the most distinctive physical feature portrayed in symbolic fear expressions.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Stepwise wiring of the Drosophila olfactory map requires specific Plexin B levels</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/39088</link>
	<content:encoded>The precise assembly of a neural circuit involves many consecutive steps. The conflict between a limited number of wiring molecules and the complexity of the neural network impels each molecule to execute multiple functions at different steps. Here, we examined the cell-type specific distribution of endogenous levels of axon guidance receptor Plexin B (PlexB) in the developing antennal lobe, the first olfactory processing center in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. We found that different classes of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) express PlexB at different levels in two wiring steps - axonal trajectory choice and subsequent target selection. In line with its temporally distinct patterns, the proper levels of PlexB control both steps in succession. Genetic interactions further revealed that the effect of high-level PlexB is antagonized by its canonical partner Sema2b. Thus, PlexB plays a multifaceted role in instructing the assembly of the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; olfactory circuit through temporally-regulated expression patterns and expression level-dependent effects.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Negative regulation of conserved RSL class I bHLH transcription factors evolved independently among land plants</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38529</link>
	<content:encoded>Basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors encoded by &lt;i&gt;RSL&lt;/i&gt; class I genes control a gene regulatory network that positively regulates the development of filamentous rooting cells - root hairs and rhizoids - in land plants. The GLABRA2 transcription factor negatively regulates these genes in the angiosperm &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt;. To find negative regulators of &lt;i&gt;RSL&lt;/i&gt; class I genes in early diverging land plants we conducted a mutant screen in the liverwort &lt;i&gt;Marchantia polymorpha&lt;/i&gt;. This identified FEW RHIZOIDS1 (MpFRH1) microRNA (miRNA) that negatively regulates the &lt;i&gt;RSL &lt;/i&gt;class I gene Mp&lt;i&gt;RSL1&lt;/i&gt;. The miRNA and its mRNA target constitute a feedback mechanism that controls epidermal cell differentiation. MpFRH1 miRNA target sites are conserved among liverwort &lt;i&gt;RSL&lt;/i&gt; class I mRNAs but are not present in &lt;i&gt;RSL&lt;/i&gt; class I mRNAs of other land plants. These findings indicate that while &lt;i&gt;RSL&lt;/i&gt; class I genes are ancient and conserved, independent negative regulatory mechanisms evolved in different lineages during land plant evolution.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: An asymmetric centromeric nucleosome</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37911</link>
	<content:encoded>Nucleosomes contain two copies of each core histone, held together by a naturally symmetric, homodimeric histone H3-H3 interface. This symmetry has complicated efforts to determine the regulatory potential of this architecture. Through molecular design and in vivo selection, we recently generated obligately heterodimeric H3s, providing a powerful tool for discovery of the degree to which nucleosome symmetry regulates chromosomal functions in living cells (Ichikawa et al., 2017). We now have extended this tool to the centromeric H3 isoform (Cse4/CENP-A) in budding yeast. These studies indicate that a single Cse4 N- or C-terminal extension per pair of Cse4 molecules is sufficient for kinetochore function, and validate previous experiments indicating that an octameric centromeric nucleosome is required for viability in this organism. These data also support the generality of the H3 asymmetric interface for probing general questions in chromatin biology.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Stage-dependent remodeling of projections to motor cortex in ALS mouse model revealed by a new variant retrograde-AAV9</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36892</link>
	<content:encoded>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by the progressive degeneration of motoneurons in the primary motor cortex (pMO) and in spinal cord. However, the pathogenic process involves multiple subnetworks in the brain and functional MRI studies demonstrate an increase in functional connectivity in areas connected to pMO despite the ongoing neurodegeneration. The extent and the structural basis of the motor subnetwork remodelling in experimentally-tractable models remain unclear. We have developed a new retrograde AAV9 to quantitatively map the projections to pMO in the SOD1(G93A) ALS mouse model. We show an increase in the number of neurons projecting from somatosensory cortex to pMO at presymptomatic stages, followed by an increase in projections from thalamus, auditory cortex and contralateral MO (inputs from 20 other structures remains unchanged) as disease advances. The stage- and structure-dependent remodeling of projection to pMO in ALS may provide insights into the hyperconnectivity observed in ALS patients.</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Maternal Folic Acid Supplementation During Pregnancy Promotes Neurogenesis and Synaptogenesis in Neonatal Rat Offspring</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy207/5078224?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Maternal folic acid supplementation during pregnancy is associated with improved cognitive performances in offspring. However, the effect of supplementation on offspring’s neurogenesis and synaptogenesis is unknown, and whether supplementation should be continued throughout pregnancy is controversial. In present study, 3 groups of female rats were fed a folate-normal diet, folate-deficient diet, or folate-supplemented diet from 1 week before mating until the end of pregnancy. A fourth group fed folate-normal diet from 1 week before mating until mating, then fed folate-supplemented diet for 10 consecutive days, then fed folate-normal diet until the end of pregnancy. Offspring were sacrificed on postnatal day 0 for measurement of neurogenesis and synaptogenesis by immunofluorescence and western blot. Additionally neural stem cells (NSCs) were cultured from offspring’s hippocampus for immunocytochemical measurement of their rates of proliferation and neuronal differentiation. The results demonstrated that maternal folic acid supplementation stimulated hippocampal neurogenesis by increasing proliferation and neuronal differentiation of NSCs, and also enhanced synaptogenesis in cerebral cortex of neonatal offspring. Hippocampal neurogenesis was stimulated more when supplementation was continued throughout pregnancy instead of being limited to the periconceptional period. In conclusion, maternal folic acid supplementation, especially if continued throughout pregnancy, improves neurogenesis and synaptogenesis in neonatal offspring.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Atypical Local and Distal Patterns of Occipito-frontal Functional Connectivity are Related to Symptom Severity in Autism</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy201/5078220?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are increasingly prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by sociocommunicative impairments. Growing consensus indicates that neurobehavioral abnormalities require explanation in terms of interconnected networks. Despite theoretical speculations about increased local and reduced distal connectivity, links between local and distal functional connectivity have not been systematically investigated in ASDs. Specifically, it remains open whether hypothesized local overconnectivity may reflect isolated versus overly integrative processing. Resting state functional MRI data from 57 children and adolescents with ASDs and 51 typically developing (TD) participants were included. In regional homogeneity (ReHo) analyses, pericalcarine visual cortex was found be locally overconnected (ASD &amp;gt; TD). Using this region as seed in whole-brain analyses, we observed overconnectivity in distal regions, specifically middle frontal gyri, for an ASD subgroup identified through &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;-means clustering. While in this subgroup local occipital to distal frontal overconnectivity was associated with greater symptom severity, a second subgroup showed the opposite pattern of connectivity and symptom severity correlations. Our findings suggest that increased local connectivity in ASDs is region-specific and may be partially associated with more integrative long-distance connectivity. Results also highlight the need to test for subtypes, as differential patterns of brain–behavior links were observed in two distinct subgroups of our ASD cohort.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Memory retrieval can strengthen, but also distort memories. Parietal cortex is a candidate region involved in retrieval-induced memory changes as it reflects retrieval success and represents retrieved content. Here, we conducted an fMRI experiment to test whether different forms of parietal reactivation predict distinct consequences of retrieval. Subjects studied associations between words and pictures of faces, scenes, or objects, and then repeatedly retrieved half of the pictures, reporting the vividness of the retrieved pictures (“retrieval practice”). On the following day, subjects completed a recognition memory test for individual pictures. Critically, the test included lures highly similar to studied pictures. Behaviorally, retrieval practice increased both hit and false alarm (FA) rates to similar lures, confirming a causal influence of retrieval on subsequent memory. Using pattern similarity analyses, we measured two different levels of reactivation during retrieval practice: generic “category-level” reactivation and idiosyncratic “item-level” reactivation. Vivid remembering during retrieval practice was associated with stronger category- and item-level reactivation in parietal cortex. However, these measures differentially predicted subsequent recognition memory performance: whereas higher category-level reactivation tended to predict FAs to lures, item-level reactivation predicted correct rejections. These findings indicate that parietal reactivation can be decomposed to tease apart distinct consequences of memory retrieval.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Auditory Training Reverses Lead (Pb)-Toxicity-Induced Changes in Sound-Azimuth Selectivity of Cortical Neurons</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy199/5078222?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Lead (Pb) causes significant adverse effects on the developing brain, resulting in cognitive and learning disabilities in children. The process by which lead produces these negative changes is largely unknown. The fact that children with these syndromes also show deficits in central auditory processing, however, indicates a speculative but disturbing relationship between lead-exposure, impaired auditory processing, and behavioral dysfunction. Here we studied in rats the changes in cortical spatial tuning impacted by early lead-exposure and their potential restoration to normal by auditory training. We found animals that were exposed to lead early in life displayed significant behavioral impairments compared with naïve controls while conducting the sound-azimuth discrimination task. Lead-exposure also degraded the sound-azimuth selectivity of neurons in the primary auditory cortex. Subsequent sound-azimuth discrimination training, however, restored to nearly normal the lead-degraded cortical azimuth selectivity. This reversal of cortical spatial fidelity was paralleled by changes in cortical expression of certain excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter receptor subunits. These results in a rodent model demonstrate the persisting neurotoxic effects of early lead-exposure on behavioral and cortical neuronal processing of spatial information of sound. They also indicate that attention-demanding auditory training may remediate lead-induced cortical neurological deficits even after these deficits have occurred.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Interdatabase Variability in Cortical Thickness Measurements</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy197/5078221?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The phenomenon of cortical thinning with age has been well established; however, the measured rate of change varies between studies. The source of this variation could be image acquisition techniques including hardware and vendor specific differences. Databases are often consolidated to increase the number of subjects but underlying differences between these datasets could have undesired effects. We explore differences in cerebral cortex thinning between 4 databases, totaling 1382 subjects. We investigate several aspects of these databases, including: 1) differences between databases of cortical thinning rates versus age, 2) correlation of cortical thinning rates between regions for each database, and 3) regression bootstrapping to determine the effect of the number of subjects included. We also examined the effect of different databases on age prediction modeling. Cortical thinning rates were significantly different between databases in all 68 parcellated regions (ANCOVA, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Subtle differences were observed in correlation matrices and bootstrapping convergence. Age prediction modeling using a leave-one-out cross-validation approach showed varying prediction performance (0.64 &amp;lt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;lt; 0.82) between databases. When a database was used to calibrate the model and then applied to another database, prediction performance consistently decreased. We conclude that there are indeed differences in the measured cortical thinning rates between these large-scale databases.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy193/5078215?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Musical training has been demonstrated to benefit speech-in-noise perception. It is however unknown whether this effect translates to selective listening in cocktail party situations, and if so what its neural basis might be. We investigated this question using magnetoencephalography-based speech envelope reconstruction and a sustained selective listening task, in which participants with varying amounts of musical training attended to 1 of 2 speech streams while detecting rare target words. Cortical frequency-following responses (FFR) and auditory working memory were additionally measured to dissociate musical training-related effects on low-level auditory processing versus higher cognitive function. Results show that the duration of musical training is associated with a reduced distracting effect of competing speech on target detection accuracy. Remarkably, more musical training was related to a robust neural tracking of both the to-be-attended and the to-be-ignored speech stream, up until late cortical processing stages. Musical training-related increases in FFR power were associated with a robust speech tracking in auditory sensory areas, whereas training-related differences in auditory working memory were linked to an increased representation of the to-be-ignored stream beyond auditory cortex. Our findings suggest that musically trained persons can use additional information about the distracting stream to limit interference by competing speech.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy192/5078219?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is an RNA-binding protein involved in translational regulation of mRNAs that play key roles in synaptic morphology and plasticity. The functional absence of FMRP causes the fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common form of inherited intellectual disability and the most common monogenic cause of autism. No effective treatment is available for FXS. We recently identified the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Phosphodiesterase 2A&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Pde2a&lt;/span&gt;) mRNA as a prominent target of FMRP. PDE2A enzymatic activity is increased in the brain of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Fmr1&lt;/span&gt;-KO mice, a recognized model of FXS, leading to decreased levels of cAMP and cGMP. Here, we pharmacologically inhibited PDE2A in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Fmr1&lt;/span&gt;-KO mice and observed a rescue both of the maturity of dendritic spines and of the exaggerated hippocampal mGluR-dependent long-term depression. Remarkably, PDE2A blockade rescued the social and communicative deficits of both mouse and rat &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Fmr1-&lt;/span&gt;KO animals. Importantly, chronic inhibition of PDE2A in newborn &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Fmr1&lt;/span&gt;-KO mice followed by a washout interval, resulted in the rescue of the altered social behavior observed in adolescent mice. Altogether, these results reveal the key role of PDE2A in the physiopathology of FXS and suggest that its pharmacological inhibition represents a novel therapeutic approach for FXS.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Cortical Maps of Hierarchical Linguistic Structures during Speech Perception</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy191/5078223?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The hierarchical nature of language requires human brain to internally parse connected-speech and incrementally construct abstract linguistic structures. Recent research revealed multiple neural processing timescales underlying grammar-based configuration of linguistic hierarchies. However, little is known about where in the whole cerebral cortex such temporally scaled neural processes occur. This study used novel magnetoencephalography source imaging techniques combined with a unique language stimulation paradigm to segregate cortical maps synchronized to 3 levels of linguistic units (i.e., words, phrases, and sentences). Notably, distinct ensembles of cortical loci were identified to feature structures at different levels. The superior temporal gyrus was found to be involved in processing all 3 linguistic levels while distinct ensembles of other brain regions were recruited to encode each linguistic level. Neural activities in the right motor cortex only followed the rhythm of monosyllabic words which have clear acoustic boundaries, whereas the left anterior temporal lobe and the left inferior frontal gyrus were selectively recruited in processing phrases or sentences. Our results ground a multi-timescale hierarchical neural processing of speech in neuroanatomical reality with specific sets of cortices responsible for different levels of linguistic units.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Guided imagery is a commonly used method for treating many disorders, such as chronic pain. The present study examined a novel intervention for pain relief that integrates acupuncture with imagery called video-guided acupuncture imagery treatment (VGAIT). A total of 27 healthy subjects were recruited for a crossover-design study that included 5 sessions administered in a randomized order (i.e., baseline and 4 different interventions). We investigated changes in pain threshold and fMRI signals modulated by: 1) VGAIT, watching a video of acupuncture previously administered on the participant’s own body at baseline while imagining it being concurrently applied; 2) a VGAIT control condition, watching a video of a cotton swab touching the skin; 3) real acupuncture; and 4) sham acupuncture. Results demonstrated that real acupuncture and VGAIT significantly increased pain threshold compared with respective control groups. Imaging showed that real acupuncture produced greater activation of the insula compared with VGAIT. VGAIT produced greater deactivation at the rostral anterior cingulate cortex. Our findings demonstrate that VGAIT holds potential clinical value for pain management.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Aging is characterized by substantial average decline in memory performance. Yet contradictory explanations have been given for how the brains of high-performing older adults work: either by engagement of compensatory processes such as recruitment of additional networks or by maintaining young adults’ patterns of activity. Distinguishing these components requires large experimental samples and longitudinal follow-up. Here, we investigate which features are key to high memory in aging, directly testing these hypotheses by studying a large sample of adult participants (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt; 300) with fMRI during an episodic memory experiment where item-context relationships were implicitly encoded. The analyses revealed that low levels of activity in frontal networks—known to be involved in memory encoding—were associated with low memory performance in the older adults only. Importantly, older participants with low memory performance and low frontal activity exhibited a strong longitudinal memory decline in an independent verbal episodic memory task spanning 8 years back (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 52). These participants were also characterized by lower hippocampal volumes and steeper rates of cortical atrophy. Altogether, maintenance of frontal brain function during encoding seems to be a primary characteristic of preservation of memory function in aging, likely reflecting intact ability to integrate information.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The heterogeneous neuronal subgroups of the basal forebrain corticopetal system (BFcs) have been shown to modulate cortical functions through their cholinergic, gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic, and glutamatergic projections to the entire cortex. Although previous studies suggested that the basalo-cortical projection system influences various cognitive functions, particularly via its cholinergic component, these studies only focused on certain parts of the BFcs or nearby structures, leaving aside a more systematic picture of the functional connectivity of BFcs subcompartments. Moreover, these studies lacked the high-spatial resolution and the probability maps needed to identify specific subcompartments. Recent advances in the ultra-high field 7T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provided potentially unprecedented spatial resolution of functional MRI images to study the subdivision of the BFcs. In this study, the BF space containing corticopetal cells was divided into 3 functionally distinct subdivisions based on functional connection to cortical regions derived from fMRI. The overall functional connection of each BFcs subdivision was examined with a test-retest study. Finally, a meta-analysis was used to study the related functional topics of each BF subdivision. Our results demonstrate distinct functional connectivity patterns of these subdivisions along the rostrocaudal axis of the BF. All three compartments have shown consistent segregation and overlap at specific target regions including the hippocampus, insula, thalamus, and the cingulate gyrus, suggesting functional integration and separation in BFcs.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

A user ready, portable, documented software package, &lt;i&gt;NFTsim&lt;/i&gt;, is presented to facilitate numerical simulations of a wide range of brain systems using continuum neural field modeling. &lt;i&gt;NFTsim&lt;/i&gt; enables users to simulate key aspects of brain activity at multiple scales. At the microscopic scale, it incorporates characteristics of local interactions between cells, neurotransmitter effects, synaptodendritic delays and feedbacks. At the mesoscopic scale, it incorporates information about medium to large scale axonal ranges of fibers, which are essential to model dissipative wave transmission and to produce synchronous oscillations and associated cross-correlation patterns as observed in local field potential recordings of active tissue. At the scale of the whole brain, &lt;i&gt;NFTsim&lt;/i&gt; allows for the inclusion of long range pathways, such as thalamocortical projections, when generating macroscopic activity fields. The multiscale nature of the neural activity produced by &lt;i&gt;NFTsim&lt;/i&gt; has the potential to enable the modeling of resulting quantities measurable via various neuroimaging techniques. In this work, we give a comprehensive description of the design and implementation of the software. Due to its modularity and flexibility, &lt;i&gt;NFTsim&lt;/i&gt; enables the systematic study of an unlimited number of neural systems with multiple neural populations under a unified framework and allows for direct comparison with analytic and experimental predictions. The code is written in C++ and bundled with Matlab routines for a rapid quantitative analysis and visualization of the outputs. The output of &lt;i&gt;NFTsim&lt;/i&gt; is stored in plain text file enabling users to select from a broad range of tools for offline analysis. This software enables a wide and convenient use of powerful physiologically-based neural field approaches to brain modeling. &lt;i&gt;NFTsim&lt;/i&gt; is distributed under the Apache 2.0 license.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MuRjTeyg-48&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Lineage space and the propensity of bacterial cells to undergo growth transitions</title>

The molecular makeup of the offspring of a dividing cell gradually becomes phenotypically decorrelated from the parent cell by noise and regulatory mechanisms that amplify phenotypic heterogeneity. Such regulatory mechanisms form networks that contain thresholds between phenotypes. Populations of cells can be poised near the threshold so that a subset of the population probabilistically undergoes the phenotypic transition. We sought to characterize the diversity of bacterial populations around a growth-modulating threshold via analysis of the effect of non-genetic inheritance, similar to conditions that create antibiotic-tolerant persister cells and other examples of bet hedging. Using simulations and experimental lineage data in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, we present evidence that regulation of growth amplifies the dependence of growth arrest on cellular lineage, causing clusters of related cells undergo growth arrest in certain conditions. Our simulations predict that lineage correlations and the sensitivity of growth to changes in toxin levels coincide in a critical regime. Below the critical regime, the sizes of related growth arrested clusters are distributed exponentially, while in the critical regime clusters sizes are more likely to become large. Furthermore, phenotypic diversity can be nearly as high as possible near the critical regime, but for most parameter values it falls far below the theoretical limit. We conclude that lineage information is indispensable for understanding regulation of cellular growth.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/i4Rue-EUE3k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Deciphering the Contribution of Oriens-Lacunosum/Moleculare (OLM) Cells to Intrinsic Theta Rhythms Using Biophysical Local Field Potential (LFP) Models</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0146-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Oscillations in local field potentials (LFPs) are prevalent and contribute to brain function. An understanding of the cellular correlates and pathways affecting LFPs is needed but many overlapping pathways in vivo make this difficult to achieve. A prevalent LFP rhythm in the hippocampus associated with memory processing and spatial navigation is the theta (3-12 Hz) oscillation. Theta rhythms emerge intrinsically in an in vitro whole hippocampus preparation and this reduced preparation makes it possible to assess the contribution of different cell types to LFP generation. We focus on oriens-lacunosum/moleculare (OLM) cells as a major class of interneurons in the hippocampus. OLM cells can influence pyramidal (PYR) cells through two distinct pathways: by direct inhibition of PYR cell distal dendrites, and by indirect disinhibition of PYR cell proximal dendrites. We use previous inhibitory network models and build biophysical LFP models using volume conductor theory. We examine the effect of OLM cells to ongoing intrinsic LFP theta rhythms by directly comparing our model LFP features with experiment. We find that OLM cell inputs regulate the robustness of LFP responses without affecting their average power and that this robust response depends on co-activation of distal inhibition and basal excitation. We use our models to estimate the spatial extent of the region generating LFP theta rhythms, leading us to predict that about 22,000 PYR cells participate in intrinsic theta generation. Besides obtaining an understanding of OLM cell contributions to intrinsic LFP theta rhythms, our work can help decipher cellular correlates of in vivo LFPs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance&lt;/b&gt; Oscillatory local field potentials (LFPs) are extracellularly recorded signals that are widely used to interpret information processing in the brain. Theta (3-12 Hz) LFP rhythms are correlated with memory processing, and inhibitory cell subtypes contribute in particular ways to theta. While a precise biophysical modeling scheme linking cellular activity to LFP signals has been established, it is difficult to assess cellular contributions &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; to LFPs because of spatiotemporally overlapping pathways that prevent the unambiguous separation of signals. Using an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; preparation that exhibits theta rhythms and where there is much less overlap, we build biophysical LFP models and uncover distinct inhibitory cellular contributions. This work brings us closer to obtaining cellular correlates of LFPs and brain function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07021</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fractional extensions of the cable equation have been proposed in the
literature to describe transmembrane potential in spiny dendrites. The
anomalous behavior has been related in the literature to the geometrical
properties of the system, in particular, the density of spines, by experiments,
computer simulations, and in comb-like models.~The same PDE can be related to
more than one stochastic process leading to anomalous diffusion behavior. The
time-fractional diffusion equation can be associated to a continuous time
random walk (CTRW) with power-law waiting time probability or to a special case
of the Erd\'ely-Kober fractional diffusion, described by the ggBm. In this
work, we show that time fractional generalization of the cable equation arises
naturally in the CTRW by considering a superposition of Markovian processes and
in a {\it ggBm-like} construction of the random variable.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06889</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Continuous attractor neural networks generate a set of smoothly connected
attractor states. In memory systems of the brain, these attractor states may
represent continuous pieces of information such as spatial locations and head
directions of animals. However, during the replay of previous experiences,
hippocampal neurons show a discontinuous sequence in which discrete transitions
of neural state are phase-locked with the slow-gamma (30-40 Hz) oscillation.
Here, we explored the underlying mechanisms of the discontinuous sequence
generation. We found that a continuous attractor neural network has several
phases depending on the interactions between external input and local
inhibitory feedback. The discrete-attractor-like behavior naturally emerges in
one of these phases without any discreteness assumption. We propose that the
dynamics of continuous attractor neural networks is the key to generate
discontinuous state changes phase-locked to the brain rhythm.

	<title>eLife: latest articles: The aryl hydrocarbon receptor and interferon gamma generate antiviral states via transcriptional repression</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38867</link>
	<content:encoded>The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor whose activation induces the expression of numerous genes, with many effects on cells. However, AhR activation is not known to affect the replication of viruses. We show that AhR activation in macrophages causes a block to HIV-1 and HSV-1 replication. We find that AhR activation transcriptionally represses cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)1/2 and their associated cyclins, thereby reducing SAMHD1 phosphorylation, cellular dNTP levels and both HIV-1 and HSV-1 replication. Remarkably, a different antiviral stimulus, interferon gamma (IFN-g), that induces a largely non-overlapping set of genes, also transcriptionally represses CDK1, CDK2 and their associated cyclins, resulting in similar dNTP depletion and antiviral effects. Concordantly, the SIV Vpx protein provides complete and partial resistance to the antiviral effects of AhR and IFN-g, respectively. Thus, distinct antiviral signaling pathways converge on CDK/cyclin repression, causing inhibition of viral DNA synthesis and replication.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37355</link>
	<content:encoded>Hematopoiesis leads to the formation of blood and immune cells. Hematopoietic stem cells emerge during development, from vascular components, via a process called the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT). Here, we reveal essential biomechanical features of the EHT, using the zebrafish embryo imaged at unprecedented spatio-temporal resolution and an algorithm to unwrap the aorta into 2D-cartography. We show that the transition involves anisotropic contraction along the antero-posterior axis, with heterogenous organization of contractile circumferential actomyosin. The biomechanics of the contraction is oscillatory, with unusually long periods in comparison to other apical constriction mechanisms described so far in morphogenesis, and is supported by the anisotropic reinforcement of junctional contacts. Finally, we show that abrogation of blood flow impairs the actin cytoskeleton, the morphodynamics of EHT cells, and the orientation of the emergence. Overall, our results underline the peculiarities of the EHT biomechanics and the influence of the mechanical forces exerted by blood flow.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36374</link>
	<content:encoded>Neuronal cell morphogenesis depends on the proper regulation of microtubule-based transport, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we report our study of MAP7, a unique microtubule-associated protein that interacts with both microtubules and the motor protein kinesin-1. Structure-function analysis in rat embryonic sensory neurons shows that the kinesin-1 interacting domain in MAP7 is required for axon and branch growth but not for branch formation. Also, two unique microtubule binding sites are found in MAP7 that have distinct dissociation kinetics and are both required for branch formation. Furthermore, MAP7 recruits kinesin-1 dynamically to microtubules, leading to alterations in organelle transport behaviors, particularly pause/speed switching frequency. As MAP7 is localized to branch sites, our results suggest a novel mechanism mediated by the dual interactions between MAP7 with microtubules and kinesin-1 in the precise control of microtubule-based transport during axon morphogenesis.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/33149</link>
	<content:encoded>Piezo1 is a mechanosensitive (MS) ion channel with characteristic fast-inactivation kinetics. We found a slowly-inactivating MS current in mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells and characterized it throughout their differentiation into motor-neurons to investigate its components. MS currents were large and slowly-inactivating in the stem-cell stage, and became smaller and faster-inactivating throughout the differentiation. We found that Piezo1 is expressed in mES cells, and its knockout abolishes MS currents, indicating that the slowly-inactivating current in mES cells is carried by Piezo1. To further investigate its slow inactivation in these cells, we cloned Piezo1 cDNA from mES cells and found that it displays fast-inactivation kinetics in heterologous expression, indicating that sources of modulation other than the aminoacid sequence determine its slow kinetics in mES cells.  Finally, we report that Piezo1 knockout ES cells showed a reduced rate of proliferation but no significant differences in other markers of pluripotency and differentiation.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Conservation of preparatory neural events in monkey motor cortex regardless of how movement is initiated</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/31826</link>
	<content:encoded>A time-consuming preparatory stage is hypothesized to precede voluntary movement. A putative neural substrate of motor preparation occurs when a delay separates instruction and execution cues. When readiness is sustained during the delay, sustained neural activity is observed in motor and premotor areas. Yet whether delay-period activity reflects an essential preparatory stage is controversial. In particular, it has remained ambiguous whether delay-period-like activity appears before non-delayed movements. To overcome that ambiguity, we leveraged a recently developed analysis method that parses population responses into putatively preparatory and movement-related components. We examined cortical responses when reaches were initiated after an imposed delay, at a self-chosen time, or reactively with low latency and no delay. Putatively preparatory events were conserved across all contexts. Our findings support the hypothesis that an appropriate 'preparatory state' is consistently achieved before movement onset. However, our results reveal that this process can consume surprisingly little time.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Reversible temporally-specific inhibition of muscle using a light-activated chloride channel</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/398156v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Achieving reversible, temporally specific inhibition of motor neurons has the potential to revolutionize treatment of disorders marked by muscle hyperactivity. Current treatment strategies are inadequate - surgical interventions are irreversible and pharmaceutical interventions have off-target effects. Optogenetic strategies for inhibiting muscle activity have theoretical promise; however, trafficking and expression problems have prevented translatable optogenetic suppression of muscle activity. Here, we exploit recent innovations in opsin engineering to demonstrate virally mediated, temporally specific optogenetic inhibition of motor neurons and muscle activity in vivo. We show that intra-muscular injection of adeno-associated virus serotype 6 can drive expression of the inhibitory channelrhodopsin mutant iC++ in both immunodeficient and wild-type mice. Illumination of the sciatic nerve in wild-type mice resulted in 64.8% inhibition of evoked twitch force. Optical excitation during tetanic stimulation in wild-type mice resulted in 59.1% inhibition at 10 Hz and 55.4% at 25 Hz. The extent of optogenetic inhibition was titratable, and ranged from 0% to 78.4% as illumination intensity was changed from 1 mW to 20 mW/mm2. These results could have therapeutic applicability to disorders such as spasticity, hypertonia and urinary incontinence, and provide a new tool to neuroscientists and muscle physiologists wishing to reversibly inhibit motor neuron activity in vivo.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The Effect of Visual Capture Towards Subjective Embodiment Within the Full Body Illusion</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/397943v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Typically, multisensory illusion paradigms emphasise the importance of synchronous visuotactile integration to induce subjective embodiment towards another body. However, the extent to which embodiment is due to the visual capture of congruent visuoproprioceptive information alone remains unclear. Thus, across two experiments (total N = 80), we investigated how mere visual observation of a mannequin body, viewed from a first-person perspective, influenced subjective embodiment independently from concomitant visuotactile integration. Moreover, we investigated whether slow, affective touch on participants own, unseen body (without concomitant touch on the seen mannequin) disrupted visual capture effects to a greater degree than fast, non-affective touch. In total, 40% of participants experienced subjective embodiment towards the mannequin body following mere visual observation, and this effect was significantly higher than conditions which included touch to participants own, unseen body. The velocity of the touch that participants received (affective/non-affective) did not differ in modulating visual capture effects. Furthermore, the effects of visual capture and perceived pleasantness of touch was not modulated by subthreshold eating disorder psychopathology. Overall, this study suggests that congruent visuoproprioceptive cues can be sufficient to induce subjective embodiment of a whole body, in the absence of visuotactile integration and beyond mere confabulatory responses.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Early Life Trauma Predicts Affective Phenomenology and the Effects are Partly Mediated by Staging Coupled with Lowered Lipid-Associated Antioxidant Defences.</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/397711v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Early life trauma (ELT) may drive mood disorder phenomenology, neuro-oxidative and neuroimmune pathways and impairments in semantic memory. Nevertheless, there are no data regarding the impact of ELT on affective phenomenology and whether these pathways are mediated by staging or lowered lipid-associated antioxidant defences. Methods: This study examined healthy controls and patients with affective disorders including major depression, bipolar disorder and anxiety disorders. ELT was assessed using the Child Trauma Questionnaire. In addition, we measured affective phenomenology and assayed advanced oxidation protein products; malondialdehyde, paraoxonase 1 (CMPAase) activity, high sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Results: ELT was associated with increased risk for mood and comorbid anxiety disorders and a more severe phenomenology, including staging characteristics (number of mood episodes), severity of depression and anxiety, suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, type of treatments received, disabilities, body mass index, smoking behaviour and hsCRP, as well as lowered health-related quality of life, economic status, antioxidant defences and semantic memory. The number of mood episodes and CMPAase and HDL cholesterol levels could be reliably combined into a new vulnerability staging biomarker index, which mediates in part the effects of ELT on affective phenomenology, while lowered antioxidant defences are associated with increased oxidative stress. Moreover, the effects of female sex on mood disorders and affective phenomenology are mediated by ELT. Discussion: The cumulative effects of different types of ELT drive many aspects of affective phenomenology either directly or indirectly through effects of staging and/or lipid associated antioxidant defences. The results show that children, especially girls, with ELT are at great risk to develop mood disorders and more severe phenotypes of affective disorders.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Speaker-normalized vowel representations in the human auditory cortex</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/397026v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Humans identify speech sounds, the fundamental building blocks of spoken language, using the same cues, or acoustic dimensions, as those that differentiate the voices of different speakers. The correct interpretation of speech cues is hence uncertain, and requires normalizing to the specific speaker. Here we assess how the human brain uses speaker-related contextual information to constrain the processing of speech cues. Using high-density electrocorticography, we recorded local neural activity from the cortical surface of participants who were engaged in a speech sound identification task. The speech sounds were preceded by speech from different speakers whose voices differed along the same acoustic dimension that differentiated the target speech sounds (the first formant; the lowest resonance frequency of the vocal tract). We found that the same acoustic speech sound tokens were perceived differently, and evoked different neural responses in auditory cortex, when they were heard in the context of different speakers. Such normalization involved the rescaling of acoustic-phonetic representations of speech, demonstrating a form of recoding before the signal is mapped onto phonemes or higher level linguistic units. This process is the result of auditory cortex sensitivity to the contrast between the dominant frequencies in speech sounds and those in their just preceding context. These findings provide important insights into the mechanistic implementation of normalization in human listeners. Moreover, they provide the first direct evidence of speaker-normalized speech sound representations in human parabelt auditory cortex, highlighting its critical role in resolving variability in sensory signals.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: An Automated Behavioral Apparatus to Assess Distal Forelimb Function in Non-Human Primates</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/396572v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Primate distal forelimb behaviors are commonly assessed using reach-to-grasp tasks. While these tasks are widely recognized as sensitive assays for forelimb function, they often require experimenter input, lack precise temporal cues for physiological monitoring, and can be expensive. New Method: Using components developed by open-source electronics platforms, we have designed and tested a low-cost system to measure distal forelimb function in non-human primates. Our system is inexpensive; it is made primarily of acrylic and 3D printed plastic parts. Our control software, developed in MATLAB, was also used to control two cameras in order to capture and process video during behavior. The system was equipped with sensors, motors and microcontrollers to control the timing of the task and facilitate synchronization between behavior and neurophysiology with high temporal precision. Results: We demonstrate that this system can be used to monitor motor recovery after stroke and investigate neurophysiological correlates of motor control. Comparison with Existing Methods: Compared to a previous version of this task, our setup reduces experimenter input while providing unbiased delivery of behavioral cues and behavioral measurements with the temporal precision necessary for electrophysiological studies. Conclusions: In summary, our system will allow unbiased monitoring of forelimb function in both healthy and injured animals that is compatible with electrophysiological studies.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Investigating functional brain network integrity using a traditional and novel diagnostic system for neurodevelopmental disorders</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/396317v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Current diagnostic systems for neurodevelopmental disorders do not have clear links to underlying neurobiology, limiting their utility in identifying targeted treatments for individuals. Several factors contribute to this issue, including the use of small samples in neuroimaging research and heterogeneity within diagnostic categories. Here, we aimed to investigate differences in functional brain network integrity between traditional diagnostic categories (autism spectrum disorder [ASD], attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], typically developing [TD]) and carefully consider the impact of comorbid ASD and ADHD on functional brain network integrity in a large sample. We also assess the neurobiological validity of a novel, potential alternative nosology based on behavioral measures of executive function. Method: Five-minute resting-state fMRI data were obtained from 168 children (128 boys, 40 girls) with ASD, ADHD, comorbid ASD and ADHD, and TD children. Independent component analysis and dual regression were used to compute within- and between-network functional connectivity metrics at the individual level. Results: No significant group differences in within- nor between-network functional connectivity were observed between traditional diagnostic categories (ASD, ADHD, TD) even when stratified by comorbidity (ASD+ADHD, ASD, ADHD, TD). Similarly, subgroups classified by executive functioning levels showed no group differences. Conclusions: Using clinical diagnosis and behavioral measures of executive function, no group differences were observed among the categories examined. Therefore, we suggest that brain imaging metrics may more effectively define clinical subgroups than behavioral metrics, and may contribute to the establishment of a neurobiologically valid nosology for neurodevelopmental disorders.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/395889v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Supported by histological and genetic evidence implicating myelin, neuroinflammation and oligodendrocyte dysfunction in schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SZ), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies have consistently shown white matter (WM) abnormalities when compared to healthy controls (HC). The diagnostic specificity remains unclear, with bipolar disorders (BD) frequently conceptualized as a less severe clinical manifestation along a psychotic spectrum. Further, the age-related dynamics and possible sex differences of WM abnormalities in SZ and BD are currently understudied. Using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) we compared DTI-based microstructural indices between SZ (n=128), BD (n=61), and HC (n=293). We tested for age-by-group and sex-by-group interactions, computed effect sizes within different age-bins and within genders. TBSS revealed global reductions in fractional anisotropy (FA) and increases in radial (RD) diffusivity in SZ compared to HC, with strongest effects in the body and splenium of the corpus callosum, and lower FA in SZ compared to BD in right inferior longitudinal fasciculus and right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and no significant differences between BD and HC. The results were not strongly dependent on age or sex. Despite lack of significant group-by-age interactions, a sliding-window approach supported widespread WM involvement in SZ with most profound differences in FA from the late 20s.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/395483v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Lip-reading is crucial to understand speech in challenging conditions. Neuroimaging investigations have revealed that lip-reading activates auditory cortices in individuals covertly repeating absent but known speech. However, in real-life, one usually has no detailed information about the content of upcoming speech. Here we show that during silent lip-reading of unknown speech, activity in auditory cortices entrains more to absent speech than to seen lip movements at frequencies below 1 Hz. This entrainment to absent speech was characterized by a speech-to-brain delay of 50-100 ms as when actually listening to speech. We also observed entrainment to lip movements at the same low frequency in the right angular gyrus, an area involved in processing biological motion. These findings demonstrate that the brain can synthesize high-level features of absent unknown speech sounds from lip-reading that can facilitate the processing of the auditory input. Such a synthesis process may help explain well-documented bottom-up perceptual effects.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Long-Term Depression Induced by Optogenetically Driven Nociceptive Inputs to Trigeminal Nucleus Caudalis or Headache Triggers</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/34/7529?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The peripheral trigeminovascular pathway mediates orofacial and craniofacial pain and projects centrally to the brainstem trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNc). Sensitization of this pathway is involved in many pain conditions, but little is known about synaptic plasticity at its first central synapse. We have taken advantage of optogenetics to investigate plasticity selectively evoked at synapses of nociceptive primary afferents onto TNc neurons. Based on immunolabeling in the trigeminal ganglia, TRPV1-lineage neurons comprise primarily peptidergic and nonpeptidergic nociceptors. Optical stimulation of channelrhodopsin-expressing axons in the TRPV1/ChR2 mouse in TNc slices thus allowed us to activate a nociceptor-enriched subset of primary afferents. We recorded from lamina I/II neurons in acutely prepared transverse TNc slices, and alternately stimulated two independent afferent pathways, one with light-activated nociceptive afferents and the other with electrically-activated inputs. Low-frequency optical stimulation induced robust long-term depression (LTD) of optically-evoked EPSCs, but not of electrically-evoked EPSCs in the same neurons. Blocking NMDA receptors or nitric oxide synthase strongly attenuated LTD, whereas a cannabinoid receptor 1 antagonist had no effect. The neuropeptide PACAP-38 or the nitric oxide donors nitroglycerin or sodium nitroprusside are pharmacologic triggers of human headache. Bath application of any of these three compounds also persistently depressed optically-evoked EPSCs. Together, our data show that LTD of nociceptive afferent synapses on trigeminal nucleus neurons is elicited when the afferents are activated at frequencies consistent with the development of central sensitization of the trigeminovascular pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Animal models suggest that sensitization of trigeminovascular afferents plays a major role in craniofacial pain syndromes including primary headaches and trigeminal neuralgia, yet little is known about synaptic transmission and plasticity in the brainstem trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNc). Here we used optogenetics to selectively drive a nociceptor-enriched population of trigeminal afferents while recording from superficial laminae neurons in the TNc. Low-frequency optical stimulation evoked robust long-term depression at TRPV1/ChR2 synapses. Moreover, application of three different headache trigger drugs also depressed TRPV1/ChR2 synapses. Synaptic depression at these primary afferent synapses may represent a newly identified mechanism contributing to central sensitization during headache.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/34/7516?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Epigenetic mechanisms have gained increasing attention as regulators of synaptic plasticity and responsiveness to drugs of abuse. In particular, it has been shown that the activity of the DNA methyltransferase 3a (Dnmt3a) mediates certain long-lasting effects of cocaine. Here we examined the role of the Dnmt isoforms, &lt;i&gt;Dnmt3a1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Dnmt3a2&lt;/i&gt;, within the nucleus accumbens (NAc) on transcriptional activity of immediate early genes (IEGs) and acute and long-lasting responsiveness to cocaine and cocaine conditioned cues. Using primary striatal cultures, we show that transcription of &lt;i&gt;Dnmt3a2&lt;/i&gt;, but not that of &lt;i&gt;Dnmt3a1&lt;/i&gt;, is activated by dopamine D1 receptor signaling and that knockdown of &lt;i&gt;Dnmt3a2&lt;/i&gt; using viral vector-mediated expression of Dnmt3a2-specific shRNAs impairs induction of the IEGs, &lt;i&gt;Arc&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;FosB&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Egr2&lt;/i&gt;. Acute cocaine administration increases expression of &lt;i&gt;Dnmt3a2&lt;/i&gt; but not that of &lt;i&gt;Dnmt3a1&lt;/i&gt; in the NAc shell. In contrast, in the NAc core, expression of &lt;i&gt;Dnmt3a1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Dnmt3a2&lt;/i&gt; was unaffected by cocaine administration. shRNA-mediated knockdown of &lt;i&gt;Dnmt3a2 in vivo&lt;/i&gt; impairs the induction of IEGs, including &lt;i&gt;Egr2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;FosB&lt;/i&gt; indicating that Dnmt3a2 regulates cocaine-dependent expression of plasticity genes in the rat NAc shell. Cocaine self-administration experiments in rats revealed that Dnmt3a2 regulates drug cue memories that drive reinstatement of cocaine seeking as well as incubation of this phenomenon within the NAc shell. Dnmt3a2 does not influence the primary reinforcing effects of cocaine. Thus, Dnmt3a2 mediates long-lasting cocaine cue memories within the NAc shell. Targeting &lt;i&gt;Dnmt3a2&lt;/i&gt; expression or function may interfere with cocaine craving and relapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In humans, drug craving can occur in response to conditioned cues, even after extended periods of abstinence. In rats, cue-induced cocaine seeking has been shown to increase progressively during the first 2 months of abstinence from drug self-administration. This phenomenon, referred to as incubation of cocaine seeking, is consistent with the hypothesis that in humans craving increases over time and remains high following prolonged abstinence. Those long-lasting behavioral changes are likely to be mediated by epigenetic effects and neuroplastic changes within the mesolimbic brain reward system. Here we show that a specific isoform of DNA-methyltransferases in the NAc shell regulates drug cue memories that drive reinstatement of cocaine seeking after both early abstinence and incubation of cocaine craving.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Evidence for Compartmentalized Axonal Mitochondrial Biogenesis: Mitochondrial DNA Replication Increases in Distal Axons As an Early Response to Parkinson's Disease-Relevant Stress</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/34/7505?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dysregulation of mitochondrial biogenesis is implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD). However, it is not clear how mitochondrial biogenesis is regulated in neurons, with their unique compartmentalized anatomy and energetic demands. This is particularly relevant in PD because selectively vulnerable neurons feature long, highly arborized axons where degeneration initiates. We previously found that exposure of neurons to chronic, sublethal doses of rotenone, a complex I inhibitor linked to PD, causes early increases in mitochondrial density specifically in distal axons, suggesting possible upregulation of mitochondrial biogenesis within axons. Here, we directly evaluated for evidence of mitochondrial biogenesis in distal axons and examined whether PD-relevant stress causes compartmentalized alterations. Using BrdU labeling and imaging to quantify replicating mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in primary rat neurons (pooled from both sexes), we provide evidence of mtDNA replication in axons along with cell bodies and proximal dendrites. We found that exposure to chronic, sublethal rotenone increases mtDNA replication first in neurites and later extending to cell bodies, complementing our mitochondrial density data. Further, isolating axons from cell bodies and dendrites, we discovered that rotenone exposure upregulates mtDNA replication in distal axons. Utilizing superresolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) imaging, we identified mtDNA replication at sites of mitochondrial–endoplasmic reticulum contacts in axons. Our evidence suggests that mitochondrial biogenesis occurs not only in cell bodies, but also in distal axons, and is altered under PD-relevant stress conditions in an anatomically compartmentalized manner. We hypothesize that this contributes to vulnerability in neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Mitochondrial biogenesis is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial and cellular health and has been linked to neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis. However, regulation of this process is poorly understood in CNS neurons, which rely on mitochondrial function for survival. Our findings offer fundamental insight into these regulatory mechanisms by demonstrating that replication of mitochondrial DNA, an essential precursor for biogenesis, can occur in distal regions of CNS neuron axons independent of the soma. Further, this process is upregulated specifically in axons as an early response to neurodegeneration-relevant stress. This is the first demonstration of the compartmentalized regulation of CNS neuronal mitochondrial biogenesis in response to stress and may prove a useful target in development of therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Face Repetition Probability Does Not Affect Repetition Suppression in Macaque Inferotemporal Cortex</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/34/7492?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Repetition suppression, which refers to reduced neural activity for repeated stimuli, is typically explained by bottom-up or local adaptation mechanisms. However, recent theories have emphasized the role of top-down processes, suggesting that this response reduction reflects the fulfillment of perceptual expectations. To support this, an influential human fMRI study showed that the magnitude of suppression is modulated by the probability of a repetition. No such repetition probability effect was found in macaque inferior temporal (IT) cortex for spiking activity despite the presence of repetition suppression. Contrary to the human fMRI studies that showed an effect of repetition probability, the macaque single-unit study used a large variety of unfamiliar stimuli and the monkeys were not required to attend the stimuli. Here, as in the human fMRI studies, we used faces as stimuli and made the monkeys attend to the stimulus content. We simultaneously recorded spiking activity and local field potentials (LFPs) in the middle lateral face patch (ML) of one monkey (male) and a face-responsive region of another (female). Although we observed significant repetition suppression of spiking activity and high gamma-band LFPs in both animals, there were no effects of repetition probability even when repetitions were task relevant and repetition probability affected behavioral decisions. In conclusion, despite the use of face stimuli and a stimulus-related task, no neural signature of repetition probability was present for faces in a face responsive patch of macaque IT. This further challenges a general perceptual expectation account of repetition suppression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Repetition suppression is a reduced brain activity for repeated stimuli commonly observed across species. In the predictive coding framework, such suppression is thought to reflect fulfilled perceptual expectations. Although this hypothesis is supported by several human fMRI studies reporting an effect of repetition probability on repetition suppression, this could not be replicated in single-cell recordings in monkey inferior temporal (IT) cortex. Subsequent studies narrowed down the conditions for the effect to requiring attention and being limited to particular stimulus categories such as faces. Here, we show that, even under these conditions, repetition suppression in monkey IT neurons is still unaffected by repetition probability, even in a task with a behavioral effect, challenging the perceptual expectation account of repetition suppression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Amplification and Suppression of Distinct Brainwide Activity Patterns by Catecholamines</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/34/7476?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The widely projecting catecholaminergic (norepinephrine and dopamine) neurotransmitter systems profoundly shape the state of neuronal networks in the forebrain. Current models posit that the effects of catecholaminergic modulation on network dynamics are homogeneous across the brain. However, the brain is equipped with a variety of catecholamine receptors with distinct functional effects and heterogeneous density across brain regions. Consequently, catecholaminergic effects on brainwide network dynamics might be more spatially specific than assumed. We tested this idea through the analysis of fMRI measurements performed in humans (19 females, 5 males) at &quot;rest&quot; under pharmacological (atomoxetine-induced) elevation of catecholamine levels. We used a linear decomposition technique to identify spatial patterns of correlated fMRI signal fluctuations that were either increased or decreased by atomoxetine. This yielded two distinct spatial patterns, each expressing reliable and specific drug effects. The spatial structure of both fluctuation patterns resembled the spatial distribution of the expression of catecholamine receptor genes: α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; norepinephrine receptors (for the fluctuation pattern: placebo &amp;gt; atomoxetine), D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-like dopamine receptors (pattern: atomoxetine &amp;gt; placebo), and β norepinephrine receptors (for both patterns, with correlations of opposite sign). We conclude that catecholaminergic effects on the forebrain are spatially more structured than traditionally assumed and at least in part explained by the heterogeneous distribution of various catecholamine receptors. Our findings link catecholaminergic effects on large-scale brain networks to low-level characteristics of the underlying neurotransmitter systems. They also provide key constraints for the development of realistic models of neuromodulatory effects on large-scale brain network dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The catecholamines norepinephrine and dopamine are an important class of modulatory neurotransmitters. Because of the widespread and diffuse release of these neuromodulators, it has commonly been assumed that their effects on neural interactions are homogeneous across the brain. Here, we present results from the human brain that challenge this view. We pharmacologically increased catecholamine levels and imaged the effects on the spontaneous covariations between brainwide fMRI signals at &quot;rest.&quot; We identified two distinct spatial patterns of covariations: one that was amplified and another that was suppressed by catecholamines. Each pattern was associated with the heterogeneous spatial distribution of the expression of distinct catecholamine receptor genes. Our results provide novel insights into the catecholaminergic modulation of large-scale human brain dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Peripheral Gene Therapeutic Rescue of an Olfactory Ciliopathy Restores Sensory Input, Axonal Pathfinding, and Odor-Guided Behavior</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/34/7462?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cilia of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) are the primary site of odor binding; hence, their loss results in anosmia, a clinical manifestation of pleiotropic ciliopathies for which there are no curative therapies. We used OSN-specific Ift88 knock-out mice (&lt;i&gt;Ift88&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;osnKO&lt;/sup&gt;) of both sexes to examine the mechanisms of ciliopathy-induced olfactory dysfunction and the potential for gene replacement to rescue odorant detection, restore olfactory circuitry, and restore odor-guided behaviors. Loss of OSN cilia in &lt;i&gt;Ift88&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;osnKO&lt;/sup&gt; mice resulted in substantially reduced odor detection and odor-driven synaptic activity in the olfactory bulb (OB). Defects in OSN axon targeting to the OB were also observed in parallel with aberrant odor-guided behavior. Intranasal gene delivery of wild-type IFT88 to &lt;i&gt;Ift88&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;osnKO&lt;/sup&gt; mice rescued OSN ciliation and peripheral olfactory function. Importantly, this recovery of sensory input in a limited number of mature OSNs was sufficient to restore axonal targeting in the OB of juvenile mice, and with delayed onset in adult mice. In addition, restoration of sensory input re-established course odor-guided behaviors. These findings highlight the spare capacity of the olfactory epithelium and the plasticity of primary synaptic input into the central olfactory system. The restoration of peripheral and central neuronal function supports the potential for treatment of ciliopathy-related anosmia using gene therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Ciliopathies, for which there are no curative therapies, are genetic disorders that alter cilia morphology and/or function in numerous tissue types, including the olfactory system, leading to sensory dysfunction. We show that &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; intranasal gene delivery restores peripheral olfactory function in a ciliopathy mouse model, including axonal targeting in the juvenile and adult olfactory bulb. Gene therapy also demonstrated restoration of olfactory perception by rescuing odor-guided behaviors. Understanding the therapeutic window and viability for gene therapy to restore odor detection and perception may facilitate translation of therapies to ciliopathy patients with olfactory dysfunctions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Suppressed Sensory Response to Predictable Object Stimuli throughout the Ventral Visual Stream</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/34/7452?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Prediction plays a crucial role in perception, as prominently suggested by predictive coding theories. However, the exact form and mechanism of predictive modulations of sensory processing remain unclear, with some studies reporting a downregulation of the sensory response for predictable input whereas others observed an enhanced response. In a similar vein, downregulation of the sensory response for predictable input has been linked to either sharpening or dampening of the sensory representation, which are opposite in nature. In the present study, we set out to investigate the neural consequences of perceptual expectation of object stimuli throughout the visual hierarchy, using fMRI in human volunteers. Participants of both sexes were exposed to pairs of sequentially presented object images in a statistical learning paradigm, in which the first object predicted the identity of the second object. Image transitions were not task relevant; thus, all learning of statistical regularities was incidental. We found strong suppression of neural responses to expected compared with unexpected stimuli throughout the ventral visual stream, including primary visual cortex, lateral occipital complex, and anterior ventral visual areas. Expectation suppression in lateral occipital complex scaled positively with image preference and voxel selectivity, lending support to the dampening account of expectation suppression in object perception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; It has been suggested that the brain fundamentally relies on predictions and constructs models of the world to make sense of sensory information. Previous research on the neural basis of prediction has documented suppressed neural responses to expected compared with unexpected stimuli. In the present study, we demonstrate robust expectation suppression throughout the entire ventral visual stream, and underlying this suppression a dampening of the sensory representation in object-selective visual cortex, but not in primary visual cortex. Together, our results provide novel evidence in support of theories conceptualizing perception as an active inference process, which selectively dampens cortical representations of predictable objects. This dampening may support our ability to automatically filter out irrelevant, predictable objects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Enhancement of the Medial Olivocochlear System Prevents Hidden Hearing Loss</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/34/7440?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cochlear synaptopathy produced by exposure to noise levels that cause only transient auditory threshold elevations is a condition that affects many people and is believed to contribute to poor speech discrimination in noisy environments. These functional deficits in hearing, without changes in sensitivity, have been called hidden hearing loss (HHL). It has been proposed that activity of the medial olivocochlear (MOC) system can ameliorate acoustic trauma effects. Here we explore the role of the MOC system in HHL by comparing the performance of two different mouse models: an α9 nicotinic receptor subunit knock-out (KO; &lt;i&gt;Chrna9&lt;/i&gt; KO), which lacks cholinergic transmission between efferent neurons and hair cells; and a gain-of-function knock-in (KI; &lt;i&gt;Chrna9L9&lt;/i&gt;'&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; KI) carrying an α9 point mutation that leads to enhanced cholinergic activity. Animals of either sex were exposed to sound pressure levels that in wild-type produced transient cochlear threshold shifts and a decrease in neural response amplitudes, together with the loss of ribbon synapses, which is indicative of cochlear synaptopathy. Moreover, a reduction in the number of efferent contacts to outer hair cells was observed. In &lt;i&gt;Chrna9&lt;/i&gt; KO ears, noise exposure produced permanent auditory threshold elevations together with cochlear synaptopathy. In contrast, the &lt;i&gt;Chrna9L9&lt;/i&gt;'&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; KI was completely resistant to the same acoustic exposure protocol. These results show a positive correlation between the degree of HHL prevention and the level of cholinergic activity. Notably, enhancement of the MOC feedback promoted new afferent synapse formation, suggesting that it can trigger cellular and molecular mechanisms to protect and/or repair the inner ear sensory epithelium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Noise overexposure is a major cause of a variety of perceptual disabilities, including speech-in-noise difficulties, tinnitus, and hyperacusis. Here we show that exposure to noise levels that do not cause permanent threshold elevations or hair cell death can produce a loss of cochlear nerve synapses to inner hair cells as well as degeneration of medial olivocochlear (MOC) terminals contacting the outer hair cells. Enhancement of the MOC reflex can prevent both types of neuropathy, highlighting the potential use of drugs that increase α9α10 nicotinic cholinergic receptor activity as a pharmacotherapeutic strategy to avoid hidden hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Temporal Expectation Modulates the Cortical Dynamics of Short-Term Memory</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/34/7428?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Increased memory load is often signified by enhanced neural oscillatory power in the alpha range (8–13 Hz), which is taken to reflect inhibition of task-irrelevant brain regions. The corresponding neural correlates of memory decay, however, are not yet well understood. In the current study, we investigated auditory short-term memory decay in humans using a delayed matching-to-sample task with pure-tone sequences. First, in a behavioral experiment, we modeled memory performance over six different delay-phase durations. Second, in a MEG experiment, we assessed alpha-power modulations over three different delay-phase durations. In both experiments, the temporal expectation for the to-be-remembered sound was manipulated so that it was either temporally expected or not. In both studies, memory performance declined over time, but this decline was weaker when the onset time of the to-be-remembered sound was expected. Similarly, patterns of alpha power in and alpha-tuned connectivity between sensory cortices changed parametrically with delay duration (i.e., decrease in occipitoparietal regions, increase in temporal regions). Temporal expectation not only counteracted alpha-power decline in heteromodal brain areas (i.e., supramarginal gyrus), but also had a beneficial effect on memory decay, counteracting memory performance decline. Correspondingly, temporal expectation also boosted alpha connectivity within attention networks known to play an active role during memory maintenance. The present data show how patterns of alpha power orchestrate short-term memory decay and encourage a more nuanced perspective on alpha power across brain space and time beyond its inhibitory role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Our sensory memories of the physical world fade quickly. We show here that this decay of short-term memory can be counteracted by so-called temporal expectation; that is, knowledge of when to expect a sensory event that an individual must remember. We also show that neural oscillations in the &quot;alpha&quot; (8–13 Hz) range index both the degree of memory decay (for brief sound patterns) and the respective memory benefit from temporal expectation. Spatially distributed cortical patterns of alpha power show opposing effects in auditory versus visual sensory cortices. Moreover, alpha-tuned connectivity changes within supramodal attention networks reflect the allocation of neural resources as short-term memory representations fade.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Age-Related Trajectories of Functional Coupling between the VTA and Nucleus Accumbens Depend on Motivational State</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/34/7420?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Over-engagement of the mesolimbic dopamine system is thought to enhance motivation in adolescents. Whereas human neuroimaging has characterized event-evoked responses of the mesolimbic system in adolescents, research has yet to characterize state-dependent engagement (i.e., seconds to minutes) of this system in goal-relevant contexts. In the current longitudinal study, we characterized age-related changes in state-dependent coupling in male and female human participants ranging in age from adolescence to adulthood. Analyses focused on two key regions of the mesolimbic dopamine system, the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens (NAcc). Although there were no differences in VTA–NAcc functional coupling in a resting-state context, VTA–NAcc functional coupling was enhanced in preadolescence/early adolescence and decreased into adulthood in a motivational context, in which individuals had to translate goal-relevant cues into instrumental actions. Furthermore, we found that task-related activation in orbitofrontal cortex, middle temporal gyrus, and visual association cortex partially mediated age-related changes in state-dependent VTA–NAcc functional coupling. These results extend prior models of neurodevelopment by showing a relationship between cortical event-evoked activation and state-dependent increases in subcortical engagement of mesolimbic systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Adolescence is characterized by increased motivated behavior, which is thought to result from an over-engagement of mesolimbic dopamine systems. Rodent models show increases in state-dependent engagement of mesolimbic systems in adolescence. However, human neuroimaging research has mainly focused on event-evoked responses (i.e., reward cues). We show that in motivational contexts, there is increased state-dependent coupling across mesolimbic systems in preadolescence/early adolescence that decreases into adulthood and is further predicted by event-evoked cortical responses. Critically, these developmental trajectories were specific to motivationally relevant contexts and were not apparent during resting state. These findings extend emerging models of human development and suggest that state-dependent increases in dopamine signaling may underlie heightened motivation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Inositol Hexakisphosphate Kinase-2 in Cerebellar Granule Cells Regulates Purkinje Cells and Motor Coordination via Protein 4.1N</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/34/7409?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Inositol hexakisphosphate kinases (IP6Ks) regulate various biological processes. Among pyrophosphates generated by IP6Ks, diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate (IP7), and bis-diphosphoinositol tetrakisphosphate have been extensively characterized. IP7 is produced in mammals by a family of inositol hexakisphosphate kinases, IP6K1, IP6K2, and IP6K3, which have distinct biological functions. We report that IP6K2 binds protein 4.1.N with high affinity and specificity. Nuclear translocation of 4.1N, which is required for its principal functions, is dependent on IP6K2. Both of these proteins are highly expressed in granule cells of the cerebellum where their interaction regulates Purkinje cell morphology and cerebellar synapses. The deletion of IP6K2 in male/female mice elicits substantial defects in synaptic influences of granule cells upon Purkinje cells as well as notable impairment of locomotor function. Moreover, the disruption of IP6K2–4.1N interactions impairs cell viability. Thus, IP6K2 and its interaction with 4.1N appear to be major determinants of cerebellar disposition and psychomotor behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

Of these, the physiological roles of IP6K2 in the brain have been least characterized. In the present study, we report that IP6K2 binds selectively to the neuronal protein 4.1N. Both of these proteins are highly expressed in granule cells of the cerebellum.

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neural Firing Patterns Are More Schematic and Less Sensitive to Changes in Background Visual Scenes in the Subiculum than in the Hippocampus</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/34/7392?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Literature suggests that the hippocampus is central to processing visual scenes to remember contextual information, but the roles of its downstream structure, subiculum, remain unknown. Here, single units were recorded simultaneously in the dorsal CA1 and subiculum while male rats made spatial choices using visual scenes as cues in a T-maze. The firing fields of subicular neurons were schematically organized following the task structure, largely divided into pre-choice and post-choice epochs, whereas those of CA1 cells were more punctate and bound to specific locations. When the rats were tested with highly familiar scenes, neurons in the CA1 and subiculum were indistinguishable in coding the task-related information (e.g., scene, choice) through rate remapping. However, when the familiar scenes were blurred parametrically, the neurons in the CA1 responded sensitively to the novelty in task demand and changed its representations parametrically following the physical changes of the stimuli, whereas these functional characteristics were absent in the subiculum. These results suggest that the unique function of the hippocampus is to acquire contextual representations in association with discrete positions in space, especially when facing new and ambiguous scenes, whereas the subiculum may translate the position-bound visual contextual information of the hippocampus into schematic codes once learning is established.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Although the potential functional significance has been recognized for decades for the subiculum, its exact roles in a goal-directed memory task still remain elusive. In the current study, we present experimental evidence that may indicate that the neural population in the subiculum could translate the location-bound spatial representations of the hippocampus into more schematic representations of task demands. Our findings also imply that the visual scene-based codes conveyed by the hippocampus and subiculum may be identical in a well learned task, whereas the hippocampus may be more specialized in representing altered visual scenes than the subiculum.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Estrogen Treatment Reverses Prematurity-Induced Disruption in Cortical Interneuron Population</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/34/7378?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Development of cortical interneurons continues until the end of human pregnancy. Premature birth deprives the newborns from the supply of maternal estrogen and a secure intrauterine environment. Indeed, preterm infants suffer from neurobehavioral disorders. This can result from both preterm birth and associated postnatal complications, which might disrupt recruitment and maturation of cortical interneurons. We hypothesized that interneuron subtypes, including parvalbumin-positive (PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), somatostatin-positive (SST&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), calretinin-positive (CalR&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), and neuropeptide Y-positive (NPY&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) interneurons, were recruited in the upper and lower cortical layers in a distinct manner with advancing gestational age. In addition, preterm birth would disrupt the heterogeneity of cortical interneurons, which might be reversed by estrogen treatment. These hypotheses were tested by analyzing autopsy samples from premature infants and evaluating the effect of estrogen supplementation in prematurely delivered rabbits. The PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CalR&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons were abundant, whereas SST&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NPY&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons were few in cortical layers of preterm human infants. Premature birth of infants reduced the density of PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or GAD67&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons and increased SST&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons in the upper cortical layers. Importantly, 17 β-estradiol treatment in preterm rabbits increased the number of PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons in the upper cortical layers relative to controls at postnatal day 14 (P14) and P21 and transiently reduced SST population at P14. Moreover, protein and mRNA levels of Arx, a key regulator of cortical interneuron maturation and migration, were higher in estrogen-treated rabbits relative to controls. Therefore, deficits in PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and excess of SST&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons in premature newborns are ameliorated by estrogen replacement, which can be attributed to elevated Arx levels. Estrogen replacement might enhance neurodevelopmental outcomes in extremely preterm infants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Premature birth often leads to neurodevelopmental delays and behavioral disorders, which may be ascribed to disturbances in the development and maturation of cortical interneurons. Here, we show that preterm birth in humans is associated with reduced population of parvalbumin-positive (PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) neurons and an excess of somatostatin-expressing interneurons in the cerebral cortex. More importantly, 17 β-estradiol treatment increased the number of PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons in preterm-born rabbits, which appears to be mediated by an elevation in the expression of Arx transcription factor. Hence the present study highlights prematurity-induced reduction in PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons in human infants and reversal in their population by estrogen replacement in preterm rabbits. Because preterm birth drops plasma estrogen level 100-fold, estrogen replacement in extremely preterm infants might improve their developmental outcome and minimize neurobehavioral disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/34/7365?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Animals successfully thrive in noisy environments with finite resources. The necessity to function with resource constraints has led evolution to design animal brains (and bodies) to be optimal in their use of computational power while being adaptable to their environmental niche. A key process undergirding this ability to adapt is the process of learning. Although a complete characterization of the neural basis of learning remains ongoing, scientists for nearly a century have used the brain as inspiration to design artificial neural networks capable of learning, a case in point being deep learning. In this viewpoint, we advocate that deep learning can be further enhanced by incorporating and tightly integrating five fundamental principles of neural circuit design and function: optimizing the system to environmental need and making it robust to environmental noise, customizing learning to context, modularizing the system, learning without supervision, and learning using reinforcement strategies. We illustrate how animals integrate these learning principles using the fruit fly olfactory learning circuit, one of nature's best-characterized and highly optimized schemes for learning. Incorporating these principles may not just improve deep learning but also expose common computational constraints. With judicious use, deep learning can become yet another effective tool to understand how and why brains are designed the way they are.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Domes and cones: Adhesion-induced fission of membranes by ESCRT proteins</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/r7Twoeks0r4/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Jaime Agudo-Canalejo, Reinhard Lipowsky&lt;/p&gt;

ESCRT proteins participate in the fission step of exocytic membrane budding, by assisting in the closure and scission of the membrane neck that connects the nascent bud to the plasma membrane. However, the precise mechanism by which the proteins achieve this so-called reverse-topology membrane scission remains to be elucidated. One mechanism is described by the &lt;i&gt;dome model&lt;/i&gt;, which postulates that ESCRT-III proteins assemble in the shape of a hemispherical dome at the location of the neck, and guide the closure of this neck &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; membrane–protein adhesion. A different mechanism is described by the &lt;i&gt;flattening cone model&lt;/i&gt;, in which the ESCRT-III complex first assembles at the neck in the shape of a cone, which then flattens leading to neck closure. Here, we use the theoretical framework of curvature elasticity and membrane–protein adhesion to quantitatively describe and compare both mechanisms. This comparison shows that the minimal adhesive strength of the membrane–protein interactions required for scission is much lower for cones than for domes, and that the geometric constraints on the shape of the assembly required to induce scission are more stringent for domes than for cones. Finally, we compute for the first time the adhesion-induced constriction forces exerted by the ESCRT assemblies onto the membrane necks. These forces are higher for cones and of the order of 100 pN.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/r7Twoeks0r4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: A Brain without Brakes: reduced Inhibition Is Associated with Enhanced but Dysregulated Plasticity in the Aged Rat Auditory Cortex</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0051-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;During early developmental windows known as critical periods (CP) of plasticity, passive alterations in the quality and quantity of sensory inputs are sufficient to induce profound and long-lasting distortions in cortical sensory representations. With CP closure those representations are stabilized, a process requiring the maturation of inhibitory networks and the maintenance of sufficient GABAergic tone in the cortex. In humans and rodents however, cortical inhibition progressively decreases with advancing age, raising the possibility that the regulation of plasticity could be altered in older individuals. Here we tested the hypothesis that aging results in a destabilization of sensory representations and maladaptive dysregulated plasticity in the rat primary auditory cortex (A1). Consistent with this idea, we found that passive tone exposure is sufficient to distort frequency tuning in the A1 of older but not younger adult rats. However, we also found that these passive distortions decayed rapidly, indicating an ongoing instability of A1 tuning in the aging cortex. These changes were associated with a decrease in GABA neurotransmitter concentration and a reduction in parvalbumin and perineuronal net expression in the cortex. Finally, we show that artificially increasing GABA tone in the aging A1 is sufficient to restore representational stability and improve the retention of learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; In this study, we examined brain plasticity in the auditory cortex of young adult and older adult rats in the context of different types of auditory stimulation and training. Surprisingly, older brains retained an equal or even higher potential for plasticity compared to young adults. In older brains, however, changes elicited by auditory stimulation and training were rapidly lost, suggesting that such increased plasticity might be detrimental as the older brains were unable to consolidate these changes. This increased but poorly regulated plasticity was associated with a reduction in cortical inhibition which normally maintains the stability of sensory representations in the young adult brain. Importantly, increasing inhibition artificially with clinically available drugs restored stability and improved the retention of learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Paradoxical LTP maintenance with inhibition of protein synthesis and the proteasome suggests a novel protein synthesis requirement for early LTP reversal. (arXiv:1808.06578v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06578</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The transition from early long-term potentiation (E-LTP) to late LTP (L-LTP)
involves protein synthesis and degradation. L-LTP is blocked by inhibiting
either protein synthesis or proteasome-dependent degradation prior to and
during a tetanic stimulus, but paradoxically, L-LTP is not blocked when
synthesis and degradation are inhibited simultaneously, suggesting
counter-acting positive and negative proteins regulate L-LTP. To investigate
this paradox, we modeled LTP at the Schaffer collateral synapse. Nine
differential equations describe the levels of positive and negative regulator
proteins (PP and NP) and transitions among five discrete synaptic states, a
basal state (BAS), three E-LTP states (EP1, EP2, ED), and a L-LTP state (LP). A
stimulus initiates the transition from BAS to EP1 and from EP1 to EP2,
initiates the synthesis of PP and NP, and activates the ubiquitin-proteasome
system (UPS). UPS mediates transitions of EP1 and EP2 to ED and the degradation
of NP. The conversion of E-LTP to L-LTP is mediated by a PP-dependent
transition from ED to LP. NP mediates reversal of EP2 to BAS. This model
simulates empirical observations: 1) normal L-LTP, 2) block by either
proteasome inhibitor or protein synthesis inhibitor alone, and 3) preservation
of L-LTP when both inhibitors are applied together. Elements of this abstract
model can be correlated with specific molecules and processes. Moreover, the
model makes testable predictions, such as a unique synaptic state ED that
precedes the transition to L-LTP, and a time window for the action of the UPS
(during the transitions from EP1 and EP2 to ED). Tests of these predictions
will provide insights into the processes of long-term synaptic plasticity.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37815</link>
	<content:encoded>Odor attraction in walking &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; is commonly used to relate neural function to behavior, but the algorithms underlying attraction are unclear. Here, we develop a high-throughput assay to measure olfactory behavior in response to well-controlled sensory stimuli. We show that odor evokes two behaviors: an upwind run during odor (ON response), and a local search at odor offset (OFF response). Wind orientation requires antennal mechanoreceptors, but search is driven solely by odor. Using dynamic odor stimuli, we measure the dependence of these two behaviors on odor intensity and history. Based on these data, we develop a navigation model that recapitulates the behavior of flies in our apparatus, and generates realistic trajectories when run in a turbulent boundary layer plume. The ability to parse olfactory navigation into quantifiable elementary sensori-motor transformations provides a foundation for dissecting neural circuits that govern olfactory behavior.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37567</link>
	<content:encoded>Sox genes encode a set of highly conserved transcription factors that regulate many developmental processes. In insects, the SoxB gene &lt;i&gt;Dichaete&lt;/i&gt; is the only Sox gene known to be involved in segmentation. To determine if similar mechanisms are used in other arthropods, we investigated the role of Sox genes during segmentation in the spider &lt;i&gt;Parasteatoda tepidariorum&lt;/i&gt;. While &lt;i&gt;Dichaete&lt;/i&gt; does not appear to be involved in spider segmentation, we found that the closely related &lt;i&gt;Sox21b-1&lt;/i&gt; gene acts as a gap gene during formation of anterior segments and is also part of the segmentation clock for development of the segment addition zone and sequential addition of opisthosomal segments. Thus, we have found that two different mechanisms of segmentation in a non-mandibulate arthropod are regulated by a SoxB gene. Our work provides new insights into the function of an important and conserved gene family, and the evolution of the regulation of segmentation in arthropods.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36494</link>
	<content:encoded>Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) is widely expressed in the hypothalamus and an important regulator of energy homeostasis; however, the specific contributions of different CART neuronal populations to this process are not known. Here, we show that depolarization of mouse arcuate nucleus (Arc) CART neurons via DREADD technology decreases energy expenditure and physical activity, while it exerts the opposite effects in CART neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (LHA). Importantly, when stimulating these neuronal populations in the absence of CART, the effects were attenuated. In contrast, while activation of CART neurons in the LHA stimulated feeding in the presence of CART, endogenous CART inhibited food intake in response to Arc CART neuron activation. Taken together, these results demonstrate anorexigenic but anabolic effects of CART upon Arc neuron activation, and orexigenic but catabolic effects upon LHA-neuron activation, highlighting the complex and nuclei-specific functions of CART in controlling feeding and energy homeostasis.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/397455v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Food shortage represents a primary challenge to survival, and animals have adapted diverse developmental, physiological, and behavioral strategies to survive when food becomes unavailable. Starvation resistance is strongly influenced by ecological and evolutionary history, yet the genetic basis for the evolution of starvation resistance remains poorly understood. The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, provides a powerful model for leveraging experimental evolution to investigate traits associated with starvation resistance. While control populations only live a few days without food, selection for starvation resistances results in populations that can survive weeks. We have previously shown that selection for starvation resistance results in increased sleep and reduced feeding in adult flies. Here, we investigate the ontogeny of starvation resistance-associated behavioral and metabolic phenotypes in these experimentally selected flies. We find that selection for starvation resistance results in delayed development and a reduction in metabolic rate in larvae that persists into adulthood, suggesting that these traits may allow for the accumulation of energy stores and an increase in body size within these selected populations. In addition, we find that sleep is largely unaffected by starvation selection and that feeding increases during the late larval stages, suggesting that experimental evolution for starvation resistance produces developmentally specified changes in behavioral regulation. Together, these findings reveal a critical role for development in the evolution of starvation resistance and indicate that selection can selectively influence behavior during defined developmental timepoints.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A spike timing-dependent plasticity rule for single, clustered and distributed dendritic spines</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/397323v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Dendritic spines can undergo structural remodeling, and are the preferential site for the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). In a variant of LTP and LTD, known as spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), the sign and magnitude of the change in synaptic strength depends on the timing between the spikes of two connected neurons. Although STDP has been extensively studied in cortical pyramidal neurons, the precise structural organization of excitatory inputs that supports STDP, as well as the structural, molecular and functional properties of dendritic spines during STDP remain unknown. Here we developed a spine STDP protocol, in which two-photon glutamate uncaging over single or multiple spines from the basal dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons, which mimics presynaptic release of glutamate (pre), was paired with somatically generated postsynaptic spikes (post). We found that the induction of STDP in single spines follows a classical Hebbian STDP rule, where pre-post pairings at timings that trigger LTP (t-LTP) produce shrinkage of the activated spine neck and a concomitant increase in its synaptic strength; and post-pre pairings that trigger LTD (t-LTD) decrease synaptic strength without affecting the activated spine shape. Furthermore, we tested whether the single spine-Hebbian STDP rule could be affected by the activation of neighboring (clustered) or distant (distributed) spines. Our results show that the induction of t-LTP in two clustered spines (&amp;lt; 5 m apart) enhances LTP via a mechanism that is accompanied by local spine calcium increases that accumulates during the induction protocol, and that requires actin polymerization-dependent neck shrinkage, which permits AMPA receptor transport to the spine head and insertion into the postsynaptic density (PSD). Moreover, the induction of t-LTD is disrupted when two clustered spines are activated, with no calcium accumulation in spines or dendrites, but can be recovered if the activated spines are separated by &amp;gt; 40 m. These results indicate that the induction of STDP in single, or distributed spines, follow a Hebbian STDP rule. Interestingly, synaptic cooperativity, induced by the co-activation of only two clustered spines and the local spatio-temporal summation of clustered synaptic inputs, provides local dendritic depolarization and local calcium signals that are sufficient to disrupt t-LTD and extend the temporal window for the induction of t-LTP, leading to STDP only encompassing LTP.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/397224v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Although the EEG slow wave of sleep is typically considered to be a hallmark of Non Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep, recent work in mice has shown that slow waves can also occur in REM sleep. Here we investigated the presence and cortical distribution of low-frequency (1-4 Hz) oscillations in human REM sleep by analyzing high-density EEG sleep recordings obtained in 28 healthy subjects. We identified two clusters of low-frequency oscillations with distinctive properties: 1) a fronto-central cluster characterized by ~2.5-3.0 Hz, relatively large, notched delta waves (so-called &quot;sawtooth waves&quot;) that tended to occur in bursts, were associated with increased gamma activity and rapid eye movements, and upon source modeling, displayed an occipito-temporal and a fronto-central component; and 2) a medial occipital cluster characterized by more isolated, slower (&amp;lt;2 Hz) and smaller waves that were not associated with rapid eye movements, displayed a negative correlation with gamma activity and were also found in NREM sleep. Thus, low-frequency oscillations are an integral part of REM sleep in humans, and the two identified subtypes (sawtooth and medial-occipital slow waves) may reflect distinct generation mechanisms and functional roles. Sawtooth waves, which are exclusive to REM sleep, share many characteristics with ponto-geniculo-occipital (PGO) waves described in animals and may represent the human equivalent or a closely related event while medio-occipital slow waves appear similar to NREM sleep slow waves.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Morlet wavelets are frequently used for time-frequency analysis of non-stationary time series data, such as neuroelectrical signals recorded from the brain. The crucial parameter of Morlet wavelets is the width of the Gaussian that tapers the sine wave. This width parameter controls the trade-off between temporal precision and frequency precision. It is typically defined as the &quot;number of cycles,&quot; but this parameter is opaque, and often leads to uncertainty and suboptimal analysis choices, as well as being difficult to interpret and evaluate. The purpose of this paper is to present alternative formulations of Morlet wavelets in time and in frequency that allow parameterizing the wavelets directly in terms of the desired temporal and spectral smoothing (as full-width at half-maximum). This formulation provides clarity on an important data analysis parameter, and should facilitate proper analyses, reporting, and interpretation of results. MATLAB code is provided.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A neuromechanistic model for rhythmic beat generation</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/397075v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>When listening to music, humans can easily identify and move to the beat. Numerous experimental studies have identified brain regions that may be involved with beat perception and representation. Several theoretical and algorithmic approaches have been proposed to account for this ability. Related to, but different from the issue of how we perceive a beat, is the question of how we learn to generate and hold a beat. In this paper, we introduce a neuronal framework for a beat generator that is capable of learning isochronous rhythms over a range of frequencies that are relevant to music and speech. Our approach combines ideas from error-correction and entrainment models to investigate the dynamics of how a biophysically-based neuronal network model synchronizes its period and phase to match that of an external stimulus. The model makes novel use of on-going faster gamma rhythms to form a set of discrete clocks that provide estimates, but not exact information, of how well the beat generator spike times match those of a stimulus sequence. The beat generator is endowed with plasticity allowing it to quickly learn and thereby adjust its spike times to achieve synchronization. Our model makes generalizable predictions about the existence of asymmetries in the synchronziation process, as well as specific predictions about resynchronization times after changes in stimulus tempo or phase. Analysis of the model demonstrates that accurate rhythmic time keeping can be achieved over a range of frequencies relevant to music, in a manner that is robust to changes in parameters and to the presence of noise.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/396986v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Cellular and circuit hyperexcitability are core features of Fragile X Syndrome and related autism spectrum disorder models. However, a synaptic basis for this hyperexcitability has proved elusive. We show in a mouse model of Fragile X Syndrome, glutamate uncaging onto individual dendritic spines yields stronger single-spine excitation than wild-type, with more silent spines. Furthermore, near-simultaneous uncaging at multiple spines revealed fewer spines are required to trigger an action potential. This arose, in part, from increased dendritic gain due to increased intrinsic excitability, resulting from reduced hyperpolarization-activated currents. Super-resolution microscopy revealed no change in dendritic spine morphology, pointing to an absence of a structure-function relationship. However, ultrastructural analysis revealed a 3-fold increase in multiply-innervated spines, accounting for the increased single-spine excitatory currents following glutamate uncaging. Thus, loss of FMRP causes abnormal synaptogenesis, leading to large numbers of poly-synaptic spines despite normal spine morphology, thus explaining the synaptic perturbations underlying circuit hyperexcitability.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Quantifying individual variation in postnatal brain development can provide insight into cognitive diversity within a population and the aetiology of common neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders that are associated with adverse conditions in early life. Non-invasive studies of the non-human primate can aid understanding of human brain development, facilitating longitudinal analysis during early postnatal development when comparative human populations are difficult to sample. In this study, we perform analysis of a longitudinal MRI dataset of 32 macaques, each with up to five magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans acquired between 1 and 36 months of age. Using nonlinear mixed effects model we derive growth trajectories for whole brain, cortical and subcortical grey matter, cerebral white matter and cerebellar volume. We then test the association between individual variation in postnatal tissue volumes and birth weight. We report nonlinear growth models for all tissue compartments, as well as significant variation in total intracranial volume between individuals. We also demonstrate that subcortical grey matter varies both in total volume and rate of change between individuals and is associated with differences in birth weight. This supports evidence that subcortical grey matter is specifically vulnerable to adverse conditions in utero and highlights the importance of longitudinal MRI analysis in developmental studies.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/396788v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The coordination between continuously-controlled and discretely-initiated orienting movements is a fundamental problem in motor control. This coordination is vital for maintaining high-acuity vision of moving objects, which requires foveating the object's image through continuous smooth pursuit and discretely triggered saccadic eye movements. However, the decision mechanism underlying this coordination remains inadequately characterized. During these coordinated eye movements, pursuit is rapidly initiated by retinal image velocity while intervening saccades are triggered with highly variable latency contingent on both retinal image velocity and position. Here we propose a new computational strategy simulating the decision mechanism triggering saccades during pursuit. In this model, future position error and its associated uncertainty are predicted through Bayesian inference across noisy, delayed sensory observations of retinal image motion. This probabilistic prediction of position error enables the computation of the confidence that a saccade will be needed, triggering saccades upon accumulating confidence to a threshold. Saccade confidence corresponds to the relative certainty that the image is positioned outside the fovea (quantified through log probability ratio). This model predicts the occurrence and latency distributions of saccades across a range of step-ramp target trajectories and externally imposed sensory uncertainty levels (e.g. via Gaussian blurring of the visual target). We suggest this stochastic, predictive decision making process represents a fundamental principle for the neural coordination of movement.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/395939v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>A puzzle for neuroscience - and robotics - is how insects achieve surprisingly complex behaviours with such tiny brains. One example is depth perception via binocular stereopsis in the praying mantis, a predatory insect. Praying mantids use stereopsis, the computation of distances from disparities between the two retinas, to trigger a raptorial strike of their forelegs when prey is within reach. The neuronal basis of this ability is entirely unknown. From behavioural evidence, one view is that the mantis brain must measure retinal disparity locally across a range of distances and eccentricities, very like disparity-tuned neurons in vertebrate visual cortex. Sceptics argue that this 'retinal disparity hypothesis' implies far too many specialised neurons for such a tiny brain. Here we show the first evidence that individual neurons in the praying mantis brain are indeed tuned to specific disparities and eccentricities, and thus locations in 3D-space. This disparity information is transmitted to the central brain by neurons connecting peripheral visual areas in both hemispheres, as well as by a unilateral neuron type. Like disparity-tuned cortical cells in vertebrates, the responses of these mantis neurons are consistent with linear summation of binocular inputs followed by an output nonlinearity. Additionally, centrifugal neurons project disparity information back from the central brain to early visual areas, possibly for gain modulation or 3D spatial attention. Thus, our study not only proves the retinal disparity hypothesis for insects, it reveals feedback connections hitherto undiscovered in any animal species.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/392936v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>To understand the mechanism of movement facilitation and inhibition in the subthalamic nucleus (STN), we recorded intra-operatively subthalamic multiunit activity while parkinsonian patients (n=43 patients, 173 recording sites) performed increasingly complex oddball paradigms: auditory task, simple movement task and movement inhibition task. We found that the human STN responds mainly to movement-involving tasks: movement execution at the motor STN and movement planning at the limbic-associative STN. At the limbic-associative STN, responses to the inhibitory cue (deviant tone) in the movement inhibition task were not significantly different from the simple movement task. However, responses to the go cue (frequent tone) were significantly decreased in the movement inhibition task. Successful motor inhibition was correlated with a higher baseline activity before the inhibitory cue. We therefore suggest that the subthalamic nucleus adapts to movement inhibition context by selectively decreasing the amplitude of neuronal activity. Smaller fluctuations might enable better preparation for possible inhibition</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Studies in rodents have demonstrated that transecting the white matter pathway linking the hippocampus and anterior thalamic nuclei - the fornix - impairs flexible navigational learning in the Morris Water Maze (MWM), as well as similar spatial learning tasks. While diffusion MRI studies in humans have linked fornix microstructure to scene discrimination and memory, its role in human navigation is currently unknown. We used high-angular resolution diffusion MRI to ask whether inter-individual differences in fornix microstructure would be associated with spatial learning in a virtual MWM task. To increase sensitivity to individual learning across trials, we adopted a novel curve fitting approach to estimate a single index of learning rate. We found a significant correlation between learning rate and the microstructure (mean diffusivity) of the fornix, but not that of a control tract linking occipital and anterior temporal cortices (the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, ILF). Further, this correlation remained significant when controlling for hippocampal volume. These findings extend previous animal studies by demonstrating the functional relevance of the fornix for human navigational learning, and highlight the importance of a distributed neuroanatomical network, underpinned by key white matter pathways, such as the fornix, in complex spatial behaviour.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/4/ENEURO.0250-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Noise exposure is one of the most common causes of hearing loss and peripheral damage to the auditory system. A growing literature suggests that the auditory system can compensate for peripheral loss through increased central neural activity. The current study sought to investigate the link between noise exposure, increases in central gain, synaptic reorganization, and auditory function. All axons of the auditory nerve project to the cochlear nucleus, making it a requisite nucleus for sound detection. As the first synapse in the central auditory system, the cochlear nucleus is well positioned to respond plastically to loss of peripheral input. To investigate noise-induced compensation in the central auditory system, we measured auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) and auditory perception and collected tissue from mice exposed to broadband noise. Noise-exposed mice showed elevated ABR thresholds, reduced ABR wave 1 amplitudes, and spiral ganglion neuron loss. Despite peripheral damage, noise-exposed mice were hyperreactive to loud sounds and showed nearly normal behavioral sound detection thresholds. Ratios of late ABR peaks (2–4) relative to the first ABR peak indicated that brainstem pathways were hyperactive in noise-exposed mice, while anatomical analysis indicated there was an imbalance between expression of excitatory and inhibitory proteins in the ventral cochlear nucleus. The results of the current study suggest that a reorganization of excitation and inhibition in the ventral cochlear nucleus may drive hyperactivity in the central auditory system. This increase in central gain can compensate for peripheral loss to restore some aspects of auditory function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;β-Site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is required for the production of β-amyloid (Aβ), one of the major pathogenic molecules of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and is therefore being actively pursued as a drug target for AD. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) is a lifelong process that is known to be important for learning and memory and may have the potential to regenerate damaged neural tissue. In this study, we examined whether BACE1 regulates AHN, which holds important implications for its suitability as a drug target in AD. Cohorts of 2-month-old wild-type (BACE1&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt;), heterozygous, and homozygous BACE1 knockout mice (BACE1&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt; and BACE1&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively) were injected with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) and sacrificed 1 day later to examine the impact of loss of BACE1 on neural precursor cell (NPC) proliferation in the adult brain. Parallel cohorts of mice were sacrificed 4 weeks after BrdU injection to determine the effects of BACE1 on survival and differentiation of newborn NPCs. We found that NPC proliferation was increased in BACE1&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice compared to BACE1&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice, while no difference was observed in NPC survival across genotypes. Differentiation of NPCs to neuronal lineage was impaired in BACE1&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. However, no differences were observed in astrogenesis, the proportion of immature neurons, or the production of oligodendrocytes across genotypes. Importantly, corresponding with a decrease in neuronal differentiation in the absence of a complementary increase in an alternate cell fate, BACE1&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice were found to have a pool of undifferentiated NPCs in the hippocampus compared to BACE1&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; and BACE1&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Human Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Shows Local Increases in Low-Frequency Oscillations and Global Decreases in High-Frequency Oscillations Compared to Resting Wakefulness</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0293-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;It is often assumed that during rapid eye-movement (REM) sleep the cerebral cortex homogenously shows electroencephalogram activity highly similar to wakefulness. However, to date no studies have compared neural oscillatory activity in human REM sleep to resting wakefulness with high spatial sampling. In the current study, we evaluated high-resolution topographical changes in neural oscillatory power between both early and late naturalistic REM sleep and resting wakefulness in adult humans. All-night recordings with 256-channel high-density electroencephalography (hd-EEG) were collected in healthy volunteers (N = 12). Topographic analysis revealed that, compared to wake, both the first and last cycle of REM sleep were associated with increased low-frequency oscillations in local central and occipital regions. In contrast, high frequency activity in both alpha and beta bands (8-20 Hz) was globally decreased during both early and late REM sleep cycles compared to wakefulness. No significant differences in topographic power in any frequency band were observed between REM sleep cycles occurring early and late in the night. We replicated these findings in an independent dataset (N = 33). Together our findings show that human REM sleep shows consistent topographical changes in oscillatory power across both early and late sleep cycles compared to resting wakefulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; In this work we present the first high-resolution topographical study of changes in neural oscillatory power between rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and wakefulness in healthy adult humans. Our results show that REM sleep is characterized by globally reduced high-frequency power as well as increased low-frequency oscillations in local regions of the cerebral cortex, including primary sensory, motor and visual cortices. Our findings are consistent with a recent study using laminar recordings rodents, which found that local slow waves occur during REM sleep in middle/superficial layers (layers 3 and 4) of primary visual, sensory and motor areas. Local low-frequency oscillations in primary sensory and motor cortices could be a potential mechanism for disconnection from the external environment during REM sleep.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Fitness effects of altering gene expression noise in Saccharomyces cerevisiae</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37272</link>
	<content:encoded>Gene expression noise is an evolvable property of biological systems that describes differences in expression among genetically identical cells in the same environment. Prior work has shown that expression noise is heritable and can be shaped by selection, but the impact of variation in expression noise on organismal fitness has proven difficult to measure. Here, we quantify the fitness effects of altering expression noise for the &lt;i&gt;TDH3&lt;/i&gt; gene in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;. We show that increases in expression noise can be deleterious or beneficial depending on the difference between the average expression level of a genotype and the expression level maximizing fitness. We also show that a simple model relating single-cell expression levels to population growth produces patterns consistent with our empirical data. We use this model to explore a broad range of average expression levels and expression noise, providing additional insight into the fitness effects of variation in expression noise.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Building a functional connectome of the Drosophila central complex</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37017</link>
	<content:encoded>The central complex is a highly conserved insect brain region composed of morphologically stereotyped neurons that arborize in distinctively shaped substructures. The region is implicated in a wide range of behaviors and several modeling studies have explored its circuit computations. Most studies have relied on assumptions about connectivity between neurons based on their overlap in light microscopy images. Here, we present an extensive functional connectome of Drosophila melanogaster's central complex at cell-type resolution. Using simultaneous optogenetic stimulation, calcium imaging and pharmacology, we tested the connectivity between 70 presynaptic-to-postsynaptic cell-type pairs. We identi1ed numerous inputs to the central complex, but only a small number of output channels. Additionally, the connectivity of this highly recurrent circuit appears to be sparser than anticipated from light microscopy images. Finally, the connectivity matrix highlights the potentially critical role of a class of bottleneck interneurons. All data is provided for interactive exploration on a website.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Background selection and biased gene conversion affect more than 95% of the human genome and bias demographic inferences</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36317</link>
	<content:encoded>Disentangling the effect on genomic diversity of natural selection from that of demography is notoriously difficult, but necessary to properly reconstruct the history of species. Here, we use high-quality human genomic data to show that purifying selection at linked sites (i.e. background selection, BGS) and GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC) together affect as much as 95% of the variants of our genome. We find that the magnitude and relative importance of BGS and gBGC are largely determined by variation in recombination rate and base composition. Importantly, synonymous sites and non-transcribed regions are also affected, albeit to different degrees. Their use for demographic inference can lead to strong biases. However, by conditioning on genomic regions with recombination rates above 1.5 cM/Mb and mutation types (C↔G, A↔T), we identify a set of SNPs that is mostly unaffected by BGS or gBGC, and that avoids these biases in the reconstruction of human history.</content:encoded>

The adherens junctions between epithelial cells involve a protein complex formed by E-cadherin, &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-catenin, &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-catenin and F-actin. The stability of this complex was a puzzle for many years, since in vitro studies could reconstitute various stable subsets of the individual proteins, but never the entirety. The missing ingredient turned out to be mechanical tension: a recent experiment that applied physiological forces to the complex with an optical tweezer dramatically increased its lifetime, a phenomenon known as catch bonding. However, in the absence of a crystal structure for the full complex, the microscopic details of the catch bond mechanism remain mysterious. Building on structural clues that point to &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-catenin as the force transducer, we present a quantitative theoretical model for how the catch bond arises, fully accounting for the experimental lifetime distributions. The underlying hypothesis is that force induces a rotational transition between two conformations of &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-catenin, overcoming a significant energy barrier due to a network of salt bridges. This transition allosterically regulates the energies at the interface between &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-catenin and F-actin. The model allows us to predict these energetic changes, as well as highlighting the importance of the salt bridge rotational barrier. By stabilizing one of the &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-catenin states, this barrier could play a role in how the complex responds to additional &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; binding partners like vinculin. Since significant conformational energy barriers are a common feature of other adhesion systems that exhibit catch bonds, our model can be adapted into a general theoretical framework for integrating structure and function in a variety of force-regulated protein complexes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9imrzUZ30_Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: How ecological feedbacks between human population and land cover influence sustainability</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/ersbwBn2nUc/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Kirsten Henderson, Michel Loreau&lt;/p&gt;

It is estimated that the Earth’s biocapacity is unable to meet current demands, which begs the question: is a sustainable future possible for both humans and the environment? The UN projects a human population of approximately 11 billion by the end of the 21st century; requiring additional agricultural land, greater demands for natural resources, and technological advancements. We model human population over the next century, emphasizing feedbacks between natural and agricultural resource availability and human demography. We argue that an intensive agriculture approach to feeding the growing population is ill-conceived, without considering biodiversity and ecosystem services (e.g., nutrient cycling, pollination, water purification, pest control). The productivity of agricultural land and human population dynamics are dependent on the area of natural land—generally, tipping at 5 billion ha of natural land (approximately 40% of the Earth’s terrestrial area). Furthermore, our model shows that an imprudent proactive approach (i.e., focusing on agriculture and ignoring ecosystem services) limits the success of reactive measures (i.e., restoration) in the future, while the inability to react to changes and recover natural systems leads to human population decline.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ersbwBn2nUc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

We present ggsashimi, a command-line tool for the visualization of splicing events across multiple samples. Given a specified genomic region, ggsashimi creates sashimi plots for individual RNA-seq experiments as well as aggregated plots for groups of experiments, a feature unique to this software. Compared to the existing versions of programs generating sashimi plots, it uses popular bioinformatics file formats, it is annotation-independent, and allows the visualization of splicing events even for large genomic regions by scaling down the genomic segments between splice sites. ggsashimi is freely available at https://github.com/guigolab/ggsashimi. It is implemented in python, and internally generates R code for plotting.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XoHi9irl4gY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The role of curvature feedback in the energetics and dynamics of lamprey swimming: A closed-loop model</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/3QBoROL-z9I/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Christina L. Hamlet, Kathleen A. Hoffman, Eric D. Tytell, Lisa J. Fauci&lt;/p&gt;

Like other animals, lampreys have a central pattern generator (CPG) circuit that activates muscles for locomotion and also adjusts the activity to respond to sensory inputs from the environment. Such a feedback system is crucial for responding appropriately to unexpected perturbations, but it is also active during normal unperturbed steady swimming and influences the baseline swimming pattern. In this study, we investigate different functional forms of body curvature-based sensory feedback and evaluate their effects on steady swimming energetics and kinematics, since little is known experimentally about the functional form of curvature feedback. The distributed CPG is modeled as chains of coupled oscillators. Pairs of phase oscillators represent the left and right sides of segments along the lamprey body. These activate muscles that flex the body and move the lamprey through a fluid environment, which is simulated using a full Navier-Stokes model. The emergent curvature of the body then serves as an input to the CPG oscillators, closing the loop. We consider two forms of feedback, each consistent with experimental results on lamprey proprioceptive sensory receptors. The first, referred to as directional feedback, excites or inhibits the oscillators on the same side, depending on the sign of a chosen gain parameter, and has the opposite effect on oscillators on the opposite side. We find that directional feedback does not affect beat frequency, but does change the duration of muscle activity. The second feedback model, referred to as magnitude feedback, provides a symmetric excitatory or inhibitory effect to oscillators on both sides. This model tends to increase beat frequency and reduces the energetic cost to the lamprey when the gain is high and positive. With both types of feedback, the body curvature has a similar magnitude. Thus, these results indicate that the same magnitude of curvature-based feedback on the CPG with different functional forms can cause distinct differences in swimming performance.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3QBoROL-z9I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Exploration of the feature space of &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; developed post-transcriptional riboregulators</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/GiqZOvwYWCE/article</link>

Metabolic engineering increasingly depends upon RNA technology to customly rewire the metabolism to maximize production. To this end, pure riboregulators allow dynamic gene repression without the need of a potentially burdensome coexpressed protein like typical Hfq binding small RNAs and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats technology. Despite this clear advantage, no clear general design principles are available to &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; develop repressing riboregulators, limiting the availability and the reliable development of these type of riboregulators. Here, to overcome this lack of knowledge on the functionality of repressing riboregulators, translation inhibiting RNAs are developed from scratch. These &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; developed riboregulators explore features related to thermodynamical and structural factors previously attributed to translation initiation modulation. In total, 12 structural and thermodynamic features were defined of which six features were retained after removing correlations from an &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; generated riboregulator library. From this translation inhibiting RNA library, 18 riboregulators were selected using a experimental design and subsequently constructed and co-expressed with two target untranslated regions to link the translation inhibiting RNA features to functionality. The pure riboregulators in the design of experiments showed repression down to 6% of the original protein expression levels, which could only be partially explained by a ordinary least squares regression model. To allow reliable forward engineering, a partial least squares regression model was constructed and validated to link the properties of translation inhibiting RNA riboregulators to gene repression. In this model both structural and thermodynamic features were important for efficient gene repression by pure riboregulators. This approach enables a more reliable &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; forward engineering of effective pure riboregulators, which further expands the RNA toolbox for gene expression modulation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GiqZOvwYWCE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this paper we address the memory demands that come with the processing of
3-dimensional, high-resolution, multi-channeled medical images in deep
learning. We exploit memory-efficient backpropagation techniques, to reduce the
memory complexity of network training from being linear in the network's depth,
to being roughly constant $ - $ permitting us to elongate deep architectures
with negligible memory increase. We evaluate our methodology in the paradigm of
Image Quality Transfer, whilst noting its potential application to various
tasks that use deep learning. We study the impact of depth on accuracy and show
that deeper models have more predictive power, which may exploit larger
training sets. We obtain substantially better results than the previous
state-of-the-art model with a slight memory increase, reducing the
root-mean-squared-error by $ 13\% $. Our code is publicly available.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05464</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Almost all EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) need some labeled
subject-specific data to calibrate a new subject, as neural responses are
different across subjects to even the same stimulus. So, a major challenge in
developing high-performance and user-friendly BCIs is to cope with such
individual differences so that the calibration can be reduced or even
completely eliminated. This paper focuses on the latter. More specifically, we
consider an offline application scenario, in which we have unlabeled EEG trials
from a new subject, and would like to accurately label them by leveraging
auxiliary labeled EEG trials from other subjects in the same task. To
accommodate the individual differences, we propose a novel unsupervised
approach to align the EEG trials from different subjects in the Euclidean space
to make them more consistent. It has three desirable properties: 1) the aligned
trial lie in the Euclidean space, which can be used by any Euclidean space
signal processing and machine learning approach; 2) it can be computed very
efficiently; and, 3) it does not need any labeled trials from the new subject.
Experiments on motor imagery and event-related potentials demonstrated the
effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Robustness of functional networks at criticality against structural defects. (arXiv:1808.05284v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05284</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The robustness of dynamical properties of neuronal networks against
structural damages is a central problem in computational and experimental
neuroscience. Research has shown that the cortical network of a healthy brain
works near a critical state, and moreover, that functional neuronal networks
often have scale-free and small-world properties. In this work, we study how
the robustness of simple functional networks at criticality is affected by
structural defects. In particular, we consider a 2D Ising model at the critical
temperature and investigate how its functional network changes with the
increasing degree of structural defects. We show that the scale-free and
small-world properties of the functional network at criticality are robust
against large degrees of structural lesions while the system remains below the
percolation limit. Although the Ising model is only a conceptual description of
a two-state neuron, our research reveals fundamental robustness properties of
functional networks derived from classical statistical mechanics models.

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Fizzy-related dictates a cell cycle switch during organ repair and tissue growth responses in the Drosophila hindgut</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38327</link>
	<content:encoded>Ploidy-increasing cell cycles drive tissue growth in many developing organs. Such cycles, including endocycles, are increasingly appreciated to drive tissue growth following injury or activated growth signaling in mature organs. In these organs, the regulation and distinct roles of different cell cycles remains unclear. Here, we uncover a programmed switch between cell cycles in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; hindgut pylorus. Using an acute injury model, we identify mitosis as the response in larval pyloric cells, whereas endocycles occur in adult pyloric cells. By developing a novel genetic method, DEMISE (Dual-Expression-Method-for-Induced-Site-specific-Eradication), we show the cell cycle regulator Fizzy-related dictates the decision between mitosis and endocycles. After injury, both cycles accurately restore tissue mass and genome content. However, in response to sustained growth signaling, only endocycles preserve epithelial architecture. Our data reveal distinct cell cycle programming in response to similar stimuli in mature vs. developmental states and reveal a tissue-protective role of endocycles.</content:encoded>

Evolve and Resequencing (E&amp;amp;R) studies allow us to monitor adaptation at the genomic level. By sequencing evolving populations at regular time intervals, E&amp;amp;R studies promise to shed light on some of the major open questions in evolutionary biology such as the repeatability of evolution and the molecular basis of adaptation. However, data interpretation, statistical analysis and the experimental design of E&amp;amp;R studies increasingly require simulations of evolving populations, a task that is difficult to accomplish with existing tools, which may i) be too slow, ii) require substantial reformatting of data, iii) not support an adaptive scenario of interest or iv) not sufficiently capture the biology of the used model organism. Therefore we developed MimicrEE2, a multi-threaded Java program for genome-wide forward simulations of evolving populations. MimicrEE2 enables the convenient usage of available genomic resources, supports biological particulars of model organism frequently used in E&amp;amp;R studies and offers a wide range of different adaptive models (selective sweeps, polygenic adaptation, epistasis). Due to its user-friendly and efficient design MimicrEE2 will facilitate simulations of E&amp;amp;R studies even for small labs with limited bioinformatics expertise or computational resources. Additionally, the scripts provided for executing MimicrEE2 on a computer cluster permit the coverage even of a large parameter space. MimicrEE2 runs on any computer with Java installed.

Understanding the epidemiology of seasonal influenza is critical for healthcare resource allocation and early detection of anomalous seasons. It can be challenging to obtain high-quality data of influenza cases specifically, as clinical presentations with influenza-like symptoms may instead be cases of one of a number of alternate respiratory viruses. We use a new dataset of confirmed influenza virological data from 2011-2016, along with high-quality denominators informing a hierarchical observation process, to model seasonal influenza dynamics in New South Wales, Australia. We use approximate Bayesian computation to estimate parameters in a climate-driven stochastic epidemic model, including the basic reproduction number &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the proportion of the population susceptible to the circulating strain at the beginning of the season, and the probability an infected individual seeks treatment. We conclude that &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and initial population susceptibility were strongly related, emphasising the challenges of identifying these parameters. Relatively high &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; values alongside low initial population susceptibility were among the results most consistent with these data. Our results reinforce the importance of distinguishing between &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and the effective reproduction number (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;) in modelling studies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/raQHBoUzdMM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0217-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Phosphorylation of MARCKS (myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate) reflects neurite degeneration at the early stage of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), before extracellular Aβ aggregates are histologically detectable. Here, we demonstrate that similar changes in MARCKS occur in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy body (DLB) pathologies in both mouse models and human patients. The increase in the level of pSer46-MARCKS began before α-synuclein aggregate formation, at a time when human α-Syn-BAC-Tg/GBA-hetero-KO mice exhibited no symptoms, and was sustained during aging, consistent with the pattern in human postmortem brains. The results strongly imply a common mechanism of pre-aggregation neurite degeneration in AD and PD/DLB pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement:&lt;/b&gt; At early stage of Alzheimer’s disease before the aggregation of extracellular Aβ, phosphorylation of MARCKS at Ser46 reflects neurite degeneration. In this study, we confirmed the similar changes both in mouse models and human patients of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). Phosphorylation of MARCKS at Ser46 was increased before α-synuclein aggregation was detected, and the increase of pSer46-MARCKS was sustained during aging. These results suggest that neurite degeneration detected by pSer46-MARCKS is a common pre-aggregation mechanism shared by AD and PD/DLB pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Larval Zebrafish Lateral Line as a Model for Acoustic Trauma</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0206-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Excessive noise exposure damages sensory hair cells, leading to permanent hearing loss. Zebrafish are a highly tractable model that have advanced our understanding of drug-induced hair cell death, yet no comparable model exists for noise exposure research. We demonstrate the utility of zebrafish as model to increase understanding of hair cell damage from acoustic trauma and develop protective therapies. We created an acoustic trauma system using underwater cavitation to stimulate lateral line hair cells. We found that acoustic stimulation resulted in exposure time- and intensity-dependent lateral line and saccular hair cell damage that is maximal at 48-72h post-trauma. The number of TUNEL positive lateral line hair cells increased 72h post-exposure whereas no increase was observed in TUNEL positive supporting cells, demonstrating that acoustic stimulation causes hair cell-specific damage. Lateral line hair cells damaged by acoustic stimulation regenerate within three days, consistent with prior regeneration studies utilizing ototoxic drugs. Acoustic stimulation-induced hair cell damage is attenuated by pharmacological inhibition of protein synthesis or caspase activation, suggesting a requirement for translation and activation of apoptotic signaling cascades. Surviving hair cells exposed to acoustic stimulation showed signs of synaptopathy, consistent with mammalian studies. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of this platform to identify compounds that prevent acoustic trauma by screening a small redox library for protective compounds. Our data suggest that acoustic stimulation results in lateral line hair cell damage consistent with acoustic trauma research in mammals, providing a highly tractable model for high-throughput genetic and drug discovery studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Noise overexposure damages hair cells, leading to permanent hearing loss. A critical step in understanding and preventing noise-induced hearing loss is establishing an accessible &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; model to test for genetic and chemical modulators of noise damage. We developed a novel acoustic trauma system, using cavitation, to stimulate and damage zebrafish lateral line hair cells. We demonstrate that acoustic stimulation damages zebrafish lateral line hair cells in an exposure time- and intensity-dependent manner, consistent with acoustic trauma research in mammals. This novel system provides a model for &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, real-time studies of noise exposure, and for rapid discovery of chemical and genetic modulators of acoustic trauma-induced hair cell damage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A multiple timescales approach to bridging spiking- and population-level dynamics. (arXiv:1808.05148v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05148</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A rigorous bridge between spiking-level and macroscopic quantities is an
on-going and well-developed story for asynchronously firing neurons, but focus
has shifted to include neural populations exhibiting varying synchronous
dynamics. Recent literature has used the Ott--Antonsen ansatz (2008) to great
effect, allowing a rigorous derivation of an order parameter for large
oscillator populations. The ansatz has been successfully applied using several
models including networks of Kuramoto oscillators, theta models, and
integrate-and-fire neurons, along with many types of network topologies. In the
present study, we take a converse approach: given the mean field dynamics of
slow synapses, predict the synchronization properties of finite neural
populations. The slow synapse assumption is amenable to averaging theory and
the method of multiple timescales. Our proposed theory applies to two
heterogeneous populations of N excitatory n-dimensional and N inhibitory
m-dimensional oscillators with homogeneous synaptic weights. We then
demonstrate our theory using two examples. In the first example we take a
network of excitatory and inhibitory theta neurons and consider the case with
and without heterogeneous inputs. In the second example we use Traub models
with calcium for the excitatory neurons and Wang-Buzs{\'a}ki models for the
inhibitory neurons. We accurately predict phase drift and phase locking in each
example even when the slow synapses exhibit non-trivial mean-field dynamics.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05143</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Humans can fluidly adapt their interest in complex environments in ways that
machines cannot. Here, we lay the groundwork for a real-world system that
passively monitors and merges neural correlates of visual interest across team
members via Collaborative Brain Computer Interface (cBCI). When group interest
is detected and co-registered in time and space, it can be used to model the
task relevance of items in a dynamic, natural environment. Previous work in
cBCIs focuses on static stimuli, stimulus- or response- locked analyses, and
often within-subject and experiment model training. The contributions of this
work are twofold. First, we test the utility of cBCI on a scenario that more
closely resembles natural conditions, where subjects visually scanned a video
for target items in a virtual environment. Second, we use an
experiment-agnostic deep learning model to account for the real-world use case
where no training set exists that exactly matches the end-users task and
circumstances. With our approach we show improved performance as the number of
subjects in the cBCI ensemble grows, and the potential to reconstruct
ground-truth target occurrence in an otherwise noisy and complex environment.

pattern with the scene being imaged. These tasks rely on a computer. Here we
demonstrate that the computational integration can be performed directly with
the human eye. We use this human ghost imaging technique to evaluate the
temporal response of the eye and establish the image persistence time to be
around 20 ms followed by a further 20 ms exponential decay. These persistence
times are in agreement with previous studies but can now potentially be
extended to include a more precise characterisation of visual stimuli and
provide a new experimental tool for the study of visual perception.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Complexity of human response delay in intermittent control: The case of virtual stick balancing. (arXiv:1808.05002v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05002</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Response delay is an inherent and essential part of human actions. In the
context of human balance control, the response delay is traditionally modeled
using the formalism of delay-differential equations, which adopts the
approximation of fixed delay. However, experimental studies revealing
substantial variability, adaptive anticipation, and non-stationary dynamics of
response delay provide evidence against this approximation. In this paper, we
call for development of principally new mathematical formalism describing human
response delay. To support this, we present the experimental data from a simple
virtual stick balancing task. Our results demonstrate that human response delay
is a widely distributed random variable with complex properties, which can
exhibit oscillatory and adaptive dynamics characterized by long-range
correlations. Given this, we argue that the fixed-delay approximation ignores
essential properties of human response, and conclude with possible directions
for future developments of new mathematical notions describing human control.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Accounting for non-stationarity in epidemiology by embedding time-varying parameters in stochastic models</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/zWKoqREZG3A/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Bernard Cazelles, Clara Champagne, Joseph Dureau&lt;/p&gt;

The spread of disease through human populations is complex. The characteristics of disease propagation evolve with time, as a result of a multitude of environmental and anthropic factors, this non-stationarity is a key factor in this huge complexity. In the absence of appropriate external data sources, to correctly describe the disease propagation, we explore a flexible approach, based on stochastic models for the disease dynamics, and on diffusion processes for the parameter dynamics. Using such a diffusion process has the advantage of not requiring a specific mathematical function for the parameter dynamics. Coupled with particle MCMC, this approach allows us to reconstruct the time evolution of some key parameters (average transmission rate for instance). Thus, by capturing the time-varying nature of the different mechanisms involved in disease propagation, the epidemic can be described. Firstly we demonstrate the efficiency of this methodology on a toy model, where the parameters and the observation process are known. Applied then to real datasets, our methodology is able, based solely on simple stochastic models, to reconstruct complex epidemics, such as flu or dengue, over long time periods. Hence we demonstrate that time-varying parameters can improve the accuracy of model performances, and we suggest that our methodology can be used as a first step towards a better understanding of a complex epidemic, in situation where data is limited and/or uncertain.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zWKoqREZG3A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

structure of pulse-coupled network to understand how a sparse coupling
structure could lead to a sparse coding by effective interactions. This
relation quantitatively displays how the dynamical structure is closely related
to the coupling structure.

to make the problem less ambiguous, however, it still remained unclear whether

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Social dominance, the main organizing principle of social hierarchies, facilitates priority access to resources by dominant individuals. Throughout taxa, individuals are more likely to become dominant if they act first in social situations and acting fast may provide evolutionary advantage; yet whether fast decision-making is a behavioral predisposition of dominant persons outside of social contexts is not known. Following characterization of participants for social dominance motivation, we found that, indeed, men high in social dominance respond faster–without loss of accuracy–than those low in dominance across a variety of decision-making tasks. Both groups did not differ in a simple reaction task. Then, we selected a decision-making task and applied high-density electroencephalography (EEG) to assess temporal dynamics of brain activation through event related potentials. We found that promptness to respond in the choice task in dominant individuals is related to a strikingly amplified brain signal at approximately 240 ms post-stimulus presentation. Source imaging analyses identified higher activity in the left insula and in the cingulate, right inferior temporal and right angular gyri in high than in low dominance participants. Our findings suggest that promptness to respond in choice situations, regardless of social context, is a biomarker for social disposition.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Here we investigated the sex-specific effects of the CACNA1C variant rs1024582 on psychiatry-related traits, brain activity during tasks and rest, and brain volume in 1207 normal male and female subjects. After correcting for multiple comparisons, there were significant interaction effects between sex and the minor allele of this polymorphism on the hostile behavior subscale scores of the Coronary-Prone Type Scale mediated by higher scores in female carriers of the minor allele. Imaging analyses revealed significant interaction effects between sex and the minor allele on fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and on brain activity during the 2-back task in areas of the right posterior cingulate cortex, right thalamus, and right hippocampus, which were all mediated by reduced activity in female carriers of the minor allele. Our results demonstrated that the rs1024582 risk variant of CACNA1C is associated with reduced activity in the frontolimbic regions at rest and during a working memory task as well as with greater hostility in females in the healthy population.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Functional Role of Large-scale Brain Network Coordination in Placebo-induced Anxiolysis</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Anxiety reduction through mere expectation of anxiolytic treatment effects (placebo anxiolysis) has enormous clinical importance. Recent behavioral and electrophysiological data suggest that placebo anxiolysis involves reduced vigilance and enhanced internalization of attention; however, the underlying neurobiological mechanisms are not yet clear. Given the fundamental function of intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) in basic cognitive processes, we investigated ICN activity patterns associated with externally and internally directed mental states under the influence of an anxiolytic placebo medication. Based on recent findings, we specifically analyzed the functional role of the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) in coordinating placebo-dependent cue-related (phasic) and cue-unrelated (sustained) network activity. Under placebo, we observed a down-regulation of the entire salience network (SN), particularly in response to threatening cues. The rACC exhibited enhanced cue-unrelated functional connectivity (FC) with the SN, which correlated with reductions in tonic arousal and anxiety. Hence, apart from the frequently reported modulation of aversive cue responses, the rACC appears to be crucially involved in exerting a tonically dampening control over salience-responsive structures. In line with a more internally directed mental state, we also found enhanced FC within the default mode network (DMN), again predicting reductions in anxiety under placebo.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Though the fusiform is well-established as a key node in the face perception network, its role in facial expression processing remains unclear, due to competing models and discrepant findings. To help resolve this debate, we recorded from 17 subjects with intracranial electrodes implanted in face sensitive patches of the fusiform. Multivariate classification analysis showed that facial expression information is represented in fusiform activity and in the same regions that represent identity, though with a smaller effect size. Examination of the spatiotemporal dynamics revealed a functional distinction between posterior fusiform and midfusiform expression coding, with posterior fusiform showing an early peak of facial expression sensitivity at around 180 ms after subjects viewed a face and midfusiform showing a later and extended peak between 230 and 460 ms. These results support the hypothesis that the fusiform plays a role in facial expression perception and highlight a qualitative functional distinction between processing in posterior fusiform and midfusiform, with each contributing to temporally segregated stages of expression perception.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that has a strong genetic component. Disruptions of FOXP1, a transcription factor expressed in the developing cerebral cortex, were associated with ASD. FOXP1(R525X) is a de novo heterozygous mutation found in patients with autism and severe mental retardation. To explore the neuronal basis of FOXP1(R525X) in ASD, we created Foxp1(R521X), a mouse homolog of the human variant. Ectopic expression of Foxp1(R521X) led to cytoplasmic aggregates and activated macroautophagy in neuroblastoma N2a cells and the developing neuronal cells. Cortical neurons expressing Foxp1(R521X) exhibited delayed migration and altered dendritic morphology. As a control, mutant Y435X that was expressed diffusively in the cytoplasm did not induce autophagy and migration delay in the cortex. The embryonic cortical cells had a minimal activity of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) as assayed by a splicing-dependent NMD reporter. We hypothesize that the developing neuronal cells use autophagy but not NMD as a safeguard mechanism against nonsense mutant aggregates, resulting in impairment of the cortical development. This study suggests a novel mechanism other than heterozygous loss of FOXP1 for the development of ASD and may advance our understanding of the complex relationships between gene mutation and the related psychiatric disorders.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Temporal-Order-Based Attentional Priority Modulates Mnemonic Representations in Parietal and Frontal Cortices</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy184/5074510?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The respective roles of occipital, parietal, and frontal cortices in visual working memory maintenance have long been under debate. Previous work on whether parietal and frontal regions convey mnemonic information has yielded mixed findings. One possibility for this variability is that the mnemonic representations in high-level frontoparietal regions are modulated by attentional priority, such as temporal order. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether the most recent item, which has a higher attentional priority in terms of temporal order, is preferentially encoded in frontoparietal regions. On each trial, participants viewed 2 gratings with different orientations in succession, and were cued to remember one of them. Using fMRI and an inverted encoding model, we reconstructed population-level, orientation representations in occipital (V1–V3), parietal (IPS), and frontal (FEF) areas during memory maintenance. Unlike early visual cortex where robust orientation representations were observed regardless of serial order, parietal, and frontal cortices showed stronger representations when participants remembered the second grating. A subsequent experiment using a change detection task on color rings excluded the possibilities of residual stimulus-driven signals or motor preparative signals for responses. These results suggest that mnemonic representations in parietal and frontal cortices are modulated by temporal-order-based attentional priority signals.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Emotion regulation is thought to involve communication between and within large-scale brain networks that underlie emotion reactivity and cognitive control. Aberrant network interaction might therefore be a key neural feature of mental disorders that involve emotion dysregulation. Here we tested whether connectivity hierarchies within and between emotion reactivity and cognitive reappraisal networks distinguishes social anxiety disorder (SAD) patients (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 70) from healthy controls (HC) (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 25). To investigate network organization, we implemented a graph-theory method called Dependency Network Analysis. Participants underwent fMRI while watching or reappraising video clips involving interpersonal verbal criticism. During reappraisal, the reappraisal network exerted less influence on the reactivity network in SAD participants. Specifically, the influence of the right inferior frontal gyrus on both reappraisal and reactivity networks was significantly reduced in SAD compared with HC, and correlated negatively with negative emotion ratings among SAD participants. Surprisingly, the amygdala exhibited reduced influence on the reappraisal network in SAD relative to HC. Yet, during the watch condition, the left amygdala’s influence on the reactivity network increased with greater social anxiety symptoms among SAD participants. These findings refine our understanding of network organization that contributes to efficient reappraisal or to disturbances in applying this strategy in SAD.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Considerable evidence demonstrates strong comorbidity between nicotine dependence and mood and anxiety disorders. Nevertheless, the neurobiological mechanisms linking adolescent nicotine exposure to mood and anxiety disorders are not known. Disturbances in the mesocorticolimbic dopamine (DA) system, comprising the prefrontal cortex (PFC), ventral tegmental area (VTA), and nucleus accumbens (NAc), are correlates of mood and anxiety-related symptoms and this circuitry is strongly influenced by acute or chronic nicotine exposure. Using a combination of behavioral pharmacology, in vivo neuronal electrophysiology and molecular analyses, we examined and compared the effects of chronic nicotine exposure in rats during adolescence versus adulthood to characterize the mechanisms by which adolescent nicotine may selectively confer increased risk of developing mood and anxiety-related symptoms in later life. We report that exposure to nicotine, selectively during adolescence, induces profound and long-lasting neuronal, molecular and behavioral disturbances involving PFC DA D1R and downstream extracellular-signal-related kinase 1-2 (ERK 1-2) signaling. Remarkably, adolescent nicotine induced a persistent state of hyperactive DA activity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) concomitant with hyperactive neuronal activity states in the PFC. Our findings identify several unique neuronal and molecular biomarkers that may serve as functional risk mechanisms for the long-lasting neuropsychiatric effects of adolescent smoking behaviors.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

The hippocampus is known to store cognitive representations, or maps, that encode both positional and contextual information, critical for episodic memories and functional behavior. How path integration and contextual cues are dynamically combined and processed by the hippocampus to maintain these representations accurate over time remains unclear. To answer this question, we propose a two-way data analysis and modeling approach to CA3 multi-electrode recordings of a moving rat submitted to rapid changes of contextual (light) cues, triggering back-and-forth instabitilies between two cognitive representations (“teleportation” experiment of Jezek et al). We develop a dual neural activity decoder, capable of independently identifying the recalled cognitive map at high temporal resolution (comparable to theta cycle) and the position of the rodent given a map. Remarkably, position can be reconstructed at any time with an accuracy comparable to fixed-context periods, even during highly unstable periods. These findings provide evidence for the capability of the hippocampal neural activity to maintain an accurate encoding of spatial and contextual variables, while one of these variables undergoes rapid changes independently of the other. To explain this result we introduce an attractor neural network model for the hippocampal activity that process inputs from external cues and the path integrator. Our model allows us to make predictions on the frequency of the cognitive map instability, its duration, and the detailed nature of the place-cell population activity, which are validated by a further analysis of the data. Our work therefore sheds light on the mechanisms by which the hippocampal network achieves and updates multi-dimensional neural representations from various input streams.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0tmzKAkXbig&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Hebbian plasticity describes a basic mechanism for synaptic plasticity whereby synaptic weights evolve depending on the relative timing of paired activity of the pre- and postsynaptic neurons. Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) constitutes a central experimental and theoretical synaptic Hebbian learning rule. Various mechanisms, mostly calcium-based, account for the induction and maintenance of STDP. Classically STDP is assumed to gradually emerge in a monotonic way as the number of pairings increases. However, non-monotonic STDP accounting for fast associative learning led us to challenge this monotonicity hypothesis and explore how the existence of multiple plasticity pathways affects the dynamical establishment of plasticity. To account for distinct forms of STDP emerging from increasing numbers of pairings and the variety of signaling pathways involved, we developed a general class of simple mathematical models of plasticity based on calcium transients and accommodating various calcium-based plasticity mechanisms. These mechanisms can either compete or cooperate for the establishment of long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD), that emerge depending on past calcium activity. Our model reproduces accurately the striatal STDP that involves endocannabinoid and NMDAR signaling pathways. Moreover, we predict how stimulus frequency alters plasticity, and how triplet rules are affected by the number of pairings. We further investigate the general model with an arbitrary number of pathways and show that depending on those pathways and their properties, a variety of plasticities may emerge upon variation of the number and/or the frequency of pairings, even when the outcome after large numbers of pairings is identical. These findings, built upon a biologically realistic example and generalized to other applications, argue that in order to fully describe synaptic plasticity it is not sufficient to record STDP curves at fixed pairing numbers and frequencies. In fact, considering the whole spectrum of activity-dependent parameters could have a great impact on the description of plasticity, and a better understanding of the engram.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PZXMmsAWq-I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Prospective Analysis of the Effects of Maternal Immune Activation on Rat Cytokines during Pregnancy and Behavior of the Male Offspring Relevant to Schizophrenia</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0249-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Influenza during pregnancy is associated with the development of psychopathology in the offspring. We sought to determine if maternal cytokines produced following administration of viral mimetic polyI:C to pregnant rats were predictive of behavioral abnormalities in the adult offspring. Timed-pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats received a single intravenous injection of 4 mg/kg polyI:C or saline on gestational day 15. Blood was collected for serum analysis of cytokine levels with ELISA. Male offspring were tested in a battery of behavioral tests at adulthood and behavior correlated with maternal cytokine levels. Maternal serum levels of CXCL1 and IL-6, but not TNF-α or CXCL2, were elevated in polyI:C-treated dams. PolyI:C-treated dams experienced post-treatment weight loss and polyI:C pups were smaller than controls at postnatal day 1. Various behavior alterations were seen in the polyI:C-treated offspring. Male polyI:C offspring had enhanced MK-801-induced locomotion, and reduced sociability. PolyI:C offspring failed to display crossmodal and visual memory, and oddity preference was also impaired. Set-shifting, assessed with a lever-based operant conditioning task, was facilitated while touchscreen-based reversal learning was impaired. Correlations were found between maternal serum concentrations of CXCL1, acute maternal temperature and body weight changes, neonatal pup mass, and odd object discrimination and social behavior. Overall, while the offspring of polyI:C-treated rats displayed behavior abnormalities, maternal serum cytokines were not related to the long-term behavior changes in the offspring. Maternal sickness effects and neonatal pup size may be better indicators of later effects in the offspring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Psychiatric pathology is complex, poorly understood, and often results in chronic illness. Many psychiatric conditions are believed to occur as a result of genetic and environmental factors. Gestational adversity such as inflammation in pregnancy may act as a priming experience for the later emergence of psychopathologies, and accurate identification of risk factors may advise early interventions. We sought to characterize long-term behavior effects in the offspring of rats exposed to an inflammatory event during pregnancy and relate these effects to the serum levels of relevant cytokines CXCL1, IL-6, and TNF-α. Our results suggest that these maternal cytokines are not strongly related to offspring behavior outcomes, and other measures may have greater value as predictors of behavior outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Microstructural White Matter Abnormalities in the Dorsal Cingulum of Adolescents with IBS</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/4/ENEURO.0354-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Alterations in fractional anisotropy (FA) have been considered to reflect microstructural white matter (WM) changes in disease conditions; however, no study to date has examined WM changes using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in adolescents with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The objective of the present study was two-fold: (1) to determine whether differences in FA, and other non-FA metrics, were present in adolescents with IBS compared to healthy controls using whole-brain, region of interest (ROI)-restricted tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) and canonical ROI DTI analyses for the cingulum bundle, and (2) to determine whether these metrics were related to clinical measures of disease duration and pain intensity in the IBS group. A total of 16 adolescents with a Rome III diagnosis of IBS (females = 12; mean age = 16.29, age range: 11.96–18.5 years) and 16 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (females = 12; mean age = 16.24; age range: 11.71–20.32 years) participated in this study. Diffusion-weighted images were acquired using a Siemens 3-T Trio Tim Syngo MRI scanner with a 32-channel head coil. The ROI-restricted TBSS and canonical ROI-based DTI analyses revealed that adolescents with IBS showed decreased FA in the right dorsal cingulum bundle compared to controls. No relationship between FA and disease severity measures was found. Microstructural WM alterations in the right dorsal cingulum bundle in adolescents with IBS may reflect a premorbid brain state or the emergence of a disease-driven process that results from complex changes in pain- and affect-related processing via spinothalamic and corticolimbic pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04262</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We present two related methods for deriving connectivity-based brain atlases
from individual connectomes. The proposed methods exploit a previously proposed
dense connectivity representation, termed continuous connectivity, by first
performing graph-based hierarchical clustering of individual brains, and
subsequently aggregating the individual parcellations into a consensus
parcellation. The search for consensus minimizes the sum of cluster membership
distances, effectively estimating a pseudo-Karcher mean of individual
parcellations. We assess the quality of our parcellations using (1)
Kullback-Liebler and Jensen-Shannon divergence with respect to the dense
connectome representation, (2) inter-hemispheric symmetry, and (3) performance
of the simplified connectome in a biological sex classification task. We find
that the parcellation based-atlas computed using a greedy search at a
hierarchical depth 3 outperforms all other parcellation-based atlases as well
as the standard Dessikan-Killiany anatomical atlas in all three assessments.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04196</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Power laws in nature are considered to be signatures of complexity. The
theory of self-organized criticality (SOC) was proposed to explain their
origins. A longstanding principle of SOC is the \emph{separation of timescales}
axiom. It dictates that external input is delivered to the system at a much
slower rate compared to the timescale of internal dynamics. The statistics of
neural avalanches in the brain was demonstrated to follow a power law,
indicating closeness to a critical state. Moreover, criticality was shown to be
a beneficial state for various computations leading to the hypothesis, that the
brain is a SOC system. However, for neuronal systems that are constantly
bombarded by incoming signals, separation of timescales assumption is
unnatural. Recently it was experimentally demonstrated that a proper correction
of the avalanche detection algorithm to account for the increased drive during
task performance leads to a change of the power-law exponent from $1.5$ to
approximately $1.3$, but there is so far no theoretical explanation for this
change. Here we investigate the importance of timescales separation, by partly
abandoning it in various models. We achieve it by allowing for external input
during the avalanche, without compromising the separation of avalanches. We
develop an analytic treatment and provide numerical simulations of a simple
neuronal model.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03958</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal circuits formed in the brain are complex with intricate connection
patterns. Such a complexity is also observed in the retina as a relatively
simple neuronal circuit. A retinal ganglion cell receives excitatory inputs
from neurons in previous layers as driving forces to fire spikes. Analytical
methods are required that can decipher these components in a systematic manner.
Recently a method termed spike-triggered non-negative matrix factorization
(STNMF) has been proposed for this purpose. In this study, we extend the scope
of the STNMF method. By using the retinal ganglion cell as a model system, we
show that STNMF can detect various biophysical properties of upstream bipolar
cells, including spatial receptive fields, temporal filters, and transfer
nonlinearity. In addition, we recover synaptic connection strengths from the
weight matrix of STNMF. Furthermore, we show that STNMF can separate spikes of
a ganglion cell into a few subsets of spikes where each subset is contributed
by one presynaptic bipolar cell. Taken together, these results corroborate that
STNMF is a useful method for deciphering the structure of neuronal circuits.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A single coordinate framework for optic flow and binocular disparity. (arXiv:1808.03875v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03875</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Optic flow is two dimensional, but no special qualities are attached to one
or other of these dimensions. For binocular disparity, on the other hand, the
terms 'horizontal' and 'vertical' disparities are commonly used. This is odd,
since binocular disparity and optic flow describe essentially the same thing.
The difference is that, generally, people tend to fixate relatively close to
the direction of heading as they move, meaning that fixation is close to the
optic flow epipole, whereas, for binocular vision, fixation is close to the
head-centric midline, i.e. approximately 90 degrees from the binocular epipole.
For fixating animals, some separations of flow may lead to simple algorithms
for the judgement of surface structure and the control of action. We consider
the following canonical flow patterns that sum to produce overall flow: (i)
'towards' flow, the component of translational flow produced by approaching (or
retreating from) the fixated object, which produces pure radial flow on the
retina; (ii) 'sideways' flow, the remaining component of translational flow,
which is produced by translation of the optic centre orthogonal to the
cyclopean line of sight and (iii) 'vergence' flow, rotational flow produced by
a counter-rotation of the eye in order to maintain fixation. A general flow
pattern could also include (iv) 'cyclovergence' flow, produced by rotation of
one eye relative to the other about the line of sight. We consider some
practical advantages of dividing up flow in this way when an observer fixates
as they move. As in some previous treatments, we suggest that there are certain
tasks for which it is sensible to consider 'towards' flow as one component and
'sideways' + 'vergence' flow as another.

Manually curating biomedical knowledge from publications is necessary to build a knowledge based service that provides highly precise and organized information to users. The process of retrieving relevant publications for curation, which is also known as document triage, is usually carried out by querying and reading articles in PubMed. However, this query-based method often obtains unsatisfactory precision and recall on the retrieved results, and it is difficult to manually generate optimal queries. To address this, we propose a machine-learning assisted triage method. We collect previously curated publications from two databases UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog, and used them as a gold-standard dataset for training deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks. We then use the trained models to classify and rank new publications for curation. For evaluation, we apply our method to the real-world manual curation process of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and the GWAS Catalog. We demonstrate that our machine-assisted triage method outperforms the current query-based triage methods, improves efficiency, and enriches curated content. Our method achieves a precision 1.81 and 2.99 times higher than that obtained by the current query-based triage methods of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and the GWAS Catalog, respectively, without compromising recall. In fact, our method retrieves many additional relevant publications that the query-based method of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot could not find. As these results show, our machine learning-based method can make the triage process more efficient and is being implemented in production so that human curators can focus on more challenging tasks to improve the quality of knowledge bases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aibwa6AslVc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: SILGGM: An extensive R package for efficient statistical inference in large-scale gene networks</title>

Gene co-expression network analysis is extremely useful in interpreting a complex biological process. The recent droplet-based single-cell technology is able to generate much larger gene expression data routinely with thousands of samples and tens of thousands of genes. To analyze such a large-scale gene-gene network, remarkable progress has been made in rigorous statistical inference of high-dimensional Gaussian graphical model (GGM). These approaches provide a formal confidence interval or a p-value rather than only a single point estimator for conditional dependence of a gene pair and are more desirable for identifying reliable gene networks. To promote their widespread use, we herein introduce an extensive and efficient R package named SILGGM (Statistical Inference of Large-scale Gaussian Graphical Model) that includes four main approaches in statistical inference of high-dimensional GGM. Unlike the existing tools, SILGGM provides statistically efficient inference on both individual gene pair and whole-scale gene pairs. It has a novel and consistent false discovery rate (FDR) procedure in all four methodologies. Based on the user-friendly design, it provides outputs compatible with multiple platforms for interactive network visualization. Furthermore, comparisons in simulation illustrate that SILGGM can accelerate the existing MATLAB implementation to several orders of magnitudes and further improve the speed of the already very efficient R package FastGGM. Testing results from the simulated data confirm the validity of all the approaches in SILGGM even in a very large-scale setting with the number of variables or genes to a ten thousand level. We have also applied our package to a novel single-cell RNA-seq data set with pan T cells. The results show that the approaches in SILGGM significantly outperform the conventional ones in a biological sense. The package is freely available via CRAN at https://cran.r-project.org/package=SILGGM.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wSym8QD9qKk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Precise positioning of the cell division site is essential for the correct segregation of the genetic material into the two daughter cells. In the bacterium &lt;i&gt;Myxococcus xanthus&lt;/i&gt;, the proteins PomX and PomY form a cluster on the chromosome that performs a biased random walk to midcell and positively regulates cell division there. PomZ, an ATPase, is necessary for tethering of the cluster to the nucleoid and regulates its movement towards midcell. It has remained unclear how the cluster dynamics change when the biochemical parameters, such as the attachment rates of PomZ dimers to the nucleoid and the cluster, the ATP hydrolysis rate of PomZ or the mobility of PomZ interacting with the nucleoid and cluster, are varied. To answer these questions, we investigate a one-dimensional model that includes the nucleoid, the Pom cluster and PomZ proteins. We find that a mechanism based on the diffusive PomZ fluxes on the nucleoid into the cluster can explain the latter’s midnucleoid localization for a broad parameter range. Furthermore, there is an ATP hydrolysis rate that minimizes the time the cluster needs to reach midnucleoid. If the dynamics of PomZ on the nucleoid is slow relative to the cluster’s velocity, we observe oscillatory cluster movements around midnucleoid. To understand midnucleoid localization, we developed a semi-analytical approach that dissects the net movement of the cluster into its components: the difference in PomZ fluxes into the cluster from either side, the force exerted by a single PomZ dimer on the cluster and the effective friction coefficient of the cluster. Importantly, we predict that the Pom cluster oscillates around midnucleoid if the diffusivity of PomZ on the nucleoid is reduced. A similar approach to that applied here may also prove useful for cargo localization in ParAB&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt; systems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SKZXSeDaTnk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Ribosome profiling is a powerful technique used to study translation at the genome-wide level, generating unique information concerning ribosome positions along RNAs. Optimal localization of ribosomes requires the proper identification of the ribosome P-site in each ribosome protected fragment, a crucial step to determine the trinucleotide periodicity of translating ribosomes, and draw correct conclusions concerning where ribosomes are located. To determine the P-site within ribosome footprints at nucleotide resolution, the precise estimation of its offset with respect to the protected fragment is necessary. Here we present riboWaltz, an R package for calculation of optimal P-site offsets, diagnostic analysis and visual inspection of ribosome profiling data. Compared to existing tools, riboWaltz shows improved accuracies for P-site estimation and neat ribosome positioning in multiple case studies. riboWaltz was implemented in R and is available as an R package at https://github.com/LabTranslationalArchitectomics/RiboWaltz.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OhaOvd6bTyU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: State-Dependent Modification of Sensory Sensitivity via Modulation of Backpropagating Action Potentials</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0283-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Neuromodulators play a critical role in sensorimotor processing via various actions, including pre- and postsynaptic signal modulation and direct modulation of signal encoding in peripheral dendrites. Here we present a new mechanism that allows state-dependent modulation of signal encoding in sensory dendrites by neuromodulatory projection neurons. We studied the impact of antidromic action potentials (APs) on stimulus encoding using the anterior gastric receptor (AGR) neuron in the heavily modulated crustacean stomatogastric ganglion. We found that ectopic AP initiation in AGR's axon trunk is under direct neuromodulatory control by the inferior ventricular (IV) neurons, a pair of descending projection neurons. IV neuron activation elicited a long-lasting decrease in AGR ectopic activity. This modulation was specific to the site of AP initiation and could be mimicked by focal application of the IV neuron co-transmitter histamine. IV neuron actions were diminished after blocking H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in AGR's axon trunk, suggesting a direct axonal modulation. This local modulation did not affect the propagation dynamics of en-passant APs. However, decreases in ectopic AP frequency prolonged sensory bursts elicited distantly near AGR's dendrites. This frequency-dependent effect was mediated via the reduction of antidromic APs, and the diminishment of backpropagation into the sensory dendrites. Computational models suggest that invading antidromic APs interact with local ionic conductances the rate constants of which determine the sign and strength of the frequency-dependent change in sensory sensitivity. Antidromic APs therefore provide descending projection neurons with a means to influence sensory encoding without affecting AP propagation or stimulus transduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Descending modulatory projection neurons are a hallmark of motor systems and fundamentally involved in sensorimotor processing. While they have been shown to interact on many levels with motor networks to dynamically and rapidly adjust motor and behavioral output, their actions on sensory neurons are not well understood. We found that descending projection neurons directly modulate action potential initiation in a sensory axon, diminishing the frequency of spontaneously generated ectopic action potentials that propagate antidromically into peripheral sensory dendrites. Changes in the frequency of these backpropagating action potentials determined the response of the sensory neuron to sensory stimuli. This suggests that descending projection neurons modulate sensory encoding by altering axonal membrane excitability and the frequency of antidromic action potential initiation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Early Targeting of L-Selectin on Leukocytes Promotes Recovery after Spinal Cord Injury, Implicating Novel Mechanisms of Pathogenesis</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0101-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;L-selectin, a lectin-like receptor on all leukocyte classes, functions in adhesive and signaling roles in the recruitment of myeloid cells from the blood to sites of inflammation. Herein, we consider L-selectin as a determinant of neurological recovery in a murine model of spinal cord injury. Spinal cord-injured, L-selectin knockout mice (male) showed improved long-term recovery with greater white matter sparing relative to wildtype mice and reduced oxidative stress in the injured cord at 72 hours post-spinal cord injury. There was a partial and transient reduction in accumulation of neutrophils in the injured spinal cords of knockouts at 24 hours post-injury. To complement these findings with knockout mice, we sought a pharmacologic means for lowering L-selectin levels. We found that diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, induced the shedding of L-selectin from the cell surface of myeloid subsets, specifically neutrophils and non-classical monocytes, in the blood and the injured spinal cord. Diclofenac administration to injured wildtype mice enhanced neurological recovery to a level comparable to that of knockouts but did not improve recovery in knockouts. While diclofenac treatment had no effect on myeloid cell accumulation, there was a reduction in oxidative stress at 72 hours post-spinal cord injury. These findings implicate L-selectin in secondary pathogenesis beyond a role in leukocyte recruitment and raise the possibility of repurposing diclofenac for the treatment of spinal cord injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; In this study, we establish L-selectin, an adhesion and signaling receptor on immune cells, as a determinant of long-term recovery and tissue sparing after spinal cord injury. We demonstrate that L-selectin contributes to secondary pathogenesis during acute inflammation, and implicate L-selectin in novel roles other than recruitment. We also report a strategy to improve recovery by employing diclofenac, an FDA-approved NSAID that induces the shedding of L-selectin from the surface of innate immune cells. Our findings demonstrate a critical time-period for anti-inflammatory intervention in a murine model of spinal cord injury and suggest that diclofenac be tested as an acute therapy for attenuating neurologic deficits following spinal cord injury in humans.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Differentiation in Theta and Beta Electrocortical Activity between Visual and Physical Perturbations to Walking and Standing Balance</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/4/ENEURO.0207-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human balance is a complex process in healthy adults, requiring precisely timed coordination among sensory information, cognitive processing, and motor control. It has been difficult to quantify brain dynamics during human balance control due to limitations in brain-imaging modalities. The goal of this study was to determine whether by using high-density electroencephalography (EEG) and independent component analysis, we can identify common cortical responses to visual and physical balance perturbations during walking and standing. We studied the responses of 30 healthy young adults to sensorimotor perturbations that challenged their balance. Subjects performed four 10 min trials of beam walking and tandem stance while either being mediolaterally pulled at the waist or viewing brief 20° field-of-view rotations in virtual reality. We recorded high-density EEG, motion capture, lower leg electromyography (EMG), and neck EMG. We hypothesized that both physical pull and visual rotation perturbations would elicit time–frequency fluctuations in theta (4–8 Hz) and beta (13–30 Hz) bands, with increased occipito-parietal activity during visual rotations compared with pull perturbations. Our results confirmed this hypothesis. For both perturbations, we found early theta synchronization and late alpha–beta (8–30 Hz) desynchronization following perturbation onset. This pattern was strongest in occipito-parietal areas during visual perturbations and strongest in sensorimotor areas during pull perturbations. These results suggest a similar time–frequency electrocortical pattern when humans respond to sensorimotor conflict, but with substantive differences in the brain areas involved for visual versus physical perturbations. Our findings may have important implications for assessing and training balance in individuals with and without motor disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Novel Quantitative Analyses of Spontaneous Synaptic Events in Cortical Pyramidal Cells Reveal Subtle Parvalbumin-Expressing Interneuron Dysfunction in a Knock-In Mouse Model of Alzheimers Disease</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/4/ENEURO.0059-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that has become a compelling global public health concern. Besides pathological hallmarks such as extracellular amyloid plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and loss of neurons and synapses, clinical reports have shown that epileptiform activity, even seizures, can occur early in the disease. Aberrant synaptic and network activities as well as epileptiform discharges have also been observed in various mouse models of AD. The new &lt;i&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mouse model is generated by a gene knock-in approach and there are limited studies on basic synaptic properties in &lt;i&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice. Therefore, we applied quantitative methods to analyze spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory synaptic events in parietal cortex layer 2/3 pyramidal cells. First, by an objective amplitude distribution analysis, we found decreased amplitudes of spontaneous IPSCs (sIPSCs) in aged &lt;i&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice caused by a reduction in the amplitudes of the large sIPSCs with fast rates of rise, consistent with deficits in the function of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PV INs). Second, we calculated the burstiness and memory in a series of successive synaptic events. Lastly, by using a novel approach to determine the excitation-to-inhibition (E/I) ratio, we found no changes in the &lt;i&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice, indicating that homeostatic mechanisms may have maintained the overall balance of excitation and inhibition in spite of a mildly impaired PV IN function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We propose a novel Coupled Hidden Markov Model to detect epileptic seizures
in multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) data. Our model defines a network
of seizure propagation paths to capture both the temporal and spatial evolution
of epileptic activity. To address the intractability introduced by the coupled
interactions, we derive a variational inference procedure to efficiently infer
the seizure evolution from spectral patterns in the EEG data. We validate our
model on EEG aquired under clinical conditions in the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit
of the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Using 5-fold cross validation, we demonstrate
that our model outperforms three baseline approaches which rely on a classical
detection framework. Our model also demonstrates the potential to localize
seizure onset zones in focal epilepsy.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03357</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We introduce Error Forward-Propagation, a biologically plausible mechanism to
propagate error feedback forward through the network. Architectural constraints
on connectivity are virtually eliminated for error feedback in the brain;
systematic backward connectivity is not used or needed to deliver error
feedback. Feedback as a means of assigning credit to neurons earlier in the
forward pathway for their contribution to the final output is thought to be
used in learning in the brain. How the brain solves the credit assignment
problem is unclear. In machine learning, error backpropagation is a highly
successful mechanism for credit assignment in deep multilayered networks.
Backpropagation requires symmetric reciprocal connectivity for every neuron.
From a biological perspective, there is no evidence of such an architectural
constraint, which makes backpropagation implausible for learning in the brain.
This architectural constraint is reduced with the use of random feedback
weights. Models using random feedback weights require backward connectivity
patterns for every neuron, but avoid symmetric weights and reciprocal
connections. In this paper, we practically remove this architectural
constraint, requiring only a backward loop connection for effective error
feedback. We propose reusing the forward connections to deliver the error
feedback by feeding the outputs into the input receiving layer. This mechanism,
Error Forward-Propagation, is a plausible basis for how error feedback occurs
deep in the brain independent of and yet in support of the functionality
underlying intricate network architectures. We show experimentally that
recurrent neural networks with two and three hidden layers can be trained using
Error Forward-Propagation on the MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets, achieving
$1.90\%$ and $11\%$ generalization errors respectively.

	<content:encoded>Although the primate posterior parietal cortex (PPC) has been largely associated with space, attention, and action-related processing, a growing number of studies have reported the direct representation of a diverse array of action-independent nonspatial visual information in the PPC during both perception and visual working memory. By describing the distinctions and the close interactions of visual representation with space, attention, and action-related processing in the PPC, here I propose that we may understand these diverse PPC functions together through the unique contribution of the PPC to adaptive visual processing and form a more integrated and structured view of the role of the PPC in vision, cognition, and action.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Understanding the neural underpinnings of vocal–motor control in humans and other animals remains a major challenge in neurobiology. The Lombard effect – a rise in call amplitude in response to background noise – has been demonstrated in a wide range of vertebrates. Here, we review both behavioral and neurophysiological data and propose that the Lombard effect is driven by a subcortical neural network, which can be modulated by cortical processes. The proposed framework offers mechanistic explanations for two fundamental features of the Lombard effect: its widespread taxonomic distribution across the vertebrate phylogenetic tree and the widely observed variations in compensation magnitude.</content:encoded>

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology allows researchers to profile the transcriptomes of thousands of cells simultaneously. Protocols that incorporate both designed and random barcodes have greatly increased the throughput of scRNA-seq, but give rise to a more complex data structure. There is a need for new tools that can handle the various barcoding strategies used by different protocols and exploit this information for quality assessment at the sample-level and provide effective visualization of these results in preparation for higher-level analyses. To this end, we developed &lt;i&gt;scPipe&lt;/i&gt;, an R/Bioconductor package that integrates barcode demultiplexing, read alignment, UMI-aware gene-level quantification and quality control of raw sequencing data generated by multiple protocols that include CEL-seq, MARS-seq, Chromium 10X, Drop-seq and Smart-seq. &lt;i&gt;scPipe&lt;/i&gt; produces a count matrix that is essential for downstream analysis along with an HTML report that summarises data quality. These results can be used as input for downstream analyses including normalization, visualization and statistical testing. &lt;i&gt;scPipe&lt;/i&gt; performs this processing in a few simple R commands, promoting reproducible analysis of single-cell data that is compatible with the emerging suite of open-source scRNA-seq analysis tools available in R/Bioconductor and beyond. The &lt;i&gt;scPipe&lt;/i&gt; R package is available for download from https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/scPipe.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SlKOJy98vdo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Discerning evolutionary trends in post-translational modification and the effect of intrinsic disorder: Analysis of methylation, acetylation and ubiquitination sites in human proteins</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/AVRbsaFgEhA/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Mohanalakshmi Narasumani, Paul M. Harrison&lt;/p&gt;

Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of proteins play significant biological functional roles despite lacking a well-defined 3D structure. For example, IDRs provide efficient housing for large numbers of post-translational modification (PTM) sites in eukaryotic proteins. Here, we study the distribution of more than 15,000 experimentally determined human methylation, acetylation and ubiquitination sites (collectively termed ‘MAU’ sites) in ordered and disordered regions, and analyse their conservation across 380 eukaryotic species. Conservation signals for the maintenance and novel emergence of MAU sites are examined at 11 evolutionary levels from the whole eukaryotic domain down to the ape superfamily, in both ordered and disordered regions. We discover that MAU PTM is a major driver of conservation for arginines and lysines in both ordered and disordered regions, across the 11 levels, most significantly across the mammalian clade. Conservation of human methylatable arginines is very strongly favoured for ordered regions rather than for disordered, whereas methylatable lysines are conserved in either set of regions, and conservation of acetylatable and ubiquitinatable lysines is favoured in disordered over ordered. Notably, we find evidence for the emergence of new lysine MAU sites in disordered regions of proteins in deuterostomes and mammals, and in ordered regions after the dawn of eutherians. For histones specifically, MAU sites demonstrate an idiosyncratic significant conservation pattern that is evident since the last common ancestor of mammals. Similarly, folding-on-binding (FB) regions are highly enriched for MAU sites relative to either ordered or disordered regions, with ubiquitination sites in FBs being highly conserved at all evolutionary levels back as far as mammals. This investigation clearly demonstrates the complex patterns of PTM evolution across the human proteome and that it is necessary to consider conservation of sequence features at multiple evolutionary levels in order not to get an incomplete or misleading picture.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AVRbsaFgEhA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Modeling subjective relevance in schizophrenia and its relation to aberrant salience</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/njS8vXy7zbs/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Teresa Katthagen, Christoph Mathys, Lorenz Deserno, Henrik Walter, Norbert Kathmann, Andreas Heinz, Florian Schlagenhauf&lt;/p&gt;

In schizophrenia, increased aberrant salience to irrelevant events and reduced learning of relevant information may relate to an underlying deficit in relevance detection. So far, subjective estimates of relevance have not been probed in schizophrenia patients. The mechanisms underlying belief formation about relevance and their translation into decisions are unclear. Using novel computational methods, we investigated relevance detection during implicit learning in 42 schizophrenia patients and 42 healthy individuals. Participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while detecting the outcomes in a learning task. These were preceded by cues differing in color and shape, which were either relevant or irrelevant for outcome prediction. We provided a novel definition of relevance based on Bayesian precision and modeled reaction times as a function of relevance weighted unsigned prediction errors (UPE). For aberrant salience, we assessed responses to subjectively irrelevant cue manifestations. Participants learned the contingencies and slowed down their responses following unexpected events. Model selection revealed that individuals inferred the relevance of cue features and used it for behavioral adaption to the relevant cue feature. Relevance weighted UPEs correlated with dorsal anterior cingulate cortex activation and hippocampus deactivation. In patients, the aberrant salience bias to subjectively task-irrelevant information was increased and correlated with decreased striatal UPE activation and increased negative symptoms. This study shows that relevance estimates based on Bayesian precision can be inferred from observed behavior. This underscores the importance of relevance detection as an underlying mechanism for behavioral adaptation in complex environments and enhances the understanding of aberrant salience in schizophrenia.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/njS8vXy7zbs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Motivation Modulates Brain Networks in Response to Faces Varying in Race and Status: A Multivariate Approach</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0039-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Previous behavioral and neuroimaging work indicates that individuals who are externally motivated to respond without racial prejudice tend not to spontaneously regulate their prejudice and prefer to focus on non-racial attributes when evaluating others. This fMRI multivariate analysis used Partial Least Squares (PLS) to examine the distributed neural processing of race and a relevant but ostensibly non-racial attribute (viz., socioeconomic status) as a function of the perceiver’s external motivation. Sixty-one White male participants (&lt;i&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/i&gt;) privately formed impressions of Black and White male faces ascribed with high or low status. Across all conditions, greater external motivation was associated with reduced co-activation of brain regions believed to support emotion regulation (rostral anterior cingulate cortex), introspection (middle cingulate), and social cognition (temporal pole, medial prefrontal cortex). The reduced involvement of this network irrespective of target race and status suggests that external motivation is related to the participant’s overall approach to impression formation in an interracial context. The findings highlight the importance of examining network co-activation in understanding the role of external motivation in impression formation, among other interracial social processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; This multivariate fMRI analysis examined distributed neural processing as participants formed impressions of faces varying in race and status. Across all conditions, participants reporting greater external motivation to respond without racial prejudice showed reduced co-activation in brain regions believed to support emotion regulation, introspection, and social cognition. These results suggest that external motivation may calibrate how perceivers form impressions in an interracial context, irrespective of target race. Results from this analysis raise new questions that may not have readily emerged in studies relying on traditional behavioral and univariate fMRI analyses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Evolutionary optimisation of neural network models for fish collective behaviours in mixed groups of robots and zebrafish. (arXiv:1808.03166v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03166</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Animal and robot social interactions are interesting both for ethological
studies and robotics. On the one hand, the robots can be tools and models to
analyse animal collective behaviours, on the other hand, the robots and their
artificial intelligence are directly confronted and compared to the natural
animal collective intelligence. The first step is to design robots and their
behavioural controllers that are capable of socially interact with animals.
Designing such behavioural bio-mimetic controllers remains an important
challenge as they have to reproduce the animal behaviours and have to be
calibrated on experimental data. Most animal collective behavioural models are
designed by modellers based on experimental data. This process is long and
costly because it is difficult to identify the relevant behavioural features
that are then used as a priori knowledge in model building. Here, we want to
model the fish individual and collective behaviours in order to develop robot
controllers. We explore the use of optimised black-box models based on
artificial neural networks (ANN) to model fish behaviours. While the ANN may
not be biomimetic but rather bio-inspired, they can be used to link perception
to motor responses. These models are designed to be implementable as robot
controllers to form mixed-groups of fish and robots, using few a priori
knowledge of the fish behaviours. We present a methodology with multilayer
perceptron or echo state networks that are optimised through evolutionary
algorithms to model accurately the fish individual and collective behaviours in
a bounded rectangular arena. We assess the biomimetism of the generated models
and compare them to the fish experimental behaviours.

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Targeting the Mouse Ventral Hippocampus in the Intrahippocampal Kainic Acid Model of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/4/ENEURO.0158-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Here we describe a novel mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) that moves the site of kainate injection from the rodent dorsal hippocampus (corresponding to the human posterior hippocampus) to the ventral hippocampus (corresponding to the human anterior hippocampus). We compare the phenotypes of this new model—with respect to seizures, cognitive impairment, affective deficits, and histopathology—to the standard dorsal intrahippocampal kainate model. Our results demonstrate that histopathological measures of granule cell dispersion and mossy fiber sprouting maximize near the site of kainate injection. Somewhat surprisingly, both the dorsal and ventral models exhibit similar spatial memory impairments in addition to similar electrographic and behavioral seizure burdens. In contrast, we find a more pronounced affective (anhedonic) phenotype specifically in the ventral model. These results demonstrate that the ventral intrahippocampal kainic acid model recapitulates critical pathologies of the dorsal model while providing a means to further study affective phenotypes such as depression in TLE.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Wakefulness Is Promoted during Day Time by PDFR Signalling to Dopaminergic Neurons in Drosophila melanogaster</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/4/ENEURO.0129-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Circadian clocks modulate timing of sleep/wake cycles in animals; however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;, large ventral lateral neurons (l-LN&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;) are known to promote wakefulness through the action of the neuropeptide pigment dispersing factor (PDF), but the downstream targets of PDF signalling remain elusive. In a screen using downregulation or overexpression (OEX) of the gene encoding PDF receptor (&lt;i&gt;pdfr&lt;/i&gt;), we found that a subset of dopaminergic neurons responds to PDF to promote wakefulness during the day. Moreover, we found that small LN&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; (s-LN&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;) and dopaminergic neurons form synaptic contacts, and PDFR signalling inhibited dopaminergic neurons specifically during day time. We propose that these dopaminergic neurons that respond to PDFR signalling are sleep-promoting and that during the day when PDF levels are high, they are inhibited, thereby promoting wakefulness. Thus, we identify a novel circadian clock pathway that mediates wake promotion specifically during day time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Characterization of Tissue Plasminogen Activator Expression and Trafficking in the Adult Murine Brain</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/4/ENEURO.0119-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is an immediate-early gene important for regulating physiological processes like synaptic plasticity and neurovascular coupling. It has also been implicated in several pathological processes including blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, seizure progression, and stroke. These varied reports suggest that tPA is a pleiotropic mediator whose actions are highly compartmentalized in space and time. The specific localization of tPA, therefore, can provide useful information about its function. Accordingly, the goal of this study was to provide a detailed characterization of tPA’s regional, cellular, and subcellular localization in the brain. To achieve this, two new transgenic mouse lines were utilized: (1) a PlatβGAL reporter mouse, which houses the β-galactosidase gene in the tPA locus and (2) a tPA&lt;sup&gt;BAC&lt;/sup&gt;-Cerulean mouse, which has a cerulean-fluorescent protein fused in-frame to the tPA C-terminus. Using these two transgenic reporters, we show that while tPA is expressed throughout most regions of the adult murine brain, it appears to be preferentially targeted to fiber tracts in the limbic system. In the hippocampus, confocal microscopy revealed tPA-Cerulean (tPA-Cer) puncta localized to giant mossy fiber boutons (MFBs) and astrocytes in stratum lucidum. With amplification of the tPA-Cer signal, somatically localized tPA was also observed in the stratum oriens (SO)/alveus layer of both CA1 and CA3 subfields. Coimmunostaining of tPA-Cer and interneuronal markers indicates that these tPA-positive cell bodies belong to a subclass of somatostatin (SST)/oriens-lacunosum moleculare (O-LM) interneurons. Together, these data imply that tPA’s localization is differentially regulated, suggesting that its neuromodulatory effects may be compartmentalized and specialized to cell type.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Interlimb Generalization of Learned Bayesian Visuomotor Prior Occurs in Extrinsic Coordinates</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/4/ENEURO.0183-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent work suggests that the brain represents probability distributions and performs Bayesian integration during sensorimotor learning. However, our understanding of the neural representation of this learning remains limited. To begin to address this, we performed two experiments. In the first experiment, we replicated the key behavioral findings of Körding and Wolpert (2004), demonstrating that humans can perform in a Bayes-optimal manner by combining information about their own sensory uncertainty and a statistical distribution of lateral shifts encountered in a visuomotor adaptation task. In the second experiment, we extended these findings by testing whether visuomotor learning occurring during the same task generalizes from one limb to the other, and relatedly, whether this learning is represented in an extrinsic or intrinsic reference frame. We found that the learned mean of the distribution of visuomotor shifts generalizes to the opposite limb only when the perturbation is congruent in extrinsic coordinates, indicating that the underlying representation of learning acquired during training is available to the untrained limb and is coded in an extrinsic reference frame.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Sodium Channel-Dependent and -Independent Mechanisms Underlying Axonal Afterdepolarization at Mouse Hippocampal Mossy Fibers</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0254-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Action potentials propagating along axons are often followed by prolonged afterdepolarization (ADP) lasting for several tens of milliseconds. Axonal ADP is thought to be an important factor in modulating the fidelity of spike propagation during repetitive firings. However, the mechanism as well as the functional significance of axonal ADP remain unclear, partly due to inaccessibility to small structures of axon for direct electrophysiological recordings. Here, we examined the ionic and electrical mechanisms underlying axonal ADP using whole-bouton recording from mossy fiber terminals in mice hippocampal slices. ADP following axonal action potentials was strongly enhanced by focal application of veratridine, an inhibitor of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel inactivation. On the contrary, tetrodotoxin (TTX) partly suppressed ADP, suggesting that a Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel-dependent component is involved in axonal ADP. The remaining TTX-resistant Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel-independent component represents slow capacitive discharge reflecting the shape and electrical properties of the axonal membrane. We also addressed the functional impact of axonal ADP on presynaptic function. In paired-pulse stimuli, we found that axonal ADP minimally affected the peak height of subsequent action potentials, although the rising phase of action potentials was slightly slowed, possibly due to steady-state inactivation of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels by prolonged depolarization. Voltage clamp analysis of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; current elicited by action potential waveform commands revealed that axonal ADP assists short-term facilitation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry into the presynaptic terminals. Taken together, axonal ADP maintains reliable firing during repetitive stimuli and plays important roles in the fine-tuning of short-term plasticity of transmitter release by modulating Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry into presynaptic terminals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Axonal action potentials are often followed by depolarizing or hyperpolarizing afterpotentials. This study illuminated the mechanisms of ADP in the hippocampal mossy fibers, where morphologic as well as biophysical data were accumulated. We found that slow activating Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels are partly involved in ADP. Capacitive components also substantially contribute to ADP, suggesting that axonal shape and electrical properties are optimized for high-fidelity propagation during repetitive stimuli. We also tested the roles of ADP in the activity-dependent tuning of the presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; current. Action potential-driven Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry into the axon terminals was facilitated by paired stimuli, possibly due to Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; current facilitation by ADP. Therefore, ADP contributes to fine-tuning of transmitter release and ensures high-fidelity spiking of axons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Here, we review new studies showing evidence for diverse allele-specific expression and epigenetic states in mammalian brain cells, which suggest that diploidy expands the landscape of gene regulatory and expression programs in cells.

However, new studies show novel genomic imprinting effects that are brain-region-, cell-type- and age-dependent.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Artificial restoration of touch is an active area of research in neuroprosthetics. However, most approaches do not consider emulating the biological machinery they intend to replace.

	<content:encoded>How are synaptic vesicles tied together in a nerve terminal? A recent study by Milovanovic and colleagues offers a new mechanism for this old and important problem: synapsin proteins establish a liquid phase that clusters vesicles. Liquid–liquid phase separation provides a fluid-like state that accommodates the dynamic demands of presynaptic vesicle traffic.</content:encoded>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: In Search of an Identity for Amyloid Plaques</title>
	<link>https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(18)30160-7?rss=yes</link>
	<content:encoded>In 1984, biochemists George Glenner and Caine Wong, in search of ‘a unique amyloid fibril precursor protein in the serum’ of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients, successfully isolated and sequenced the first 24 amino acids of a ‘cerebrovascular amyloid fibril protein β’ that we now know as the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide. This landmark paper laid the foundation for extensive research in the following decades that ultimately established the role of β-amyloidosis as a player in the pathogenesis of AD.</content:encoded>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Synaptic Receptor Diversity Revealed Across Space and Time</title>
	<link>https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(18)30159-0?rss=yes</link>
	<content:encoded>In their 1994 paper, Monyer et al. described unique functional properties and cell type-specific expression of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) GluN2 subunits, suggesting that the roles of NMDAR vary across brain regions and throughout development. This influential work not only provided insight into how molecular diversity impacts synapse function, but also continues to inform new approaches for modulating brain circuits.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(18)30157-7?rss=yes</link>
	<content:encoded>Kynurenines, the major degradative products of the essential amino acid tryptophan, may play critical roles in the pathophysiology of depressive disorders. In 2014, Agudelo and colleagues reported that exercise indirectly modulates the metabolism of kynurenines in skeletal muscle, which in turn influences the brain and enhances resilience to depression.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(18)30141-3?rss=yes</link>
	<content:encoded>In 2004, Prinz et al. demonstrated that almost indistinguishable network activity can arise from widely different sets of underlying membrane and synaptic parameters, and, thus, likely arise from different cellular and network mechanisms. This now broadly accepted principle guides research into individual variation in neuronal and synaptic properties, and their homeostatic regulation.</content:encoded>
