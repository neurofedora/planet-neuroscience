	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Sex-and Region-Dependent Expression of the Autism-Linked ADNP Correlates with Social- and Speech-Related Genes in the Canary Brain</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-020-01700-x</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ADNP&lt;/em&gt;) syndrome is an autistic-like disorder, instigated by mutations in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ADNP&lt;/em&gt;. This syndrome is characterized by developmental delays, impairments in speech, motor function, abnormal hearing, and intellectual disabilities. In the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Adnp&lt;/em&gt;-haploinsufficient mouse model, many of these impediments are evident, appearing in a sex-dependent manner. In zebra finch songbird (ZF; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Taeniopygia guttata&lt;/em&gt;), an animal model used for song/language studies, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ADNP&lt;/em&gt; mRNA most robust expression is observed in the cerebrum of young males, potentially corroborating with male ZF exclusive singing behavior and developed cerebral song system. Herein, we report a similar sex-dependent &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ADNP&lt;/em&gt; expression profile, with the highest expression in the cerebrum (qRT-PCR) in the brain of another songbird, the domesticated canary (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Serinus canaria domestica&lt;/em&gt;). Additional analyses for the mRNA transcripts of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ADNP&lt;/em&gt; regulator, vasoactive intestinal peptide (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;VIP&lt;/em&gt;), sister gene &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ADNP2&lt;/em&gt;, and speech-related Forkhead box protein P2 (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;FoxP2&lt;/em&gt;) revealed multiple sex and brain region–dependent positive correlations between the genes (including &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ADNP&lt;/em&gt;). Parallel transcript expression patterns for &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;FoxP2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;VIP&lt;/em&gt; were observed alongside specific &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;FoxP2&lt;/em&gt; increase in males compared with females as well as &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;VIP/ADNP2&lt;/em&gt; correlations. In spatial view, a sexually independent extensive form of expression was found for &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ADNP&lt;/em&gt; in the canary cerebrum (RNA in situ hybridization). The songbird cerebral mesopallium area stood out as a potentially high-expressing &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ADNP&lt;/em&gt; tissue, further strengthening the association of ADNP with sense integration and auditory memory formation, previously implicated in mouse and human.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Identification of Hub Genes in Atypical Teratoid/Rhabdoid Tumor by Bioinformatics Analyses</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-020-01587-8</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (ATRT) is a devastating intracranial tumor in children. Currently, its molecular mechanisms cannot be studied effectively because patient samples are limited, and many factors are involved in its pathogenesis. In this study, we analyzed three gene expression profile data sets obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to identify genes that participate in ATRT. The datasets were integrated and analyzed using the RobustRankAggreg method to screen for differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We identified 197 DEGs, including 94 downregulated and 103 upregulated genes which were then used for gene set enrichment analysis. The results showed that the downregulated genes were mainly enriched in synaptic vesicle cycle, nicotine addiction, and GABAergic synapse, whereas the upregulated genes were enriched in the cell cycle, p53 signaling pathway, and cellular senescence. Consistent with these results, gene set enrichment analysis showed that E2F targets, G2M checkpoints, and MYC targets were significantly enriched in datasets. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network revealed that CDK1, CCNA2, BUB1B, CDC20, KIF11, KIF20A, KIF2C, NCAPG, NDC80, NUSAP1, PBK, RRM2, TPX2, TOP2A, and TTK were hub genes. NetworkAnalyst algorithm was used to predict the transcription factor (TF), and the results showed that MYC, SOX2, and KDM5B could regulate these hub genes. In conclusion, the present study brings a new perspective of ATRT pathogenesis and the strategy targeted to cell cycle related gene may be promising treatments for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study aimed to explore the implication of circular RNA (circRNA) expression profiles in spinal cord injury (SCI) rats at the immediate phase. CircRNA expression profiles in spinal cord samples from five SCI rats at the immediate phase (2 h post SCI) and five sham control (Ctrl) rats were assessed by microarray analysis. Subsequently, ten candidate circRNAs (obtained from microarray analysis) were validated in ten SCI rats at the immediate phase and ten Ctrl rats by the reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). PCA plots and heatmap analyses revealed that circRNA expression profiles could distinguish SCI rats at the immediate phase from Ctrl rats. Furthermore, 1101 circRNAs were upregulated and 897 circRNAs were downregulated in SCI rats at the immediate phase compared with Ctrl rats. These dysregulated circRNAs distributed on all chromosomes, and most of them located on chromosome 1–10. As for circRNA types, most of these dysregulated circRNAs were exonic. Additionally, enrichment analyses displayed that these dysregulated circRNAs were enriched in multiple signaling pathways related to neuronal signal transduction, immunity, and inflammation, such as the calcium signaling pathway, JAK-STAT signaling pathway, and MAPK signaling pathway. Using RT-qPCR, eight out of ten candidate circRNAs (including rno_circRNA_011690, rno_circRNA_011494, rno_circRNA_005470, rno_circRNA_014301, rno_circRNA_009608, rno_circRNA_016031, rno_circRNA_011497, and rno_circRNA_015152) were dysregulated in SCI rats at the immediate phase compared with Ctrl rats. Our study provides a valuable reference for circRNA expression profiles in SCI rats at the immediate phase, which offers new clues for investigating mechanisms underlying the immediate phase and possible early intervention targets of SCI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Schizophrenia (SZ) is a complex and severe psychiatric disorder, which has a global lifetime prevalence of 0.4% and a heritability of around 0.81. A number of epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) have been carried out for SZ, with discordant results. The main aim of this study was to carry out an integrative in silico analysis of available genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in schizophrenia. In this work, an integration of multiple lines of evidence (top candidate genes from several EWAS and genome-wide expression and association data) was carried out, in order to identify top differentially methylated (DM) genes for SZ. In addition, functional enrichment and protein-protein interaction analyses were carried out. Several top differentially methylated genes, such as &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;APC, CACNB2,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PRKN,&lt;/em&gt; were found, and an enrichment of binding sites for brain-expressed transcription factors, such as &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;FOXO1, MYB,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ZIC3&lt;/em&gt;, was also observed. Moreover, a protein-protein interaction network showed a central role for &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;DISC1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ZNF688&lt;/em&gt; genes, and experimentally validated targets of MIR-137, such as and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;KCNB2, NRXN1,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SYN2&lt;/em&gt;, were identified among DM genes. This is the first integrative in silico analysis of available genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in schizophrenia. This work identified novel candidate genes and pathways for SZ and provides the basis to explore their role in the pathogenesis of SZ in future studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Suicidal behavior as a psychological problem with high public health burden is associated with a number of genetically determined risk factors. In the current study, we investigated the association between two polymorphisms within the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;NINJ2&lt;/em&gt; gene and risk of suicide in an Iranian population. The study included 295 individuals who attempted suicide with soft suicide methods, 234 suicide victims and 410 normal controls. The rs11833579 SNP was associated with death from suicide in a codominant model in that the AG genotype decreased the risk of death from suicide compared with the GG genotype (OR (95% CI) = 0.49 (0.34–0.71), adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 4e−04). This SNP was also associated with death from suicide in dominant (AG + AA versus GG: OR (95% CI) = 0.63 (0.46–0.87), adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.011) and overdominant (AG versus GG + AA: OR (95% CI) = 0.49 (0.35–0.69), adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value &amp;lt; 0.0001) models. In addition, this SNP was associated with soft suicide attempts in a codominant model (AG versus AA + GG: OR (95% CI) = 0.7 (0.5–0.98), adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.02). The rs3806263 SNP was associated with death from suicide in allelic (A versus G: OR (95% CI) = 1.48 (1.17–1.88), adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.002), codominant (AA versus GG: OR (95% CI) = 3.14 (1.89–5.21), adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value &amp;lt; 0.0001), recessive (AA versus GG + AG: OR (95% CI) = 3.47 (2.15–5.61), adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value &amp;lt; 0.0001), overdominant (AG versus AA + GG: OR (95% CI) = 0.62 (0.45–0.87), adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.0092) and log-additive models (OR (95% CI) = 1.45 (1.15–1.83), adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.0034). When comparing allele/genotype frequencies of this SNP between suicide victims and soft suicide attempters, significant associations were found in allelic, codominant, recessive and log-additive models. The AG haplotype (rs11833579 and rs3806263, respectively) was significantly less prevalent among suicide victims compared with controls (OR (95% CI) = 0.37 (0.26–0.52), adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value &amp;lt; 0.0001). This haplotype was also less prevalent among suicide victims vs. soft suicide attempters (OR (95% CI) = 0.43 (0.31–0.61), adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value &amp;lt; 0.0001). The GA haplotype (rs11833579 and rs3806263, respectively) was less frequent among suicide victims compared with controls (OR (95% CI) = 0.63 (0.45–0.89), adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.0156). Finally, the AA haplotype was more prevalent among suicide victims compared with both controls (OR (95% CI) = 2.37 (1.56–3.6), adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.0002) and soft suicide attempters (OR (95% CI) = 1.92 (1.32–2.78), adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.0012). Thus, these two SNPs might be regarded as genetic determinants of suicide risk in Iranian populations. Further studies in different populations are needed to verify these results.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The aim of this study was to determine the optimum frequency of electroacupuncture (EA) for the treatment of dysphagia after stroke. Male C57BL/6 J mice were randomly divided into five groups: normal, model, 2 Hz, 50 Hz, and 100 Hz groups. All mice received a photochemical ischemia, except the normal group. The EA parameters were 1 mA for 15 min, with different frequencies (2, 50, and 100 Hz) applied. After a three day treatment, neuronal activation was detected by the expression of c-Fos. A multi-channel electrophysiological technique was used to assess the discharge of contralateral neurons and the neuron types in each group. The concentration of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the contralateral neurons was also examined. In addition, the dysfunction of swallowing in mice was calculated according to the lick counts and the lick–lick interval within a certain period of time. The number of c-Fos neurons (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) and the expression of BDNF (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) increased after the 2 Hz EA treatment. The total frequency of neuron discharge in the 2 Hz group increased compared with the model group (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). The pattern of sorted neuron populations was similar between the normal and 2 Hz groups. Consistent with these results, the lick counts increased (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) and the lick–lick interval decreased after the 2 Hz EA treatment, which indicated a functional improvement in swallowing. These results indicated that the 2 Hz EA treatment had a good effect on dysphagia after stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;There are two major isoforms of NTRK2 (neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 2, or TrkB), full-length isoform with tyrosine kinase (TK) domain intact (+) and spliced isoform without tyrosine kinase domain (TK(−)). Within each isoform, there exist subtypes with minor modifications of the protein sequences. In human, the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;NTRK2&lt;/em&gt; mRNA transcripts encoding TK(+) have same 3′UTRs, while the transcripts encoding subtypes of NTRK2 TK(−) have two completely different 3′UTRs. In mouse, the mRNA transcripts encoding same NTRK2 protein sequence for either TK(+) or TK(−) have long or short 3′UTRs, respectively. The physiological functions of these different 3′UTRs are still unknown. Pilocarpine stimulation increased &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Ntrk2&lt;/em&gt; mRNA levels in soma, while the increase in synaptosome was smaller. FISH results further showed that mouse &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Ntrk2&lt;/em&gt; transcripts with different 3′UTRs were distributed differently in cultured cortical neurons. The transcripts with long 3′UTR were distributed more in apical dendrites compared with transcripts with short 3′UTR. Our results provide evidence of non-coding 3′UTR function in regulating mRNA distribution in neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Schizophrenia is a serious neurodevelopmental disorder. Genetics is an important factor leading to schizophrenia, but its exact role is still unclear. Many studies have focused on neurotransmitters and regulators that participate in the processes mediated by these neurotransmitters. Alcohol dehydrogenase may not only catalyze the oxidation of retinol and ethanol but also be involved in a variety of neurotransmitter metabolic pathways. Therefore, our study investigated whether &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ADH7&lt;/em&gt; gene variations in the Chinese Han population were associated with schizophrenia. Genomic DNA was extracted from a cohort of 275 schizophrenic patients (136 men and 139 women) and 313 healthy controls (160 men and 153 women) from the Northern Han Chinese population. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test and linkage disequilibrium analysis were performed. Differences in genotypes, alleles, and haplotypes between the schizophrenic and control groups were determined using the chi-square test and correlation analysis. The distribution of the CC + TT genotype of rs284787 was statistically different between the case and control groups (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.026, OR = 1.448); however, the difference disappeared after Bonferroni correction. Linkage analysis indicated that rs739147, rs284787, rs3805329, rs894369, rs3805331, and rs284786 were closely linked in one block. The haplotype analysis found no association between the composed haplotypes and the occurrence of schizophrenia. Our study showed that the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ADH7&lt;/em&gt; gene was not associated with the risk of schizophrenia. Additional studies with larger cohorts of different ethnicities are needed to validate our findings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been proposed as useful medical carriers in the field of regenerative medicine. This study aimed to assess the direct conjugation ability of retinoic acid (RA) with AuNPs and to develop a strategy to differentiate the human adipose-derived stromal/stem cells (hADSCs) into neurons using AuNPs-RA. The physical properties of this nanocarrier were characterized using FT-IR, TEM, and FE-SEM. Moreover, the efficiency of RA conjugation on AuNPs was determined at 99% using UV-Vis spectroscopy. According to the MTT assay, an RA concentration of 66 μM caused a 50% inhibition of cell viability and AuNPs were not cytotoxic in concentrations below 5 μg/ml. Real-time PCR and immunocytochemistry proved that AuNPs-RA is able to increase the expression of neuronal marker genes and the number of neuronal protein (GFAP and MAP2)-positive cells, 14 days post-induction of hADSCs. Taken together, these results confirmed that the AuNPs-RA promote the neuronal differentiation of hADSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Is Fertility Affected in Women of Childbearing Age with Multiple Sclerosis or Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder?</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-020-01576-x</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic immune-mediated demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS), which is more prevalent among women of childbearing age. Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is a severe autoimmune disease of the CNS with similar prevalence features to MS and has recently been considered a different entity from MS. Measuring ovarian reserve is one way of evaluating fertility. Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is a peptide hormone produced by ovarian granulosa cells of early follicles and is considered to be a marker for ovarian reserve. With MS and NMOSD predominance in young women, the present study aimed to address the possibility of these diseases affecting fertility by measuring AMH levels in MS and NMOSD patients and comparing it with healthy controls. The present study included 23 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients, 23 seronegative NMOSD patients, and 23 healthy age-matched controls between 18 and 45 years of age. Serum samples of the three groups were collected, and the AMH levels were measured with AMH Gen II Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay, Beckman Coulter kit. In the present study, the AMH levels did not differ significantly between the groups (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.996). The mean AMH in the RRMS group was 3.59 ± 0.55 ng/ml compared with the mean of 3.60 ± 0.50 ng/ml in healthy controls. The mean AMH levels in the NMOSD group were 3.66 ± 0.61 ng/ml. Lower levels of AMH were found to be negatively associated with annualized relapse rate (in both groups of patients) and MS severity score. However, the difference was not significant. In NMOSD patients, the serum levels of AMH were negatively associated with disease duration (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = − 0.42, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.023). There had been a significant negative correlation between mean AMH serum levels with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) at the time of diagnosis and at the time of study in the NMOSD group (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = − 0.402, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.03 and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = − 0.457, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.014, respectively). There was not a significant difference in mean serum AMH levels between RRMS and NMOSD patients compared with that of healthy controls. Further studies with larger sample sizes should be conducted, which take more variables affecting fertility in women with either RRMS or NMOSD into account to put an end to the controversial issue of fertility in this area.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating neurological disease for which an accurate, cost-effective prediction of motor function recovery is in pressing need. A plethora of neurochemical changes involved in the pathophysiological process of SCI may serve as a new source of biomarkers for patient outcomes. Five dogs were included in this study. We characterized the plasma cytokine profiles in acute phase (0, 1, and 3 days after SCI) and subacute phase (7, 14, and 21 days after SCI) with microarray analysis. The motor function recovery following SCI was monitored by Olby scores. The expression level of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) was measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Then, correlations with the Olby scores and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis were performed. We identified 12 DEPs including 10 pro-inflammatory and 2 anti-inflammatory cytokines during the 21-day study period. Among those, the expression levels of erythropoietin (EPO), IL-17A, and IFNγ significantly correlated with the Olby scores with &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;R&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; values of 0.870, 0.740, and 0.616, respectively. The results of the ROC analysis suggested that plasma EPO, IL-17A, and IFNγ exhibited a significant predictive power with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.656, 0.848, and 0.800 for EPO, IL-17A, and IFNγ, respectively. Our results provide a longitudinal description of the changes in plasma cytokine expression in the acute and subacute stages of canine SCI. These data reveal novel panels of inflammation-related cytokines which have the potential to be evaluated as biomarkers for predicting motor function prognosis after SCI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) is a nonselective Ca&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-permeable cation channel that is a member of the TRP channel family. It is clear that TRPV4 channels are broadly expressed in the brain. As they are expressed on the plasma membrane, they interact with other channels and play a crucial role in nervous system activity. Under some pathological conditions, TRPV4 channels are upregulated and sensitized via cellular signaling pathways, and this can cause nervous system diseases. In this review, we focus on receptors that cooperate with TRPV4, including large-conductance Ca&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-activated K&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(BKca) channels, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate receptors (AMPARs), inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs), ryanodine receptors (RyRs), aquaporin 4 (AQP4), and other potential cooperative receptors in the brain. The data demonstrate how these channels work together to cause nervous system diseases under pathological conditions. The aim of this review was to discuss the receptors and signaling pathways related to TRPV4 based on recent data on the important physiological functions of TRPV4 channels to provide new clues for future studies and prospective therapeutic targets for related brain diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

We demonstrated regional patterns of selective vulnerability as distinguishing features of PART and AD in functionally relevant structures of the hippocampus. In AD cases, tau pathology was high in both CA1 and subiculum, followed by CA2/3, entorhinal cortex (EC), CA4, and dentate gyrus (DG). In PART, the severity of tau pathology in CA1 and subiculum was high, followed by EC, CA2/3, CA4, and DG. There are significant differences between sector DG and CA1, DG and subiculum in both AD and PART.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methylene blue (MB) has a protective effect on cognitive decline caused by chronic hypoperfusion, but the specific mechanism is not clear. This article aims to determine whether MB protects vascular neurons through PI3K/Akt and plays a role in improving cognitive impairment. Molecular biological methods, the hippocampal neuronal density test, the hippocampal vascular network density test, and dynamic enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were used to detect the blood–brain barrier permeability and Evans blue leakage rate in the hippocampus. We also observed and evaluated the changes in the above results after administration of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway protein inhibitor LY294002. There were significant differences for cerebral blood flow (CBF) between the chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) + MB group (100 ml/100 g/min) and the CCH group (60 ml/100 g/min, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). After using LY294002, the CBF of the CCH + MB + LY294002 group dropped to 82 ml/100 g/min. The vascular density in the CCH + MB group was 23%, which is significantly higher than that in the CCH group (15.1%) (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). The vascular density (17.5%) in the CCH + MB + LY294002 group was significantly higher than that in the CCH group but lower than that in the CCH + MB group. Western blotting results showed that one week after intraperitoneal injection of MB, the expression of t-Akt and p-Akt in the CCH + MB group was increased after CCH, and LY294002 partially blocked this up-regulation effect (CCH + MB + LY294002 group). MB is a potential therapy for the relief of mild cognitive impairment associated with CCH, vascular dementia, and Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder and is characterized by degeneration and axon loss from the upper motor neuron, that descends from the lower motor neuron in the brain. Over the period, assorted outcomes from medical findings, molecular pathogenesis, and structural and biophysical studies have abetted in providing thoughtful insights underlying the importance of disease-causing genes in ALS. Consequently, numerous mechanisms were proposed for the pathogenesis of ALS, considering protein mutations, aggregation, and misfolding. Besides, the answers to the majority of ALS cases that happen to be sporadic still remain obscure. The application in discovering susceptibility factors in ALS contemplating the genetic factors is to be further dissevered in the future years with innovation in research studies. Hence, this review targets in revisiting the breakthroughs on the disease-causing genes related with ALS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) has a close association with inflammatory response and oxidative stress in tissues and is widely expressed in intracranial aneurysms (IAs), especially in smooth muscle cells. Therefore, it is inferred that SPARC might be involved in the formation and development of IAs through the inflammatory response pathway or oxidative stress pathway. The aim of this study is to investigate the pathological mechanism of SPARC in oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis during the formation of IAs, as well as the involvement of TGF-β1 and NOX4 molecules. Human brain vascular smooth muscle cells (HBVSMCs) were selected as experimental objects. After the cells were stimulated by recombinant human SPARC protein in vitro, the ROS level in the cells was measured using an ID/ROS fluorescence analysis kit combined with fluorescence microscope and flow cytometry. The related protein expression in HBVSMCs was measured using western blotting. The mitochondrial membrane potential change was detected using a mitochondrial membrane potential kit and laser confocal microscope. The mechanism was explored by intervention with reactive oxygen scavengers N-acetylcysteine (NAC), TGF-β1 inhibitor (SD-208), and siRNA knockout. The results showed that SPARC upregulated the expression of NOX4 through the TGF-β1-dependent signaling pathway, leading to oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory matrix behavior and apoptosis in HBVSMCs. These findings demonstrated that SPARC may promote the progression of IAs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cerebral ischemia represents a major cause of disability, yet its precise mechanism remains unknown. In addition, ischemia-reperfusion injury which occurs during the blood recovery process increases the risk of mortality, and is not adequately addressed with current treatment. To improve therapeutic options, it is important to explore the vital substances that play a pivotal role in ischemia-reperfusion injury. This study is the first to investigate the role of IL-32, a vital pro-inflammatory factor, in models of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. The results showed that IL-32 was highly expressed in both in vivo and in vitro models. The proteins of the NOD/MAPK/NF-κB pathway were also up-regulated, indicating a potential signaling pathway mechanism. Inhibition of IL-32 and blocking of the NOD/MAPK/NF-κB pathway increased cell survival, decreased the level of inflammatory factors and inflammasomes, and attenuated nitrosative stress. Taken together, the results show that inhibition of IL-32 expression ameliorates cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury via the NOD/MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway. The findings in this study reveal that IL-32 is a vital target of ischemia-reperfusion injury, providing a new avenue for treatment development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Medulloblastoma (MB) is one of the most common intracranial malignancies in children. The present study applied integrated bioinformatics to identify potential core genes associated with the pathogenesis of MB and reveal potential molecular mechanisms. Through the integrated analysis of multiple data sets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), 414 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Combining the protein–protein interaction (PPI) network analysis with gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), eight core genes, including CCNA2, CCNB1, CCNB2, AURKA, CDK1, MAD2L1, BUB1B, and RRM2, as well as four core pathways, including “cell cycle”, “oocyte meiosis”, “p53 pathway” and “DNA replication” were selected. In independent data sets, the core genes showed superior diagnostic values and significant prognostic correlations. Moreover, in the pan-caner data of the cancer genome atlas (TCGA), the core genes were also widely abnormally expressed. In conclusion, this study identified core genes and pathways of MB through integrated analysis to deepen the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the MB and provide potential targets and pathways for diagnosis and treatment of MB.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Stimuli from stressful events, attention in the classroom, and many other experiences affect the functionality of the brain by changing the structure or reorganizing the connections between neurons and their communication. Modification of the synaptic transmission is a vital mechanism for generating neural activity via internal or external stimuli. Neuronal plasticity is an important driving force in neuroscience research, as it is the basic process underlying learning and memory and is involved in many other functions including brain development and homeostasis, sensorial training, and recovery from brain injury. Indeed, neuronal plasticity has been explored in numerous studies, but it is still not clear how neuronal plasticity affects the physiology and morphology of the brain. Thus, unraveling the molecular mechanisms of neuronal plasticity is essential for understanding the operation of brain functions. In this timeline review, we discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying different forms of synaptic plasticity and their association with neurodegenerative/neurological disorders as a consequence of alterations in neuronal plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The spinal cord is essential to the control of locomotion in legged animals and humans. However, the actual circuitry of the spinal controller remains only vaguely understood. Here we approach this problem from the viewpoint of learning. More precisely, we assume the circuitry evolves through the transfer of control from the brain to the spinal cord, propose a specific learning mechanism for this transfer based on the error between the cord and brain contributions to muscle control, and study the resulting structure of the spinal controller in a simplified neuromuscular model of human locomotion. The model focuses on the leg rebound behavior in stance and represents the spinal circuitry with 150 muscle reflexes. We find that after learning a spinal controller has evolved that produces leg rebound motions in the absence of a central brain input with only three structural reflex groups. These groups contain individual reflexes well known from physiological experiments but thought to serve separate purposes in the control of human locomotion. Our results suggest a more holistic interpretation of the role of individual sensory projections in spinal networks than is common. In addition, we discuss potential neural correlates for the proposed learning mechanism that may be probed in experiments. Together with such experiments, neuromuscular models of spinal learning likely will become effective tools for uncovering the structure and development of the spinal control circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Affected Kv1.1 channels exhibit combinations of altered expression, voltage sensitivity, and rates of activation and deactivation. Computational modeling and analysis can reveal the potential of particular channelopathies to alter neuronal excitability. A dynamical systems approach was taken to study the excitability and underlying dynamical structure of the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model of neural excitation as properties of the delayed rectifier K&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel were altered. Bifurcation patterns of the HH model were determined as the amplitude of steady injection current was varied simultaneously with single parameters describing the delayed rectifier rates of activation and deactivation, maximal conductance, and voltage sensitivity. Relatively modest changes in the properties of the delayed rectifier K&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel analogous to what is described for its channelopathies alter the bifurcation structure of the HH model and profoundly modify excitability of the HH model. Channelopathies associated with Kv1.1 can reduce the threshold for onset of neural activity. These studies also demonstrate how pathological delayed rectifier K&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels could lead to the observation of the generalized Hopf bifurcation and, perhaps, other variants of the Hopf bifurcation. The observed bifurcation patterns collectively demonstrate that properties of the nominal delayed rectifier in the HH model appear optimized to permit activation of the HH model over the broadest possible range of input currents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;During fictive locomotion cat lumbar motoneurons exhibit changes in membrane proprieties including a decrease in voltage threshold (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;), afterhyperpolarization (AHP) and input resistance (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;R&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;in&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;) and an increase in non-linear membrane property. The impact of these changes on the motoneuron recruitment remains unknown. Using modeling approach we investigated the channel mechanism regulating the motoneuron recruitment. Three types of motoneuron pools including slow (S), fatigue-resistant (FR) and fast-fatigable (FF) motoneurons were constructed based on the membrane proprieties of cat lumbar motoneurons. The transient sodium (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;NaT&lt;/em&gt;), persistent sodium (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;NaP&lt;/em&gt;), delayed-rectifier potassium [&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;K(DR&lt;/em&gt;)], Ca&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent K&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; [&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;K(AHP)&lt;/em&gt;] and L-type calcium (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Ca&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;L&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;) channels were included in the models. Simulation results showed that (1) Strengthening synaptic inputs increased the number of recruitments in all three types of motoneurons following the size principle. (2) Increasing &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;NaT or NaP&lt;/em&gt; or decreasing &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;K(DR&lt;/em&gt;) or &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;K(AHP)&lt;/em&gt; lowered rheobase of spike generation thus increased recruitment of motoneuron pools&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; (3) Decreasing &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;R&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;in&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; reduced recruitment in all three types of motoneurons.

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The existence of electrical communication among pyramidal cells (PCs) in the adult cortex has been debated by neuroscientists for several decades. Gap junctions (GJs) among cortical interneurons have been well documented experimentally and their functional roles have been proposed by both computational neuroscientists and experimentalists alike. Experimental evidence for similar junctions among pyramidal cells in the cortex, however, has remained elusive due to the apparent rarity of these couplings among neurons. In this work, we develop a neuronal network model that includes observed probabilities and strengths of electrotonic coupling between PCs and gap-junction coupling among interneurons, in addition to realistic synaptic connectivity among both populations. We use this network model to investigate the effect of electrotonic coupling between PCs on network behavior with the goal of theoretically addressing this controversy of existence and purpose of electrotonically coupled PCs in the cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Small dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons are primary nociceptors which are responsible for sensing pain. Elucidation of their dynamics is essential for understanding and controlling pain. To this end, we present a numerical bifurcation analysis of a small DRG neuron model in this paper. The model is of Hodgkin-Huxley type and has 9 state variables. It consists of a Na&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 and a Na&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.8 sodium channel, a leak channel, a delayed rectifier potassium, and an A-type transient potassium channel. The dynamics of this model strongly depend on the maximal conductances of the voltage-gated ion channels and the external current, which can be adjusted experimentally. We show that the neuron dynamics are most sensitive to the Na&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.8 channel maximal conductance (&lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus inline-equation id-i-eq1&quot;&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus equation-source format-t-e-x&quot;&gt;\(\overline {g}_{1.8}\)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;). Numerical bifurcation analysis shows that depending on &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus inline-equation id-i-eq2&quot;&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus equation-source format-t-e-x&quot;&gt;\(\overline {g}_{1.8}\)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt; and the external current, different parameter regions can be identified with stable steady states, periodic firing of action potentials, mixed-mode oscillations (MMOs), and bistability between stable steady states and stable periodic firing of action potentials. We illustrate and discuss the transitions between these different regimes. We further analyze the behavior of MMOs. As the external current is decreased, we find that MMOs appear after a cyclic limit point. Within this region, bifurcation analysis shows a sequence of isolated periodic solution branches with one large action potential and a number of small amplitude peaks per period. For decreasing external current, the number of small amplitude peaks is increasing and the distance between the large amplitude action potentials is growing, finally tending to infinity and thereby leading to a stable steady state. A closer inspection reveals more complex concatenated MMOs in between these periodic MMO branches, forming Farey sequences. Lastly, we also find small solution windows with aperiodic oscillations which seem to be chaotic. The dynamical patterns found here—as consequences of bifurcation points regulated by different parameters—have potential translational significance as repetitive firing of action potentials imply pain of some form and intensity; manipulating these patterns by regulating the different parameters could aid in investigating pain dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We study the task of replicating the functionality of black-box neural
models, for which we only know the output class probabilities provided for a
set of input images. We assume back-propagation through the black-box model is
not possible and its training images are not available, e.g. the model could be
exposed only through an API. In this context, we present a teacher-student
framework that can distill the black-box (teacher) model into a student model
with minimal accuracy loss. To generate useful data samples for training the
student, our framework (i) learns to generate images on a proxy data set (with
images and classes different from those used to train the black-box) and (ii)
applies an evolutionary strategy to make sure that each generated data sample
exhibits a high response for a specific class when given as input to the black
box. Our framework is compared with several baseline and state-of-the-art
methods on three benchmark data sets. The empirical evidence indicates that our
model is superior to the considered baselines. Although our method does not
back-propagate through the black-box network, it generally surpasses
state-of-the-art methods that regard the teacher as a glass-box model. Our code
is available at: https://github.com/antoniobarbalau/black-box-ripper.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11124</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Genetic disorders such as Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) and Coffin-Lowry
syndrome (CLS) cause lifelong cognitive disability, including deficits in
learning and memory. Can pharmacological therapies be suggested to improve
learning and memory in these disorders? To address this question, we simulated
drug effects within a computational model describing induction of late
long-term potentiation (L-LTP). Biochemical pathways impaired in these and
other disorders converge on a common target, histone acetylation by
acetyltransferases such as CREB binding protein (CBP), which facilitates gene
induction necessary for L-LTP. We focused on four drug classes: tropomyosin
receptor kinase B (TrkB) agonists, cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitors, histone
deacetylase inhibitors, and ampakines. Simulations suggested each drug type
alone may rescue deficits in L-LTP. A potential disadvantage, however, was the
necessity of simulating strong drug effects (high doses), which could produce
adverse side effects. Thus, we investigated the effects of six drug pairs among
the four classes described above. These combination treatments normalized
impaired L-LTP with substantially smaller drug doses. In addition three of
these combinations, a TrkB agonist paired with an ampakine and a cAMP
phosphodiesterase inhibitor paired with a TrkB agonist or an ampakine,
exhibited strong synergism in L-LTP rescue. Therefore, we suggest these drug
combinations are promising candidates for further empirical studies in animal
models of genetic disorders that impair acetylation, L-LTP, and learning.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: A Neurochaos Learning Architecture for Genome Classification. (arXiv:2010.10995v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10995</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There has been empirical evidence of presence of non-linearity and chaos at
the level of single neurons in biological neural networks. The properties of
chaotic neurons inspires us to employ them in artificial learning systems.
Here, we propose a Neurochaos Learning (NL) architecture, where the neurons
used to extract features from data are 1D chaotic maps. ChaosFEX+SVM, an
instance of this NL architecture, is proposed as a hybrid combination of chaos
and classical machine learning algorithm. We formally prove that a single layer
of NL with a finite number of 1D chaotic neurons satisfies the Universal
Approximation Theorem with an exact value for the number of chaotic neurons
needed to approximate a discrete real valued function with finite support. This
is made possible due to the topological transitivity property of chaos and the
existence of uncountably infinite number of dense orbits for the chosen 1D
chaotic map. The chaotic neurons in NL get activated under the presence of an
input stimulus (data) and output a chaotic firing trajectory. From such chaotic
firing trajectories of individual neurons of NL, we extract Firing Time, Firing
Rate, Energy and Entropy that constitute ChaosFEX features. These ChaosFEX
features are then fed to a Support Vector Machine with linear kernel for
classification. The effectiveness of chaotic feature engineering performed by
NL (ChaosFEX+SVM) is demonstrated for synthetic and real world datasets in the
low and high training sample regimes. Specifically, we consider the problem of
classification of genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from other coronaviruses
(SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and others). With just one training sample per class for
1000 random trials of training, we report an average macro F1-score &amp;gt; 0.99 for
the classification of SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-CoV-1 genome sequences. Robustness
of ChaosFEX features to additive noise is also demonstrated.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10926</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There is increasing realization in neuroscience that information is
represented in the brain, e.g., neocortex, hippocampus, in the form sparse
distributed codes (SDCs), a kind of cell assembly. Two essential questions are:
a) how are such codes formed on the basis of single trials, and how is
similarity preserved during learning, i.e., how do more similar inputs get
mapped to more similar SDCs. I describe a novel Modular Sparse Distributed Code
(MSDC) that provides simple, neurally plausible answers to both questions. An
MSDC coding field (CF) consists of Q WTA competitive modules (CMs), each
comprised of K binary units (analogs of principal cells). The modular nature of
the CF makes possible a single-trial, unsupervised learning algorithm that
approximately preserves similarity and crucially, runs in fixed time, i.e., the
number of steps needed to store an item remains constant as the number of
stored items grows. Further, once items are stored as MSDCs in superposition
and such that their intersection structure reflects input similarity, both
fixed time best-match retrieval and fixed time belief update (updating the
probabilities of all stored items) also become possible. The algorithm's core
principle is simply to add noise into the process of choosing a code, i.e.,
choosing a winner in each CM, which is proportional to the novelty of the
input. This causes the expected intersection of the code for an input, X, with
the code of each previously stored input, Y, to be proportional to the
similarity of X and Y. Results demonstrating these capabilities for spatial
patterns are given in the appendix.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the area of evolutionary computation the calculation of diverse sets of
high-quality solutions to a given optimization problem has gained momentum in
recent years under the term evolutionary diversity optimization. Theoretical
insights into the working principles of baseline evolutionary algorithms for
diversity optimization are still rare. In this paper we study the well-known
Minimum Spanning Tree problem (MST) in the context of diversity optimization
where population diversity is measured by the sum of pairwise edge overlaps.
Theoretical results provide insights into the fitness landscape of the MST
diversity optimization problem pointing out that even for a population of
$\mu=2$ fitness plateaus (of constant length) can be reached, but nevertheless
diverse sets can be calculated in polynomial time. We supplement our
theoretical results with a series of experiments for the unconstrained and
constraint case where all solutions need to fulfill a minimal quality
threshold. Our results show that a simple $(\mu+1)$-EA can effectively compute
a diversified population of spanning trees of high quality.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10885</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the last decade remarkable progress has been made in development of
suitable proof techniques for analysing randomised search heuristics. The
theoretical investigation of these algorithms on classes of functions is
essential to the understanding of the underlying stochastic process. Linear
functions have been traditionally studied in this area resulting in tight
bounds on the expected optimisation time of simple randomised search algorithms
for this class of problems. Recently, the constrained version of this problem
has gained attention and some theoretical results have also been obtained on
this class of problems. In this paper we study the class of linear functions
under uniform constraint and investigate the expected optimisation time of
Randomised Local Search (RLS) and a simple evolutionary algorithm called (1+1)
EA. We prove a tight bound of $\Theta(n^2)$ for RLS and improve the previously
best known upper bound of (1+1) EA from $O(n^2 \log (Bw_{\max}))$ to $O(n^2\log
B)$ in expectation and to $O(n^2 \log n)$ with high probability, where
$w_{\max}$ and $B$ are the maximum weight of the linear objective function and
the bound of the uniform constraint, respectively. Also, we obtain a tight
bound of $O(n^2)$ for the (1+1) EA on a special class of instances. We
complement our theoretical studies by experimental investigations that consider
different values of $B$ and also higher mutation rates that reflect the fact
that $2$-bit flips are crucial for dealing with the uniform constraint.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The paper presents a novel software framework for Association Rule Mining
named uARMSolver. The framework is written fully in C++ and runs on all
platforms. It allows users to preprocess their data in a transaction database,
to make discretization of data, to search for association rules and to guide a
presentation/visualization of the best rules found using external tools. As
opposed to the existing software packages or frameworks, this also supports
numerical and real-valued types of attributes besides the categorical ones.
Mining the association rules is defined as an optimization and solved using the
nature-inspired algorithms that can be incorporated easily. Because the
algorithms normally discover a huge amount of association rules, the framework
enables a modular inclusion of so-called visual guiders for extracting the
knowledge hidden in data, and visualize these using external tools.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Attention modules, as simple and effective tools, have not only enabled deep
neural networks to achieve state-of-the-art results in many domains, but also
enhanced their interpretability. Most current models use deterministic
attention modules due to their simplicity and ease of optimization. Stochastic
counterparts, on the other hand, are less popular despite their potential
benefits. The main reason is that stochastic attention often introduces
optimization issues or requires significant model changes. In this paper, we
propose a scalable stochastic version of attention that is easy to implement
and optimize. We construct simplex-constrained attention distributions by
normalizing reparameterizable distributions, making the training process
differentiable. We learn their parameters in a Bayesian framework where a
data-dependent prior is introduced for regularization. We apply the proposed
stochastic attention modules to various attention-based models, with
applications to graph node classification, visual question answering, image
captioning, machine translation, and language understanding. Our experiments
show the proposed method brings consistent improvements over the corresponding

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10564</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The brain cortex, which processes visual, auditory and sensory data in the
brain, is known to have many recurrent connections within its layers and from
higher to lower layers. But, in the case of machine learning with neural
networks, it is generally assumed that strict feed-forward architectures are
suitable for static input data, such as images, whereas recurrent networks are
required mainly for the processing of sequential input, such as language.
However, it is not clear whether also processing of static input data benefits
from recurrent connectivity. In this work, we introduce and test a novel
implementation of recurrent neural networks with lateral and feed-back
connections into deep learning. This departure from the strict feed-forward
structure prevents the use of the standard error backpropagation algorithm for
training the networks. Therefore we provide an algorithm which implements the
backpropagation algorithm on a implicit implementation of recurrent networks,
which is different from state-of-the-art implementations of recurrent neural
networks. Our method, in contrast to current recurrent neural networks,
eliminates the use of long chains of derivatives due to many iterative update
steps, which makes learning computationally less costly. It turns out that the
presence of recurrent intra-layer connections within a one-layer implicit
recurrent network enhances the performance of neural networks considerably: A
single-layer implicit recurrent network is able to solve the XOR problem, while
a feed-forward network with monotonically increasing activation function fails
at this task. Finally, we demonstrate that a two-layer implicit recurrent
architecture leads to a better performance in a regression task of physical
parameters from the measured trajectory of a damped pendulum.

tasks, a growing amount of work is directed towards comparing information
processing in humans and machines. These studies are an exciting chance to
learn about one system by studying the other. Here, we propose ideas on how to
design, conduct and interpret experiments such that they adequately support the
investigation of mechanisms when comparing human and machine perception. We
demonstrate and apply these ideas through three case studies. The first case
study shows how human bias can affect how we interpret results, and that
several analytic tools can help to overcome this human reference point. In the
second case study, we highlight the difference between necessary and sufficient
mechanisms in visual reasoning tasks. Thereby, we show that contrary to
previous suggestions, feedback mechanisms might not be necessary for the tasks
in question. The third case study highlights the importance of aligning
experimental conditions. We find that a previously-observed difference in
object recognition does not hold when adapting the experiment to make
conditions more equitable between humans and machines. In presenting a
checklist for comparative studies of visual reasoning in humans and machines,
we hope to highlight how to overcome potential pitfalls in design or inference.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Meta-learning is a promising strategy for learning to efficiently learn
within new tasks, using data gathered from a distribution of tasks. However,
the meta-learning literature thus far has focused on the task segmented
setting, where at train-time, offline data is assumed to be split according to
the underlying task, and at test-time, the algorithms are optimized to learn in
a single task. In this work, we enable the application of generic meta-learning
algorithms to settings where this task segmentation is unavailable, such as
continual online learning with a time-varying task. We present meta-learning
via online changepoint analysis (MOCA), an approach which augments a
meta-learning algorithm with a differentiable Bayesian changepoint detection
scheme. The framework allows both training and testing directly on time series
data without segmenting it into discrete tasks. We demonstrate the utility of
this approach on a nonlinear meta-regression benchmark as well as two
meta-image-classification benchmarks.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09788</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dropout is a simple but efficient regularization technique for achieving
better generalization of deep neural networks (DNNs); hence it is widely used
in tasks based on DNNs. During training, dropout randomly discards a portion of
the neurons to avoid overfitting. This paper presents an enhanced dropout
technique, which we call multi-sample dropout, for both accelerating training
and improving generalization over the original dropout. The original dropout
creates a randomly selected subset (called a dropout sample) from the input in
each training iteration while the multi-sample dropout creates multiple dropout
samples. The loss is calculated for each sample, and then the sample losses are
averaged to obtain the final loss. This technique can be easily implemented by
duplicating a part of the network after the dropout layer while sharing the
weights among the duplicated fully connected layers. Experimental results using
image classification tasks including ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 showed
that multi-sample dropout accelerates training. Moreover, the networks trained
using multi-sample dropout achieved lower error rates compared to networks
trained with the original dropout. The additional computation cost due to the
duplicated operations is not significant for deep convolutional networks
because most of the computation time is consumed in the convolution layers
before the dropout layer, which are not duplicated.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.03363</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As neuroscientists we want to understand how causal interactions or
mechanisms within the brain give rise to perception, cognition, and behavior.
It is typical to estimate interaction effects from measured activity using
statistical techniques such as functional connectivity, Granger Causality, or
information flow, whose outcomes are often falsely treated as revealing
mechanistic insight. Since these statistical techniques fit models to
low-dimensional measurements from brains, they ignore the fact that brain
activity is high-dimensional. Here we focus on the obvious confound of common
inputs: the countless unobserved variables likely have more influence than the
few observed ones. Any given observed correlation can be explained by an
infinite set of causal models that take into account the unobserved variables.
Therefore, correlations within massively undersampled measurements tell us
little about mechanisms. We argue that these mis-inferences of causality from
correlation are augmented by an implicit redefinition of words that suggest
mechanisms, such as connectivity, causality, and flow.

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: High-Resolution Transcriptomic and Proteomic Profiling of Heterogeneity of Brain-Derived Microglia in Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.583811</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microglia are important for central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis and first to respond to tissue damage and perturbations. Microglia are heterogeneous cells; in case of pathology, microglia adopt a range of phenotypes with altered functions. However, how these different microglia subtypes are implicated in CNS disease is largely unresolved. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic demyelinating disease of the CNS, characterized by inflammation and axonal degeneration, ultimately leading to neurological decline. One way microglia are implicated in MS is through stimulation of remyelination. They facilitate efficient remyelination by phagocytosis of myelin debris. In addition, microglia recruit oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) to demyelinated areas and stimulate remyelination. The development of high-resolution technologies to profile individual cells has greatly contributed to our understanding of microglia heterogeneity and function under normal and pathological conditions. Gene expression profiling technologies have evolved from whole tissue RNA sequencing toward single-cell or nucleus sequencing. Single microglia proteomic profiles are also increasingly generated, offering another layer of high-resolution data. Here, we will review recent studies that have employed these technologies in the context of MS and their respective advantages and disadvantages. Moreover, recent developments that allow for (single) cell profiling while retaining spatial information and tissue context will be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Isolation and Characterization of Multi-Protein Complexes Enriched in the K-Cl Co-transporter 2 From Brain Plasma Membranes</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.563091</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Kcc2 plays a critical role in determining the efficacy of synaptic inhibition, however, the cellular mechanisms neurons use to regulate its membrane trafficking, stability and activity are ill-defined. To address these issues, we used affinity purification to isolate stable multi-protein complexes of K-Cl Co-transporter 2 (Kcc2) from the plasma membrane of murine forebrain. We resolved these using blue-native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) coupled to LC-MS/MS and label-free quantification. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD021368. Purified Kcc2 migrated as distinct molecular species of 300, 600, and 800 kDa following BN-PAGE. In excess of 90% coverage of the soluble N- and C-termini of Kcc2 was obtained. In total we identified 246 proteins significantly associated with Kcc2. The 300 kDa species largely contained Kcc2, which is consistent with a dimeric quaternary structure for this transporter. The 600 and 800 kDa species represented stable multi-protein complexes of Kcc2. We identified a set of novel structural, ion transporting, immune related and signaling protein interactors, that are present at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, consistent with the proposed localization of Kcc2. These included spectrins, C1qa/b/c and the IP3 receptor. We also identified interactors more directly associated with phosphorylation; Akap5, Akap13, and Lmtk3. Finally, we used LC-MS/MS on the same purified endogenous plasma membrane Kcc2 to detect phosphorylation sites. We detected 11 sites with high confidence, including known and novel sites. Collectively our experiments demonstrate that Kcc2 is associated with components of the neuronal cytoskeleton and signaling molecules that may act to regulate transporter membrane trafficking, stability, and activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Object Recognition Memory: Distinct Yet Complementary Roles of the Mouse CA1 and Perirhinal Cortex</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.527543</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;While the essential contribution of the hippocampus to spatial memory is well established, object recognition memory has been traditionally attributed to the perirhinal cortex (PRh). However, the results of several studies indicate that under specific procedural conditions, temporary or permanent lesions of the hippocampus affect object memory processes as measured in the Spontaneous Object Recognition (SOR) task. The PRh and hippocampus are considered to contribute distinctly to object recognition memory based on memory strength. Allowing mice more, or less, exploration of novel objects during the encoding phase of the task (i.e., sample session), yields stronger, or weaker, object memory, respectively. The current studies employed temporary local inactivation and immunohistochemistry to determine the differential contributions of neuronal activity in PRh and the CA1 region of the hippocampus to strong and weak object memory. Temporary inactivation of the CA1 immediately after the SOR sample session impaired strong object memory but spared weak object memory; while temporary inactivation of PRh post-sample impaired weak object memory but spared strong object memory. Furthermore, mRNA transcription and de novo protein synthesis are required for the consolidation of episodic memory, and activation patterns of immediate early genes (IEGs), such as c-Fos and Arc, are linked to behaviorally triggered neuronal activation and synaptic plasticity. Analyses of c-Fos and Arc protein expression in PRh and CA1 neurons by immunohistochemistry, and of Arc mRNA by qPCR after distinct stages of SOR, provide additional support that strong object memory is dependent on CA1 neuronal activity, while weak object memory is dependent on PRh neuronal activity. Taken together, the results support the view that both PRh and CA1 are required for object memory under distinct conditions. Specifically, our results are consistent with a model that as the mouse begins to explore a novel object, information about it accumulates within PRh, and a weak memory of the object is encoded. If object exploration continues beyond some threshold, strong memory for the event of object exploration is encoded; the consolidation of which is CA1-dependent. These data serve to reconcile the dissension in the literature by demonstrating functional and complementary roles for CA1 and PRh neurons in rodent object memory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Spooky Interaction at a Distance in Cave and Surface Dwelling Electric Fishes</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.561524</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Glass knifefish (Eigenmannia) are a group of weakly electric fishes found throughout the Amazon basin. Their electric organ discharges (EODs) are energetically costly adaptations used in social communication and for localizing conspecifics and other objects including prey at night and in turbid water. Interestingly, a troglobitic population of blind cavefish Eigenmannia vicentespelea survives in complete darkness in a cave system in central Brazil. We examined the effects of troglobitic conditions, which includes a complete loss of visual cues and potentially reduced food sources, by comparing the behavior and movement of freely behaving cavefish to a nearby epigean (surface) population (Eigenmannia trilineata). We found that the strengths of electric discharges in cavefish were greater than in surface fish, which may result from increased reliance on electrosensory perception, larger size, and sufficient food resources. Surface fish were recorded while feeding at night and did not show evidence of territoriality, whereas cavefish appeared to maintain territories. Surprisingly, we routinely found both surface and cavefish with sustained differences in EOD frequencies that were below 10 Hz despite being within close proximity of about 50 cm. A half century of analysis of electrosocial interactions in laboratory tanks suggest that these small differences in EOD frequencies should have triggered the “jamming avoidance response,” a behavior in which fish change their EOD frequencies to increase the difference between individuals. Pairs of fish also showed significant interactions between EOD frequencies and relative movements at large distances, over 1.5 m, and at high differences in frequencies, often &amp;gt;50 Hz. These interactions are likely “envelope” responses in which fish alter their EOD frequency in relation to higher order features, specifically changes in the depth of modulation, of electrosocial signals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: A Cross-Session Dataset for Collaborative Brain-Computer Interfaces Based on Rapid Serial Visual Presentation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.579469</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) have been widely used to categorize target and non-target images. However, it is still a challenge to detect single-trial event related potentials (ERPs) from electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Besides, the variability of EEG signal over time may cause difficulties of calibration in long-term system use. Recently, collaborative BCIs have been proposed to improve the overall BCI performance by fusing brain activities acquired from multiple subjects. For both individual and collaborative BCIs, feature extraction and classification algorithms that can be transferred across sessions can significantly facilitate system calibration. Although open datasets are highly efficient for developing algorithms, currently there is still a lack of datasets for a collaborative RSVP-based BCI. This paper presents a cross-session EEG dataset of a collaborative RSVP-based BCI system from 14 subjects, who were divided into seven groups. In collaborative BCI experiments, two subjects did the same target image detection tasks synchronously. All subjects participated in the same experiment twice with an average interval of ∼23 days. The results in data evaluation indicate that adequate signal processing algorithms can greatly enhance the cross-session BCI performance in both individual and collaborative conditions. Besides, compared with individual BCIs, the collaborative methods that fuse information from multiple subjects obtain significantly improved BCI performance. This dataset can be used for developing more efficient algorithms to enhance performance and practicality of a collaborative RSVP-based BCI system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00853</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Methods: Alzheimer's disease and Frontotemporal dementia are the first and third most common forms of dementia. Due to their similar clinical symptoms, they are easily misdiagnosed as each other even with sophisticated clinical guidelines. For disease-specific intervention and treatment, it is essential to develop a computer-aided system to improve the accuracy of their differential diagnosis. Recent advances in deep learning have delivered some of the best performance for medical image recognition tasks. However, its application to the differential diagnosis of AD and FTD pathology has not been explored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approach: In this study, we proposed a novel deep learning based framework to distinguish between brain images of normal aging individuals and subjects with AD and FTD. Specifically, we combined the multi-scale and multi-type MRI-base image features with Generative Adversarial Network data augmentation technique to improve the differential diagnosis accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Each of the multi-scale, multitype, and data augmentation methods improved the ability for differential diagnosis for both AD and FTD. A 10-fold cross validation experiment performed on a large sample of 1,954 images using the proposed framework achieved a high overall accuracy of 88.28%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The salient contributions of this study are three-fold: (1) our experiments demonstrate that the combination of multiple structural features extracted at different scales with our proposed deep neural network yields superior performance than individual features; (2) we show that the use of Generative Adversarial Network for data augmentation could further improve the discriminant ability of the network regarding challenging tasks such as differentiating dementia sub-types; (3) and finally, we show that ensemble classifier strategy could make the network more robust and stable.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Do Individuals With Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder Share Similar Neural Mechanisms of Decision-Making Under Ambiguous Circumstances?</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.585086</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Impaired decision-making is well documented in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and a range of electrophysiological and functional neuroimaging measures have begun to reveal the pathological mechanisms that underlie the decision-making process. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) has core symptoms that often overlap with OCD, but similarities between these disorders at the behavioral and neurological levels are often unclear, including whether OCPD exhibits similar decision-making deficits and shared neurological dysfunction. To address these issues, we examined 24 cases of OCD, 19 cases of OCPD, and 26 matched normal control (NC) subjects during the revised Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) using event-related potentials (ERPs). The net IGT scores were lower for OCD subjects than for OCPD or NC subjects, thus indicating that OCD subjects chose more disadvantageous options and were “short-sighted” with regards to information. The feedback-related negativity (FRN) waveform (lose-win) was larger in both OCD and OCPD subjects, which suggested that obstacles exist in the feedback process. Consequently, these subjects might share similar neural mechanisms under ambiguous decision-making circumstances. Furthermore, IGT net scores were significantly and negatively correlated with Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) scales. This implies that more severe obsessive-compulsive symptoms inspired more negative emotions that led to worse decision-making ability. Therefore, although similar neural mechanisms might exist, this led to different behaviors in which OCPD is associated with better behavioral performance compared to OCD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: High Phase Synchronization in Alpha Band Activity in Older Subjects With High Creativity</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.583049</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Despite growing evidence that high creativity leads to mental well-being in older individuals, the neurophysiological bases of creativity remain elusive. Creativity reportedly involves multiple brain areas and their functional interconnections. In particular, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is used to investigate the role of patterns of functional connectivity between the default network and other networks in creative activity. These interactions among networks play the role of integrating various neural processes to support creative activity and involve attention, cognitive control, and memory. The electroencephalogram (EEG) enables researchers to capture a pattern of band-specific functional connectivity, as well as moment-to-moment dynamics of brain activity; this can be accomplished even in the resting-state by exploiting the excellent temporal resolution of the EEG. Furthermore, the recent advent of functional connectivity analysis in EEG studies has focused on the phase-difference variable because of its fine spatio-temporal resolution. Therefore, we hypothesized that the combining method of EEG signals having high-temporal resolution and the phase synchronization analysis having high-spatio-temporal resolutions brings a new insight of functional connectivity regarding high creative activity of older participants. In this study, we examined the resting-state EEG signal in 20 healthy older participants and estimated functional connectivities using the phase lag index (PLI), which evaluates the phase synchronization of EEG signals. Individual creativity was assessed using the S-A creativity test in a separate session before the EEG recording. In the analysis of associations of EEG measures with the S-A test scores, the covariate effect of the intelligence quotient was evaluated. As a result, higher individual S-A scores were significantly associated with higher node degrees, defined as the average PLI of a node (electrode) across all links with the remaining nodes, across all nodes at the alpha band. A conventional power spectrum analysis revealed no significant association with S-A scores in any frequency band. Older participants with high creativity exhibited high functional connectivity even in the resting-state, irrespective of intelligence quotient, which supports the theory that creativity entails widespread brain connectivity. Thus, PLIs derived from EEG data may provide new insights into the relationship between functional connectivity and creativity in healthy older people.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.567541</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The role of visual skills in reading acquisition has long been debated and whether there is shared neurobiological basis between visual skills and reading is not clear. This study investigated the relationship between Visual Matching and reading and their shared neuroanatomical basis. Two hundred and ninety-three typically developing Mandarin-speaking children were followed in a longitudinal study from ages 4 to 11 years old. A subsample of 79 children was further followed up at 14 years old when the MRI data were collected. Results showed that the development of Visual Matching from ages 6 to 8 predicted reading accuracy at age 11. In addition, both the development of Visual Matching and reading accuracy were associated with cortical surface area of a cluster located in fusiform gyrus. These findings suggested that the mapping from visual codes to phonological codes is important in learning to read and that left fusiform gyrus provided neural basis for such mapping. Implications of these findings in light of a new approach toward the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying reading development are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) characterized by neuropsychiatric abnormalities is a major complication of cirrhosis with high mortality. However, the pathogenesis of HE has not been fully elucidated. This study aimed to determine endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) in the blood of HE patients and investigate the role of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S in an astrocytic model of HE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Patients with and without HE were recruited to determine plasma H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S levels and blood microbial 16S rRNA gene. Rat astrocytes were employed as a model of HE by treatment of NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl. Exogenous H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S was preadded. Cell viability was measured by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, and cell death was evaluated by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Apoptosis was determined by Hoechst 33342/Propidium Iodide (PI) Double Staining and Western blot analysis of apoptosis-related protein expression. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were assessed by flow cytometer. Expressions of Nrf2 and its downstream regulated genes were examined by immunofluorescence staining and Western blot, respectively. Nrf2 gene knockdown was performed by antisense shRNA of Nrf2 gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: There was a significant decrease in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S levels in cirrhotic patients with HE compared with without HE. Blood microbiota analyses revealed that certain strains associated with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S production were negatively correlated with HE. In vitro, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S markedly attenuated NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl-induced cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. This effect was mediated by Nrf2/ARE signaling, and knockdown of Nrf2 expression abolished the antagonistic effect of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S on NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl-induced neurotoxicity in astrocytes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Levels of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and bacteria associated with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S production are decreased in HE, and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S functions as the neuroprotector against NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl-induced HE by activating Nrf2/ARE signaling of astrocytes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Graph Theory Analysis Reveals Resting-State Compensatory Mechanisms in Healthy Aging and Prodromal Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.576627</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Several theories of cognitive compensation have been suggested to explain sustained cognitive abilities in healthy brain aging and early neurodegenerative processes. The growing number of studies investigating various aspects of task-based compensation in these conditions is contrasted by the shortage of data about resting-state compensatory mechanisms. Using our proposed criterion-based framework for compensation, we investigated 45 participants in three groups: (i) patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and positive biomarkers indicative of Alzheimer’s disease (AD); (ii) cognitively normal young adults; (iii) cognitively normal older adults. To increase reliability, three sessions of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging for each participant were performed on different days (135 scans in total). To elucidate the dimensions and dynamics of resting-state compensatory mechanisms, we used graph theory analysis along with volumetric analysis. Graph theory analysis was applied based on the Brainnetome atlas, which provides a connectivity-based parcellation framework. Comprehensive neuropsychological examinations including the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) and the Trail Making Test (TMT) were performed, to relate graph measures of compensatory nodes to cognition. To avoid false-positive findings, results were corrected for multiple comparisons. First, we observed an increase of degree centrality in cognition related brain regions of the middle frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus and superior parietal lobe despite local atrophy in MCI and healthy aging, indicating a resting-state connectivity increase with positive biomarkers. When relating the degree centrality measures to cognitive performance, we observed that greater connectivity led to better RAVLT and TMT scores in MCI and, hence, might constitute a compensatory mechanism. The detection and improved understanding of the compensatory dynamics in healthy aging and prodromal AD is mandatory for implementing and tailoring preventive interventions aiming at preserved overall cognitive functioning and delayed clinical onset of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Thus, we conducted this study to evaluate whether an association exists between psoriasis and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We searched for studies from six databases from inception to July 30, 2020, using subject and free words. RevMan 5.4 was used to calculate the risk ratio (RR) of dementia in the subjects with psoriasis. When heterogeneity was present, a random-effects model was used. Subgroup, sensitivity, and meta-regression analyses were performed using Stata 15.1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Nine studies were identified and included in the study, of which seven that involved a total of 3,638,487 participants were included in the meta-analysis. We found that among the patients with psoriasis (RR: 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06–1.24, p = 0.0009) and psoriatic arthritis (RR: 2.20, 95% CI: 1.29–3.78, p = 0.004), the proportions of those with non-vascular dementia (RR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.11–1.15, p &amp;lt; 0.00001) and vascular dementia (RR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.09–1.82, p = 0.009) were higher than that among the patients without psoriasis. Those with dementia were also more likely to develop psoriasis, and those with severe psoriasis were less likely to die from dementia (RR: 1.88, 95% CI: 0.72–4.90, p = 0.020). The meta-regression analysis did not show any significant sources of heterogeneity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis show high prevalence of different types of dementia. Based on the findings of this study, dementia may not be considered a high-risk factor of death from severe psoriasis. However, identification of this potential risk allows for early intervention, thereby reducing comorbidities and deaths.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;To investigate dysregulated molecules in preoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of elderly hip fracture patients with postoperative delirium (POD), in order to identify potential pathological mechanisms and biomarkers for pre-stage POD.&lt;/p&gt;Materials and Methods&lt;p&gt;This nested case control study used untargeted metabolomic and lipidomic analysis to profile the preoperative CSF of patients (n = 40) who developed POD undergone hip fracture surgery (n = 10) and those who did not (n = 30). Thirty Non-POD patients were matched to 10 POD patients by age (± 2 years) and Mini Mental State Examination score (± 2 points). CSF was collected after successful spinal anesthesia and banked for subsequent analysis. On the first two postoperative days, patients were assessed twice daily using the Confusion Assessment Method-Chinese Revision. CSF samples from the two groups were analyzed to investigate possible relevant pathological mechanisms and identify candidate biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Demographic characteristics of the groups were matched. Eighteen metabolites and thirty-three lipids were dysregulated in the preoperative CSF of POD patients. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed perturbations in D-glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism; glycerophospholipid metabolism; alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism; sphingolipid metabolism; histidine metabolism; and arginine biosynthesis at the pre-delirium stage. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that phosphatidylethanolamine (PE, 40:7e), with an area under the curve value of 0.92, is a potential biomarker for POD.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Multiple pathological mechanisms in the POD group were involved before surgery, including neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and energy metabolism disorders induced by hypoxia, as well as neurotransmitter imbalances such as increased dopamine and glutamate, and decreased glutamine. These metabolic abnormalities potentially increase the fragility of the brain, thus contributing to POD. PE (40:7e) might be a potential biomarker for POD. Not only do our results provide potential biomarkers for POD, but also provide information for deep pathological research.&lt;/p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration&lt;p&gt;www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier ChiCTR1900021533.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.550416</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Social cognition, in particular mindreading, enables the understanding of another individual’s feelings, intentions, desires, and mental states. The Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) captures the ability to identify mental states from gaze. We investigated RMET accuracy in the context of age and cognition across the whole adult age-range (19–79 years) in a very large population-based sample (N = 1,603) with linear regression models accounting for cognitive abilities, neurological diseases, and psychiatric disorders. Higher age predicted lower RMET performance in women and men, suggesting difficulties to infer mental states from gaze at older age. Effects remained stable when taking other cognitive abilities and psychiatric disorders or neurological diseases into account. Our results show that RMET performance as a measure of social cognition declines with increasing age.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

For many species, vision is one of the most important sensory modalities for mediating essential tasks that include navigation, predation and foraging, predator avoidance, and numerous social behaviors. The vertebrate visual process begins when photons of the light interact with rod and cone photoreceptors that are present in the neural retina. Vertebrate visual photopigments are housed within these photoreceptor cells and are sensitive to a wide range of wavelengths that peak within the light spectrum, the latter of which is a function of the type of chromophore used and how it interacts with specific amino acid residues found within the opsin protein sequence. Minor differences in the amino acid sequences of the opsins are known to lead to large differences in the spectral peak of absorbance (i.e. the λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; value). In our prior studies, we developed a new approach that combined homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulations to gather structural information associated with chromophore conformation, then used it to generate statistical models for the accurate prediction of λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; values for photopigments derived from Rh1 and Rh2 amino acid sequences. In the present study, we test our novel approach to predict the λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of phylogenetically distant Sws2 cone opsins. To build a model that can predict the λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; using our approach presented in our prior studies, we selected a spectrally-diverse set of 11 teleost Sws2 photopigments for which both amino acid sequence information and experimentally measured λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; values are known. The final first-order regression model, consisting of three terms associated with chromophore conformation, was sufficient to predict the λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of Sws2 photopigments with high accuracy. This study further highlights the breadth of our approach in reliably predicting λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; values of Sws2 cone photopigments, evolutionary-more distant from template bovine RH1, and provided mechanistic insights into the role of known spectral tuning sites.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ejyzi54XZog&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Calretinin and calbindin architecture of the midline thalamus associated with prefrontal–hippocampal circuitry</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23271?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The midline thalamus bidirectionally connects the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus (HC) creating a unique cortico‐thalamo‐cortical circuit fundamental to memory and executive function. While the anatomical connectivity of midline thalamus has been thoroughly investigated, little is known about its cellular organization within each nucleus. Here we used immunohistological techniques to examine cellular distributions in the midline thalamus based on the calcium binding proteins parvalbumin (PV), calretinin (CR), and calbindin (CB). We also examined these calcium binding proteins in a population of reuniens cells known to project to both mPFC and HC using a dual fluorescence retrograde adenoassociated virus‐based tracing approach. These dual reuniens mPFC‐HC projecting cells, in particular, are thought to be important for synchronizing mPFC and HC activity. First, we confirmed the absence of PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons in the midline thalamus. Second, we found a common pattern of CR&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells throughout midline thalamus with CR&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells running along the nearby third ventricle (3V) and penetrating the midline. CB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells were consistently more lateral and toward the middle of the dorsal‐ventral extent of the midline thalamus. Notably, single‐labeled CR&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; zones were partially overlapping and included dual‐labeled CR&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells. Within RE, we also observed a CR and CB subzone specific diversity. Interestingly, dual mPFC‐HC projecting neurons in RE expressed none of the calcium binding proteins examined, but were contained in nests of CR&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells. Overall, the midline thalamus was well organized into CR&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; rich zones distributed throughout the region, with dual mPFC‐HC projecting cells in reuniens representing a unique cell population. These results provide a cytoarchitectural organization in the midline thalamus based on calcium binding protein expression, and set the stage for future cell‐type specific interrogations of the functional role of these different cell populations in mPFC‐HC interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25941?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Exome sequencing was performed in two unrelated families with progressive myoclonus epilepsy. Affected individuals from both families shared a rare, homozygous c.191A&amp;gt;G variant affecting a splice site in &lt;i&gt;SLC7A6OS&lt;/i&gt;. Analysis of cDNA from lymphoblastoid cells demonstrated partial splice site abolition and the creation of an abnormal isoform. RT‐qPCR and western blot showed a marked reduction of protein expression. Haplotype analysis identified a ~0.85cM shared genomic region on chromosome 16q encompassing the c.191A&amp;gt;G variant, consistent with a distant ancestor common to both families. Our results suggest that bi‐allelic loss‐of‐function variants in &lt;i&gt;SLC7A6OS&lt;/i&gt; are a novel genetic cause of progressive myoclonus epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Regional brain growth trajectories in fetuses with congenital heart disease</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25940?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congenital heart disease (CHD) is associated with abnormal brain development &lt;i&gt;in utero&lt;/i&gt;. We applied innovative fetal MRI techniques to determine whether reduced fetal cerebral substrate delivery impacts the brain globally, or in a region‐specific pattern. Our novel design included two control groups–one with and the other without a family history of CHD–to explore the contribution of shared genes and/or fetal environment to brain development.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2014‐2018, we enrolled 179 pregnant women into four groups: “HLHS/TGA” fetuses with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) or transposition of the great arteries (TGA), diagnoses with lowest fetal cerebral substrate delivery; “CHD‐Other,” with other CHD diagnoses; “CHD‐Related,” healthy with a CHD family history; and “Optimal Control,” healthy without a family history. Two MRIs were obtained between 18‐40 weeks gestation. Random effect regression models assessed group differences in brain volumes and relationships to hemodynamic variables.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HLHS/TGA (n=24), CHD‐Other (50), and CHD‐Related (34) groups each had generally smaller brain volumes than the Optimal Controls (71). Compared with CHD‐Related, the HLHS/TGA group had smaller subplate (‐13.3% [standard error=4.3%], P&amp;lt;0.01) and intermediate (‐13.7% [4.3%], P&amp;lt;0.01) zones, with a similar trend in ventricular zone (‐7.1% [1.9%], P=0.07). These volumetric reductions were associated with lower cerebral substrate delivery.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fetuses with CHD, especially those with lowest cerebral substrate delivery, show a region‐specific pattern of small brain volumes and impaired brain growth before 32 weeks gestation. The brains of fetuses with CHD were more similar to those of CHD‐Related than Optimal controls, suggesting genetic or environmental factors also contribute.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Modeling psychological measurements with quantum instruments: Combination of question order effect, response replicability effect, and QQ-equality. (arXiv:2010.10444v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10444</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We continue to analyze matching of some basic constraints on human's decision
making with quantum theory of measurement. As was found, quantum measurement
theory based on the projection postulate does not match with combination of the
question order effect (QOE) and the response replicability effect (RRE). This
was the alarm signal for quantum-like modeling of decision making. Recently, it
was shown that this objection to quantum-like modeling can be removed on the
basis of the general measurement theory based on quantum instruments. In the
present paper, the problem of combination QOE, RRE with the famous QQ-equality
is analyzed. This equality was derived by Busemeyer and Wang and it was shown
(in the joint paper with Solloway and Shiffrin) that statistical data from many
social opinion polls satisfies it. Now, we construct quantum instruments
satisfying QQE, RRE, and QQ-inequality. Moreover, we show that this model
reproduces the statistics of the famous Clinton-Gore Poll data almost
faithfully with a prior belief state independent of the question order. This
model successfully removes the order effect from the data to determine the
genuine distribution of the opinion to the Poll. Independently of modeling of
the concrete psychological effects, the paper provides psychologist-friendly
presentation of the theory of quantum instruments - the most general
mathematical framework for quantum measurements. We hope that this theory will
attract attention of psychologists and generate further psychological
applications.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Performance of Dual-Augmented Lagrangian Method and Common Spatial Patterns applied in classification of Motor-Imagery BCI. (arXiv:2010.10359v1 [eess.SP])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10359</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Motor-imagery based brain-computer interfaces (MI-BCI) have the potential to
become ground-breaking technologies for neurorehabilitation, the
reestablishment of non-muscular communication and commands for patients
suffering from neuronal disorders and disabilities, but also outside of
clinical practice, for video game control and other entertainment purposes.
However, due to the noisy nature of the used EEG signal, reliable BCI systems
require specialized procedures for features optimization and extraction. This
paper compares the two approaches, the Common Spatial Patterns with Linear
Discriminant Analysis classifier (CSP-LDA), widely used in BCI for extracting
features in Motor Imagery (MI) tasks, and the Dual-Augmented Lagrangian (DAL)
framework with three different regularization methods: group sparsity with row
groups (DAL-GLR), dual-spectrum (DAL-DS) and l1-norm regularization (DAL-L1).
The test has been performed on 7 healthy subjects performing 5 BCI-MI sessions
each. The preliminary results show that DAL-GLR method outperforms standard
CSP-LDA, presenting 6.9% lower misclassification error (p-value = 0.008) and
demonstrate the advantage of DAL framework for MI-BCI.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Online adaptive group-wise sparse NPLS for ECoG neural signal decoding. (arXiv:2010.10353v1 [eess.SP])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10353</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) create a new communication
pathway between the brain and an effector without neuromuscular activation. BCI
experiments highlighted high intra and inter-subjects variability in the BCI
decoders. Although BCI model is generally relying on neurological markers
generalizable on the majority of subjects, it requires to generate a wide range
of neural features to include possible neurophysiological patterns. However,
the processing of noisy and high dimensional features, such as brain signals,
brings several challenges to overcome such as model calibration issues, model
generalization and interpretation problems and hardware related obstacles.
Approach. An online adaptive group-wise sparse decoder named Lp-Penalized
REW-NPLS algorithm (PREW-NPLS) is presented to reduce the feature space
dimension employed for BCI decoding. The proposed decoder was designed to
create BCI systems with low computational cost suited for portable applications
and tested during offline pseudo-online study based on online closed-loop BCI
control of the left and right 3D arm movements of a virtual avatar from the
ECoG recordings of a tetraplegic patient.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Main results. PREW-NPLS algorithm highlight at least as good decoding
performance as REW-NPLS algorithm. However, the decoding performance obtained
with PREW-NPLS were achieved thanks to sparse models with up to 64% and 75% of
the electrodes set to 0 for the left and right hand models respectively using
L1-PREW-NPLS.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Significance. The designed solution proposed an online incremental adaptive
algorithm suitable for online adaptive decoder calibration which estimate
sparse decoding solutions. The PREW-NPLS models are suited for portable
applications with low computational power using only small number of electrodes
with degrading the decoding performance.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10177</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Large, multi-dimensional spatio-temporal datasets are omnipresent in modern
science and engineering. An effective framework for handling such data are
Gaussian process deep generative models (GP-DGMs), which employ GP priors over
the latent variables of DGMs. Existing approaches for performing inference in
GP-DGMs do not support sparse GP approximations based on inducing points, which
are essential for the computational efficiency of GPs, nor do they handle
missing data -- a natural occurrence in many spatio-temporal datasets -- in a
principled manner. We address these shortcomings with the development of the
sparse Gaussian process variational autoencoder (SGP-VAE), characterised by the
use of partial inference networks for parameterising sparse GP approximations.
Leveraging the benefits of amortised variational inference, the SGP-VAE enables
inference in multi-output sparse GPs on previously unobserved data with no
additional training. The SGP-VAE is evaluated in a variety of experiments where
it outperforms alternative approaches including multi-output GPs and structured
VAEs.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Overlapping neural representations for the position of visible and imagined objects. (arXiv:2010.09932v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09932</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Humans can covertly track the position of an object, even if the object is
temporarily occluded. What are the neural mechanisms underlying our capacity to
track moving objects when there is no physical stimulus for the brain to track?
One possibility is that the brain 'fills-in' information about imagined objects
using internally generated representations similar to those generated by
feed-forward perceptual mechanisms. Alternatively, the brain might deploy a
higher order mechanism, for example using an object tracking model that
integrates visual signals and motion dynamics. In the present study, we used
EEG and time-resolved multivariate pattern analyses to investigate the spatial
processing of visible and imagined objects. Participants tracked an object that
moved in discrete steps around fixation, occupying six consecutive locations.
They were asked to imagine that the object continued on the same trajectory
after it disappeared and move their attention to the corresponding positions.
Time-resolved decoding of EEG data revealed that the location of the visible
stimuli could be decoded shortly after image onset, consistent with early
retinotopic visual processes. For processing of unseen/imagined positions, the
patterns of neural activity resembled stimulus-driven mid-level visual
processes, but were detected earlier than perceptual mechanisms, implicating an
anticipatory and more variable tracking mechanism. Encoding models revealed
that spatial representations were much weaker for imagined than visible
stimuli. Monitoring the position of imagined objects thus utilises similar
perceptual and attentional processes as monitoring objects that are actually
present, but with different temporal dynamics. These results indicate that
internally generated representations rely on top-down processes, and their
timing is influenced by the predictability of the stimulus.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09931</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep networks are gradually penetrating almost every domain in our lives due
to their amazing success. However, with substantive performance accuracy
improvements comes the price of \emph{irreproducibility}. Two identical models,
trained on the exact same training dataset may exhibit large differences in
predictions on individual examples even when average accuracy is similar,
especially when trained on highly distributed parallel systems. The popular
Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation has been key to recent success of deep
networks. We demonstrate, however, that ReLU is also a catalyzer to
irreproducibility in deep networks. We show that not only can activations
smoother than ReLU provide better accuracy, but they can also provide better
accuracy-reproducibility tradeoffs. We propose a new family of activations;
Smooth ReLU (\emph{SmeLU}), designed to give such better tradeoffs, while also
keeping the mathematical expression simple, and thus training speed fast and
implementation cheap. SmeLU is monotonic, mimics ReLU, while providing
continuous gradients, yielding better reproducibility. We generalize SmeLU to
give even more flexibility and then demonstrate that SmeLU and its generalized
form are special cases of a more general methodology of REctified Smooth
Continuous Unit (RESCU) activations. Empirical results demonstrate the superior
accuracy-reproducibility tradeoffs with smooth activations, SmeLU in
particular.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09923</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep networks have been revolutionary in improving performance of machine
learning and artificial intelligence systems. Their high prediction accuracy,
however, comes at a price of \emph{model irreproducibility\/} in very high
levels that do not occur with classical linear models. Two models, even if they
are supposedly identical, with identical architecture and identical trained
parameter sets, and that are trained on the same set of training examples,
while possibly providing identical average prediction accuracies, may predict
very differently on individual, previously unseen, examples. \emph{Prediction
differences\/} may be as large as the order of magnitude of the predictions
themselves. Ensembles have been shown to somewhat mitigate this behavior, but
without an extra push, may not be utilizing their full potential. In this work,
a novel approach, \emph{Anti-Distillation\/}, is proposed to address
irreproducibility in deep networks, where ensemble models are used to generate
predictions. Anti-Distillation forces ensemble components away from one another
by techniques like de-correlating their outputs over mini-batches of examples,
forcing them to become even more different and more diverse. Doing so enhances
the benefit of ensembles, making the final predictions more reproducible.
Empirical results demonstrate substantial prediction difference reductions
achieved by Anti-Distillation on benchmark and real datasets.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13254</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Robots operating in the real world will experience a range of different
environments and tasks. It is essential for the robot to have the ability to
adapt to its surroundings to work efficiently in changing conditions.
Evolutionary robotics aims to solve this by optimizing both the control and
body (morphology) of a robot, allowing adaptation to internal, as well as
external factors. Most work in this field has been done in physics simulators,
which are relatively simple and not able to replicate the richness of
interactions found in the real world. Solutions that rely on the complex
interplay between control, body, and environment are therefore rarely found. In
this paper, we rely solely on real-world evaluations and apply evolutionary
search to yield combinations of morphology and control for our mechanically
self-reconfiguring quadruped robot. We evolve solutions on two distinct
physical surfaces and analyze the results in terms of both control and
morphology. We then transition to two previously unseen surfaces to demonstrate
the generality of our method. We find that the evolutionary search finds
high-performing and diverse morphology-controller configurations by adapting
both control and body to the different properties of the physical environments.
We additionally find that morphology and control vary with statistical
significance between the environments. Moreover, we observe that our method
allows for morphology and control parameters to transfer to previously-unseen
terrains, demonstrating the generality of our approach.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02184</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Developmental Dyslexia (DD) is a learning disability related to the
acquisition of reading skills that affects about 5% of the population. DD can
have an enormous impact on the intellectual and personal development of
affected children, so early detection is key to implementing preventive
strategies for teaching language. Research has shown that there may be
biological underpinnings to DD that affect phoneme processing, and hence these
symptoms may be identifiable before reading ability is acquired, allowing for
early intervention. In this paper we propose a new methodology to assess the
risk of DD before students learn to read. For this purpose, we propose a mixed
neural model that calculates risk levels of dyslexia from tests that can be
completed at the age of 5 years. Our method first trains an auto-encoder, and
then combines the trained encoder with an optimized ordinal regression neural
network devised to ensure consistency of predictions. Our experiments show that
the system is able to detect unaffected subjects two years before it can assess
the risk of DD based mainly on phonological processing, giving a specificity of
0.969 and a correct rate of more than 0.92. In addition, the trained encoder
can be used to transform test results into an interpretable subject spatial
distribution that facilitates risk assessment and validates methodology.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Deep learning to achieve clinically applicable segmentation of head and neck anatomy for radiotherapy. (arXiv:1809.04430v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04430</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Over half a million individuals are diagnosed with head and neck cancer each
year worldwide. Radiotherapy is an important curative treatment for this
disease, but it requires manual time consuming delineation of radio-sensitive
organs at risk (OARs). This planning process can delay treatment, while also
introducing inter-operator variability with resulting downstream radiation dose
differences. While auto-segmentation algorithms offer a potentially time-saving
solution, the challenges in defining, quantifying and achieving expert
performance remain. Adopting a deep learning approach, we demonstrate a 3D
U-Net architecture that achieves expert-level performance in delineating 21
distinct head and neck OARs commonly segmented in clinical practice. The model
was trained on a dataset of 663 deidentified computed tomography (CT) scans
acquired in routine clinical practice and with both segmentations taken from
clinical practice and segmentations created by experienced radiographers as
part of this research, all in accordance with consensus OAR definitions. We
demonstrate the model's clinical applicability by assessing its performance on
a test set of 21 CT scans from clinical practice, each with the 21 OARs
segmented by two independent experts. We also introduce surface Dice similarity
coefficient (surface DSC), a new metric for the comparison of organ
delineation, to quantify deviation between OAR surface contours rather than
volumes, better reflecting the clinical task of correcting errors in the
automated organ segmentations. The model's generalisability is then
demonstrated on two distinct open source datasets, reflecting different centres
and countries to model training. With appropriate validation studies and
regulatory approvals, this system could improve the efficiency, consistency,
and safety of radiotherapy pathways.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: The Cerebellum on Cocaine</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.586574</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The traditional cerebellum’s role has been linked to the high computational demands for sensorimotor control. However, several findings have pointed to its involvement in executive and emotional functions in the last decades. First in 2009 and then, in 2016, we raised why we should consider the cerebellum when thinking about drug addiction. A decade later, mounting evidence strongly suggests the cerebellar involvement in this disorder. Nevertheless, direct evidence is still partial and related mainly to drug-induced reward memory, but recent results about cerebellar functions may provide new insights into its role in addiction. The present review does not intend to be a compelling revision on available findings, as we did in the two previous reviews. This minireview focuses on specific findings of the cerebellum’s role in drug-related reward memories and the way ahead for future research. The results discussed here provide grounds for involving the cerebellar cortex’s apical region in regulating behavior driven by drug-cue associations. They also suggest that the cerebellar cortex dysfunction may facilitate drug-induced learning by increasing glutamatergic output from the deep cerebellar nucleus (DCN) to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and neural activity in its projecting areas.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Spinal Cord Imaging Markers and Recovery of Volitional Leg Movement With Spinal Cord Epidural Stimulation in Individuals With Clinically Motor Complete Spinal Cord Injury</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.559313</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have shown that epidural stimulation of the lumbosacral spinal cord (scES) can re-enable lower limb volitional motor control in individuals with chronic, clinically motor complete spinal cord injury (SCI). This observation entails that residual supraspinal connectivity to the lumbosacral spinal circuitry still persisted after SCI, although it was non-detectable when scES was not provided. In the present study, we aimed at exploring further the mechanisms underlying scES-promoted recovery of volitional lower limb motor control by investigating neuroimaging markers at the spinal cord lesion site via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Spinal cord MRI was collected prior to epidural stimulator implantation in 13 individuals with chronic, clinically motor complete SCI, and the spared tissue of specific regions of the spinal cord (anterior, posterior, right, left, and total cord) was assessed. After epidural stimulator implantation, and prior to any training, volitional motor control was evaluated during left and right lower limb flexion and ankle dorsiflexion attempts. The ability to generate force exertion and movement was not correlated to any neuroimaging marker. On the other hand, spared tissue of specific cord regions significantly and importantly correlated with some aspects of motor control that include activation amplitude of antagonist (negative correlation) muscles during left ankle dorsiflexion, and electromyographic coordination patterns during right lower limb flexion. The fact that amount and location of spared spinal cord tissue at the lesion site were not related to the ability to generate volitional lower limb movements may suggest that supraspinal inputs through spared spinal cord regions that differ across individuals can result in the generation of lower limb volitional motor output prior to any training when epidural stimulation is provided.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Local Sleep Slow-Wave Activity Colocalizes With the Ictal Symptomatogenic Zone in a Patient With Reflex Epilepsy: A High-Density EEG Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.549309</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Slow-wave activity (SWA) during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep reflects synaptic potentiation during preceding wakefulness. Epileptic activity may induce increases in state-dependent SWA in human brains, therefore, localization of SWA may prove useful in the presurgical workup of epileptic patients. We analyzed high-density electroencephalography (HDEEG) data across vigilance states from a reflex epilepsy patient with a clearly localizable ictal symptomatogenic zone to provide a proof-of-concept for the testability of this hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Overnight HDEEG recordings were obtained in the patient during REM sleep, NREM sleep, wakefulness, and during a right facial motor seizure then compared to 10 controls. After preprocessing, SWA (i.e., delta power; 1–4 Hz) was calculated at each channel. Scalp level and source reconstruction analyses were computed. We assessed for statistical differences in maximum SWA between the patient and controls within REM sleep, NREM sleep, wakefulness, and seizure. Then, we completed an identical statistical comparison after first subtracting intrasubject REM sleep SWA from that of NREM sleep, wakefulness, and seizure SWA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The topographical analysis revealed greater left hemispheric SWA in the patient vs. controls in all vigilance states except REM sleep (which showed a right hemispheric maximum). Source space analysis revealed increased SWA in the left inferior frontal cortex during NREM sleep and wakefulness. Ictal data displayed poor source-space localization. Comparing each state to REM sleep enhanced localization accuracy; the most clearly localizing results were observed when subtracting REM sleep from wakefulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: State-dependent SWA during NREM sleep and wakefulness may help to identify aspects of the potential epileptogenic zone. Future work in larger cohorts may assess the clinical value of sleep SWA to help presurgical planning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.572312</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The development of methods for the activity-dependent tagging of neurons enabled a new way to tackle the problem of engram identification at the cellular level, giving rise to groundbreaking findings in the field of memory studies. However, the resolution of activity-dependent tagging remains limited to the whole-cell level. Notably, events taking place at the synapse level play a critical role in the establishment of new memories, and strong experimental evidence shows that learning and synaptic plasticity are tightly linked. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the currently available techniques that enable to identify and track the neuronal activity with synaptic spatial resolution. We also present recent technologies that allow to selectively interfere with specific subsets of synapses. Lastly, we discuss how these technologies can be applied to the study of learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Functional Interactions of Tau Phosphorylation Sites That Mediate Toxicity and Deficient Learning in Drosophila melanogaster</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.569520</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hyperphosphorylated Tau protein is the main component of the neurofibrillary tangles, characterizing degenerating neurons in Alzheimer’s disease and other Tauopathies. Expression of human Tau protein in Drosophila CNS results in increased toxicity, premature mortality and learning and memory deficits. Herein we use novel transgenic lines to investigate the contribution of specific phosphorylation sites previously implicated in Tau toxicity. These three different sites, Ser&lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;, Thr&lt;sup&gt;245&lt;/sup&gt;, and Ser&lt;sup&gt;262&lt;/sup&gt; were tested either by blocking their phosphorylation, by Ser/Thr to Ala substitution, or pseudophosphorylation, by changing Ser/Thr to Glu. We validate the hypothesis that phosphorylation at Ser&lt;sup&gt;262&lt;/sup&gt; is necessary for Tau-dependent learning deficits and a “facilitatory gatekeeper” to Ser&lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt; occupation, which is linked to Tau toxicity. Importantly we reveal that phosphorylation at Thr&lt;sup&gt;245&lt;/sup&gt; acts as a “suppressive gatekeeper”, preventing phosphorylation of many sites including Ser&lt;sup&gt;262&lt;/sup&gt; and consequently of Ser&lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;. Therefore, we elucidate novel interactions among phosphosites central to Tau mediated neuronal dysfunction and toxicity, likely driven by phosphorylation-dependent conformational plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Brain Computer Interface Treatment for Motor Rehabilitation of Upper Extremity of Stroke Patients—A Feasibility Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.591435</link>
	<content:encoded>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Numerous recent publications have explored Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) systems as rehabilitation tools to help subacute and chronic stroke patients recover upper extremity movement. Recent work has shown that BCI therapy can lead to better outcomes than conventional therapy. BCI combined with other techniques such as Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) and Virtual Reality (VR) allows to the user restore the neurological function by inducing the neural plasticity through improved real-time detection of motor imagery (MI) as patients perform therapy tasks.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Fifty-one stroke patients with upper extremity hemiparesis were recruited for this study. All participants performed 25 sessions with the MI BCI and assessment visits to track the functional changes before and after the therapy.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The results of this study demonstrated a significant increase in the motor function of the paretic arm assessed by Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA-UE), ΔFMA-UE = 4.68 points, P &amp;lt; 0.001, reduction of the spasticity in the wrist and fingers assessed by Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), ΔMAS-wrist = -0.72 points (SD = 0.83), P &amp;lt; 0.001, ΔMAS-fingers = -0.63 points (SD = 0.82), P &amp;lt; 0.001. Other significant improvements in the grasp ability were detected in the healthy hand. All these functional improvements achieved during the BCI therapy persisted 6 months after the therapy ended. Results also showed that patients with Motor Imagery accuracy (MI) above 80% increase 3.16 points more in the FMA than patients below this threshold (95% CI; [1.47–6.62], P = 0.003). The functional improvement was not related with the stroke severity or with the stroke stage.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The BCI treatment used here was effective in promoting long lasting functional improvements in the upper extremity in stroke survivors with severe, moderate and mild impairment. This functional improvement can be explained by improved neuroplasticity in the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cerebral syphilitic gumma is a rare disease and can be misdiagnosed as a common brain tumor when only conventional imaging results are adopted. Differentiating between syphilitic gumma and tumors may be achieved by applying advanced magnetic resonance (MR) techniques, such as MR spectroscopy and MR perfusion. However, the MR perfusion characteristics of cerebral syphilitic gumma have not been reported yet. Here, we report a case of cerebral syphilitic gumma in a 52-year-old woman and discuss the imaging features of conventional MR, MR spectroscopy, and MR perfusion. The results suggest that the application of MR spectroscopy and MR perfusion could provide additional information that contributes to the diagnosis of cerebral syphilitic gumma.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Determination of the Time Window of Event-Related Potential Using Multiple-Set Consensus Clustering</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.521595</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Clustering is a promising tool for grouping the sequence of similar time-points aimed to identify the attention blocks in spatiotemporal event-related potentials (ERPs) analysis. It is most likely to elicit the appropriate time window for ERP of interest if a suitable clustering method is applied to spatiotemporal ERP. However, how to reliably estimate a proper time window from entire individual subjects’ data is still challenging. In this study, we developed a novel multiset consensus clustering method in which several clustering results of multiple subjects were combined to retrieve the best fitted clustering for all the subjects within a group. Then, the obtained clustering was processed by a newly proposed time-window detection method to determine the most suitable time window for identifying the ERP of interest in each condition/group. Applying the proposed method to the simulated ERP data and real data indicated that the brain responses from the individual subjects can be collected to determine a reliable time window for different conditions/groups. Our results revealed more precise time windows to identify N2 and P3 components in the simulated data compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, our proposed method achieved more robust performance and outperformed statistical analysis results in the real data for N300 and prospective positivity components. To conclude, the proposed method successfully estimates the time window for ERP of interest by processing the individual data, offering new venues for spatiotemporal ERP processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: ANSH: Multimodal Neuroimaging Database Including MR Spectroscopic Data From Each Continent to Advance Alzheimer’s Disease Research</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.571039</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions of people worldwide. The etiology of AD is not known, and intense research involving multimodal neuroimaging data (e.g., MRI, functional MRI, PET etc.) is extensively used to identify the causal molecular process for AD. In this context, various imaging-based databases accessible to researchers globally, are useful for an independent analysis. Apart from MRI-based brain imaging data, the neurochemical data using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) provide early molecular processes before the structural or functional changes are manifested. The existing imaging-based databases in AD lack the integration of MRS modality and, thus, limits the availability of neurochemical information to the AD research community. This perspective is an initiative to bring attention to the development of the neuroimaging database, “ANSH,” that includes brain glutathione (GSH), gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels, and other neurochemicals along with MRI-based information for AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and healthy subjects. ANSH is supported by a JAVA-based workflow environment and python providing a simple, dynamic, and distributed platform with data security. The platform consists of two-tiered architecture for data collection and management further supporting quality control, report generation for analyzed data, and data backup with a dedicated storage system. The ANSH database aims to present a single neuroimaging data platform incorporating diverse data types from healthy control and patient groups to provide better insights pertaining to disease progression. This data management platform provides flexible data sharing across users with continuous project monitoring. The development of ANSH platform will facilitate collaborative research and multi-site data sharing across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.581090</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Considerable variability exists in the publication of clinical research study procedures related to study enrollment and participant exit from clinical trials. Despite recent efforts to encourage research data sharing and greater transparency regarding research outcomes, reporting of research procedures remains inconsistent. Transparency about study procedures has important implications for the interpretation of study outcomes and the consistent implementation of best practices in clinical trial design and conduct. This review of publications from clinical trials of deep brain stimulation (DBS) using the MEDLINE database examines the frequency and consistency of publication of research procedures and data related to exit from DBS research. Related considerations, such as device explant or continued use, battery and other device hardware replacements, and post-trial follow-up care are also reviewed. This review finds significant variability in the publication and reporting of study exit procedures. Of the 47 clinical trials included in this review, 19% (9) disclosed procedures related to exit from research. Reporting of other exit-related data and study procedures examined in this review was identified in fewer than half of the included clinical trials. The rate of participant retention and duration of follow-up was reported more than any other category of data included in this review. Results inform efforts to improve consistency in research design, conduct, and publication of results from clinical trials in DBS and related areas of clinical research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.576171</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Associative motor cortical plasticity can be non-invasively induced by paired median nerve electric stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the primary motor cortex (M1). This study investigates whether a simultaneous motor reaction of the other hand advances the associative plasticity in M1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Twenty-four right-handed subjects received conventional paired associative stimulation (PAS) and PAS with simultaneous motor reaction (PASmr) with at least a 1-week interval. The PASmr protocol additionally included left abductor pollicis brevis muscle movement responding to a digital sound. The motor reaction time was individually measured. The M1 excitability was examined by the motor evoked potential (MEP), short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), and intracortical facilitation (ICF) before and after the PAS protocols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The conventional PAS protocol significantly facilitated MEP and suppressed SICI. A negative correlation between the reaction time and the MEP change, and a positive correlation between the reaction time and the ICF change were found in the PASmr protocol. By subgrouping analysis, we further found significant facilitation of MEP and a reduction of ICF in the subjects with fast reaction times but not in those with slow reaction times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Synchronized motor reaction ipsilateral to the stimulated M1 induces associative M1 motor plasticity through the spike-timing dependent principle. MEP and ICF change could represent this kind of plasticity. The current findings provide a novel insight into designing rehabilitation programs concerning motor function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Impact of Medical Complications in Predicting the Rehabilitation Outcome of Patients With Disorders of Consciousness After Severe Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.570544</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this study, we sought to assess the predictors of outcome in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) during neurorehabilitation stay. In total, 96 patients with DOC (vegetative state, minimally conscious state, or emergence from minimally conscious state) were enrolled (69 males; mean age 43.6 ± 20.8 years) and the improvement of the degree of disability, as assessed by the Disability Rating Scale, was considered the main outcome measure. To define the best predictor, a series of demographical and clinical factors were modeled using a twofold approach: (1) logistic regression to evaluate a possible causal effect among variables; and (2) machine learning algorithms (ML), to define the best predictive model. Univariate analysis demonstrated that disability in DOC patients statistically decreased at the discharge with respect to admission. Genitourinary was the most frequent medical complication (MC) emerging during the neurorehabilitation period. The logistic model revealed that the total amount of MCs is a risk factor for lack of functional improvement. ML discloses that the most important prognostic factors are the respiratory and hepatic complications together with the presence of the upper gastrointestinal comorbidities. Our study provides new evidence on the most adverse short-term factors predicting a functional recovery in DOC patients after severe TBI. The occurrence of medical complications during neurorehabilitation stay should be considered to avoid poor outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.580564</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: This study aimed to explore alterations in the topological properties of the functional brain network in primary Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients with freezing of gait (PD-FOG).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (Rs-fMRI) data were obtained in 23 PD-FOG patients, 33 PD patients without FOG (PD-nFOG), and 24 healthy control (HC) participants. The whole-brain functional connectome was constructed by thresholding the Pearson correlation matrices of 90 brain regions, and topological properties were analyzed by using graph theory approaches. The network-based statistics (NBS) method was used to determine the suprathreshold connected edges (P &amp;lt; 0.05; threshold T = 2.725), and statistical significance was estimated by using the non-parametric permutation method (5,000 permutations). Statistically significant topological properties were further evaluated for their relationship with clinical neurological scales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The topological properties of the functional brain network in PD-FOG and PD-nFOG showed no abnormalities at the global level. However, compared with HCs, PD-FOG patients showed decreased nodal local efficiency in several brain regions, including the bilateral striatum, frontoparietal areas, visual cortex, and bilateral superior temporal gyrus, increased nodal local efficiency in the left gyrus rectus. When compared with PD-nFOG patients and HCs, PD-FOG showed increased betweenness centrality in the left hippocampus. Moreover, compared to HCs, both PD-FOG and PD-nFOG patients displayed reduced network connections by using the NBS method, mainly involving the sensorimotor cortex (SM), visual network (VN), default mode network (DMN), auditory network (AN), dorsal attention network (DAN), subcortical regions, and limbic network (LIM). The local node efficiency of the right temporal pole: superior temporal gyrus in PD-FOG patients was positively correlated with the Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (FOGQ) scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: This study demonstrates the disrupted regional topological organization in PD-FOG patients, especially associated with damage to the subcortical regions and multiple cortical regions. Our results provide insights into the dysfunctional mechanisms of the relevant networks and indicate potential neuroimaging biomarkers of PD-FOG.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>In the hippocampus, a widely accepted model posits that the dentate gyrus improves learning and memory by enhancing discrimination between inputs. To test this model, we studied conditional knockout mice in which the vast majority of dentate granule cells (DGCs) fail to develop – including nearly all DGCs in the dorsal hippocampus – secondary to eliminating &lt;i&gt;Wntless&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Wls&lt;/i&gt;) in a subset of cortical progenitors with &lt;i&gt;Gfap-Cre&lt;/i&gt;. Other cells in the &lt;i&gt;Wls&lt;sup&gt;fl/-&lt;/sup&gt;;Gfap-Cre&lt;/i&gt; hippocampus were minimally affected, as determined by single nucleus RNA sequencing. CA3 pyramidal cells, the targets of DGC-derived mossy fibers, exhibited normal morphologies with a small reduction in the numbers of synaptic spines. &lt;i&gt;Wls&lt;sup&gt;fl/-&lt;/sup&gt;;Gfap-Cre&lt;/i&gt; mice have a modest performance decrement in several complex spatial tasks, including active place avoidance. They were also modestly impaired in one simpler spatial task, finding a visible platform in the Morris water maze. These experiments support a role for DGCs in enhancing spatial learning and memory.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61991</link>
	<content:encoded>A small fraction of HIV-1- infected humans develop broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against HIV-1 that protect macaques from simian immunodeficiency HIV chimeric virus (SHIV). Similarly, a small number of macaques infected with SHIVs develop broadly neutralizing serologic activity, but less is known about the nature of simian antibodies. Here, we report on a monoclonal antibody, Ab1485, isolated from a macaque infected with SHIVAD8 that developed broadly neutralizing serologic activity targeting the V3-glycan region of HIV-1 Env. Ab1485 neutralizes 38.1% of HIV-1 isolates in a 42-pseudovirus panel with a geometric mean IC50 of 0.055 µg/mLl and SHIVAD8 with an IC50 of 0.028 µg/mLl. Ab1485 binds the V3-glycan epitope in a glycan-dependent manner. A 3.5 Å cryo-electron microscopy structure of Ab1485 in complex with a native-like SOSIP Env trimer showed conserved contacts with the N332gp120 glycan and gp120 GDIR peptide motif, but in a distinct Env-binding orientation relative to human V3/N332gp120 glycan-targeting bNAbs. Intravenous infusion of Ab1485 protected macaques from a high dose challenge with SHIVAD8. We conclude that macaques can develop bNAbs against the V3-glycan patch that resemble human V3-glycan bNAbs.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Several MRI measures have been proposed as in vivo biomarkers of myelin, each with applications ranging from plasticity to pathology. Despite the availability of these myelin-sensitive modalities, specificity and sensitivity have been a matter of discussion. Debate about which MRI measure is the most suitable for quantifying myelin is still ongoing. In this study, we performed a systematic review of published quantitative validation studies to clarify how different these measures are when compared to the underlying histology. We analysed the results from 43 studies applying meta-analysis tools, controlling for study sample size and using interactive visualization (https://neurolibre.github.io/myelin-meta-analysis). We report the overall estimates and the prediction intervals for the coefficient of determination and find that MT and relaxometry-based measures exhibit the highest correlations with myelin content. We also show which measures are, and which measures are not statistically different regarding their relationship with histology.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Extracellular Hedgehog (Hh) proteins induce transcriptional changes in target cells by inhibiting the proteolytic processing of full-length Drosophila Ci or mammalian Gli proteins to nuclear transcriptional repressors and by activating the full-length Ci or Gli proteins. We used Ci variants expressed at physiological levels to investigate the contributions of these mechanisms to dose-dependent Hh signaling in Drosophila wing imaginal discs. Ci variants that cannot be processed supported a normal pattern of graded target gene activation and the development of adults with normal wing morphology, when supplemented by constitutive Ci repressor, showing that Hh can signal normally in the absence of regulated processing. The processing-resistant Ci variants were also significantly activated in the absence of Hh by elimination of Cos2, likely acting through binding the CORD domain of Ci, or PKA, revealing separate inhibitory roles of these two components in addition to their well-established roles in promoting Ci processing.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Sleep is essential but incompatible with other behaviors, and thus sleep drive competes with other motivations. We previously showed &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; males balance sleep and courtship via octopaminergic neurons that act upstream of courtship-regulating P1 neurons (Machado et al., 2017). Here we show nutrition modulates the sleep-courtship balance and identify sleep-regulatory neurons downstream of P1 neurons. Yeast-deprived males exhibited attenuated female-induced nighttime sleep loss yet normal daytime courtship, which suggests male flies consider nutritional status in deciding whether the potential benefit of pursuing female partners outweighs the cost of losing sleep. Trans-synaptic tracing and calcium imaging identified dopaminergic neurons projecting to the protocerebral bridge (DA-PB) as postsynaptic partners of P1 neurons. Activation of DA-PB neurons led to reduced sleep in normally fed but not yeast-deprived males. Additional PB-projecting neurons regulated male sleep, suggesting several groups of PB-projecting neurons act downstream of P1 neurons to mediate nutritional modulation of the sleep-courtship balance.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Artemisinin exposure at the ring or trophozoite stage impacts Plasmodium falciparum sexual conversion differently</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60058</link>
	<content:encoded>Malaria transmission is dependent on the formation of gametocytes in the human blood. The sexual conversion rate, the proportion of asexual parasites that convert into gametocytes at each multiplication cycle, is variable and reflects the relative parasite investment between transmission and maintaining the infection. The impact of environmental factors such as drugs on sexual conversion rates is not well understood. We developed a robust assay using gametocyte-reporter parasite lines to accurately measure the impact of drugs on sexual conversion rates, independently from their gametocytocidal activity. We found that exposure to subcurative doses of the frontline antimalarial drug dihydroartemisinin (DHA) at the trophozoite stage resulted in a ~ fourfold increase in sexual conversion. In contrast, no increase was observed when ring stages were exposed or in cultures in which sexual conversion was stimulated by choline depletion. Our results reveal a complex relationship between antimalarial drugs and sexual conversion, with potential public health implications.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Gene expression variability in human and chimpanzee populations share common determinants</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59929</link>
	<content:encoded>Inter-individual variation in gene expression has been shown to be heritable and is often associated with differences in disease susceptibility between individuals. Many studies focused on mapping associations between genetic and gene regulatory variation, yet much less attention has been paid to the evolutionary processes that shape the observed differences in gene regulation between individuals in humans or any other primate. To begin addressing this gap, we performed a comparative analysis of gene expression variability and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in humans and chimpanzees, using gene expression data from primary heart samples. We found that expression variability in both species is often determined by non-genetic sources, such as cell-type heterogeneity. However, we also provide evidence that inter-individual variation in gene regulation can be genetically controlled, and that the degree of such variability is generally conserved in humans and chimpanzees. In particular, we found a significant overlap of orthologous genes associated with eQTLs in both species. We conclude that gene expression variability in humans and chimpanzees often evolves under similar evolutionary pressures.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Functional reconstitution of a bacterial CO2 concentrating mechanism in E. coli</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59882</link>
	<content:encoded>Many photosynthetic organisms employ a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrating mechanism (CCM) to increase the rate of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation via the Calvin cycle. CCMs catalyze ≈50% of global photosynthesis, yet it remains unclear which genes and proteins are required to produce this complex adaptation. We describe the construction of a functional CCM in a non-native host, achieved by expressing genes from an autotrophic bacterium in an &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; strain engineered to depend on rubisco carboxylation for growth. Expression of 20 CCM genes enabled &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; to grow by fixing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from ambient air into biomass, with growth in ambient air depending on the components of the CCM. Bacterial CCMs are therefore genetically compact and readily transplanted, rationalizing their presence in diverse bacteria. Reconstitution enabled genetic experiments refining our understanding of the CCM, thereby laying the groundwork for deeper study and engineering of the cell biology supporting CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; assimilation in diverse organisms.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Structural and functional characterization of G protein-coupled receptors with deep mutational scanning</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54895</link>
	<content:encoded>In humans, the &amp;gt;800 G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are responsible for transducing diverse chemical stimuli to alter cell state, and are the largest class of drug targets. Their myriad structural conformations and various modes of signaling make it challenging to understand their structure and function. Here we developed a platform to characterize large libraries of GPCR variants in human cell lines with a barcoded transcriptional reporter of G-protein signal transduction. We tested 7,800 of 7,828 possible single amino acid substitutions to the beta-2 adrenergic receptor (β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AR) at four concentrations of the agonist isoproterenol. We identified residues specifically important for β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AR signaling, mutations in the human population that are potentially loss of function, and residues that modulate basal activity. Using unsupervised learning, we resolve residues critical for signaling, including all major structural motifs and molecular interfaces. We also find a previously uncharacterized structural latch spanning the first two extracellular loops that is highly conserved across Class A GPCRs and is conformationally rigid in both the inactive and active states of the receptor. More broadly, by linking deep mutational scanning with engineered transcriptional reporters, we establish a generalizable method for exploring pharmacogenomics, structure and function across broad classes of drug receptors.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: ARID1A loss in adult hepatocytes activates β-catenin-mediated erythropoietin transcription</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53550</link>
	<content:encoded>Erythropoietin (EPO) is a key regulator of erythropoiesis. The embryonic liver is the main site of erythropoietin synthesis, after which the kidney takes over. The adult liver retains the ability to express EPO, and we discovered here new players of this transcription, distinct from the classical hypoxia-inducible factor pathway. In mice genetically-invalidated in hepatocytes for the chromatin remodeler &lt;i&gt;Arid1a&lt;/i&gt;, and for &lt;i&gt;Apc&lt;/i&gt;, the major silencer of Wnt pathway, chromatin was more accessible and histone marks turned into active ones at the &lt;i&gt;Epo &lt;/i&gt;downstream enhancer. Activating β-catenin signaling increased binding of Tcf4/β-catenin complex and upregulated its enhancer function. The loss of &lt;i&gt;Arid1a&lt;/i&gt; together with β-catenin signaling, resulted in cell-autonomous &lt;i&gt;EPO &lt;/i&gt;transcription in mouse and human hepatocytes. In mice with &lt;i&gt;Apc-Arid1a&lt;/i&gt; gene invalidations in single hepatocytes, Epo &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; synthesis led to its secretion, to splenic erythropoiesis and to dramatic erythrocytosis. Thus, we identified new hepatic &lt;i&gt;EPO&lt;/i&gt; regulation mechanism stimulating erythropoiesis.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) is the most widely distributed tick-borne viral infection in the world. Strikingly, reported mortality rates for CCHF are extremely variable, ranging from 5 to 80% (1). CCHF virus (CCHFV, &lt;i&gt;Nairoviridae&lt;/i&gt;) exhibits extensive genomic sequence diversity across strains (2, 3). It is currently unknown if genomic diversity is a factor contributing to variation in its pathogenicity. We obtained complete genome sequences of CCHFV directly from the tick reservoir. These new strains belong to a solitary lineage named Europe 2 that is circumstantially reputed to be less pathogenic than the epidemic strains from Europe 1 lineage. We identified a single tick-specific amino acid variant in the viral glycoprotein region that dramatically reduces its fusion activity in human cells, providing evidence that a GPC variant, present in ticks, have severely impaired function in human cells.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The transcription factor estrogen receptor  (ER) is a principal regulator of sex differences in the vertebrate brain and can modulate mood, behavior, and energy balance in females and males. However, the genes regulated by ER in the brain remain largely unknown. Here we reveal the genomic binding of ER within a sexually dimorphic neural circuit that regulates social behaviors. We profiled gene expression and chromatin accessibility and show ER induces a neurodevelopmental gene program in adulthood. We further demonstrate that ER binds with Nuclear factor I X-type (Nfix) to regulate a male-biased gene expression program that initiates in early life. Our results reveal a neural strategy for ER-mediated gene regulation and provide molecular targets that underlie estrogen's effects on brain development, behavior, and disease.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.21.349191v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Alpha-synuclein () is a small protein involved in neurodegenerative diseases known as synucleinopathies. The phosphorylated form (psyn) is the primary component of protein aggregates known as Lewy bodies (LBs), which are the hallmark of diseases such as Parkinsons disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Synucleinopathies might spread in a prion-like fashion, leading to a progressive emergence of symptoms over time. syn pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) induce LB-like pathology in wild-type (WT) mice, but there are remaining questions about the progressive spreading of pathology and the cognitive and behavioral effects. Here, we induced LB-like pathology in the bilateral motor cortex of WT mice and assessed behavioral and cognitive performance. As there are no long-term effective treatments for synucleinopathies, and no therapies slow or reduce the spreading of LBs, we also assessed the effects of a mouse syn-targeted antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) on pathology and behavioral and cognitive performance starting 5 weeks after ASO treatment. At 3 months post-PFF injection (mpi), mice injected with PFFs showed cognitive impairments and mild motor impairments. At 6 mpi, PFF-injected mice showed further cognitive and motor impairments that were partially ameliorated by the ASO. ASO treatment also reduced LB-like pathology, and pathology was significantly correlated with cognitive measures. However, the particular mouse ASO used in these assays was also associated with some possible off-target effects, defined as effects not involving lowering of syn, such as a decline in body weight. These results add to what is known about the progressive nature of the PFF model of synucleinopathies. These data also support the therapeutic potential of ASOs to improve Lewy pathology and associated behavioral and cognitive phenotypes.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.21.348557v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In recent years research on natural speech processing has benefited from recognizing that low frequency cortical activity tracks the amplitude envelope of natural speech. However, it remains unclear to what extent this tracking reflects speech-specific processing beyond the analysis of the stimulus acoustics. In the present study, we aimed to disentangle contributions to cortical envelope tracking that reflect general acoustic processing from those that are functionally related to processing speech. To do so, we recorded EEG from subjects as they listened to 'auditory chimeras', stimuli comprised of the temporal fine structure (TFS) of one speech stimulus modulated by the amplitude envelope (ENV) of another speech stimulus. By varying the number of frequency bands used in making the chimeras, we obtained some control over which speech stimulus was recognized by the listener. No matter which stimulus was recognized, envelope tracking was always strongest for the ENV stimulus, indicating a dominant contribution from acoustic processing. However, there was also a positive relationship between intelligibility and the tracking of the perceived speech, indicating a contribution from speech specific processing. These findings were supported by a follow-up analysis that assessed envelope tracking as a function of the (estimated) output of the cochlea rather than the original stimuli used in creating the chimeras. Finally, we sought to isolate the speech-specific contribution to envelope tracking using forward encoding models and found that indices of phonetic feature processing tracked reliably with intelligibility. Together these results show that cortical speech tracking is dominated by acoustic processing, but also reflects speech-specific processing.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.21.348367v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Predicting individual differences in cognitive processes is crucial, but the ability of task-based fMRI to do so remains dubious, despite decades of costly research. We tested the ability of working-memory fMRI in predicting working-memory, using the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (n = 4,350). The conventionally-used mass-univariate approach led to poor out-of-sample prediction (Mean r = .1-.12). However, the multivariate Elastic Net, which draws information across brain regions, enhanced out-of-sample prediction (r = .47) by several folds. The Elastic Net also enabled us to predict cognitive performance from various tasks collected outside of the scanner, highlighting its generalizability. Moreover, using an omics-inspired approach, we combined Elastic Net with permutation, allowing us to statistically infer which brain regions contribute to individual differences while accounting for collinearity. Accordingly, our framework can build an easy-to-interpret predictive fMRI model that transfers knowledge learned from large-scale datasets to smaller samples, akin to polygenic scores in genomics.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.21.348359v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Few studies in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) focus on the premotor interneurons synapsing onto motoneurons (MNs). We hypothesized inhibitory interneurons contribute to dysfunction, particularly if altered before MN neuropathology. We directly assessed excitability and morphology of ventral lumbar glycinergic interneurons from SOD1G93AGlyT2eGFP (SOD1) and wildtype GlyT2eGFP (WT) mice. SOD1 interneurons were smaller but density was unchanged. Patch clamp revealed dampened excitability in SOD1 interneurons, including depolarized PICs and voltage threshold. Renshaw cells (RCs; confirmed with immunohistochemistry) showed similar dampened excitability. Morphology and electrophysiology were used to create a random forest statistical model to predict RCs when histological verification was not possible. Predicted SOD1 RCs were less excitable (consistent with experimental results); predicted SOD1 non-RCs were more excitable. In summary, inhibitory interneurons show very early perturbations poised to impact MNs, modify motor output, and provide early biomarkers of ALS. Therapeutics like riluzole that universally reduce CNS excitability could exacerbate this dysfunction.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Post-translational modification of a protein with glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) is a conserved mechanism exists in all eukaryotes. Thus far, more than 150 human GPI anchored proteins have been discovered and about 30 enzymes have been reported to be involved in the biosynthesis and maturation of mammalian GPI. Phosphatidylinositol glycan biosynthesis class A protein (PIGA) catalyzes the very first step of GPI anchor biosynthesis. Patients carrying a mutation of the PIGA gene usually suffer from intractable epilepsy and intellectual developmental disorder. We generated three mouse models with PIGA deficits specifically in telencephalon excitatory neurons (Ex-M-cko), inhibitory neurons (In-M-cko), or thalamic neurons (Th-H-cko), respectively. Both Ex-M-cko and In-M-cko mice showed impaired long-term fear memory and were more susceptible to kainic acid (KA)-induced seizures. In addition, In-M-cko demonstrated a severe limb-clasping phenotype. Hippocampal synapse changes were observed in Ex-M-cko mice. Our Piga conditional knockout mouse models provide powerful tools to understand the cell-type specific mechanisms underlying inherited GPI deficiency and to test different therapeutic modalities.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>In Parkinson's disease (PD) misfolded alpha-synuclein (aSyn) accumulates in the substantia nigra, where dopaminergic neurons are progressively lost. The mechanisms underlying aSyn pathology are still unclear but hypothesized to involve the autophagy lysosome pathways (ALP). LRRK2 mutations are a major cause of familial and sporadic PD, hyperactivate kinase activity and its pharmacological inhibition reduces pS129-aSyn inclusions. We observed selective downregulation of the novel PD risk factor RIT2 in G2019S-LRRK2 expressing cells. Here we studied whether RIT2 could modulate LRRK2 kinase activity. RIT2 overexpression in G2019S-LRRK2 cells rescued ALP abnormalities and diminished aSyn inclusions. In vivo, viral mediated overexpression of RIT2 operated neuroprotection against AAV-A53T-aSyn. Furthermore, RIT2 overexpression prevented the A53T-aSyn-dependent increase of LRRK2 kinase activity in vivo. Our data indicate that RIT2 inhibits overactive LRRK2 to ameliorate ALP impairment and counteract aSyn aggregation and related deficits. Targeting RIT2 could represent a novel strategy to combat neuropathology in familial and idiopathic PD.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) ensure proper communication between motor neurons and muscle through the release of neurotransmitters. In motor neuron disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), NMJs degenerate resulting in muscle atrophy, paralysis and respiratory failure. The aim of this study was to establish a versatile and reproducible in vitro model of a human motor unit to study the effect of ALS-causing mutations. Therefore, we generated a co-culture of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived motor neurons and human primary mesoangioblast-derived myotubes in microfluidic devices. A chemotactic and volumetric gradient facilitated the growth of motor neuron neurites through microgrooves resulting in the interaction with myotubes and the formation of NMJs. We observed that ALS-causing FUS mutations resulted in a reduced neurite outgrowth and in a decreased NMJ number. Interestingly, the selective HDAC6 inhibitor, Tubastatin A, improved the neurite outgrowth and the NMJ morphology of FUS-ALS co-cultures, further prompting HDAC6 inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy for ALS.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.21.345876v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In most everyday life situations, the brain needs to engage not only in making decisions, but also in anticipating and predicting the behavior of others. In such contexts, gaze can be highly informative about others' intentions, goals and upcoming decisions. Here, we investigated whether a humanoid robot's gaze (mutual or averted) influences the way people strategically reason in a social decision-making context. Specifically, participants played a strategic game with the robot iCub while we measured their behavior and neural (EEG) activity. Participants were slower to respond when iCub established mutual gaze prior to their decision, relative to averted gaze. This was associated with a higher decision threshold in the drift diffusion model and accompanied by more synchronized EEG alpha activity. In addition, we found that participants reasoned about the robot's actions in both conditions. However, those who mostly experienced the averted gaze were more likely to adopt a self-oriented strategy and their neural activity showed higher sensitivity to outcome. Altogether, these findings suggest that robot gaze acts as a strong social signal for humans, modulating response times, decision threshold, neural synchronization, as well as choice strategies and sensitivity outcomes. This has strong implications for all contexts involving human-robot interaction, from robotics to clinical applications.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The prion protein is not required for peripheral nerve repair after crush injury</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.348011v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The cellular prion protein (PrP) is essential to the long-term maintenance of myelin sheaths in peripheral nerves. PrP activates the adhesion G-protein coupled receptor Adgrg6 on Schwann cells and initiates a pro-myelination cascade of molecular signals. Because Adgrg6 is crucial for peripheral myelin development and regeneration after nerve injury, we investigated the role of PrP in peripheral nerve repair. We performed experimental sciatic nerve crush injuries in co-isogenic wild-type and PrP-deficient mice, and examined peripheral nerve repair processes. Generation of repair Schwann cells, macrophage recruitment and remyelination were similar in PrP-deficient and wild-type mice. We conclude that PrP is dispensable for sciatic nerve regeneration after crush injury. Adgrg6 may sustain its function in peripheral nerve repair independently of its activation by PrP.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Multidimensional face representation in deep convolutional neural network reveals the mechanism underlying AI racism</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.347898v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The increasingly popular application of AI runs the risks of amplifying social bias, such as classifying non-white faces to animals. Recent research has attributed the bias largely to data for training. However, the underlying mechanism is little known, and therefore strategies to rectify the bias are unresolved. Here we examined a typical deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), VGG-Face, which was trained with a face dataset consisting of more white faces than black and Asian faces. The transfer learning result showed significantly better performance in identifying white faces, just like the well-known social bias in human, the other-race effect (ORE). To test whether the effect resulted from the imbalance of face images, we retrained the VGG-Face with a dataset containing more Asian faces, and found a reverse ORE that the newly-trained VGG-Face preferred Asian faces over white faces in identification accuracy. In addition, when the number of Asian faces and white faces were matched in the dataset, the DCNN did not show any bias. To further examine how imbalanced image input led to the ORE, we performed the representational similarity analysis on VGG-Face's activation. We found that when the dataset contained more white faces, the representation of white faces was more distinct, indexed by smaller ingroup similarity and larger representational Euclidean distance. That is, white faces were scattered more sparsely in the representational face space of the VGG-Face than the other faces. Importantly, the distinctiveness of faces was positively correlated with the identification accuracy, which explained the ORE observed in the VGG-Face. In sum, our study revealed the mechanism underlying the ORE in DCNNs, which provides a novel approach of study AI ethics. In addition, the face multidimensional representation theory discovered in human was found also applicable to DCNNs, advocating future studies to apply more cognitive theories to understand DCNN's behavior.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>In human speech and communication across various species, recognizing sounds is fundamental for the selection of appropriate behaviors. But how does the brain decide which action to perform based on sounds? We explored whether the premotor supplementary motor area (SMA), responsible for linking sensory information to motor programs, also accounts for auditory-driven decision making. To this end, we trained two rhesus monkeys to discriminate between numerous naturalistic sounds and words learned as target (T) or non-target (nT) categories. We demonstrated that the neural population is organized differently during the auditory and the movement periods of the task, implying that it is performing different computations in each period. We found that SMA neurons perform acoustic-decision-related computations that transition from auditory to movement representations in this task. Our results suggest that the SMA integrates sensory information while listening to auditory stimuli in order to form categorical signals that drive behavior.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.347831v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Although the human hippocampus is necessary for long-term memory, controversial findings suggest that hippocampal computations support short-term memory in the service of guiding effective behaviors during learning. We tested the counter-intuitive theory that the hippocampus contributes to long-term memory through remarkably short-term processing, as reflected in the sequence of eye movements during encoding of naturalistic scenes. While viewing scenes for the first time, participants generated patterns of eye movements that reflected a shift from stimulus-driven to memory-driven viewing and signaled effective spatiotemporal memory formation. Hippocampal theta oscillations recorded from depth electrodes predicted this viewing pattern. Moreover, effective viewing patterns were preceded by shifts towards top-down influence of hippocampal theta on activity within cortical networks that support visual perception and visuospatial attention. The hippocampus thus supports short-term memory processing that coordinates perception, attention, and behavior in the service of effective spatiotemporal learning. These findings motivate re-interpretation of long-term memory disorders as reflecting loss of the organizing influence of hippocampal short-term memory on learning.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Recent developments in reinforcement learning, cognitive control, and systems neuroscience highlight the complimentary roles in learning of valenced reward prediction errors (RPEs) and non-valenced salience prediction errors (PEs) driven by the magnitude of surprise. A core debate in reward learning focuses on whether valenced and non-valenced PEs can be isolated in the human electroencephalogram (EEG). Here, we combine behavioral modeling and single-trial EEG regression revealing a sequence of valenced and non-valenced PEs in an interval timing task dissociating outcome valence, magnitude, and probability. Multiple regression across temporal, spatial, and frequency dimensions revealed a spatio-tempo-spectral cascade from valenced RPE value represented by the feedback related negativity event-related potential (ERP) followed by non-valenced RPE magnitude and outcome probability effects indexed by subsequent P300 and late frontal positivity ERPs. The results show that learning is supported by a sequence of multiple PEs evident in the human EEG.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.347732v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The hypokinetic motor symptoms of Parkinsons disease (PD) are closely linked with a decreased motor cortical output as a consequence of elevated basal ganglia inhibition. However, whether and how the loss of dopamine alters the cellular properties of motor cortical neurons in PD remains undefined. We induced experimental parkinsonism in adult C57BL6 mice of both sexes by injecting neurotoxin, 6-hydroxydopamine, into the medial forebrain bundle. By using ex vivo patch-clamp recording and retrograde tracing approach, we found that the intrinsic excitability of pyramidal tract neurons (PTNs) in the motor cortical layer 5b was greatly decreased following the degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic neurons; but the intratelencephalic neurons (ITNs) were not affected. The cell-type-specific intrinsic adaptations were associated with a significant broadening of the action potentials in PTNs but not in ITNs. Moreover, the loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons impaired the capability of M1 PTNs to sustain high-frequency firing, which could underlie their abnormal pattern of activity in the parkinsonian state. We also showed that the decreased excitability and broadened action potentials were largely caused by a disrupted function of the large conductance, Ca2+-activated K+ channels. The restoration of dopaminergic neuromodulation failed to rescue the impaired intrinsic excitability of M1 PTNs in parkinsonian mice. Altogether, our data show cell-type-specific decreases of the excitability of M1 pyramidal neurons following the loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Thus, intrinsic adaptations in the motor cortex, together with pathological basal ganglia inhibition, underlie the decreased motor cortical output in parkinsonian state and exacerbate parkinsonian motor deficits</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Auditory cortex is susceptible to lexical influence as revealed by informational vs. energetic masking of speech categorization</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.347724v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Speech perception requires the grouping of acoustic information into meaningful phonetic units via the process of categorical perception (CP). Environmental masking influences speech perception and CP. However, it remains unclear at which stage of processing (encoding, decision, or both) masking affects categorization of speech signals. The purpose of this study was to determine whether linguistic interference influences the early acoustic-phonetic conversion process inherent to CP. To this end, we measured source level, event related brain potentials (ERPs) from auditory cortex (AC) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) as listeners rapidly categorized speech sounds along a /da/ to /ga/ continuum presented in three listening conditions: quiet, and in the presence of forward (informational masker) and time-reversed (energetic masker) 2-talker babble noise. Maskers were matched in overall SNR and spectral content and thus varied only in their degree of linguistic interference (i.e., informational masking). We hypothesized a differential effect of informational versus energetic masking on behavioral and neural categorization responses, where we predicted increased activation of frontal regions when disambiguating speech from noise, especially during lexical-informational maskers. We found (1) informational masking weakens behavioral speech phoneme identification above and beyond energetic masking; (2) low-level AC activity not only codes speech categories but is susceptible to higher-order lexical interference; (3) identifying speech amidst noise recruits a cross hemispheric circuit (ACleft [-&amp;gt;] IFGright) whose engagement varies according to task difficulty. These findings provide corroborating evidence for top-down influences on the early acoustic-phonetic analysis of speech through a coordinated interplay between frontotemporal brain areas.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.347625v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (qMRI) signal model fitting is traditionally performed via non-linear least square (NLLS) estimation. NLLS is slow and its performance can be affected by the presence of different local minima in the fitting objective function. Recently, machine learning techniques, including deep neural networks (DNNs), have been proposed as robust alternatives to NLLS. Here we present a deep learning implementation of qMRI model fitting, which uses DNNs to perform the inversion of the forward signal model. We compare two DNN training strategies, based on two alternative definitions of the loss function, since at present it is not known which definition leads to the most accurate, precise and robust parameter estimation. In strategy 1 we define the loss as the l2-norm of tissue parameter prediction errors, while in strategy 2 as the l2-norm of MRI signal prediction errors. We compare the two approaches on synthetic and 3T in vivo saturation inversion recovery (SIR) diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI data, using a model for joint diffusion-T1 mapping. Strategy 1 leads to lower tissue parameter root mean squared errors (RMSEs) when realistic noise distributions are considered (e.g. Rician vs Gaussian). However, strategy 2 offers lower signal reconstruction RMSE, and allows training to be performed on both synthetic and actual in vivo MRI measurements. In conclusion, both strategies are valid choices for DNN-based fitting. Strategy 2 is more practical, as it does not require pre-computation of reference tissue parameters, but may lead to worse parameter estimation.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.347526v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Categorical perception (CP) describes how the human brain categorizes speech despite inherent acoustic variability. We examined neural correlates of CP in both evoked and induced EEG activity to evaluate which mode best describes the process of speech categorization. Using source reconstructed EEG, we used band-specific evoked and induced neural activity to build parameter optimized support vector machine (SVMs) model to assess how well listeners' speech categorization could be decoded via whole-brain and hemisphere-specific responses. We found whole-brain evoked {beta}-band activity decoded prototypical from ambiguous speech sounds with ~70% accuracy. However, induced {gamma}-band oscillations showed better decoding of speech categories with ~95% accuracy compared to evoked {beta}-band activity (~70% accuracy). Induced high frequency ({gamma}-band) oscillations dominated CP decoding in the left hemisphere, whereas lower frequency ({theta}-band) dominated decoding in the right hemisphere. Moreover, feature selection identified 14 brain regions carrying induced activity and 22 regions of evoked activity that were most salient in describing category-level speech representations. Among the areas and neural regimes explored, we found that induced {gamma}-band modulations were most strongly associated with listeners' behavioral CP. Our data suggest that the category-level organization of speech is dominated by relatively high frequency induced brain rhythms.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.347518v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>MRI scanner and sequence imperfections and advances in reconstruction and imaging techniques to increase motion robustness can lead to inter-slice intensity variations in Echo Planar Imaging. Leveraging deep convolutional neural networks as universal image filters, we present a data-driven method for the correction of acquisition artefacts that manifest as inter-slice inconsistencies, regardless of their origin. This technique can be applied to motion- and dropout-artefacted data by embedding it in a reconstruction pipeline. The network is trained in the absence of ground-truth data on, and finally applied to, the reconstructed multi-shell high angular resolution diffusion imaging signal to produce a corrective slice intensity modulation field. This correction can be performed in either motion-corrected or scattered source-space. We focus on gaining control over the learned filter and the image data consistency via built-in spatial frequency and intensity constraints. The end product is a corrected image reconstructed from the original raw data, modulated by a multiplicative field that can be inspected and verified to match the expected features of the artefact. In-plane, the correction approximately preserves the contrast of the diffusion signal and throughout the image series, it reduces inter-slice inconsistencies within and across subjects without biasing the data. We apply our pipeline to enhance the super-resolution reconstruction of neonatal multi-shell high angular resolution data as acquired in the developing Human Connectome Project.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Radial asymmetries around the visual field: From retina to cortex to behavior</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.347492v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Visual performance varies around the visual field. It is best near the fovea compared to the periphery, and at iso-eccentric locations it is best on the horizontal, intermediate on the lower, and poorest on the upper meridian. The fovea-to-periphery performance decline is linked to the decreases in cone density, retinal ganglion cell (RGC) density, and V1 cortical magnification factor (CMF) as eccentricity increases. The origins of radial asymmetries are not well understood. Optical quality and cone density vary across the retina, but recent computational modeling has shown that these factors can only account for a small percentage of behavior. Here, we investigate how visual processing beyond the cones contributes to radial asymmetries in performance. First, we quantify the extent of asymmetries in cone density, midget RGC density, and V1-V2 CMF. We find that both radial asymmetries and eccentricity gradients are amplified from cones to mRGCs, and from mRGCs to cortex. Second, we extend our previously published computational observer model to quantify the contribution of spatial filtering by mRGCs to behavioral asymmetries. Starting with photons emitted by a visual display, the model simulates the effect of human optics, fixational eye movements, cone isomerizations and mRGC spatial filtering. The model performs a forced choice orientation discrimination task on mRGC responses using a linear support vector machine classifier. The model shows radial asymmetries in performance that are larger than those from a model operating on the cone outputs, but considerably smaller than those observed from human performance. We conclude that spatial filtering properties of mRGCs contribute to radial performance differences, but that a full account of these differences will entail a large contribution from cortical representations.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.347260v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Clinical and experimental data from the last nine decades indicate that the preoptic area of the hypothalamus is a critical node in a brain network that controls sleep onset and homeostasis. By contrast, we recently reported that a group of glutamatergic neurons in the lateral and medial preoptic area increases wakefulness, challenging the long-standing notion in sleep neurobiology that the preoptic area is exclusively somnogenic. However, the precise role of these subcortical neurons in the control of behavioral state transitions and cortical dynamics remains unknown. Therefore, in this study we used conditional expression of excitatory hM3Dq receptors in these preoptic glutamatergic (Vglut2+) neurons and show that their activation initiates wakefulness, decreases non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and causes a persistent suppression of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Activation of preoptic glutamatergic neurons also causes a high degree of NREM sleep fragmentation, promotes state instability with frequent arousals from sleep, and shifts cortical dynamics (including oscillations, connectivity, and complexity) to a more wake-like state. We conclude that a subset of preoptic glutamatergic neurons may initiate (but not maintain) arousals from sleep, and their inactivation may be required for NREM stability and REM sleep generation. Further, these data provide novel empirical evidence supporting the conclusion that the preoptic area causally contributes to the regulation of both sleep and wakefulness.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The ability to discriminate between stimuli relies on a chain of neural operations associated with perception, memory and decision-making. Accumulating studies show learning-dependent plasticity in perception or decision-making, yet whether perceptual learning modifies mnemonic processing remains unclear. Here, we trained participants on an orientation discrimination task, while using fMRI and TMS to separately examine training-induced changes in working memory (WM) representation. Although fMRI decoding revealed orientation-specific neural patterns during delay period in early visual cortex (V1) before, but not after, training, neurodisruption of V1 during delay period led to behavioral deficit in both phases. In contrast, both fMRI decoding and disruptive effect of TMS showed that intraparietal sulcus (IPS) represent WM content after, but not before, training. These results suggest that sensory engagement for WM is relatively independent of training but the coding format may be altered, whereas the involvement of parietal area in WM depends on training.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.347146v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) remains an unsolved problem in the clinical management of HIV-1 carriers, because existing anti-retroviral therapy while suppressing viral replication, do not prevent neurocognitive impairment (e.g. spatial memory loss). HIV-1 gp120 protein has been proposed to contribute to HAND because it is shed by infected cells and the use of antibodies revealed its presence in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) even in the combinatory antiretroviral therapy (cART) era. The cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) has long been known to be a star player in memory. CREB exerts its effect partially through regulating the genes for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator (PGC)-1a and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). CREB, PGC-1a, and BDNF levels are low in the brains of patients with neurodegenerative diseases and a dearth of either protein is associated with cognitive decline. We have obtained data showing that gp120 contributes to neurodegeneration by altering CREB phosphorylation on serine residue 133 thus disrupting mitochondrial movement and synaptic plasticity leading to spatial memory loss. Inhibition of CREB function was also associated with a decrease of ATP levels and lower mitochondrial DNA copy numbers. Our data was validated in vitro (primary mouse neurons and neuronal cell line, SH-SY5Y) and in vivo (gp120-tg mice and mice injected with gp120). The negative effect of gp120 was alleviated in cells and animals in the presence of Rolipram. Hence, we conclude that HIV-1 gp120 protein contributes to spatial memory impairment via inhibition of CREB protein activity.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.347005v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Being able to anticipate events before they happen facilitates stimulus processing. The anticipation of the contents of events is thought to be implemented by the elicitation of prestimulus templates in sensory cortex. In contrast, the anticipation of the timing of events is typically associated with entrainment of neural oscillations. It is so far unknown whether temporal expectations interact with feature-based expectations, and, consequently, whether entrainment modulates the generation of content-specific sensory templates. In this study, we investigated the role of temporal expectations in a sensory discrimination task. We presented participants with rhythmically interleaved visual and auditory streams of relevant and irrelevant stimuli while measuring neural activity using magnetoencephalography. We found no evidence that rhythmic stimulation induced prestimulus feature templates. However, we did observe clear anticipatory rhythmic pre-activation of the relevant sensory cortices. This oscillatory activity peaked at behaviourally relevant, in-phase, intervals. Our results suggest that temporal expectations about stimulus features do not behave similarly to explicitly cued, non-rhythmic, expectations; yet elicit a distinct form of modality-specific pre-activation.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>In a sample of highly anxious individuals, the relationship between gray matter volume brain morphology and attentional bias to threat was assessed. Participants performed a dot-probe task of attentional bias to threat and gray matter volume was acquired from whole brain structural T1-weighted MRI scans. The results replicate previous findings in unselected samples that elevated attentional bias to threat is linked to greater gray matter volume in the anterior cingulate cortex, middle frontal gyrus, and striatum. In addition, we provide novel evidence that elevated attentional bias to threat is associated with greater gray matter volume in the right posterior parietal cortex, cerebellum, and other distributed regions. Lastly, exploratory analyses provide initial evidence that distinct sub-regions of the right posterior parietal cortex may contribute to attentional bias in a sex-specific manner. Our results illuminate how differences in gray matter volume morphology relate to attentional bias to threat in anxious individuals. This knowledge could inform neurocognitive models of anxiety-related attentional bias to threat and targets of neuroplasticity in anxiety interventions such as attention bias modification.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The onset of voluntary movements is driven by coordinated firing across a large population of motor cortical neurons. This pattern of activity is determined by both local interactions and long-range corticocortical and subcortical inputs. The way remote areas of the brain communicate to effectively drive movement is still unclear. We addressed this question by studying an important pathway through which the cerebellum communicates, via the motor thalamus, with the motor cortex. We found that similar to the sensory cortices, thalamic input to the motor cortex triggers feedforward inhibition by directly contacting inhibitory cells via particularly effective GluR2- lacking AMPA receptors blocked by NASPM. Based on these results, we constructed a classifier for SCP-responsive cortical cells to identify pyramidal and PV interneurons and study their role in controlling movements. The findings indicate that PV and pyramidal cells are co-driven by TC input in response to activation of the CTC pathway. During task performance, PV and pyramidal cells had comparable relations to movement parameters (directional tuning and movement duration). However, PV interneurons exhibited stronger movement-related activity that preceded the firing of pyramidal cells. This seemingly counterintuitive sequence of events where inhibitory cells are recruited more strongly and before excitatory cells may in fact enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of cerebellar signals by suppressing other inputs and prioritizing the excitatory synchronized volley from the TC system which occurs at the right time to overcome the inhibitory signal. In this manner, the CTC system can shape cortical activity in a way that exceeds its sheer synaptic efficacy.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Hippocampal place cells encode global location but not changes in environmental connectivity in a 4-room navigation task</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.346130v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Flexible navigation relies on a cognitive map of space, thought to be implemented by hippocampal place cells: neurons that exhibit location-specific firing. In connected environments, optimal navigation requires keeping track of one's location and of the available connections between subspaces. We examined whether the dorsal CA1 place cells of rats encode environmental connectivity in four geometrically-identical boxes arranged in a square. Rats moved between boxes by pushing saloon-type doors that could be locked in one or both directions. While rats demonstrated knowledge of environmental connectivity, their place cells did not respond to connectivity changes, nor did they represent doorways differently from other locations. Importantly, place cells coded the space in a global frame, expressing minimal repetitive fields despite the repetitive geometry (global coding). These results suggest that CA1 place cells provide a spatial map that does not explicitly include connectivity.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.345371v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Imaging calcium signals in neurons of awake, behaving mice using two-photon microscopy makes it possible to study how learning alters coding in large neural populations. Such experiments produce extremely large datasets requiring powerful automated methods to extract responses from hundreds of neurons. Here we present a new open source toolbox for 1) segmentation of regions of interest (ROIs) representing neuronal structures, 2) inspection and manual splitting, addition or rejection of ROIs, 3) neuropil correction and signal extraction and 4) matching of ROIs in sequential recordings. Our toolbox is built around a novel method for the identification of ROIs based on temporal cross-correlations of low frequency components derived by Fourier analysis, of each pixel with its neighbors. The approach is insightful for the end user and allows for the ROI detection around neurons or irregular structures such as dendrites and axons by adjusting simple morphological constraints. This new pipeline thus provides an efficient and user-friendly approach for analyzing calcium responses in neuronal structures imaged over prolonged periods of time.</content:encoded>

Icosahedral viruses are under a micrometer in diameter, their infectious genome encapsulated by a shell assembled by a multiscale process, starting from an integer multiple of 60 viral capsid or coat protein (VP) monomers. We predict and validate inter-atomic hotspot interactions between VP monomers that are important for the assembly of 3 types of icosahedral viral capsids: Adeno Associated Virus serotype 2 (AAV2) and Minute Virus of Mice (MVM), both &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; = 1 single stranded DNA viruses, and Bromo Mosaic Virus (BMV), a &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; = 3 single stranded RNA virus. Experimental validation is by in-vitro, site-directed mutagenesis data found in literature. We combine ab-initio predictions at two scales: at the &lt;i&gt;interface-scale&lt;/i&gt;, we predict the importance (&lt;i&gt;cruciality&lt;/i&gt;) of an interaction for successful subassembly across each interface between symmetry-related VP monomers; and at the &lt;i&gt;capsid-scale&lt;/i&gt;, we predict the cruciality of an interface for successful capsid assembly. At the interface-scale, we measure cruciality by changes in the capsid free-energy landscape &lt;i&gt;partition function&lt;/i&gt; when an interaction is removed. The partition function computation uses &lt;i&gt;atlases&lt;/i&gt; of interface subassembly landscapes, rapidly generated by a novel geometric method and curated opensource software EASAL (efficient atlasing and search of assembly landscapes). At the capsid-scale, cruciality of an interface for successful assembly of the capsid is based on combinatorial entropy. Our study goes all the way from resource-light, multiscale computational predictions of crucial hotspot inter-atomic interactions to validation using data on site-directed mutagenesis’ effect on capsid assembly. By reliably and rapidly narrowing down target interactions, (no more than 1.5 hours per interface on a laptop with Intel Core i5-2500K @ 3.2 Ghz CPU and 8GB of RAM) our predictions can inform and reduce time-consuming in-vitro and in-vivo experiments, or more computationally intensive in-silico analyses.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TXWLfReOxHg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: seekCRIT: Detecting and characterizing differentially expressed circular RNAs using high-throughput sequencing data</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/sYHI90r064E/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Mohamed Chaabane, Kalina Andreeva, Jae Yeon Hwang, Tae Lim Kook, Juw Won Park, Nigel G. F. Cooper&lt;/p&gt;

Over the past two decades, researchers have discovered a special form of alternative splicing that produces a circular form of RNA. Although these circular RNAs (circRNAs) have garnered considerable attention in the scientific community for their biogenesis and functions, the focus of current studies has been on the tissue-specific circRNAs that exist only in one tissue but not in other tissues or on the disease-specific circRNAs that exist in certain disease conditions, such as cancer, but not under normal conditions. This approach was conducted in the relative absence of methods that analyze a group of common circRNAs that exist in both conditions, but are more abundant in one condition relative to another (differentially expressed). Studies of differentially expressed circRNAs (DECs) between two conditions would serve as a significant first step in filling this void. Here, we introduce a novel computational tool, seekCRIT (seek for differentially expressed CircRNAs In Transcriptome), that identifies the DECs between two conditions from high-throughput sequencing data. Using rat retina RNA-seq data from ischemic and normal conditions, we show that over 74% of identifiable circRNAs are expressed in both conditions and over 40 circRNAs are differentially expressed between two conditions. We also obtain a high qPCR validation rate of 90% for DECs with a FDR of &amp;lt; 5%. Our results demonstrate that seekCRIT is a novel and efficient approach to detect DECs using rRNA depleted RNA-seq data. seekCRIT is freely downloadable at https://github.com/UofLBioinformatics/seekCRIT.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by M. Latorre, J. D. Humphrey&lt;/p&gt;

Myriad risk factors–including uncontrolled hypertension, aging, and diverse genetic mutations–contribute to the development and enlargement of thoracic aortic aneurysms. Detailed analyses of clinical data and longitudinal studies of murine models continue to provide insight into the natural history of these potentially lethal conditions. Yet, because of the co-existence of multiple risk factors in most cases, it has been difficult to isolate individual effects of the many different factors or to understand how they act in combination. In this paper, we use a data-informed computational model of the initiation and progression of thoracic aortic aneurysms to contrast key predisposing risk factors both in isolation and in combination; these factors include localized losses of elastic fiber integrity, aberrant collagen remodeling, reduced smooth muscle contractility, and dysfunctional mechanosensing or mechanoregulation of extracellular matrix along with superimposed hypertension and aortic aging. In most cases, mild-to-severe localized losses in cellular function or matrix integrity give rise to varying degrees of local dilatations of the thoracic aorta, with enlargement typically exacerbated in cases wherein predisposing risk factors co-exist. The simulations suggest, for the first time, that effects of compromised smooth muscle contractility are more important in terms of dysfunctional mechanosensing and mechanoregulation of matrix than in vessel-level control of diameter and, furthermore, that dysfunctional mechanobiological control can yield lesions comparable to those in cases of compromised elastic fiber integrity. Particularly concerning, therefore, is that loss of constituents such as fibrillin-1, as in Marfan syndrome, can compromise both elastic fiber integrity and mechanosensing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_lLAarBO2Bc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Visual detection is locked to the internal dynamics of cortico-motor control</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Alice Tomassini, Eric Maris, Pauline Hilt, Luciano Fadiga, Alessandro D’Ausilio&lt;/p&gt;

Movements overtly sample sensory information, making sensory analysis an active-sensing process. In this study, we show that visual information sampling is not just locked to the (overt) movement dynamics but to the internal (covert) dynamics of cortico-motor control. We asked human participants to perform continuous isometric contraction while detecting unrelated and unpredictable near-threshold visual stimuli. The motor output (force) shows zero-lag coherence with brain activity (recorded via electroencephalography) in the beta-band, as previously reported. In contrast, cortical rhythms in the alpha-band systematically forerun the motor output by 200 milliseconds. Importantly, visual detection is facilitated when cortico-motor alpha (not beta) synchronization is enhanced immediately before stimulus onset, namely, at the optimal phase relationship for sensorimotor communication. These findings demonstrate an ongoing coupling between visual sampling and motor control, suggesting the operation of an internal and alpha-cycling visuomotor loop.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/W8V-xDoWiJQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;We conducted a post hoc analysis on 1,047 patients with PDD from 2 randomized controlled trials comparing rivastigmine versus placebo at week 24 (n = 501) and rivastigmine patch versus capsule at week 76 (n = 546). A drop ≥ 20 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure (SBP) or ≥ 10 in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) upon standing classified subjects as OH positive (OH+); otherwise, OH negative (OH‐). The primary end point was the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale ‐ Cognitive subscale (ADAS‐Cog) at week 24 and the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS) at week 76, using intention‐to‐treat with retrieved dropout at week 24 and observed cases at week 76, consistent with the original analyses.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall safety was comparable between OH+ (n = 288, 27.5%) and OH‐ (n = 730, 69.7%), except for higher frequency of syncope (9.2%) in the OH+ placebo arm. The placebo‐adjusted effect of rivastigmine on ADAS‐Cog at week 24 was 5.6 ± 1.2 for OH+ and 1.9 ± 0.9 in OH‐ (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0165). Among subjects with OH, the MDRS change from baseline at week 76 was higher for rivastigmine capsules versus patch (10.6 ± 2.9 vs ‐1.5 ± 3.0, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.031). The overall prevalence of OH was lower for rivastigmine than placebo at week 24 (28.3% vs 44.6%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0476).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cognitive benefit from rivastigmine is larger in patients with PDD with OH, possibly mediated by a direct antihypotensive effect. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Low power photomicrographs of myelin staining in the basolateral amygdala of the banded mongoose (left) and domestic ferret (right). Note the overall lower density of myelin in the domestic ferret, which may relate to either a smaller brain mass or be an effect of the domestication process. Scale bars in each image = 1 mm.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current study provides an analysis of the cytoarchitecture, myeloarchitecture, and chemoarchitecture of the amygdaloid body of the banded mongoose (&lt;i&gt;Mungos mungo&lt;/i&gt;) and domestic ferret (&lt;i&gt;Mustela putorius furo&lt;/i&gt;). Using architectural and immunohistochemical stains, we observe that the organization of the nuclear and cortical portions of the amygdaloid complex is very similar in both species. The one major difference is the presence of a cortex‐amygdala transition zone observed in the domestic ferret that is absent in the banded mongoose. In addition, the chemoarchitecture is, for the most part, quite similar in the two species, but several variances, such as differing densities of neurons expressing the calcium‐binding proteins in specific nuclei are noted. Despite this, certain aspects of the chemoarchitecture, such as the cholinergic innervation of the magnocellular division of the basal nuclear cluster and the presence of doublecortin expressing neurons in the shell division of the accessory basal nuclear cluster, appear to be consistent features of the Eutherian mammal amygdala. The domestic ferret presented with an overall lower myelin density throughout the amygdaloid body than the banded mongoose, a feature that may reflect artificial selection in the process of domestication for increased juvenile‐like behavior in the adult domestic ferret, such as a muted fear response. The shared, but temporally distant, ancestry of the banded mongoose and domestic ferret allows us to generate observations relevant to understanding the relative influence that phylogenetic constraints, adaptive evolutionary plasticity, and the domestication process may play in the organization and chemoarchitecture of the amygdaloid body.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;In male rats exposed to an experimental model of shift‐work, we reported circadian disruption, depressive and anxiety‐like behaviors as well as neuroinflammation in brain areas associated with mood regulation. Time‐restricted feeding associated with the normal activity phase prevents depressive and anxiety‐like behaviors as well as neuroinflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individuals who regularly shift their sleep timing, like night and/or shift‐workers suffer from circadian desynchrony and are at risk of developing cardiometabolic diseases and cancer. Also, shift‐work is are suggested to be a risk factor for the development of mood disorders such as the burn out syndrome, anxiety, and depression. Experimental and clinical studies provide evidence that food intake restricted to the normal activity phase is a potent synchronizer for the circadian system and can prevent the detrimental health effects associated with circadian disruption. Here, we explored whether adult male Wistar rats exposed to an experimental model of shift‐work (W‐AL) developed depressive and/or anxiety‐like behaviors and whether this was associated with neuroinflammation in brain areas involved with mood regulation. We also tested whether time‐restricted feeding (TRF) to the active phase could ameliorate circadian disruption and therefore would prevent depressive and anxiety‐like behaviors as well as neuroinflammation. In male Wistar rats, W‐AL induced depressive‐like behavior characterized by hypoactivity and anhedonia and induced increased anxiety‐like behavior in the open field test. This was associated with increased number of glial fibrillary acidic protein and IBA‐1‐positive cells in the prefrontal cortex and basolateral amygdala. Moreover W‐AL caused morphological changes in the microglia in the CA3 area of the hippocampus indicating microglial activation. Importantly, TRF prevented behavioral changes and decreased neuroinflammation markers in the brain. Present results add up evidence about the importance that TRF in synchrony with the light–dark cycle can prevent neuroinflammation leading to healthy mood states in spite of circadian disruptive conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spiking neural networks (SNNs) receive widespread attention because of their
low-power hardware characteristic and brain-like signal response mechanism, but
currently, the performance of SNNs is still behind Artificial Neural Networks
(ANNs). We build an information theory-inspired system called Stochastic
Probability Adjustment (SPA) system to reduce this gap. The SPA maps the
synapses and neurons of SNNs into a probability space where a neuron and all
connected pre-synapses are represented by a cluster. The movement of synaptic
transmitter between different clusters is modeled as a Brownian-like stochastic
process in which the transmitter distribution is adaptive at different firing
phases. We experimented with a wide range of existing unsupervised SNN
architectures and achieved consistent performance improvements. The
improvements in classification accuracy have reached 1.99% and 6.29% on the
MNIST and EMNIST datasets respectively.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09660</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural computation in biological and artificial networks relies on nonlinear
synaptic integration. The structural connectivity matrix of synaptic weights
between neurons is a critical determinant of overall network function. However,
quantitative links between neural network structure and function are complex
and subtle. For example, many networks can give rise to similar functional
responses, and the same network can function differently depending on context.
Whether certain patterns of synaptic connectivity are required to generate
specific network-level computations is largely unknown. Here we introduce a
geometric framework for identifying synaptic connections required by
steady-state responses in recurrent networks of rectified-linear neurons.
Assuming that the number of specified response patterns does not exceed the
number of input synapses, we analytically calculate all feedforward and
recurrent connectivity matrices that can generate the specified responses from
the network inputs. We then use this analytical characterization to rigorously
analyze the solution space geometry and derive certainty conditions
guaranteeing a non-zero synapse between neurons. Numerical simulations of
feedforward and recurrent networks verify our analytical results. Our
theoretical framework could be applied to neural activity data to make
anatomical predictions that follow generally from the model architecture. It
thus provides novel opportunities for discerning what model features are
required to accurately relate neural network structure and function.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Connected networks are a fundamental structure of neurobiology. Understanding
these networks will help us elucidate the neural mechanisms of computation.
Mathematically speaking these networks are `graphs' - structures containing
objects that are connected. In neuroscience, the objects could be regions of
the brain, e.g. fMRI data, or be individual neurons, e.g. calcium imaging with
fluorescence microscopy. The formal study of graphs, graph theory, can provide
neuroscientists with a large bank of algorithms for exploring networks. Graph
theory has already been applied in a variety of ways to fMRI data but, more
recently, has begun to be applied at the scales of neurons, e.g. from
functional calcium imaging. In this primer we explain the basics of graph
theory and relate them to features of microscopic functional networks of
neurons from calcium imaging - neuronal graphs. We explore recent examples of
graph theory applied to calcium imaging and we highlight some areas where
researchers new to the field could go awry.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09588</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Simulation-based training is an effective tool for acquiring practical
skills, the question remains as to which methods should be utilized to optimize
this process and for a better assessment of improved manual dexterity.
Specifically, it is not fully understood which brain processes during
simulation-based training will translate to better skill acquisition through
practice. As cognitive load decreases with better performance, we used a novel
method for brain assessment that enables an extraction of a cognitive load
neurological biomarker. 38 participants were assigned into 3 experiments
examining their behavioral performance undergoing a task with the Simbionix LAP
MENTO simulator, while their brain activity was measured using a
single-electrode EEG by Aurora by Neurosteer. Each task was repeated 3 times
with difference session setups. Correlations between a cognitive biomarker
(VC9) and behavioral performance measurements (e.g. accuracy, economy of
movement and time to exceed the task). Exp 1 results exhibited an improvement
in behavioral performance with no correlations to VC9. As a result of
prolonging session time to three trials, VC9 activity significantly decreased
with higher participants performance both in Exp.2 and in Exp. 3. Altogether,
VC9 is found to be an effective biological measurement for the assessment of
cognitive load while performing laparoscopic tasks using the surgical
simulator. As surgical simulations allow to gain important skills and
experience needed to perform procedures without any patient risk, it is crucial
to fully evaluate and optimize the effect of these simulations on medical
staff. This could potentially be expanded to evaluate the efficacy different
medical simulations to help medical staff and to measure cognitive and mental
load under real laparoscopic surgeries.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09568</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Gaussian blurring is a well-established method for image data augmentation:
it may generate a large set of images from a small set of pictures for training
and testing purposes for Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications. When we
apply AI for non-imagelike biological data, hardly any related method exists.
Here we introduce the &quot;Newtonian blurring&quot; in human braingraph (or connectome)
augmentation: Started from a dataset of 1053 subjects, we first repeat a
probabilistic weighted braingraph construction algorithm 10 times for
describing the connections of distinct cerebral areas, then take 7 repetitions
in every possible way, delete the lower and upper extremes, and average the
remaining 7-2=5 edge-weights for the data of each subject. This way we augment
the 1053 graph-set to 120 x 1053 = 126,360 graphs. In augmentation techniques,
it is an important requirement that no artificial additions should be
introduced into the dataset. Gaussian blurring and also this Newtonian blurring
satisfy this goal. The resulting dataset of 126,360 graphs, each in 5
resolutions (i.e., 631,800 graphs in total), is freely available at the site
https://braingraph.org/cms/download-pit-group-connectomes/. Augmenting with
Newtonian blurring may also be applicable in other non-image related fields,
where probabilistic processing and data averaging are implemented.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Altered structural balance of resting-state networks in autism. (arXiv:2010.09441v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09441</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;What makes a network complex, in addition to its size, is the interconnected
interactions between elements, disruption of which inevitably results in
dysfunction. Likewise, the brain networks' complexity arises from interactions
beyond pair connections, as it is simplistic to assume that in complex networks
state of a link is independently determined only according to its two
constituting nodes. This is particularly of note in genetically complex brain
impairments, such as the autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Accordingly,
structural balance theory (SBT) affirms that in the real-world signed networks,
a link is remarkably influenced by each of its two nodes' interactions with the
third node within a triadic interrelationship. Thus, it is plausible to ask
whether ASD is associated with altered structural balance resulting from
atypical triadic interactions. In other words, it is the abnormal interplay of
positive and negative interactions that matter in ASD, besides and beyond hypo
(hyper) pair connectivity. To address this, we explore triadic interactions in
the rs-fMRI network of participants with ASD relative to healthy controls
(CON). We demonstrate that balanced triads are overrepresented in the ASD and
CON networks while unbalanced triads are underrepresented, providing first-time
empirical evidence for the strong notion of structural balance on the brain
networks. We further analyze the frequency and energy distribution of triads
and suggest an alternative description for the reduced functional integration
and segregation in the ASD brain networks. Last but not least, we observe that
energy of the salient and the default mode networks are lower in autism, which
may be a reflection of the difficulty in flexible behaviors. Altogether, these
results highlight the potential value of SBT as a new perspective in functional
connectivity studies, especially in neurodevelopmental disorders.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Stress Varies Along the Social Density Continuum</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.582985</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Social stress is ubiquitous in the lives of social animals. While significant research has aimed to understand the specific forms of stress imparted by particular social interactions, less attention has been paid to understanding the behavioral effects and neural underpinnings of stress produced by the presence and magnitude of social interactions. However, in humans and rodents alike, chronically low and chronically high rates of social interaction are associated with a suite of mental health issues, suggesting the need for further research. Here, we review literature examining the behavioral and neurobiological findings associated with changing social density, focusing on research on chronic social isolation and chronic social crowding in rodent models, and synthesize findings in the context of the continuum of social density that can be experienced by social animals. Through this synthesis, we aim to both summarize the state of the field and describe promising avenues for future research that would more clearly define the broad effects of social interaction on the brain and behavior in mammals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Using Minimal-Redundant and Maximal-Relevant Whole-Brain Functional Connectivity to Classify Bipolar Disorder</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.563368</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;A number of mental illness is often re-diagnosed to be bipolar disorder (BD). Furthermore, the prefronto-limbic-striatal regions seem to be associated with the main dysconnectivity of BD. Functional connectivity is potentially an appropriate objective neurobiological marker that can assist with BD diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Health controls (HC; n = 173) and patients with BD who had been diagnosed by experienced physicians (n = 192) were separated into 10-folds, namely, a ninefold training set and a onefold testing set. The classification involved feature selection of the training set using minimum redundancy/maximum relevance. Support vector machine was used for training. The classification was repeated 10 times until each fold had been used as the testing set.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The mean accuracy of the 10 testing sets was 76.25%, and the area under the curve was 0.840. The selected functional within-network/between-network connectivity was mainly in the subcortical/cerebellar regions and the frontoparietal network. Furthermore, similarity within the BD patients, calculated by the cosine distance between two functional connectivity matrices, was smaller than between groups before feature selection and greater than between groups after the feature selection.&lt;/p&gt;Limitations&lt;p&gt;The major limitations were that all the BD patients were receiving medication and that no independent dataset was included.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our approach effectively separates a relatively large group of BD patients from HCs. This was done by selecting functional connectivity, which was more similar within BD patients, and also seems to be related to the neuropathological factors associated with BD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Phosphorylation of the Retinal Ribbon Synapse Specific t-SNARE Protein Syntaxin3B Is Regulated by Light via a Ca2 +-Dependent Pathway</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.587072</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurotransmitter release at retinal ribbon-style synapses utilizes a specialized t-SNARE protein called syntaxin3B (STX3B). In contrast to other syntaxins, STX3 proteins can be phosphorylated in vitro at T14 by Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+/&lt;/sup&gt;calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). This modification has the potential to modulate SNARE complex formation required for neurotransmitter release in an activity-dependent manner. To determine the extent to which T14 phosphorylation occurs in vivo in the mammalian retina and characterize the pathway responsible for the in vivo phosphorylation of T14, we utilized quantitative immunofluorescence to measure the levels of STX3 and STX3 phosphorylated at T14 (pSTX3) in the synaptic terminals of mouse retinal photoreceptors and rod bipolar cells (RBCs). Results demonstrate that STX3B phosphorylation at T14 is light-regulated and dependent upon the elevation of intraterminal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. In rod photoreceptor terminals, the ratio of pSTX3 to STX3 was significantly higher in dark-adapted mice, when rods are active, than in light-exposed mice. By contrast, in RBC terminals, the ratio of pSTX3 to STX3 was higher in light-exposed mice, when these terminals are active, than in dark-adapted mice. These results were recapitulated in the isolated eyecup preparation, but only when Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; was included in the external medium. In the absence of external Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, pSTX3 levels remained low regardless of light/dark exposure. Using the isolated RBC preparation, we next showed that elevation of intraterminal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; alone was sufficient to increase STX3 phosphorylation at T14. Furthermore, both the non-specific kinase inhibitor staurosporine and the selective CaMKII inhibitor AIP inhibited the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent increase in the pSTX3/STX3 ratio in isolated RBC terminals, while in parallel experiments, AIP suppressed RBC depolarization-evoked exocytosis, measured using membrane capacitance measurements. Our data support a novel, illumination-regulated modulation of retinal ribbon-style synapse function in which activity-dependent Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry drives the phosphorylation of STX3B at T14 by CaMKII, which in turn, modulates the ability to form SNARE complexes required for exocytosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Genetically Encoded Calcium Indicators Can Impair Dendrite Growth of Cortical Neurons</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.570596</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A battery of genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) with different binding kinetics and calcium affinities was developed over the recent years to permit long-term calcium imaging. GECIs are calcium buffers and therefore, expression of GECIs may interfere with calcium homeostasis and signaling pathways important for neuronal differentiation and survival. Our objective was to investigate if the biolistically induced expression of five commonly used GECIs at two postnatal time points (days 14 and 22–25) could affect the morphological maturation of cortical neurons in organotypic slice cultures of rat visual cortex. Expression of GCaMP3 in both time windows, and of GCaMP5G and TN-XXL in the later time window impaired apical and /or basal dendrite growth of pyramidal neurons. With time, the proportion of GECI transfectants with nuclear filling increased, but an only prolonged expression of TN-XXL caused higher levels of neurodegeneration. In multipolar interneurons, only GCaMP3 evoked a transient growth delay during the early time window. GCaMP6m and GCaMP6m-X&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; were quite “neuron-friendly.” Since growth-impaired neurons might not have the physiological responses typical of age-matched wildtype neurons the results obtained after prolonged developmental expression of certain GECIs might need to be interpreted with caution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.555747</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spastin, a microtubule-severing enzyme, is important for neurite outgrowth. However, the mechanisms underlying the post-transcriptional regulation of spastin during microtubule-related processes are largely unknown. We demonstrated that the spastin expression level is controlled by a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1)/microRNA-30 (miR-30) axis during neurite outgrowth. The miR-30 expression level decreased in hippocampal neurons with increasing days in culture, and miR-30 overexpression suppressed while miR-30 inhibition promoted neurite outgrowth in hippocampal neurons. Spastin was validated as a target gene of miR-30 using the luciferase reporter assay. The protein expression, microtubule severing activity, and neurite promoting effect of spastin were suppressed by the overexpression of miR-30 mimics and increased by miR-30 inhibitors. MALAT1 expression increased during neurite outgrowth and MALAT1 silencing impaired neurite outgrowth. miR-30 was a sponge target of MALAT1 and MALAT1/miR-30 altered neurite outgrowth in hippocampal neurons. MALAT1 overexpression reversed the inhibitory effect of miR-30 on the activity of a luciferase reporter construct containing spastin, as well as spastin mRNA and protein expression, indicating that spastin was a downstream effector of MALAT1/miR-30. The MALAT1/miR-30 cascade also modulated spastin-induced microtubule severing, and the MALAT1/miR-30/spastin axis regulated neurite outgrowth in hippocampal neurons. This study suggests a new mechanism governing neurite outgrowth in hippocampal neurons involving MALAT1/miR-30-regulated spastin expression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.581821</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Vertebrate forelimbs contain arrays of sensory neuron fibers that transmit signals from the skin to the nervous system. We used the genetic toolkit and optical clarity of the larval zebrafish to conduct a live imaging study of the sensory neurons innervating the pectoral fin skin. Sensory neurons in both the hindbrain and the spinal cord innervate the fin, with most cells located in the hindbrain. The hindbrain somas are located in rhombomere seven/eight, laterally and dorsally displaced from the pectoral fin motor pool. The spinal cord somas are located in the most anterior part of the cord, aligned with myomere four. Single cell reconstructions were used to map afferent processes and compare the distributions of processes to soma locations. Reconstructions indicate that this sensory system breaks from the canonical somatotopic organization of sensory systems by lacking a clear organization with reference to fin region. Arborizations from a single cell branch widely over the skin, innervating the axial skin, lateral fin surface, and medial fin surface. The extensive branching over the fin and the surrounding axial surface suggests that these fin sensory neurons report on general conditions of the fin area rather than providing fine location specificity, as has been demonstrated in other vertebrate limbs. With neuron reconstructions that span the full primary afferent arborization from the soma to the peripheral cutaneous innervation, this neuroanatomical study describes a system of primary sensory neurons and lays the groundwork for future functional studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.585218</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microvascular rarefaction, or the decrease in vascular density, has been described in the cerebrovasculature of aging humans, rats, and, more recently, mice in the presence and absence of age-dependent diseases. Given the wide use of mice in modeling age-dependent human diseases of the cerebrovasculature, visualization, and quantification of the global murine cerebrovasculature is necessary for establishing the baseline changes that occur with aging. To provide in vivo whole-brain imaging of the cerebrovasculature in aging C57BL/6 mice longitudinally, contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA) was employed using a house-made gadolinium-bearing micellar blood pool agent. Enhancement in the vascular space permitted quantification of the detectable, or apparent, cerebral blood volume (aCBV), which was analyzed over 2 years of aging and compared to histological analysis of the cerebrovascular density. A significant loss in the aCBV was detected by CE-MRA over the aging period. Histological analysis via vessel-probing immunohistochemistry confirmed a significant loss in the cerebrovascular density over the same 2-year aging period, validating the CE-MRA findings. While these techniques use widely different methods of assessment and spatial resolutions, their comparable findings in detected vascular loss corroborate the growing body of literature describing vascular rarefaction aging. These findings suggest that such age-dependent changes can contribute to cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, which are modeled using wild-type and transgenic laboratory rodents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/62043</link>
	<content:encoded>Out of millions of ejaculated sperm, only a few reach the fertilization site in mammals. Flagellar Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling nanodomains, organized by multi-subunit CatSper calcium channel complexes, are pivotal for sperm migration in the female tract, implicating CatSper-dependent mechanisms in sperm selection. Here, using biochemical and pharmacological studies, we demonstrate that CatSper1 is an O-linked glycosylated protein, undergoing capacitation-induced processing dependent on Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and phosphorylation cascades. CatSper1 processing correlates with protein tyrosine phosphorylation (pY) development in sperm cells capacitated &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Using 3D &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; molecular imaging and ANN-based automatic detection of sperm distributed along the cleared female tract, we demonstrate that all spermatozoa past the UTJ possess intact CatSper1 signals. Together, we reveal that fertilizing mouse spermatozoa &lt;i&gt;in situ &lt;/i&gt;are characterized by intact CatSper channel, lack of pY, and reacted acrosomes. These findings provide molecular insight into sperm selection for successful fertilization in the female reproductive tract.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Cannabinoids modulate associative cerebellar learning via alterations in behavioral state</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61821</link>
	<content:encoded>Cannabinoids are notorious and profound modulators of behavioral state. In the brain, endocannabinoids act via Type 1-cannabinoid receptors (CB1) to modulate synaptic transmission and mediate multiple forms of synaptic plasticity. CB1 knockout (CB1KO) mice display a range of behavioral phenotypes, in particular hypoactivity and various deficits in learning and memory, including cerebellum-dependent delay eyeblink conditioning. Here we find that the apparent effects of CB1 deletion on cerebellar learning are not due to direct effects on CB1-dependent plasticity, but rather, arise as a secondary consequence of altered behavioral state. Hypoactivity of CB1KO mice accounts for their impaired eyeblink conditioning across both animals and trials. Moreover, learning in these mutants is rescued by walking on a motorized treadmill during training. Finally, cerebellar granule-cell-specific CB1KOs exhibit normal eyeblink conditioning, and both global and granule-cell-specific CB1KOs display normal cerebellum-dependent locomotor coordination and learning. These findings highlight the modulation of behavioral state as a powerful independent means through which individual genes contribute to complex behaviors.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60434</link>
	<content:encoded>The way in which multidomain proteins fold has been a puzzling question for decades. Until now, the mechanisms and functions of domain interactions involved in multidomain protein folding have been obscure. Here, we develop structure-based models to investigate the folding and DNA-binding processes of the multidomain Y-family DNA polymerase IV (DPO4). We uncover shifts in folding mechanism among ordered domain-wise folding, backtracking folding, and cooperative folding, modulated by interdomain interactions. These lead to &quot;U-shaped' folding kinetics. We characterize the effects of interdomain flexibility on the promotion of DPO4-DNA (un)binding, which probably contributes to the ability of DPO4 to bypass DNA lesions, a known biological role of Y-family polymerases. We suggest that the native topology of DPO4 leads to a trade-off between fast, stable folding and tight functional DNA binding. Our approach provides an effective way to quantitatively correlate the roles of protein interactions in conformational dynamics at the multidomain level.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58815</link>
	<content:encoded>The relationship between lipid metabolism and longevity remains unclear. Although fat oxidation is essential for weight loss, whether it remains beneficial when sustained for long periods, and the extent to which it may attenuate or augment lifespan remain important unanswered questions. Here, we develop an experimental handle in the &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; model system, in which we uncover the mechanisms that connect long-term fat oxidation with longevity. We find that sustained β-oxidation via activation of the conserved triglyceride lipase ATGL-1, triggers a feedback transcriptional loop that involves the mito-nuclear transcription factor ATFS-1, and a previously unknown and highly conserved repressor of ATGL-1 called HLH-11/AP4. This feedback loop orchestrates the dual control of fat oxidation and lifespan, and shields the organism from life-shortening mitochondrial stress in the face of continuous fat oxidation. Thus, we uncover one mechanism by which fat oxidation can be sustained for long periods without deleterious effects on longevity.</content:encoded>

Here we present the first systematic comparison of prosocial behavior across multiple species in a taxonomic group outside the primate order, namely the bird family Corvidae. We measured prosociality in 8 corvid species, which vary in the expression of cooperative breeding and colonial nesting. We show that cooperative breeding is positively associated with prosocial behavior across species. Also, colonial nesting is associated with a stronger propensity for prosocial behavior, but only in males. The combined results of our study strongly suggest that both cooperative breeding and colonial nesting, which may both rely on heightened social tolerance at the nest, are likely evolutionary pathways to prosocial behavior in corvids.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Multiscale cardiac imaging spanning the whole heart and its internal cellular architecture in a small animal model</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58138</link>
	<content:encoded>Cardiac pumping depends on the morphological structure of the heart, but also on its sub-cellular (ultrastructural) architecture, which enables cardiac contraction. In cases of congenital heart defects, localized ultrastructural disruptions that increase the risk of heart failure are only starting to be discovered. This is in part due to a lack of technologies that can image the three dimensional (3D) heart structure, to assess malformations; and its ultrastructure, to assess organelle disruptions. We present here a multiscale, correlative imaging procedure that achieves high-resolution images of the whole heart, using 3D micro-computed tomography (micro-CT); and its ultrastructure, using 3D scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In a small animal model (chicken embryo), we achieved uniform fixation and staining of the whole heart, without losing ultrastructural preservation on the same sample, enabling correlative multiscale imaging. Our approach enables multiscale studies in models of congenital heart disease and beyond.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Functional links between sensory representations, choice activity, and sensorimotor associations in parietal cortex</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57968</link>
	<content:encoded>Three-dimensional (3D) representations of the environment are often critical for selecting actions that achieve desired goals. The success of these goal-directed actions relies on 3D sensorimotor transformations that are experience-dependent. Here we investigated the relationships between the robustness of 3D visual representations, choice-related activity, and motor-related activity in parietal cortex. Macaque monkeys performed an eight-alternative 3D orientation discrimination task and a visually guided saccade task while we recorded from the caudal intraparietal area using laminar probes. We found that neurons with more robust 3D visual representations preferentially carried choice-related activity. Following the onset of choice-related activity, the robustness of the 3D representations further increased for those neurons. We additionally found that 3D orientation and saccade direction preferences aligned, particularly for neurons with choice-related activity, reflecting an experience-dependent sensorimotor association. These findings reveal previously unrecognized links between the fidelity of ecologically relevant object representations, choice-related activity, and motor-related activity.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Photosynthetic sea slugs induce protective changes to the light reactions of the chloroplasts they steal from algae</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57389</link>
	<content:encoded>Sacoglossan sea slugs are able to maintain functional chloroplasts inside their own cells, and mechanisms that allow preservation of the chloroplasts are unknown. We found that the slug &lt;i&gt;Elysia timida &lt;/i&gt;induces changes to the photosynthetic light reactions of the chloroplasts it steals from the alga &lt;i&gt;Acetabularia acetabulum&lt;/i&gt;. Working with a large continuous laboratory culture of both the slugs (&amp;gt;500 individuals) and their prey algae, we show that the plastoquinone pool of slug chloroplasts remains oxidized, which can suppress reactive oxygen species formation. Slug chloroplasts also rapidly build up a strong proton motive force upon a dark-to-light transition, which helps them to rapidly switch on photoprotective non-photochemical quenching of excitation energy. Finally, our results suggest that chloroplasts inside &lt;i&gt;E. timida&lt;/i&gt; rely on oxygen-dependent electron sinks during rapid changes in light intensity. These photoprotective mechanisms are expected to contribute to the long-term functionality of the chloroplasts inside the slugs.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Neuronal octopamine signaling regulates mating-induced germline stem cell increase in female Drosophila melanogaster</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57101</link>
	<content:encoded>Stem cells fuel the development and maintenance of tissues. Many studies have addressed how local signals from neighboring niche cells regulate stem cell identity and their proliferative potential. However, the regulation of stem cells by tissue-extrinsic signals in response to environmental cues remains poorly understood. Here we report that efferent octopaminergic neurons projecting to the ovary are essential for germline stem cell (GSC) increase in response to mating in female &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. The neuronal activity of the octopaminergic neurons is required for mating-induced GSC increase as they relay the mating signal from sex peptide receptor-positive cholinergic neurons. Octopamine and its receptor Oamb are also required for mating-induced GSC increase via intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling. Moreover, we identified Matrix metalloproteinase-2 as a downstream component of the octopamine-Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling to induce GSC increase. Our study provides a mechanism describing how neuronal system couples stem cell behavior to environmental cues through stem cell niche signaling.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Timescales of motor memory formation in dual-adaptation</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/bqhLxchpz0k/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Marion Forano, David W. Franklin&lt;/p&gt;

The timescales of adaptation to novel dynamics are well explained by a dual-rate model with slow and fast states. This model can predict interference, savings and spontaneous recovery, but cannot account for adaptation to multiple tasks, as each new task drives unlearning of the previously learned task. Nevertheless, in the presence of appropriate contextual cues, humans are able to adapt simultaneously to opposing dynamics. Consequently this model was expanded, suggesting that dual-adaptation occurs through a single fast process and multiple slow processes. However, such a model does not predict spontaneous recovery within dual-adaptation. Here we assess the existence of multiple fast processes by examining the presence of spontaneous recovery in two experimental variations of an adaptation-de-adaptation-error-clamp paradigm within dual-task adaptation in humans. In both experiments, evidence for spontaneous recovery towards the initially learned dynamics (A) was found in the error-clamp phase, invalidating the one-fast-two-slow dual-rate model. However, as adaptation is not only constrained to two timescales, we fit twelve multi-rate models to the experimental data. BIC model comparison again supported the existence of two fast processes, but extended the timescales to include a third rate: the ultraslow process. Even within our single day experiment, we found little evidence for decay of the learned memory over several hundred error-clamp trials. Overall, we show that dual-adaptation can be best explained by a two-fast-triple-rate model over the timescales of adaptation studied here. Longer term learning may require even slower timescales, explaining why we never forget how to ride a bicycle.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bqhLxchpz0k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The development of increasingly sophisticated methods to acquire high-resolution images has led to the generation of large collections of biomedical imaging data, including images of tissues and organs. Many of the current machine learning methods that aim to extract biological knowledge from histopathological images require several data preprocessing stages, creating an overhead before the proper analysis. Here we present PyHIST (https://github.com/manuel-munoz-aguirre/PyHIST), an easy-to-use, open source whole slide histological image tissue segmentation and preprocessing command-line tool aimed at tile generation for machine learning applications. From a given input image, the PyHIST pipeline i) optionally rescales the image to a different resolution, ii) produces a mask for the input image which separates the background from the tissue, and iii) generates individual image tiles with tissue content.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/L_5MRMvBd20&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Marcus Nguyen, Robert Olson, Maulik Shukla, Margo VanOeffelen, James J. Davis&lt;/p&gt;

A growing number of studies are using machine learning models to accurately predict antimicrobial resistance (AMR) phenotypes from bacterial sequence data. Although these studies are showing promise, the models are typically trained using features derived from comprehensive sets of AMR genes or whole genome sequences and may not be suitable for use when genomes are incomplete. In this study, we explore the possibility of predicting AMR phenotypes using incomplete genome sequence data. Models were built from small sets of randomly-selected core genes after removing the AMR genes. For &lt;i&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;, we report that it is possible to classify susceptible and resistant phenotypes with average F1 scores ranging from 0.80–0.89 with as few as 100 conserved non-AMR genes, with very major error rates ranging from 0.11–0.23 and major error rates ranging from 0.10–0.20. Models built from core genes have predictive power in cases where the primary AMR mechanisms result from SNPs or horizontal gene transfer. By randomly sampling non-overlapping sets of core genes, we show that F1 scores and error rates are stable and have little variance between replicates. Although these small core gene models have lower accuracies and higher error rates than models built from the corresponding assembled genomes, the results suggest that sufficient variation exists in the core non-AMR genes of a species for predicting AMR phenotypes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xSeJuQXGTKo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Fibrillarin evolution through the Tree of Life: Comparative genomics and microsynteny network analyses provide new insights into the evolutionary history of Fibrillarin</title>

Fibrillarin (FIB), a methyltransferase essential for life in the vast majority of eukaryotes, is involved in methylation of rRNA required for proper ribosome assembly, as well as methylation of histone H2A of promoter regions of rRNA genes. RNA viral progression that affects both plants and animals requires FIB proteins. Despite the importance and high conservation of fibrillarins, there little is known about the evolutionary dynamics of this small gene family. We applied a phylogenomic microsynteny-network approach to elucidate the evolutionary history of FIB proteins across the Tree of Life. We identified 1063 non-redundant FIB sequences across 1049 completely sequenced genomes from Viruses, Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. FIB is a highly conserved single-copy gene through Archaea and Eukarya lineages, except for plants, which have a gene family expansion due to paleopolyploidy and tandem duplications. We found a high conservation of the FIB genomic context during plant evolution. Surprisingly, FIB in mammals duplicated after the Eutheria split (e.g., ruminants, felines, primates) from therian mammals (e.g., marsupials) to form two main groups of sequences, the FIB and FIB-like groups. The FIB-like group transposed to another genomic context and remained syntenic in all the eutherian mammals. This transposition correlates with differences in the expression patterns of FIB-like proteins and with elevated Ks values potentially due to reduced evolutionary constraints of the duplicated copy. Our results point to a unique evolutionary event in mammals, between FIB and FIB-like genes, that led to non-redundant roles of the vital processes in which this protein is involved.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/80DABC-qKA8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: After the honeymoon, the divorce: Unexpected outcomes of disease control measures against endemic infections</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/fRsPr52Xn3o/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Brandon Hollingsworth, Kenichi W. Okamoto, Alun L. Lloyd&lt;/p&gt;

The lack of effective vaccines for many endemic diseases often forces policymakers to rely on non-immunizing control measures, such as vector control, to reduce the massive burden of these diseases. Controls can have well-known counterintuitive effects on endemic infections, including the honeymoon effect, in which partially effective controls cause not only a greater initial reduction in infection than expected, but also large outbreaks during control resulting from accumulation of susceptibles. Unfortunately, many control measures cannot be maintained indefinitely, and the results of cessation are poorly understood. Here, we examine the results of stopped or failed non-immunizing control measures in endemic settings. By using a mathematical model to compare the cumulative number of cases expected with and without control, we show that deployment of control can lead to a larger total number of infections, &lt;i&gt;counting from the time that control started&lt;/i&gt;, than without any control–the &lt;i&gt;divorce effect&lt;/i&gt;. This result is directly related to the population-level loss of immunity resulting from non-immunizing controls and is seen in a variety of models when non-immunizing controls are used against an infection that confers immunity. Finally, we examine three control plans for minimizing the magnitude of the divorce effect in seasonal infections and show that they are incapable of eliminating the divorce effect. While we do not suggest stopping control programs that rely on non-immunizing controls, our results strongly argue that the accumulation of susceptibility should be considered before deploying such controls against endemic infections when indefinite use of the control is unlikely. We highlight that our results are particularly germane to endemic mosquito-borne infections, such as dengue virus, both for routine management involving vector control and for field trials of novel control approaches, and in the context of non-pharmaceutical interventions aimed at COVID-19.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fRsPr52Xn3o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

A user ready, well documented software package PyOIF contains an implementation of a robust validated computational model for cell flow modelling. The software is capable of simulating processes involving biological cells immersed in a fluid. The examples of such processes are flows in microfluidic channels with numerous applications such as cell sorting, rare cell isolation or flow fractionation. Besides the typical usage of such computational model in the design process of microfluidic devices, PyOIF has been used in the computer-aided discovery involving mechanical properties of cell membranes. With this software, single cell, many cell, as well as dense cell suspensions can be simulated. Many cell simulations include cell-cell interactions and analyse their effect on the cells. PyOIF can be used to test the influence of mechanical properties of the membrane in flows and in membrane-membrane interactions. Dense suspensions may be used to study the effect of cell volume fraction on macroscopic phenomena such as cell-free layer, apparent suspension viscosity or cell degradation. The PyOIF module is based on the official ESPResSo distribution with few modifications and is available under the terms of the GNU General Public Licence. PyOIF is based on Python objects representing the cells and on the C++ computational core for fluid and interaction dynamics. The source code is freely available at GitHub repository, runs natively under Linux and MacOS and can be used in Windows Subsystem for Linux. The communication among PyOIF users and developers is maintained using active mailing lists. This work provides a basic background to the underlying computational models and to the implementation of interactions within this framework. We provide the prospective PyOIF users with a practical example of simulation script with reference to our publicly available User Guide.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/eafUYQgL8qA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

3D macromolecular structural data is growing ever more complex and plentiful in the wake of substantive advances in experimental and computational structure determination methods including macromolecular crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, and integrative methods. Efficient means of working with 3D macromolecular structural data for archiving, analyses, and visualization are central to facilitating interoperability and reusability in compliance with the FAIR Principles. We address two challenges posed by growth in data size and complexity. First, data size is reduced by bespoke compression techniques. Second, complexity is managed through improved software tooling and fully leveraging available data dictionary schemas. To this end, we introduce BinaryCIF, a serialization of Crystallographic Information File (CIF) format files that maintains full compatibility to related data schemas, such as PDBx/mmCIF, while reducing file sizes by more than a factor of two versus gzip compressed CIF files. Moreover, for the largest structures, BinaryCIF provides even better compression—factor ten and four versus CIF files and gzipped CIF files, respectively. Herein, we describe CIFTools, a set of libraries in Java and TypeScript for generic and typed handling of CIF and BinaryCIF files. Together, BinaryCIF and CIFTools enable lightweight, efficient, and extensible handling of 3D macromolecular structural data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nJWZnGmXs_E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Intuitive physical reasoning about objects’ masses transfers to a visuomotor decision task consistent with Newtonian physics</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/l7qlWyakkm4/article</link>

While interacting with objects during every-day activities, e.g. when sliding a glass on a counter top, people obtain constant feedback whether they are acting in accordance with physical laws. However, classical research on intuitive physics has revealed that people’s judgements systematically deviate from predictions of Newtonian physics. Recent research has explained at least some of these deviations not as consequence of misconceptions about physics but instead as the consequence of the probabilistic interaction between inevitable perceptual uncertainties and prior beliefs. How intuitive physical reasoning relates to visuomotor actions is much less known. Here, we present an experiment in which participants had to slide pucks under the influence of naturalistic friction in a simulated virtual environment. The puck was controlled by the duration of a button press, which needed to be scaled linearly with the puck’s mass and with the square-root of initial distance to reach a target. Over four phases of the experiment, uncertainties were manipulated by altering the availability of sensory feedback and providing different degrees of knowledge about the physical properties of pucks. A hierarchical Bayesian model of the visuomotor interaction task incorporating perceptual uncertainty and press-time variability found substantial evidence that subjects adjusted their button-presses so that the sliding was in accordance with Newtonian physics. After observing collisions between pucks, which were analyzed with a hierarchical Bayesian model of the perceptual observation task, subjects transferred the relative masses inferred perceptually to adjust subsequent sliding actions. Crucial in the modeling was the inclusion of a cost function, which quantitatively captures participants’ implicit sensitivity to errors due to their motor variability. Taken together, in the present experiment we find evidence that our participants transferred their intuitive physical reasoning to a subsequent visuomotor control task consistent with Newtonian physics and weighed potential outcomes with a cost functions based on their knowledge about their own variability.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/l7qlWyakkm4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Genetic diversity in offspring is induced by meiotic recombination, which is initiated between homologs at &amp;gt;200 sites originating from meiotic double-strand breaks (DSBs). Of this initial pool, only 1–2 DSBs per homolog pair will be designated to form meiotic crossovers (COs), where reciprocal genetic exchange occurs between parental chromosomes. Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) is known to localize to so-called “late recombination nodules” (LRNs) marking incipient CO sites. However, the role of CDK2 kinase activity in the process of CO formation remains uncertain. Here, we describe the phenotype of 2 &lt;i&gt;Cdk2&lt;/i&gt; point mutants with elevated or decreased activity, respectively. Elevated CDK2 activity was associated with increased numbers of LRN-associated proteins, including CDK2 itself and the MutL homolog 1 (MLH1) component of the MutLγ complex, but did not lead to increased numbers of COs. In contrast, reduced CDK2 activity leads to the complete absence of CO formation during meiotic prophase I. Our data suggest an important role for CDK2 in regulating MLH1 focus numbers and that the activity of this kinase is a key regulatory factor in the formation of meiotic COs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/jud51SrdahU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: NOTCH2NLC Intermediate‐Length Repeat Expansions Are Associated with Parkinson Disease</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25925?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;NOTCH2NLC&lt;/i&gt; GGC repeat expansions were recently identified in neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID); however, it remains unclear whether they occur in other neurodegenerative disorders. This study aimed to investigate the role of intermediate‐length &lt;i&gt;NOTCH2NLC&lt;/i&gt; GGC repeat expansions in Parkinson disease (PD). We screened for GGC repeat expansions in a cohort of 1,011 PD patients and identified 11 patients with intermediate‐length repeat expansions ranging from 41 to 52 repeats, with no repeat expansions in 1,134 controls. Skin biopsy revealed phospho‐alpha‐synuclein deposition, confirming the PD diagnosis in 2 patients harboring intermediate‐length repeat expansions instead of NIID or essential tremor. Fibroblasts from PD patients harboring intermediate‐length repeat expansions revealed &lt;i&gt;NOTCH2NLC&lt;/i&gt; upregulation and autophagic dysfunction. Our results suggest that intermediate‐length repeat expansions in &lt;i&gt;NOTCH2NLC&lt;/i&gt; are potentially associated with PD. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Association between migraine and cryptogenic ischemic stroke in young adults</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25937?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assess the association between migraine and cryptogenic ischemic stroke (CIS) in young adults, with subgroup analyses stratified by sex and presence of patent foramen ovale (PFO).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We prospectively enrolled 347 consecutive patients aged 18‐49 with a recent CIS and 347 age‐ and sex‐matched (±5 years) stroke‐free controls. Any migraine and migraine with (MA) and migraine without aura (MO) were identified by a screener, which we validated against a headache‐neurologist. We used conditional logistic regression adjusting for age, education, hypertension, diabetes, waist‐to‐hip ratio, physical inactivity, current smoking, heavy drinking, and oral estrogen use to assess independent association between migraine and CIS. The effect of PFO on the association between migraine and CIS was analyzed with logistic regression in a subgroup investigated with transcranial Doppler bubble screen.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The screener performance was excellent (Cohen’s Kappa &amp;gt;0.75) in patients and controls. Compared with non‐migraineurs, any migraine (odds ratio [OR] 2.48, 95% confidence interval 1.63‐3.76) and MA (OR 3.50, 2.19‐5.61) were associated with CIS, whereas MO was not. The association emerged both in women (OR 2.97 for any migraine, 1.61‐5.47; OR 4.32 for MA, 2.16‐8.65) and men (OR 2.47 for any migraine, 1.32‐4.61; OR 3.61 for MA, 1.75‐7.45). Specifically for MA, the association with CIS remained significant irrespective of PFO. MA prevalence increased with increasing magnitude of the right‐to‐left shunt in patients with PFO.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MA has a strong association with CIS in young patients, independent of vascular risk factors and presence of PFO.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: A comparison of cell density and serotonergic innervation of the amygdala among four macaque species</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;A comparison of cell density and serotonergic innervation of the amygdala among four macaque species&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/31585180-4cde-400d-ad7e-4ef557521b36/cne25048-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A high degree of behavioral variation has been observed among macaque species. To investigate the neural basis of this variation, we used stereological methods to compare neural cell density and serotonin transporter‐immunoreactive axon density in the amygdala among four species that differ in social style. We hypothesized that significantly greater serotonergic innervation would be observed in the amygdala of the most socially tolerant species in our sample, the moor macaque. Instead, the pigtailed macaque, which is considered moderately tolerant, possessed significantly greater serotonergic innervation in the amygdala relative to Japanese and moor macaques. Our findings provide insight on the neural substrates of primate sociality from an evolutionary perspective.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The genus &lt;i&gt;Macaca&lt;/i&gt; is an ideal model for investigating the biological basis of primate social behavior from an evolutionary perspective. A significant amount of behavioral diversity has been reported among the macaque species, but little is known about the neural substrates that support this variation. The present study compared neural cell density and serotonergic innervation of the amygdala among four macaque species using histological and immunohistochemical methods. The species examined included rhesus (&lt;i&gt;Macaca mulatta)&lt;/i&gt;, Japanese (&lt;i&gt;M. fuscata)&lt;/i&gt;, pigtailed (&lt;i&gt;M. nemestrina)&lt;/i&gt;, and moor macaques (&lt;i&gt;M. maura)&lt;/i&gt;. We anticipated that the more aggressive rhesus and Japanese macaques would have lower serotonergic innervation within the amygdala compared to the more affiliative pigtailed and moor macaques. In contrast to our prediction, pigtailed macaques had higher serotonergic innervation than Japanese and moor macaques in the basal and central amygdala nuclei when controlling for neuron density. Our analysis of neural cell populations revealed that Japanese macaques possess significantly higher neuron and glia densities relative to the other three species, however we observed no glia‐to‐neuron ratio differences among species. The results of this study revealed serotonergic innervation and cell density differences among closely related macaque species, which may play a role in modulating subtle differences in emotional processing and species‐typical social styles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Modifying reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling in peripheral macrophages, using bone marrow cell replacement, reduces both macrophage and microglia inflammatory response, delays pathology and increases survival in ALS mouse models.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/dk8ZQAHZweU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Repeated Restraint Stress Led to Cognitive Dysfunction by NMDA Receptor-Mediated Hippocampal CA3 Dendritic Spine Impairments in Juvenile Sprague-Dawley Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.552787</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Although numerous studies have indicated that chronic stress causes cognitive dysfunction with the impairment of synaptic structures and functions, the relationship between cognitive deficits induced by repeated restraint stress and the level of NMDA receptors in the subregion of the hippocampus has been relatively unknown until now. In this study, 3-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to repeated restraint stress for seven consecutive days, their cognitive functions were evaluated through behavioral tests, and then they were sacrificed for electrophysiological, morphological, and biochemical assays. Chronic repeated restraint stress led to cognitive and electrophysiological impairments, with a reduced density of dendritic spines. We also found that the protein level of NMDA receptors only increased in the hippocampal CA3 region. Nevertheless, repeated restraint stress-induced cognitive and synaptic dysfunction were effectively reversed by Ro25-6981, an inhibitor of the GluN2B receptor. These findings suggest that repeated restraint stress-induced synaptic and cognitive deficits are probably mediated through NMDA receptors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation-Induced Plasticity Mechanisms: TMS-Related Gene Expression and Morphology Changes in a Human Neuron-Like Cell Model</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.528396</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a form of non-invasive brain stimulation, used to alter cortical excitability both in research and clinical applications. The intermittent and continuous Theta Burst Stimulation (iTBS and cTBS) protocols have been shown to induce opposite after-effects on human cortex excitability. Animal studies have implicated synaptic plasticity mechanisms long-term potentiation (LTP, for iTBS) and depression (LTD, for cTBS). However, the neural basis of TMS effects has not yet been studied in human neuronal cells, in particular at the level of gene expression and synaptogenesis. To investigate responses to TBS in living human neurons, we differentiated human SH-SY5Y cells toward a mature neural phenotype, and stimulated them with iTBS, cTBS, or sham (placebo) TBS. Changes in (a) mRNA expression of a set of target genes (previously associated with synaptic plasticity), and (b) morphological parameters of neurite outgrowth following TBS were quantified. We found no general effects of stimulation condition or time on gene expression, though we did observe a significantly enhanced expression of plasticity genes NTRK2 and MAPK9 24 h after iTBS as compared to sham TBS. This specific effect provides unique support for the widely assumed plasticity mechanisms underlying iTBS effects on human cortex excitability. In addition to this protocol-specific increase in plasticity gene expression 24 h after iTBS stimulation, we establish the feasibility of stimulating living human neuron with TBS, and the importance of moving to more complex human in vitro models to understand the underlying plasticity mechanisms of TBS stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Dopamine, Alpha-Synuclein, and Mitochondrial Dysfunctions in Parkinsonian Eyes</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.567129</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by motor dysfunctions including bradykinesia, tremor at rest and motor instability. These symptoms are associated with the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons originating in the substantia nigra pars compacta and projecting to the corpus striatum, and by accumulation of cytoplasmic inclusions mainly consisting of aggregated alpha-synuclein, called Lewy bodies. PD is a complex, multifactorial disorder and its pathogenesis involves multiple pathways and mechanisms such as α-synuclein proteostasis, mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, calcium homeostasis, axonal transport, and neuroinflammation. Motor symptoms manifest when there is already an extensive dopamine denervation. There is therefore an urgent need for early biomarkers to apply disease-modifying therapeutic strategies. Visual defects and retinal abnormalities, including decreased visual acuity, abnormal spatial contrast sensitivity, color vision defects, or deficits in more complex visual tasks are present in the majority of PD patients. They are being considered for early diagnosis together with retinal imaging techniques are being considered as non-invasive biomarkers for PD. Dopaminergic cells can be found in the retina in a subpopulation of amacrine cells; however, the molecular mechanisms leading to visual deficits observed in PD patients are still largely unknown. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the retinal abnormalities observed in PD patients and animal models and of the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration in parkinsonian eyes. We will review the role of α-synuclein aggregates in the retina pathology and/or in the onset of visual symptoms in PD suggesting that α-synuclein aggregates are harmful for the retina as well as for the brain. Moreover, we will summarize experimental evidence suggesting that the optic nerve pathology observed in PD resembles that seen in mitochondrial optic neuropathies highlighting the possible involvement of mitochondrial abnormalities in the development of PD visual defects. We finally propose that the eye may be considered as a complementary experimental model to identify possible novel disease’ pathways or to test novel therapeutic approaches for PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This article provides an overview of the study protocol for the Teen Inflammation Glutamate Emotion Research (TIGER) project, a longitudinal study in which we plan to recruit 60 depressed adolescents (ages 13–18 years) and 30 psychiatrically healthy controls in order to examine the inflammatory and glutamatergic pathways that contribute to the recurrence of depression in adolescents. TIGER is the first study to examine the effects of peripheral inflammation on neurodevelopmental trajectories by assessing changes in cortical glutamate in depressed adolescents. Here, we describe the scientific rationale, design, and methods for the TIGER project. This article is intended to serve as an introduction to this project and to provide details for investigators who may be seeking to replicate or extend these methods for other related research endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Pancreatic Polypeptide but Not Other Members of the Neuropeptide Y Family Shows a Moderate Association With Perceived Anxiety in Obese Men</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.578578</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuropeptide Y (NPY), peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY), and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) are important mediators in the bidirectional communication along the gut-brain-axis. Best known for their role in the regulation of appetite and food intake they are considered to play a crucial role in the development of obesity. Additionally, mounting evidence indicates a regulatory function in anxiety, mood and stress resilience with potential sex differences. In the present study, we examined the associations of NPY, PYY, and PP plasma levels with anxiety, depressiveness and perceived stress in obese patients. We analyzed 144 inpatients (90 female, 54 male, BMI mean: 49.4 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in a naturalistic treatment setting for obesity and its somatic and mental comorbidities. Fasting blood samples were taken, and patients completed psychometric self-assessment questionnaires (GAD-7, PHQ-9, PSQ-20) within the first week after admission and before discharge. Plasma concentrations of the peptides were measured by ELISA. Women showed significant higher anxiety (GAD-7: 8.13 ± 5.67 vs. 5.93 ± 5.42, p = 0.04) and stress scores (PSQ-20: 52.62 ± 23.5 vs. 41.23 ± 22.53, p = 0.01) than men. In the longitudinal analysis women with a clinically relevant improvement of anxiety (≥ 5 points on GAD-7, p &amp;lt; 0.001) also showed significant improvements in depression (PHQ-9: 38%, p = 0.002) and PSQ-20 scores (23%, p = 0.005) while anxiety-improved male patients only improved in the subscale tension of the PSQ-20 (34%, p = 0.02). In men we observed a positive correlation of PP with anxiety scores (GAD-7: r = 0.41, p = 0.007) and with age (r = 0.49, p = 0.001) on admission while NPY negatively correlated with age (r = -0.38, p = 0.01). In contrast, there were no significant associations (p &amp;gt; 0.05) in female subjects in the cross-sectional as well as in the longitudinal analysis. In conclusion, women suffering from morbid obesity showed greater psychological comorbidity and considerable interactions among them. Despite that we solely observed associations of PP with anxiety and age with NPY and PP in men, suggesting a possible influence of sex hormones on the NPY system. However, improvement of anxiety scores did not lead to significant changes in NPY.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Oscillations in the beta/low gamma range (10–45 Hz) are recorded in diverse neural structures. They have successfully been modeled as sparsely synchronized oscillations arising from reciprocal interactions between randomly connected excitatory (E) pyramidal cells and local interneurons (I). The synchronization of spatially distant oscillatory spiking E–I modules has been well-studied in the rate model framework but less so for modules of spiking neurons. Here, we first show that previously proposed modifications of rate models provide a quantitative description of spiking E–I modules of Exponential Integrate-and-Fire (EIF) neurons. This allows us to analyze the dynamical regimes of sparsely synchronized oscillatory E–I modules connected by long-range excitatory interactions, for two modules, as well as for a chain of such modules. For modules with a large number of neurons (&amp;gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;), we obtain results similar to previously obtained ones based on the classic deterministic Wilson-Cowan rate model, with the added bonus that the results quantitatively describe simulations of spiking EIF neurons. However, for modules with a moderate (~ 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;) number of neurons, stochastic variations in the spike emission of neurons are important and need to be taken into account. On the one hand, they modify the oscillations in a way that tends to promote synchronization between different modules. On the other hand, independent fluctuations on different modules tend to disrupt synchronization. The correlations between distant oscillatory modules can be described by stochastic equations for the oscillator phases that have been intensely studied in other contexts. On shorter distances, we develop a description that also takes into account amplitude modes and that quantitatively accounts for our simulation data. Stochastic dephasing of neighboring modules produces transient phase gradients and the transient appearance of phase waves. We propose that these stochastically-induced phase waves provide an explanative framework for the observations of traveling waves in the cortex during beta oscillations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Molecular Motor KIF3B Acts as a Key Regulator of Dendritic Architecture in Cortical Neurons</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.521199</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurons require a well-coordinated intercellular transport system to maintain their normal cellular function and morphology. The kinesin family of proteins (KIFs) fills this role by regulating the transport of a diverse array of cargos in post-mitotic cells. On the other hand, in mitotic cells, KIFs facilitate the fidelity of the cellular division machinery. Though certain mitotic KIFs function in post-mitotic neurons, little is known about them. We studied the role of a mitotic KIF (KIF3B) in neuronal architecture. We find that the RNAi mediated knockdown of KIF3B in primary cortical neurons resulted in an increase in spine density; the number of thin and mushroom spines; and dendritic branching. Consistent with the change in spine density, we observed a specific increase in the distribution of the excitatory post-synaptic protein, PSD-95 in KIF3B knockdown neurons. Interestingly, overexpression of KIF3B produced a reduction in spine density, in particular mushroom spines, and a decrease in dendritic branching. These studies suggest that KIF3B is a key determinant of cortical neuron morphology and that it functions as an inhibitory constraint on structural plasticity, further illuminating the significance of mitotic KIFs in post-mitotic neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Mapping Central Projection of Oxytocin Neurons in Unmated Mice Using Cre and Alkaline Phosphatase Reporter</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.559402</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Oxytocin, a neuropeptide and peptide hormone, is produced by neurons in the hypothalamus and released by the posterior pituitary to control breastfeeding and labor. Recent studies have revealed that oxytocin in the central nervous system is also involved in modulating social interaction. To understand the potential role and innervation pattern of oxytocin neurons before sexual interaction, here we used transgenic mice which have the Cre recombinase under the control of an endogenous oxytocin promoter and Cre-dependent human placental alkaline phosphatase (AP) reporter to label the oxytocin neurons in the naive mouse brain. Since AP is located on the membrane of oxytocin neurons, AP histochemistry staining enabled us to observe the fine axonal terminals and the innervation pattern of oxytocin neurons in the thick serial coronal brain slices. Here we show that the number of AP-labeled cells varies with staining reaction time and ranges from 30% of the oxytocin immune-positive cell count to slightly higher than the oxytocin immune-positive cell count. Using AP staining with extended reaction time, which may not label all oxytocin neurons, we confirmed many innervation targets of oxytocin neurons from the anterior olfactory nucleus, some cortex regions, the limbic system, the hypothalamus, and the hindbrain, while the cell bodies were exclusively located in the hypothalamus and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Finally, we observe some individual variance at the olfactory area, isocortex, striatum, paraventricular nucleus of thalamus, locus coeruleus, and Barrington’s nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The mouse is the most important animal model within neuroscientific research, a position strengthened by the wide-spread use of transgenic mouse models. Discoveries in animals are followed by corroboration in humans, and the interchange between these fields of research is essential to our understanding of the human brain. With the advent of advanced technologies such as single-cell transcriptomics, epigenetic profiling and diffusion MRI, many prominent research institutes and collaborations have emerged, aiming to construct complete human or mouse brain atlases with data on gene expression, connectivity and cell types. These initiatives are indispensable resources, but frequently require extensive, time-consuming development, and rely on updates by the provider. They often come in the shape of applications which require practice or prior technical know-how. Importantly, none of them place the human and the mouse brain next to each other to allow for immediate comparison. We present BrainWiki, a user-friendly, web-based atlas that links the human and the mouse brain together, side-by-side. The platform gives the user a simple overview of brain anatomy along with published articles relating to each brain region that allows the user to delve deeper into the current state of research concerning circuitry, brain functions and pathology. The website relies on interactivity and supports user contributions resulting in a dynamic website that evolves at the pace of neuroscience. It is designed to allow for constant updates and new features in the future which will contain data such as gene expression and neuronal cell types.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Large-Scale Convergence of Receptor Cell Arrays Onto Afferent Terminal Arbors in the Lorenzinian Electroreceptors of Polyodon</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00050</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Certain sensory receptors contain many transducers, converging onto few afferents. Convergence creates star-topology neural networks, of iterative parallel organization, that may yield special functional properties. We quantitated large-scale convergence in electroreceptors on the rostrum of preadult paddlefish, Polyodon spathula (Acipenseriforme vertebrates), and analyzed the afferent terminal branching underlying the convergence. From neurophysiological mapping, a recorded afferent innervated 23.3 ± 9.1 (range 6–45) ampullary organs, and innervated every ampullary organ within the receptive field’s sharp boundary. Ampullary organs each contained ∼665 Lorenzinian receptor cells, from imaging and modeling. We imaged three serial types of afferent branching at electroreceptors, after immunofluorescent labeling for neurite filaments, glial sheaths, or nodal ion channels, or by DiI tracing. (i) Myelinated tree: Each of 3.08 ± 0.51 (2–4) parallel afferents from a cranial nerve (ALLn) entered a receptive field from deeper tissue, then branched into a laminar tree of large myelinated dendrites, parallel to the skin, that branched radially until ∼9 extremities with heminodes, which were candidate sites of spike encoders. (ii) Inline transition: Each myelinated extremity led distally into local unmyelinated arbors originating at inline branching structures covered by terminal (satellite) glia. The unmyelinated transition zones included globular afferent modules, 4–6 microns wide, from which erupted fine fascicles of parallel submicron neurites, a possibly novel type of neuronal branching. The neurite fascicles formed loose bundles projecting ∼105 microns distally to innervate local groups of ∼3 adjacent ampullary organs. (iii) Radial arbors: Receptor cells in an electrosensory neuroepithelium covering the basal pole of each ampullary organ were innervated by bouton endings of radial neurites, unmyelinated and submicron, forming a thin curviplanar lamina distal to the lectin+ basal lamina. The profuse radial neurites diverged from thicker (∼2 micron) basolateral trunks. Overall, an average Polyodon electroreceptor formed a star topology array of ∼9 sensor groups. Total convergence ratios were 15,495 ± 6,052 parallel receptor cells per afferent per mean receptive field, assuming 100% innervation. Large-scale convergence likely increases the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of stimulus encoding into spiking afferent output, increasing receiver sensitivity. Unmyelinated arbors may also regenerate and repair the afferent innervation of ampullary organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LSID:urn:lsid:zoobank.org:act:09BCF04C-3C3C-4B6C-9DC9-A2BF43087369&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: LncRNAs Stand as Potent Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets for Stroke</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.594571</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Stroke is a major public health problem worldwide with a high burden of neurological disability and mortality. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have attracted much attention in the past decades because of their newly discovered roles in pathophysiological processes in many diseases. The abundance of lncRNAs in the nervous system indicates that they may be part of a complex regulatory network governing physiology and pathology of the brain. In particular, lncRNAs have been shown to play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of stroke. In this article, we provide a review of the multifaceted functions of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage, highlighting their promising use as stroke diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutics. To this end, we discuss the potential of stem cells in aiding lncRNA applications in stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Effects of Nordic Walking With Poles With an Integrated Resistance Shock Absorber on Cognitive Abilities and Cardiopulmonary Efficiency in Postmenopausal Women</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.586286</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Late adulthood is associated with atrophy of brain areas, which contribute to cognitive deterioration and increase the risk of depression. On the other hand, aerobic exercise can improve learning and memory function, ameliorate mood, and prevent neurodegenerative changes. This study demonstrates the effect of Nordic walking (NW) and NW with poles with an integrated resistance shock absorber (NW with RSA) on aerobic capacity and body composition in postmenopausal women. It also measures the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) serum levels and determines correlations with cognitive functions and depression symptoms. These relationships with the use of NW with RSA as a new form of exercise have not been described thus far. In this study, 31 women (NW – 16, NW with RSA – 15) participated in eight weeks of training. The findings showed that only NW with RSA training caused a significant decrease in body mass and body mass index (p &amp;lt; 0.05). There were no significant changes in GDNF levels between groups studied. Regarding BDNF, a significant decrease (p &amp;lt; 0.05) in the NW group and an increase (not statistically significant) in the NW with RSA group was found. A comparative analysis of cognitive and depression outcomes and changes in BDNF and GDNF concentration showed no significant differences in the efficacy of either form of training. Training loads resulted in a significant increase in VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;max in both the NW (p &amp;lt; 0.01) and NW with RSA (p &amp;lt; 0.05) groups. This indicates an improvement in cardiopulmonary efficiency of the examined women.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Reliability of P3 Event-Related Potential During Working Memory Across the Spectrum of Cognitive Aging</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.566391</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Event-related potentials (ERPs) offer unparalleled temporal resolution in tracing distinct electrophysiological processes related to normal and pathological cognitive aging. The stability of ERPs in older individuals with a vast range of cognitive ability has not been established. In this test-retest reliability study, 39 older individuals (age 74.10 (5.4) years; 23 (59%) women; 15 non β-amyloid elevated, 16 β-amyloid elevated, 8 cognitively impaired) with scores on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) ranging between 3 and 30 completed a working memory (n-back) test with three levels of difficulty at baseline and 2-week follow-up. The main aim was to evaluate stability of the ERP on grand averaged task effects for both visits in the total sample (n = 39). Secondary aims were to evaluate the effect of age, group (non β-amyloid elevated; β-amyloid elevated, cognitively impaired), cognitive status (MOCA), and task difficulty on ERP reliability. P3 peak amplitude and latency were measured in predetermined channels. P3 peak amplitude at Fz, our main outcome variable, showed excellent reliability in 0-back (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), 95% confidence interval = 0.82 (0.67–0.90) and 1-back (ICC = 0.87 (0.76–0.93), however, only fair reliability in 2-back (ICC = 0.53 (0.09–0.75). Reliability of P3 peak latencies was substantially lower, with ICCs ranging between 0.17 for 2-back and 0.54 for 0-back. Generalized linear mixed models showed no confounding effect of age, group, or task difficulty on stability of P3 amplitude and latency of Fz. By contrast, MOCA scores tended to negatively correlate with P3 amplitude of Fz (p = 0.07). We conclude that P3 peak amplitude, and to lesser extent P3 peak latency, provide a stable measure of electrophysiological processes in older individuals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/62199</link>
	<content:encoded>Although the ε2 allele of apolipoprotein E (&lt;i&gt;APOE2&lt;/i&gt;) benefits longevity, its mechanism is not understood. The protective effects of the &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;2 on Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, particularly through their effects on amyloid or tau accumulation, may confound &lt;i&gt;APOE2&lt;/i&gt; effects on longevity. Herein, we showed that the association between &lt;i&gt;APOE2&lt;/i&gt; and longer lifespan persisted irrespective of AD status, including its neuropathology, by analyzing clinical database as well as animal models. Notably, &lt;i&gt;APOE2&lt;/i&gt; was associated with preserved physical activity during aging, which also associated with lifespan. In animal models, distinct apoE isoform levels, where &lt;i&gt;APOE2&lt;/i&gt; has the highest, were correlated with activity levels, while some forms of cholesterol and triglycerides were associated with apoE and activity levels. These results indicate that &lt;i&gt;APOE2&lt;/i&gt; can contribute to longevity independent of AD. Preserved activity would be an early-observable feature of apoE2-mediated longevity, where higher levels of apoE2 and its-associated lipid metabolism might be involved.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Feeding state functionally reconfigures a sensory circuit to drive thermosensory behavioral plasticity</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61167</link>
	<content:encoded>Internal state alters sensory behaviors to optimize survival strategies. The neuronal mechanisms underlying hunger-dependent behavioral plasticity are not fully characterized. Here we show that feeding state alters &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; thermotaxis behavior by engaging a modulatory circuit whose activity gates the output of the core thermotaxis network. Feeding state does not alter the activity of the core thermotaxis circuit comprised of AFD thermosensory and AIY interneurons. Instead, prolonged food deprivation potentiates temperature responses in the AWC sensory neurons, which inhibit the postsynaptic AIA interneurons to override and disrupt AFD-driven thermotaxis behavior. Acute inhibition and activation of AWC and AIA, respectively, restores negative thermotaxis in starved animals. We find that state-dependent modulation of AWC-AIA temperature responses requires INS-1 insulin-like peptide signaling from the gut and DAF-16 FOXO function in AWC. Our results describe a mechanism by which functional reconfiguration of a sensory network via gut-brain signaling drives state-dependent behavioral flexibility.</content:encoded>

In mice expressing human &lt;i&gt;MFN2&lt;/i&gt; T105M, intermittent mitofusin activation with a small molecule, MiM111, normalized CMT2A neuromuscular dysfunction, reversed pre-treatment axon and skeletal myocyte atrophy, and enhanced axon regrowth by increasing mitochondrial transport within peripheral axons and promoting &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; mitochondrial localization to neuromuscular junctional synapses. MiM111-treated &lt;i&gt;MFN2&lt;/i&gt; T105M mouse neurons exhibited accelerated primary outgrowth and greater post-axotomy regrowth, linked to enhanced mitochondrial motility.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59795</link>
	<content:encoded>Insects utilize diverse food resources which can affect the evolution of their genomic repertoire, including leading to gene losses in different nutrient pathways. Here we investigate gene loss in amino acid synthesis pathways, with special attention to hymenopterans and parasitoid wasps. Using comparative genomics, we find that synthesis capability for tryptophan, phenylalanine, tyrosine and histidine was lost in holometabolous insects prior to hymenopteran divergence, while valine, leucine and isoleucine were lost in the common ancestor of Hymenoptera. Subsequently, multiple loss events of lysine synthesis occurred independently in the Parasitoida and Aculeata. Experiments in the parasitoid &lt;i&gt;Cotesia chilonis&lt;/i&gt; confirm that it has lost the ability to synthesize eight amino acids. Our findings provide insights into amino acid synthesis evolution, and specifically can be used to inform the design of parasitoid artificial diets for pest control.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: On the objectivity, reliability, and validity of deep learning enabled bioimage analyses</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59780</link>
	<content:encoded>Bioimage analysis of fluorescent labels is widely used in the life sciences. Recent advances in deep learning (DL) allow automating time-consuming manual image analysis processes based on annotated training data. However, manual annotation of fluorescent features with a low signal-to-noise ratio is somewhat subjective. Training DL models on subjective annotations may be instable or yield biased models. In turn, these models may be unable to reliably detect biological effects. An analysis pipeline integrating data annotation, ground truth estimation, and model training can mitigate this risk. To evaluate this integrated process, we compared different DL-based analysis approaches. With data from two model organisms (mice, zebrafish) and five laboratories, we show that ground truth estimation from multiple human annotators helps to establish objectivity in fluorescent feature annotations. Furthermore, ensembles of multiple models trained on the estimated ground truth establish reliability and validity. Our research provides guidelines for reproducible DL-based bioimage analyses.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Bacteria of the genus &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; cause shigellosis, a severe gastrointestinal disease that is a major cause of diarrhea-associated mortality in humans. Mice are highly resistant to &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; and the lack of a tractable physiological model of shigellosis has impeded our understanding of this important human disease. Here we propose that the differential susceptibility of mice and humans to &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; is due to mouse-specific activation of the NAIP–NLRC4 inflammasome. We find that NAIP–NLRC4-deficient mice are highly susceptible to oral &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; infection and recapitulate the clinical features of human shigellosis. Although inflammasomes are generally thought to promote &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; pathogenesis, we instead demonstrate that intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific NAIP–NLRC4 activity is sufficient to protect mice from shigellosis. In addition to describing a new mouse model of shigellosis, our results suggest that the lack of an inflammasome response in IECs may help explain the susceptibility of humans to shigellosis.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Effective learning requires using errors in a task-dependent manner, for example adjusting to errors that result from unpredicted environmental changes but ignoring errors that result from environmental stochasticity. Where and how the brain represents errors in a task-dependent manner and uses them to guide behavior are not well understood. We imaged the brains of human participants performing a predictive-inference task with two conditions that had different sources of errors. Their performance was sensitive to this difference, including more choice switches after fundamental changes versus stochastic fluctuations in reward contingencies. Using multi-voxel pattern classification, we identified task-dependent representations of error magnitude and past errors in posterior parietal cortex. These representations were distinct from representations of the resulting behavioral adjustments in dorsomedial frontal, anterior cingulate, and orbitofrontal cortex. The results provide new insights into how the human brain represents errors in a task-dependent manner and guides subsequent adaptive behavior.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Poor diet and lifestyle exposures are implicated in substantial global increases in non-communicable disease burden in low-income, remote, and Indigenous communities. This observational study investigated the contribution of the fecal microbiome to influence host physiology in two Indigenous communities in the Torres Strait Islands: Mer, a remote island where a traditional diet predominates, and Waiben a more accessible island with greater access to takeaway food and alcohol. Counterintuitively, disease markers were more pronounced in Mer residents. However, island-specific differences in disease risk were explained, in part, by microbiome traits. The absence of &lt;i&gt;Alistipes onderdonkii&lt;/i&gt;, for example, significantly (p=0.014) moderated island-specific patterns of systolic blood pressure in multivariate-adjusted models. We also report mediatory relationships between traits of the fecal metagenome, disease markers, and risk exposures. Understanding how intestinal microbiome traits influence response to disease risk exposures is critical for the development of strategies that mitigate the growing burden of cardiometabolic disease in these communities.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58155</link>
	<content:encoded>Ubiquitination regulates many different cellular processes, including protein quality control, membrane trafficking, and stress responses. The diversity of ubiquitin functions in the cell is partly due to its ability to form chains with distinct linkages that can alter the fate of substrate proteins in unique ways. The complexity of the ubiquitin code is further enhanced by post-translational modifications on ubiquitin itself, the biological functions of which are not well understood. Here, we present genetic and biochemical evidence that serine 57 (Ser57) phosphorylation of ubiquitin functions in stress responses in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, including the oxidative stress response. We also identify and characterize the first known Ser57 ubiquitin kinases in yeast and human cells, and we report that two Ser57 ubiquitin kinases regulate the oxidative stress response in yeast. These studies implicate ubiquitin phosphorylation at the Ser57 position as an important modifier of ubiquitin function, particularly in response to proteotoxic stress.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Learning about rewards and punishments is critical for survival. Classical studies have demonstrated an impressive correspondence between the firing of dopamine neurons in the mammalian midbrain and the reward prediction errors of reinforcement learning algorithms, which express the difference between actual reward and predicted mean reward. However, it may be advantageous to learn not only the mean but also the complete distribution of potential rewards. Recent advances in machine learning have revealed a biologically plausible set of algorithms for reconstructing this reward distribution from experience.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Corticocuneate projections are altered after spinal cord dorsal column lesions in New World monkeys&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6b7c0466-84a2-453b-a733-75d7de43c872/cne25050-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cuneate nucleus normally receives cortical inputs from the hand regions of sensorimotor cortex in the contralateral and ipsilateral hemispheres. This cortical descending influence remains similar in New World monkeys with the short recoveries from the dorsal column lesion, but is greatly increased after the long recoveries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recovery of responses to cutaneous stimuli in the area 3b hand cortex of monkeys after dorsal column lesions (DCLs) in the cervical spinal cord relies on neural rewiring in the cuneate nucleus (Cu) over time. To examine whether the corticocuneate projections are modified during recoveries after the DCL, we injected cholera toxin subunit B into the hand representation in Cu to label the cortical neurons after various recovery times, and related results to the recovery of neural responses in the affected area 3b hand cortex. In normal New World monkeys, labeled neurons were predominately distributed in the hand regions of contralateral areas 3b, 3a, 1 and 2, parietal ventral (PV), secondary somatosensory cortex (S2), and primary motor cortex (M1), with similar distributions in the ipsilateral cortex in significantly smaller numbers. In monkeys with short‐term recoveries, the area 3b hand neurons were unresponsive or responded weakly to touch on the hand, while the cortical labeling pattern was largely unchanged. After longer recoveries, the area 3b hand neurons remained unresponsive, or responded to touch on the hand or somatotopically abnormal parts, depending on the lesion extent. The distributions of cortical labeled neurons were much more widespread than the normal pattern in both hemispheres, especially when lesions were incomplete. The proportion of labeled neurons in the contralateral area 3b hand cortex was not correlated with the functional reactivation in the area 3b hand cortex. Overall, our findings indicated that corticocuneate inputs increase during the functional recovery, but their functional role is uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Hippocampal subregional volume changes in elders classified using positron emission tomography‐based Alzheimer's biomarkers of β‐amyloid deposition and neurodegeneration&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9cfefe36-38bc-4677-b9d2-3723b3170e53/jnr24739-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volume of hippocampal subregions (presubiculum/subiculum) are reduced in elderly subjects presenting cortical β‐amyloid deposition and signs of neurodegeneration. In elderly subjects with no neurodegeneration, hippocampal subregional volumes are also reduced in those with cognitive decline (dementia or amnestic mild cognitive impairment) compared to cognitively intact individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes in hippocampal subfield volumes (HSV) along the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum have been scarcely investigated to date in elderly subjects classified based on the presence of β‐amyloid aggregation and signs of neurodegeneration. We classified patients (either sex) with mild dementia compatible with AD (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 35) or amnestic mild cognitive impairment (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 39), and cognitively unimpaired subjects (either sex; &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 26) using [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PIB‐PET to assess β‐amyloid aggregation (A+) and [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG‐PET to account for neurodegeneration ((N)+). Magnetic resonance imaging‐based automated methods were used for HSV and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) measurements. Significant HSV reductions were found in A+(N)+ subjects in the presubiculum/subiculum complex and molecular layer, related to worse memory performance. In both the A+(N)+ and A+(N)− categories, subicular volumes were inversely correlated with the degree of Aβ deposition. The A−(N)+ subgroup showed reduced HSV relative to the A−(N)− subgroup also in the subiculum/presubiculum. Combining all (N)− subjects, HSV were lower in subjects presenting significant cognitive decline irrespective of A+/A− classification (controlling for WMH load); these between‐group differences were detected again in the presubiculum, but also involved the CA4 and granular layer. These findings demonstrate that differential HSV reductions are detectable both in (N)+ and (N)− categories along the AD continuum, and are directly related to the severity of cognitive deficits. HSV reductions are larger both in A+(N)+ and A+(N)− subjects in direct proportion to the degree of Aβ deposition. The meaningful HSV reductions detected in the A−(N)+ subgroup highlights the strength of biomarker‐based classifications outside of the classical AD continuum.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;This study provides an anatomical characterization of motor and premotor neurons associated with the muscle producing swim bladder sounds and/or electric discharges in five mochokid catfish. Even though the same muscle and neuronal populations are associated with these behaviors across all species, our results suggest that behavioral differences are associated with quantitative differences, mainly in the size of the protractor muscle and associated skeletal elements, and the number, size and location of motoneurons.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mochokid catfish offer a distinct opportunity to study a communication system transitioning to a new signaling channel because some produce sounds and others electric discharges. Both signals are generated using an elastic spring system (ESS), which includes a protractor muscle innervated by motoneurons within the protractor nucleus that also has a motoneuron afferent population. &lt;i&gt;Synodontis grandiops&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S. nigriventris&lt;/i&gt; produce sounds and electric discharges, respectively, and their ESSs show several morphological and physiological differences. The extent to which these differences explain different signal types remains unclear. Here, we compare ESS morphologies and behavioral phenotypes among five mochokids. &lt;i&gt;Synodontis grandiops&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S. nigriventris&lt;/i&gt; were compared with &lt;i&gt;S. eupterus&lt;/i&gt; that is known to produce both signal types, and representative members of two sister genera, &lt;i&gt;Microsynodontis&lt;/i&gt; cf. &lt;i&gt;batesii&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mochokiella paynei&lt;/i&gt;, for which no data were available&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; We provide support for the hypothesis that peripheral and central components of the ESS are conserved among mochokids. We also show that the two non‐synodontids are only sonic, consistent with sound production being an ancestral character for mochokids. Even though the three sound producing‐only species differ in some ESS characters, several are similar and likely associated with only sound production. We propose that the ability of &lt;i&gt;S. eupterus&lt;/i&gt; to generate both electric discharges and sounds may depend on a protractor muscle intermediate in morphology between sound producing‐only and electric discharge‐only species, and two separate populations of protractor motoneurons. Our results further suggest that an electrogenic ESS in synodontids is an exaptation of a sound producing ESS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Development and Evolution influence the size and branching of visually targeted Mauthner cell dendrites.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mauthner cells are the largest neurons in the hindbrain of teleost fish and most amphibians. Each cell has two major dendrites thought to receive segregated streams of sensory input: the lateral dendrite receives mechanosensory input while the ventral dendrite receives visual input. These inputs, which mediate escape responses to sudden stimuli, may be modulated by the availability of sensory information to the animal. To understand the impact of the absence of visual information on the morphologies of Mauthner cells during developmental and evolutionary time scales, we examined the teleost &lt;i&gt;Astyanax mexicanus&lt;/i&gt;. This species of tetra is found in two morphs: a seeing surface fish and a blind cavefish. We compared the structure of Mauthner cells in surface fish raised under daily light conditions, in surface fish raised in constant darkness, and in two independent lineages of cave populations. The length of ventral dendrites of Mauthner cells in dark‐raised surface fish larvae were longer and more branched, while in both cave morphs the ventral dendrites were smaller or absent. The absence of visual input in surface fish with normal eye development leads to a homeostatic increase in dendrite size, whereas over evolution, the absence of light led to the loss of eyes and a reduction in dendrite size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We measured [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; using fura‐2 imaging in all subtypes (H1, H2, H3, H4) of goldfish retinal horizontal cells in isolated cell and tissue slice preparations, and report spontaneous Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;‐based action potentials (APs) in every subtype. In both preparations, APs differed by subtype: APs were longer and less frequent in H3/4.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horizontal cells (HCs) are neurons of the outer retina, which provide inhibitory feedback onto photoreceptors and contribute to image processing. HCs in teleosts are classified into four subtypes (H1‐H4), each having different roles: H1‐H3 feed back onto different sets of cones, H4 feed back onto rods, and only H1 store and release the inhibitory neurotransmitter, γ‐aminobutyric acid (GABA). Dissociated HCs exhibit spontaneous Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;‐based action potentials (APs), yet it is unclear if APs occur &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt;, or if all subtypes exhibit APs. We measured intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and report APs in slice preparations of the goldfish retina. In HCs furthest from photoreceptors (i.e. H3/H4), APs were less frequent, with greater duration and area under the curve (a measure of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; flux). Next, we classified acutely‐dissociated HCs into subtypes by integrating the ratio of dendritic field size vs. soma size (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;d/s&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;). H1 and H2 subtypes had low &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;d/s&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; values (&amp;lt;8); H3/H4 had high &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;d/s&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; (&amp;gt;12). To verify this model, H1s were identified by immunoreactivity for GABA and 95% of these cells had an &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;d/s&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; increased, AP duration and area under the curve increased, while frequency decreased. Our results demonstrate the presence of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;‐based APs in the goldfish retina &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; and show that HC subtypes H1 through H4 exhibit progressively longer and less frequent spontaneous APs. These results suggest that APs may play an important role in inhibitory feedback, and may have implications for understanding the relative contributions of HC subtypes in the outer retina.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;In 125 healthy older adults we highlighted the importance of routinely accounting for factors that impact cognition both directly as well as indirectly via structural brain changes. Temporal stem diffusion changes demonstrated specificity for explaining the differential impacts of a number of cognitive risk factors on memory performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior research investigating associations between hypertension, obesity, and apolipoprotein (&lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;) genotype status with memory performance among older adults has yielded inconsistent results. This may reflect, in part, a lack of first accounting for the effects these variables have on structural brain changes, that in turn contribute to age‐related memory impairment. The current study sought to clarify the relationships between these factors via path modeling. We hypothesized that higher body mass index (BMI), hypertension, and being an &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;‐ε4 allele carrier would predict poorer memory scores, with much of these effects accounted for by indirect effects operating via differences in the integrity of temporal stem white matter. Participants included 125 healthy older adults who underwent neuropsychological assessment and diffusion‐weighted MRI scanning. Direct effects were found for hypertension and demographic variables including age, sex, and education. Importantly, indirect effects were found for BMI, hypertension, &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;‐ε4 status, age, and sex, where these factors predicted memory scores via their impact on temporal stem diffusion measures. There was also a dual effect of sex, with a direct effect indicating that females had better memory performance overall, and an indirect effect indicating that females with greater temporal stem diffusion had poorer memory performance. Results suggest that changes to the integrity of temporal white matter in aging may underpin reduced memory performance. These results highlight that accounting for variables that not only directly impact cognition, but also for those that indirectly impact cognition via structural brain changes, is crucial for understanding the impact of risk factors on cognition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Adipose tissue stem cells in peripheral nerve regeneration—In vitro and in vivo</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24738?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After peripheral nerve injury, Schwann cells (SCs) are crucially involved in several steps of the subsequent regenerative processes, such as the Wallerian degeneration. They promote lysis and phagocytosis of myelin, secrete numbers of neurotrophic factors and cytokines, and recruit macrophages for a biological debridement. However, nerve injuries with a defect size of &amp;gt;1 cm do not show proper tissue regeneration and require a surgical nerve gap reconstruction. To find a sufficient alternative to the current gold standard—the autologous nerve transplant—several cell‐based therapies have been developed and were experimentally investigated. One approach aims on the use of adipose tissue stem cells (ASCs). These are multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells that can differentiate into multiple phenotypes along the mesodermal lineage, such as osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and myocytes. Furthermore, ASCs also possess neurotrophic features, that is, they secrete neurotrophic factors like the nerve growth factor, brain‐derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin‐3, ciliary neurotrophic factor, glial cell‐derived neurotrophic factor, and artemin. They can also differentiate into the so‐called Schwann cell‐like cells (SCLCs). These cells share features with naturally occurring SCs, as they also promote nerve regeneration in the periphery. This review gives a comprehensive overview of the use of ASCs in peripheral nerve regeneration and peripheral nerve tissue engineering both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. While the sustainability of differentiation of ASCs to SCLCs &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; is still questionable, ASCs used with different nerve conduits, such as hydrogels or silk fibers, have been shown to promote nerve regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Time‐to‐contact perception in the brain&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/28dd0b12-6c75-4ea6-b4b8-22d7163fb18d/jnr24740-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the brain areas engaged when estimating the time to contact of an approaching ball? Patients undergoing an awake brain surgery performed the task while various areas were stimulated. The performances were assessed compared to a presurgery baseline. Results showed a direct and causal involvement of areas near the intraparietal sulcus, and indirect involvement of areas related to the language. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time‐to‐contact (TTC) perception refers to the ability of an observer to estimate the remaining time before an object reaches a point in the environment, and is of crucial importance in daily life. Noninvasive correlational approaches have identified several brain areas sensitive to TTC information. Here we report the results of two studies, including one during an awake brain surgery, that aimed to identify the specific areas causally engaged in the TTC estimation process. In Study 1, we tested 40 patients with brain tumor in a TTC estimation task. The results showed that four of the six patients with impaired performance had tumors in right upper parietal cortex, although this tumoral location represented only six over 40 patients. In Study 2, 15 patients underwent awake brain surgery electrostimulation mapping to examine the implication of various brain areas in the TTC estimation process. We acquired and normalized to MNI space the coordinates of the functional areas that influenced task performance. Our results seem to demonstrate that the early stage of the TTC estimation process involved specific cortical territories in the ventral region of the right intraparietal sulcus. Downstream processing of TTC could also involve the frontal eye field (middle frontal gyrus) related to ocular search. We also found that deactivating language areas in the left hemisphere interfered with the TTC estimation process. These findings demonstrate a fine grained, cortical representation of TTC processing close to the ventral right intraparietal sulcus and complement those described in other human studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are intriguing molecules, able to directly kill several microorganisms and to regulate multiple aspects of the immune response. Despite the extensive studies on the role of AMPs in the epithelial barrier, placing them as a pivotal line of defense against pathogen invasion, little attention has been directed to their role in the maintenance and modulation of the gut microbiota and, by consequence, of the homeostasis of extra intestinal tissues. Here, we review the recent literature about the microbiome–gut–brain axis, focusing on the role of AMPs in this scenario. We provide a straightforward revision of current data in order to provide an overview of the subject, discussing more in depth some points that, in our opinion, are crucial and have received little attention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Using graph theory‐based approach, we investigated the topological organization of functional brain networks in patients with end‐stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing hemodialysis (HD). Disrupted brain functional networks were identified in patients with ESRD, and HD patients showed further disruptions in functional network organization compared with nondialysis patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patterns of change in whole‐brain functional networks remain poorly understood in patients with end‐stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing hemodialysis (HD). We conducted a prospective research to investigate the topological properties of whole‐brain functional networks in those patients using a graph‐based network analysis. Resting‐state functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed on 51 ESRD patients (25 HD and 26 nondialysis patients) and 36 healthy controls (HCs). We compared the topological properties of brain functional networks among the three groups, and analyzed the relationships between those significant parameters and clinical variables in ESRD patients. Progressively disrupted global topological organizations were observed from nondialysis patients to HD patients compared with HCs (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05 after Bonferroni correction). HD patients, relative to HCs, showed significantly decreased nodal centralities in the left temporal pole: superior temporal gyrus, bilateral median cingulate and paracingulate gyri, bilateral hippocampus, bilateral parahippocampal gyrus, and bilateral amygdala, and showed increased nodal centralities in the orbital part of the bilateral middle frontal gyrus, left cuneus, and left superior occipital gyrus (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05 after Bonferroni correction). Furthermore, nodal centralities in the bilateral hippocampus were significantly decreased in HD patients compared with nondialysis patients (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05 after Bonferroni correction). Dialysis duration negatively correlated with global efficiency in ESRD patients undergoing HD (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = −0.676, FDR &lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt; = 0.004). This study indicates that ESRD patients exhibit disruptions in brain functional networks, which are more severe in HD patients, and these alterations are correlated with cognitive performance and clinical markers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Social defeat stress induces sex‐specific inflammatory cytokine/chemokine responses in the periphery and sex‐specific transcriptional regulation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Treatment with dihydrocaffeic acid/malvidin‐glucoside modulates periphery inflammation and gene expression in the prefrontal cortex and alleviates depression‐like phenotype. CSDS, chronic social defeat stress; DHCA, dihydrocaffeic acid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major depressive disorder affects ~20% of the world population and is characterized by strong sexual dimorphism with females being two to three times more likely to develop this disorder. Previously, we demonstrated that a combination therapy with dihydrocaffeic acid and malvidin‐glucoside to synergistically target peripheral inflammation and stress‐induced synaptic maladaptation in the brain was effective in alleviating chronic social defeat stress (CSDS)‐induced depression‐like phenotype in male mice. Here, we test the combination therapy in a female CSDS model for depression and compared sex‐specific responses to stress in the periphery and the central nervous system. Similar to male mice, the combination treatment is also effective in promoting resilience against the CSDS‐induced depression‐like behavior in female mice. However, there are sex‐specific differences in peripheral immune responses and differential gene regulation in the prefrontal cortex to chronic stress and to the treatment. These data indicate that while therapeutic approaches to combat stress‐related disorders may be effective in both sexes, the mechanisms underlying these effects differ, emphasizing the need for inclusion of both sexes in preclinical studies using animal models.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Here we investigated the effects of the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) performed with natural speaking, on the results of linguistic activations. We found that overt speaking during fMRI induced few artifacts and did not significantly affect the results, allowing the identification of areas involved in primary motor control and prosodic regulation of speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid motion artifacts, almost all speech‐related functional magnetic resonance imagings (fMRIs) are performed covertly to detect language activations. This method may be difficult to execute, especially by patients with brain tumors, and does not allow the identification of phonological areas. Here, we aimed to evaluate overt task feasibility. Thirty‐three volunteers participated in this study. They performed two functional sessions of covert and overt generation of a short sentence semantically linked with a word. Three main contrasts were performed: Covert and Overt for the isolation of language‐activated areas, and Overt &amp;gt; Covert for the isolation of the motor cortical activation of speech. fMRI data preprocessing was performed with and without unwarping, and with and without regression of movement parameters as confounding variables. All types of results were compared to each other. For the Overt contrast, Dice coefficients showed strong overlap between each pair of types of results: 0.98 for the pair with and without unwarping, and 0.9 for the pair with and without movement parameter regression. The Overt &amp;gt; Covert contrast allowed isolation of motor laryngeal activations with high statistical reliability and revealed the right‐lateralized temporal activity related to acoustic feedback. Overt speaking during magnetic resonance imaging induced few artifacts and did not significantly affect the results, allowing the identification of areas involved in primary motor control and prosodic regulation of speech. Unwarping and motion artifact regression in the postprocessing step, seem to not be necessary. Changes in lateralization of cortical activity by overt speech shall be explored before using these tasks for presurgical mapping.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Sex‐specific association between infant caudate volumes and a polygenic risk score for major depressive disorder&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b49251b8-6816-401a-a95e-c43535e231a1/jnr24722-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A polygenic risk score for major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with sex‐specific brain structural alterations in the infant bilateral caudate which is crucially implicated in MDD in adults. Our results suggest that sex‐specific polygenic influences on early caudate volume development might contribute to the sexually dimorphic prevalence of MDD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polygenic risk scores for major depressive disorder (PRS‐MDD) have been identified in large genome‐wide association studies, and recent findings suggest that PRS‐MDD might interact with environmental risk factors to shape human limbic brain development as early as in the prenatal period. Striatal structures are crucially involved in depression; however, the association of PRS‐MDD with infant striatal volumes is yet unknown. In this study, 105 Finnish mother–infant dyads (44 female, 11–54 days old) were investigated to reveal how infant PRS‐MDD is associated with infant dorsal striatal volumes (caudate, putamen) and whether PRS‐MDD interacts with prenatal maternal depressive symptoms (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, gestational weeks 14, 24, 34) on infant striatal volumes. A robust sex‐specific main effect of PRS‐MDD on bilateral infant caudate volumes was observed. PRS‐MDD were more positively associated with caudate volumes in boys compared to girls. No significant interaction effects of genotype PRS‐MDD with the environmental risk factor “prenatal maternal depressive symptoms” (genotype‐by‐environment interaction) nor significant interaction effects of genotype with prenatal maternal depressive symptoms and sex (genotype‐by‐environment‐by‐sex interaction) were found for infant dorsal striatal volumes. Our study showed that a higher PRS‐MDD irrespective of prenatal exposure to maternal depressive symptoms is associated with smaller bilateral caudate volumes, an indicator of greater susceptibility to major depressive disorder, in female compared to male infants. This sex‐specific polygenic effect might lay the ground for the higher prevalence of depression in women compared to men.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression is a mental disorder that affects millions of people around the world. However, depressive symptoms can be seen in other psychiatric and medical conditions. Here, we investigate the effect of DHEA treatment on depressive symptoms in individuals with depression and/or other clinical conditions in which depressive symptoms are present. An electronic search was performed until October 2019, with no restrictions on language or year of publication in the following databases: Medline, EMBASE, LILACS, and Cochrane Library. Randomized controlled trials comparing DHEA versus placebo were included if the depressive symptoms were assessed. Fifteen studies with 853 female and male individuals were included in this review. To conduct the meta‐analysis, data were extracted from 14 studies. In comparison with placebo, DHEA improved depressive symptoms (standardized mean difference [SMD] −0.28, 95% (CI) −0.45 to −0.11, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; =.001, 12 studies, 742 individuals (375 in the experimental group and 367 in the placebo group), &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 24%), very low quality of evidence, 2 of 14 studies reporting this outcome were removed in a sensitivity analysis as they were strongly influencing heterogeneity between studies. No hormonal changes that indicated any risk to the participants' health were seen. Side effects observed were uncommon, mild, and transient, but commonly related to androgyny. In conclusion, DHEA was associated with a beneficial effect on depressive symptoms compared to placebo. However, these results should be viewed with caution, since the quality of evidence for this outcome was considered very low according to the GRADE criteria.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Innate and adaptive immune responses to sciatic nerve allografts treated with a polyethylene glycol (PEG)‐fusion repair protocol were compared to those in negative control allografts untreated by PEG. By 21 days PO, PEG‐fused allografts showed significantly reduced major histocompatibility complex class I expression and T cell (CD3) infiltration. PEG‐fused allografts more closely resembled unoperated nerves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ablation/segmental loss peripheral nerve injuries (PNIs) exhibit poor functional recovery due to slow and inaccurate outgrowth of regenerating axons. Viable peripheral nerve allografts (PNAs) as growth‐guide conduits are immunologically rejected and all anucleated donor/host axonal segments undergo Wallerian degeneration. In contrast, we report that ablation‐type sciatic PNIs repaired by neurorrhaphy of viable sciatic PNAs and a polyethylene glycol (PEG)‐fusion protocol using PEG immediately restored axonal continuity for many axons, reinnervated/maintained their neuromuscular junctions, and prevented much Wallerian degeneration. PEG‐fused PNAs permanently restored many sciatic‐mediated behaviors within 2–6 weeks. PEG‐fused PNAs were not rejected even though host/donors were neither immunosuppressed nor tissue‐matched in outbred female Sprague Dawley rats. Innate and adaptive immune responses to PEG‐fused sciatic PNAs were analyzed using electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for morphological features, T cell and macrophage infiltration, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression, apoptosis, expression of cytokines, chemokines, and cytotoxic effectors. PEG‐fused PNAs exhibited attenuated innate and adaptive immune responses by 14–21 days postoperatively, as evidenced by (a) many axons and cells remaining viable, (b) significantly reduced infiltration of cytotoxic and total T cells and macrophages, (c) significantly reduced expression of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and MHC proteins, (d) consistently low apoptotic response. Morphologically and/or biochemically, PEG‐fused sciatic PNAs often resembled sciatic &lt;i&gt;autografts&lt;/i&gt; or intact sciatic nerves. In brief, PEG‐fused PNAs are an unstudied, perhaps unique, example of immune tolerance of viable allograft tissue in a nonimmune‐privileged environment and could greatly improve the clinical outcomes for PNIs relative to current protocols.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cognitive deficits due to spinal cord injury (SCI) have been elucidated in both animals and humans with SCI. Such disorders may cause concomitant oscillatory changes in regions of the brain involving in cognition; a subject that has not been directed mechanistically. One of the crucial oscillations, having a prominent role in cognition, particularly spatial memory, is hippocampal theta rhythm. Our research revealed that SCI could induce changes not only in the neurogenesis and apoptosis rate of the hippocampus but also in theta power as well as receptors involving in the generation of this rhythm. Herein we used 24 male Wistar rats (Sham/SCI = 12) and examined the effect of spinal cord contusion on hippocampal theta rhythm, spatial memory, and neurodegeneration. We proved that SCI eliminates hippocampus‐dependent theta power through spatial working memory, and correlates significantly with neurodegeneration and expression of receptors (NMDA, GABAA, Muscarinic1/M1), which are in turn essential in generation of theta rhythm. The immunohistochemistry analysis also demonstrated a significant decrease in DCX+ and BrdU+ cells; however, according to TUNEL assay, apoptosis is significantly higher in SCI‐induced animals. The western blotting analysis further showed a significant reduction of the abovementioned receptors in the hippocampus. We also verified that SCI impairs the spatial memory, proved by poor performance in the Y‐maze task. As well as, based on the local field potential recordings analysis, SCI decreases the power of theta rhythm. Eventually, this study demonstrated that chronic brain neurodegeneration occurs after SCI accompanied by theta rhythm and cognitive deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Locus Coeruleus and neurovascular unit: From its role in physiology to its potential role in Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24718?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locus coeruleus (LC) is the main noradrenergic (NA) nucleus of the central nervous system. LC degenerates early during Alzheimer's disease (AD) and NA loss might concur to AD pathogenesis. Aside from neurons, LC terminals provide dense innervation of brain intraparenchymal arterioles/capillaries, and NA modulates astrocyte functions. The term neurovascular unit (NVU) defines the strict anatomical/functional interaction occurring between neurons, glial cells, and brain vessels. NVU plays a fundamental role in coupling the energy demand of activated brain regions with regional cerebral blood flow, it includes the blood–brain barrier (BBB), plays an active role in neuroinflammation, and participates also to the glymphatic system. NVU alteration is involved in AD pathophysiology through several mechanisms, mainly related to a relative oligoemia in activated brain regions and impairment of structural and functional BBB integrity, which contributes also to the intracerebral accumulation of insoluble amyloid. We review the existing data on the morphological features of LC‐NA innervation of the NVU, as well as its contribution to neurovascular coupling and BBB proper functioning. After introducing the main experimental data linking LC with AD, which have repeatedly shown a key role of neuroinflammation and increased amyloid plaque formation, we discuss the potential mechanisms by which the loss of NVU modulation by LC might contribute to AD pathogenesis. Surprisingly, thus far not so many studies have tested directly these mechanisms in models of AD in which LC has been lesioned experimentally. Clarifying the interaction of LC with NVU in AD pathogenesis may disclose potential therapeutic targets for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Possible routes of SARS‐CoV‐2 invasion in brain: In context of neurological symptoms in COVID‐19 patients</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24717?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manifestation of neurological symptoms in certain patients of coronavirus disease‐2019 (COVID‐19) has warranted for their virus‐induced etiogenesis. SARS‐CoV‐2, the causative agent of COVID‐19, belongs to the genus of betacoronaviruses which also includes SARS‐CoV‐1 and MERS‐CoV; causative agents for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, respectively. Studies demonstrating the neural invasion of SARS‐CoV‐2 &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; are still scarce, although such characteristics of certain other betacoronaviruses are well demonstrated in the literature. Based on the recent evidence for the presence of SARS‐CoV‐2 host cell entry receptors in specific components of the human nervous and vascular tissue, a neural (olfactory and/or vagal), and a hematogenous—crossing the blood–brain barrier, routes have been proposed. The neurological symptoms in COVID‐19 may also arise as a consequence of the “cytokine storm” (characteristically present in severe disease) induced neuroinflammation, or co‐morbidities. There is also a possibility that, there may be multiple routes of SARS‐CoV‐2 entry into the brain, or multiple mechanisms can be involved in the pathogenesis of the neurological symptoms. In this review article, we have discussed the possible routes of SARS‐CoV‐2 brain entry based on the emerging evidence for this virus, and that available for other betacoronaviruses in literature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;In the present study, we identified cannabinoid type 1 (CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)/dopamine type 2 (D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) heteromers in the globus pallidus of C57BL/J male mice. We found that heteromer formation was differentially influenced by a cannabinoid agonist and different antipsychotics. These CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heteromers were also functionally relevant to mouse movement and γ‐aminobutyric acid release in a neuronal cell culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cannabinoid type 1 (CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) receptor and the dopamine type 2 (D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) receptor are co‐localized on medium spiny neuron terminals in the globus pallidus where they modulate neural circuits involved in voluntary movement. Physical interactions between the two receptors have been shown to alter receptor signaling in cell culture. The objectives of the current study were to identify the presence of CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heteromers in the globus pallidus of C57BL/6J male mice, define how CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heteromer levels are altered following treatment with cannabinoids and/or antipsychotics, and determine if fluctuating levels of CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heteromers have functional consequences. Using &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; proximity ligation assays, we observed CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heteromers in the globus pallidus of C57BL/6J mice. The abundance of the heteromers increased following treatment with the nonselective cannabinoid receptor agonist, CP55,940. In contrast, treatment with the typical antipsychotic haloperidol reduced the number of CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heteromers, whereas the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine treatment had no effect. Co‐treatment with CP55,940 and haloperidol had similar effects to haloperidol alone, whereas co‐treatment with CP55,940 and olanzapine had similar effects to CP55,940. The observed changes were found to have functional consequences as the differential effects of haloperidol and olanzapine also applied to γ‐aminobutyric acid release in ST&lt;i&gt;Hdh&lt;/i&gt;

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Beyond barrier functions: Roles of pericytes in homeostasis and regulation of neuroinflammation</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24715?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pericytes are contractile cells that extend along the vasculature to mediate key homeostatic functions of endothelial barriers within the body. In the central nervous system (CNS), pericytes are important contributors to the structure and function of the neurovascular unit, which includes endothelial cells, astrocytes and neurons. The understanding of pericytes has been marred by an inability to accurately distinguish pericytes from other stromal cells with similar expression of identifying markers. Evidence is now growing in favor of pericytes being actively involved in both CNS homeostasis and pathology of neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, and Alzheimer's disease among others. In this review, we discuss the current understanding on the characterization of pericytes, their roles in maintaining the integrity of the blood–brain barrier, and their contributions to neuroinflammation and neurorepair. Owing to its plethora of surface receptors, pericytes respond to inflammatory mediators such as CCL2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein‐1) and tumor necrosis factor‐α, in turn secreting CCL2, nitric oxide, and several cytokines. Pericytes can therefore act as promoters of both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. Much like professional phagocytes, pericytes also have the ability to clear up cellular debris and macromolecular plaques. Moreover, pericytes promote the activities of CNS glia, including in maturation of oligodendrocyte lineage cells for myelination. Conversely, pericytes can impair regenerative processes by contributing to scar formation. A better characterization of CNS pericytes and their functions would bode well for therapeutics aimed at alleviating their undesirable properties and enhancing their benefits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Combination of acamprosate and baclofen (PXT864) as a potential new therapy for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24714?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Combination of acamprosate and baclofen (PXT864) as a potential new therapy for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/206e4a52-dda7-4979-8593-dc7f9f195006/jnr24714-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The activity of PXT864, a combination of acamprosate and baclofen, was assessed in cellular models relevant for ALS disease. PXT864 protected neuro muscular junctions in co‐cultures of primary rat neurons and human muscle cells, as well as motoneurons derived from SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; rodents against glutamate toxicity. When combined with riluzole, PXT864 exerted larger protective effects, highlighting the potential use of PXT864 with the standard of care. Importantly, PXT864 reduced TDP‐43 toxic accumulation in cells after insulting stimuli such as glutamate or oxidative stress inducers. An improved maturity of cultured primary SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; motoneurons was also found after PXT864 treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is currently no therapy impacting the course of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The only approved treatments are riluzole and edaravone, but their efficacy is modest and short‐lasting, highlighting the need for innovative therapies. We previously demonstrated the ability of PXT864, a combination of low doses of acamprosate and baclofen, to synergistically restore cellular and behavioral activity in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease models. The overlapping genetic, molecular, and cellular characteristics of these neurodegenerative diseases supported investigating the effectiveness of PXT864 in ALS. As neuromuscular junction (NMJ) alterations is a key feature of ALS, the effects of PXT864 in primary neuron‐muscle cocultures injured by glutamate were studied. PXT864 significantly and synergistically preserved NMJ and motoneuron integrity following glutamate excitotoxicity. PXT864 added to riluzole significantly improved such protection. PXT864 activity was then assessed in primary cultures of motoneurons derived from SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; rat embryos. These motoneurons presented severe maturation defects that were significantly improved by PXT864. In this model, glutamate application induced an accumulation of TDP‐43 protein in the cytoplasm, a hallmark that was completely prevented by PXT864. The anti‐TDP‐43 aggregation effect was also confirmed in a cell line expressing TDP‐43 fused to GFP. These results demonstrate the value of PXT864 as a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of ALS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Scalp ripples can predict development of epilepsy after first unprovoked seizure in childhood</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25939?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identification of children at risk of developing epilepsy after a first unprovoked seizure can be challenging. Interictal epileptiform discharges are associated with higher risk but have limited sensitivity and specificity. High frequency oscillations (HFOs) are newer biomarkers for epileptogenesis. We prospectively evaluated the predictive value of HFOs for developing epilepsy in scalp EEG of children after a first unprovoked seizure.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After their first seizure, 56 children were followed prospectively over 12 months and then grouped in “epilepsy” or “no epilepsy”. Initial EEGs were visually analyzed for spikes, spike ripples and ripples. Inter‐group comparisons of spike‐ and HFO‐rates were done by Mann–Whitney U test. Predictive values and optimal thresholds were calculated by ROC curves.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the epilepsy group (n = 26, 46%), mean rates of ripples (0.3 vs. 0.09/min, p &amp;lt; 0.0001) and spike ripples (0.6 vs. 0.06/min, p &amp;lt; 0.05) were significantly higher, with no difference in spike rates (1.7 vs. 3.0/min, p = 0.38). Of those three markers, ripples showed the best predictive value (AUC&lt;sub&gt;ripples&lt;/sub&gt; 0.88). The optimal threshold for ripples was calculated to be ≥0.125/min with a sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 85%. Ripple rates were negatively correlated to days passing before epilepsy‐diagnosis (R = −0.59, p &amp;lt; 0.0001) and time to a second seizure (R = −0.64, CI ‐0.77 to 0.43, p &amp;lt; 0.0001).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could show that in a cohort of children with a first unprovoked seizure, ripples predict the development of epilepsy better than spikes or spike ripples and might be useful biomarkers in the estimation of prognosis and question of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Blood metal levels and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis risk: a prospective cohort</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25932?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metals have been suggested as risk factor for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but only retrospective studies are available to date. We compared metal levels in prospectively collected blood samples from ALS patients and controls, to explore whether metals are associated with ALS mortality.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nested ALS case‐control study was conducted within the prospective EPIC cohort. Cases were identified through death certificates. We analyzed metal levels in erythrocyte samples obtained at recruitment, as biomarker for metal exposure from any source. Arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, manganese, mercury, selenium and zinc concentrations were measured by inductively coupled plasma‐mass spectrometry. To estimate ALS risk, we applied conditional logistic regression models.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study population comprised 107 cases (65% female) and 319 controls matched for age, sex and study center. Median time between blood collection and ALS death was 8 years (range 1‐15). Comparing the highest with the lowest tertile, cadmium (odds ratio (OR) 2.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08‐3.87) and lead (OR 1.89, 95%CI 0.97‐3.67) concentrations suggest associations with increased ALS risk. Zinc was associated with a decreased risk (OR 0.50, 95%CI 0.27‐0.94). Associations for cadmium and lead remained when limiting analyses to non‐current smokers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first study to compare metal levels before disease onset, minimizing reverse causation. The observed associations suggest that cadmium, lead and zinc may play a role in ALS etiology. Cadmium and lead possibly act as intermediates on the pathway from smoking to ALS.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Prior Anticoagulation in Patients with Ischemic Stroke and Atrial Fibrillation</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25917?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim was to evaluate, in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and acute ischemic stroke, the association of prior anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) with stroke severity, utilization of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT), safety of IVT, and 3‐month outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a cohort study of consecutive patients (2014–2019) on anticoagulation versus those without (controls) with regard to stroke severity, rates of IVT/mechanical thrombectomy, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), and favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0–2) at 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of 8,179 patients (mean [SD] age, 79.8 [9.6] years; 49% women), 1,486 (18%) were on VKA treatment, 1,634 (20%) on DOAC treatment at stroke onset, and 5,059 controls. Stroke severity was lower in patients on DOACs (median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 4, [interquartile range 2–11]) compared with VKA (6, [2–14]) and controls (7, [3–15], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001; quantile regression: β −2.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] −2.6 to −1.7). The IVT rate in potentially eligible patients was significantly lower in patients on VKA (156 of 247 [63%]; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.67; 95% CI 0.50–0.90) and particularly in patients on DOACs (69 of 464 [15%]; aOR 0.06; 95% CI 0.05–0.08) compared with controls (1,544 of 2,504 [74%]). sICH after IVT occurred in 3.6% (2.6–4.7%) of controls, 9 of 195 (4.6%; 1.9–9.2%; aOR 0.93; 95% CI 0.46–1.90) patients on VKA and 2 of 65 (3.1%; 0.4–10.8%, aOR 0.56; 95% CI 0.28–1.12) of those on DOACs. After adjustments for prognostic confounders, DOAC pretreatment was associated with a favorable 3‐month outcome (aOR 1.24; 1.01–1.51).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior DOAC therapy in patients with AF was associated with decreased admission stroke severity at onset and a remarkably low rate of IVT. Overall, patients on DOAC might have better functional outcome at 3 months. Further research is needed to overcome potential restrictions for IVT in patients taking DOACs.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Safety and Efficacy of Omaveloxolone in Friedreich's Ataxia (MOXIe Study)</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25934?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is a progressive genetic neurodegenerative disorder with no approved treatment. Omaveloxolone, an Nrf2 activator, improves mitochondrial function, restores redox balance, and reduces inflammation in models of FRDA. We investigated the safety and efficacy of omaveloxolone in patients with FRDA.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conducted an international, double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled parallel‐group, registrational phase 2 trial at 11 institutions in the United States, Europe, and Australia (NCT02255435, EudraCT2015‐002762‐23). Eligible patients, 16 to 40 years of age with genetically confirmed FRDA and baseline modified Friedreich's Ataxia Rating Scale (mFARS) scores between 20 and 80, were randomized 1:1 to placebo or 150 mg per day of omaveloxolone. The primary outcome was change from baseline in the mFARS score in those treated with omaveloxolone compared with those on placebo at 48 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;155 patients were screened and 103 were randomly assigned to receive omaveloxolone (n=51) or placebo (n=52), with 40 omaveloxolone patients and 42 placebo patients analyzed in the full analysis set. Changes from baseline in mFARS scores in omaveloxolone (–1.55 ± 0.69) and placebo (0.85 ± 0.64) patients showed a difference between treatment groups of 
–2.40 ± 0.96; p=0.014). Transient reversible increases in aminotransferase levels were observed with omaveloxolone without increases in total bilirubin or other signs of liver injury. Headache, nausea, and fatigue were also more common among patients receiving omaveloxolone.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the MOXIe trial, omaveloxolone significantly improved neurological function compared to placebo and was generally safe and well tolerated. It represents a potential therapeutic agent in FRDA.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Neocortical Slow Oscillations Implicated in the Generation of Epileptic Spasms</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25935?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epileptic spasms are a hallmark of severe seizure disorders. The neurophysiological mechanisms and the neuronal circuit(s) that generate these seizures are unresolved and are the focus of studies reported here.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the tetrodotoxin model, we used 16‐channel microarrays and microwires to record electrophysiological activity in neocortex and thalamus during spasms. Chemogenetic activation was used to examine the role of neocortical pyramidal cells in generating spasms. Comparisons were made to recordings from infantile spasms patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current source density and simultaneous multiunit activity analyses indicate that the ictal events of spasms are initiated in infragranular cortical layers. A dramatic pause of neuronal activity was recorded immediately prior to the onset of spasms. This preictal pause is shown to share many features with the down states of slow‐wave sleep. In addition, the ensuing interictal up states of slow‐wave rhythms are more intense in epileptic than control animals and occasionally appear sufficient to initiate spasms. Chemogenetic activation of neocortical pyramidal cells supported these observations since it increased slow oscillations and spasm numbers and clustering. Recordings also revealed a ramp‐up in the number of neocortical slow oscillations preceding spasms, which was also observed in infantile spasms patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings provide evidence that epileptic spasms can arise from the neocortex and reveal a previously unappreciated interplay between brain state physiology and spasm generation. The identification of neocortical up states as a mechanism capable of initiating epileptic spasms will likely provide new targets for interventional therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

The COVID-19 pandemic has motivated many open and collaborative analytical research projects with real-world impact. However, despite their value, such activities are generally overlooked by traditional academic metrics. Science is ultimately improved by analytical work, whether ensuring reproducible and well-documented code to accompany papers, developing and maintaining flexible tools, sharing and curating data, or disseminating analysis to wider audiences. To increase the impact and sustainability of modern science, it will be crucial to ensure these analytical activities—and the people who do them—are valued in academia.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ReMnGjGXiWI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Adaptive evolution shapes the present-day distribution of the thermal sensitivity of population growth rate</title>

Developing a thorough understanding of how ectotherm physiology adapts to different thermal environments is of crucial importance, especially in the face of global climate change. A key aspect of an organism’s thermal performance curve (TPC)—the relationship between fitness-related trait performance and temperature—is its thermal sensitivity, i.e., the rate at which trait values increase with temperature within its typically experienced thermal range. For a given trait, the distribution of thermal sensitivities across species, often quantified as “activation energy” values, is typically right-skewed. Currently, the mechanisms that generate this distribution are unclear, with considerable debate about the role of thermodynamic constraints versus adaptive evolution. Here, using a phylogenetic comparative approach, we study the evolution of the thermal sensitivity of population growth rate across phytoplankton (Cyanobacteria and eukaryotic microalgae) and prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea), 2 microbial groups that play a major role in the global carbon cycle. We find that thermal sensitivity across these groups is moderately phylogenetically heritable, and that its distribution is shaped by repeated evolutionary convergence throughout its parameter space. More precisely, we detect bursts of adaptive evolution in thermal sensitivity, increasing the amount of overlap among its distributions in different clades. We obtain qualitatively similar results from evolutionary analyses of the thermal sensitivities of 2 physiological rates underlying growth rate: net photosynthesis and respiration of plants. Furthermore, we find that these episodes of evolutionary convergence are consistent with 2 opposing forces: decrease in thermal sensitivity due to environmental fluctuations and increase due to adaptation to stable environments. Overall, our results indicate that adaptation can lead to large and relatively rapid shifts in thermal sensitivity, especially in microbes for which rapid evolution can occur at short timescales. Thus, more attention needs to be paid to elucidating the implications of rapid evolution in organismal thermal sensitivity for ecosystem functioning.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/hRVNeQwYVrk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Molecular mechanisms within the dentate gyrus and the perirhinal cortex interact during discrimination of similar nonspatial memories</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23269?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Differentiating between similar memories is a crucial cognitive function that enables correct episodic memory formation. The ability to separate the components of memories into distinct representations is thought to rely on a computational process known as pattern separation, by which differences are amplified to disambiguate similar events. Although pattern separation has been localized to the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus and shown to occur in a spatial domain, this cognitive function takes place also during processing of other types of information. In particular, there is some debate on whether the DG participates in pattern separation of nonspatial representations. Considering the classic role of the Prh in the acquisition and storage of object memories in general and tasks with similar features in particular, this cognitive function could rely more heavily on perirhinal regions when object‐related information is processed. Here we show that two plasticity‐related proteins, BDNF, and Arc, are required in the DG for nonspatial mnemonic differentiation. Moreover, we found that the crucial role of the DG is transient since activity of AMPAR is only required in the Prh but not the DG during differentiated object memory retrieval. Additionally, this memory is not modifiable by postacquisition rhBDNF infusions in the DG that are known to improve memory when given in the Prh. This highlights a differential role of Prh and DG during differentiated object memory consolidation. Additionally, we found that these molecular mechanisms actively interact in the DG and Prh for the formation of distinguishable memories, with infusions of rhBDNF in the Prh being able to rescue mnemonic deficits caused by reduced Arc expression in the DG. These results reveal a complex interaction between plasticity mechanisms in the Prh and DG for nonspatial pattern separation and posit the Prh as the key structure where unique object representations are stored.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;The inferior colliculus (IC) is the primary auditory nucleus of the midbrain. We used multi‐channel fluorescent &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization to detect expression of α&lt;sub&gt;1A,B,D&lt;/sub&gt;, α&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;, and β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; encoding mRNA in the mouse IC. We found expression of mRNA encoding these adrenergic receptors in the three subnuclei of the IC in juveniles and adults.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adrenergic receptors are mediators of adrenergic and noradrenergic modulation throughout the brain. Previous studies have provided evidence for the expression of adrenergic receptors in the midbrain auditory nucleus, the inferior colliculus (IC), but have not examined the cellular patterns of expression in detail. Here, we utilize multi‐channel fluorescent in situ hybridization to detect the expression of adrenergic receptor‐encoding mRNA in the inferior colliculus of male and female mice. We found expression of α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, α&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;, and β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor‐encoding mRNA throughout all areas of the IC. While we observed similar levels of expression of α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor‐encoding mRNA across the subregions of the IC, α&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; and β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor‐encoding mRNA was expressed differentially. To account for developmental changes in noradrenergic receptor expression, we measured expression levels in mice aged P15, P20, and P60. We observed little change in levels of expression across these ages. To ascertain the modulatory potential of multiple adrenergic receptor subtypes in a single IC cell, we measured co‐expression of α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, α&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;, and β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor‐encoding mRNA. We found greater proportions of cells in the IC that expressed no adrenergic receptor‐encoding mRNA, α1 and α2A adrenergic receptor‐encoding mRNA, and α1, α2A, and β2 receptor‐encoding mRNA than would be predicted by independent expression of each receptor subtype. These data suggest a coordinated pattern of adrenergic receptor expression in the IC and provide the first evidence for adrenergic receptor expression and co‐expression in the subregions of the mouse auditory midbrain.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Dynamics of perineuronal nets over amphibian metamorphosis</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Dynamics of perineuronal nets over amphibian metamorphosis&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/690256ae-0ee7-4882-8f60-40394ebdca36/cne25055-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate a dramatic, brain‐wide reorganization of perineuronal nets (PNNs) during metamorphosis in an anuran amphibian. A sharp reduction of PNNs precedes the overhaul of amphibian morphology and neural circuitry that transitions the animal from an aquatic to terrestrial lifestyle. In mammals, PNNs regulate neuronal plasticity and maturation. Results suggest PNN temporal dynamics are important to understanding their role in neural development, learning, and memory.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracellular matrix materials known as perineuronal nets (PNNs) have been shown to have remarkable consequences for the maturation of neural circuits and stabilization of behavior. It has been proposed that, due to the possibly long‐lived biochemical nature of their components, PNNs may be an important substrate by which long‐term memories are stored in the central nervous system. However, little empirical evidence exists that shows that PNNs are themselves stable once established. Thus, the question of their temporal dynamics remains unresolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We leverage the dramatic morphological and behavioral transformations that occur during amphibian metamorphosis to show that PNNs can be highly dynamic in nature. We used established lectin histochemistry to show that PNNs undergo drastic reconstruction during the metamorphic transition. Pre‐metamorphic tadpoles have abundant lectin‐labeled pericellular material, which we interpret to be PNNs, surrounding neurons throughout the central nervous system. During the metamorphic transition, these structures degrade, and begin to reform in the months following metamorphosis. We show that PNN sizes and staining intensity further change over metamorphosis, suggesting compositional rearrangement. We found PNNs in brain regions with putative homology to regions in mammals with known PNN function, and in other shared regions where PNN function is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that PNNs are susceptible to remodeling by endogenous mechanisms during development. Interpreting the roles of PNNs in circuit maturation and stability requires understanding their temporal relationship with the neurons and synapses they surround. Our work provides further impetus to investigate this relationship in tandem with developmental and behavioral studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;In this research, the potential anti‐relapse efficacy of N‐acetylcysteine (NAC), using the alcohol deprivation effect (ADE) model in long‐term experienced male Wistar rats, has been explored. Two different experiments were performed in order to: (a) test the efficacy of NAC to prevent relapse and (b) discriminate the best administration schedule (intermittent vs. continuous) for the drug. NAC subcutaneously administered, either by continuous infusion or by intermittent injections regimen, was able to block the ADE. The best results were obtained after using 60 mg/kg NAC dose under an intermittent regimen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcohol use disorders are chronic and highly relapsing disorders, thus alcoholic patients have a high rate of recidivism for drug use even after long periods of abstinence. The literature points to the potential usefulness of N‐acetylcysteine (NAC) in the management of several substance use disorders probably due to its capacity to restore brain homeostasis of the glutamate system disrupted in addiction. However, there is little evidence in the case of alcohol. The aim of this study was to explore the potential anti‐relapse efficacy of NAC using the alcohol deprivation effect (ADE) model in long‐term experienced rats. Two experiments were performed in male Wistar rats to: (a) test the efficacy of NAC to prevent relapse and (b) discriminate the best administration schedule (intermittent vs. continuous) for NAC. In the first experiment, animals were implanted with mini‐osmotic pumps delivering 0 or 1 mg/hr NAC during 14 days. In a second experiment, rats received 0, 60, or 100 mg/kg once daily by subcutaneous injection. The efficacy to prevent ADE was evaluated in both experiments. NAC subcutaneously administered, either by continuous infusion or by intermittent injections regimen, is able to block the ADE. The best results were obtained after using 60 mg/kg NAC dose. Our findings support the hypothesis that NAC may represent a valuable therapy in the management of alcohol relapse.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Differential Expression of DeltaFosB in Reward Processing Regions Between Binge Eating Prone and Resistant Female Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.562154</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Binge eating (BE) is characterized by the consumption of large amounts of palatable food in a discrete period and compulsivity. Even though BE is a common symptom in bulimia nervosa (BN), binge eating disorder (BED), and some cases of other specified feeding or eating disorders, little is known about its pathophysiology. We aimed to identify brain regions and neuron subtypes implicated in the development of binge-like eating in a female rat model. We separated rats into binge eating prone (BEP) and binge eating resistant (BER) phenotypes based on the amount of sucrose they consumed following foot-shock stress. We quantified deltaFosB (ΔFosB) expression, a stably expressed Fos family member, in different brain regions involved in reward, taste, or stress processing, to assess their involvement in the development of the phenotype. The number of ΔFosB-expressing neurons was: (1) higher in BEP than BER rats in reward processing areas [medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), nucleus accumbens (Acb), and ventral tegmental area (VTA)]; (2) similar in taste processing areas [insular cortex, IC and parabrachial nucleus (PBN)]; and (3) higher in the paraventricular nucleus of BEP than BER rats, but not different in the locus coeruleus (LC), which are stress processing structures. To study subtypes of ΔFosB-expressing neurons in the reward system, we performed in situ hybridization for glutamate decarboxylase 65 and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA after ΔFosB immunohistochemistry. In the mPFC and Acb, the proportions of γ-aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) and non-GABAergic ΔFosB-expressing neurons were similar in BER and BEP rats. In the VTA, while the proportion of dopaminergic ΔFosB-expressing neurons was similar in both phenotypes, the proportion of GABAergic ΔFosB-expressing neurons was higher in BER than BEP rats. Our results suggest that reward processing brain regions, particularly the VTA, are important for the development of binge-like eating.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Degradation and Transmission of Tau by Autophagic-Endolysosomal Networks and Potential Therapeutic Targets for Tauopathy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.586731</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tauopathies are a class of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), Corticobasal Degeneration (CBD), and many others where microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT or tau) is hyperphosphorylated and aggregated to form insoluble paired helical filaments (PHFs) and ultimately neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Autophagic-endolysosomal networks (AELN) play important roles in tau clearance. Excessive soluble neurotoxic forms of tau and tau hyperphosphorylated at specific sites are cleared through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), Chaperon-mediated Autophagy (CMA), and endosomal microautophagy (e-MI). On the other hand, intra-neuronal insoluble tau aggregates are often degraded within lysosomes by macroautophagy. AELN defects have been observed in AD, FTD, CBD, and PSP, and lysosomal dysfunction was shown to promote the cleavage and neurotoxicity of tau. Moreover, several AD risk genes (e.g., PICALM, GRN, and BIN1) have been associated with dysregulation of AELN in the late-onset sporadic AD. Conversely, tau dissociation from microtubules interferes with retrograde transport of autophagosomes to lysosomes, and that tau fragments can also lead to lysosomal dysfunction. Recent studies suggest that tau is not merely an intra-neuronal protein, but it can be released to brain parenchyma via extracellular vesicles, like exosomes and ectosomes, and thus spread between neurons. Extracellular tau can also be taken up by microglial cells and astrocytes, either being degraded through AELN or propagated via exosomes. This article reviews the complex roles of AELN in the degradation and transmission of tau, potential diagnostic/therapeutic targets and strategies based on AELN-mediated tau clearance and propagation, and the current state of drug development targeting AELN and tau against tauopathies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Hepcidin Decreases Rotenone-Induced α-Synuclein Accumulation via Autophagy in SH-SY5Y Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.560891</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, and the hallmarks of this disease include iron deposition and α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregation. Hepcidin could reduce iron in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Here, we hypothesized that hepcidin could further decrease α-syn accumulation via reducing iron. Therefore, rotenone or α-syn was introduced into human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells to imitate the pathological progress of PD in vitro. This study investigated the clearance effects of hepcidin on α-syn induced by a relatively low concentration of rotenone exposure or α-syn overexpression to elucidate the potential clearance pathway involved in this process. We demonstrated that SH-SY5Y cell viability was impaired after rotenone treatment in a dose-dependent manner. α-syn expression and iron content increased under a low concentration rotenone (25 nM for 3 days) treatment in SH-SY5Y cells. Pre-treatment with hepcidin peptide suppressed the abovementioned effects of rotenone. However, hepcidin did not affect treatment with rotenone under high iron conditions. Hepcidin also played a role in reducing α-syn accumulation in rotenone and α-syn overexpression conditions. We identified that the probable clearance effect of hepcidin on α-syn was mediated by the autophagy pathway using pretreatment with autophagy inhibitors (3-MA and CQ) and detection of autophagy protein markers (LC3II/I and p62). In conclusion, hepcidin eliminated α-syn expression via the autophagy pathway in rotenone-treated and α-syn overexpression SH-SY5Y cells. This study highlights that hepcidin may offer a potential therapeutic perspective in α-syn accumulation diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Systems Biology: On the Organization of the Locomotor CPG: Insights From Split-Belt Locomotion and Mathematical Modeling</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.598888</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Rhythmic limb movements during locomotion are controlled by central pattern generator (CPG) circuits located in the spinal cord. It is considered that these circuits are composed of individual rhythm generators (RGs) for each limb interacting with each other through multiple commissural and long propriospinal circuits. The organization and operation of each RG are not fully understood, and different competing theories exist about interactions between its flexor and extensor components, as well as about left–right commissural interactions between the RGs. The central idea of circuit organization proposed in this study is that with an increase of excitatory input to each RG (or an increase in locomotor speed) the rhythmogenic mechanism of the RGs changes from “flexor-driven” rhythmicity to a “classical half-center” mechanism. We test this hypothesis using our experimental data on changes in duration of stance and swing phases in the intact and spinal cats walking on the ground or tied-belt treadmills (symmetric conditions) or split-belt treadmills with different left and right belt speeds (asymmetric conditions). We compare these experimental data with the results of mathematical modeling, in which simulated CPG circuits operate in similar symmetric and asymmetric conditions with matching or differing control drives to the left and right RGs. The obtained results support the proposed concept of state-dependent changes in RG operation and specific commissural interactions between the RGs. The performed simulations and mathematical analysis of model operation under different conditions provide new insights into CPG network organization and limb coordination during locomotion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Current Status of Stem Cell-Derived Therapies for Parkinson’s Disease: From Cell Assessment and Imaging Modalities to Clinical Trials</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.558532</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Curative therapies or treatments reversing the progression of Parkinson’s disease (PD) have attracted considerable interest in the last few decades. PD is characterized by the gradual loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons and decreased striatal dopamine levels. Current challenges include optimizing neuroprotective strategies, developing personalized drug therapy, and minimizing side effects from the long-term prescription of pharmacological drugs used to relieve short-term motor symptoms. Transplantation of DA cells into PD patients’ brains to replace degenerated DA has the potential to change the treatment paradigm. Herein, we provide updates on current progress in stem cell-derived DA neuron transplantation as a therapeutic alternative for PD. We briefly highlight cell sources for transplantation and focus on cell assessment methods such as identification of genetic markers, single-cell sequencing, and imaging modalities used to access cell survival and function. More importantly, we summarize clinical reports of patients who have undergone cell-derived transplantation in PD to better perceive lessons that can be drawn from past and present clinical outcomes. Modifying factors include (1) source of the stem cells, (2) quality of the stem cells, (3) age of the patient, (4) stage of disease progression at the time of cell therapy, (5) surgical technique/practices, and (6) the use of immunosuppression. We await the outcomes of joint efforts in clinical trials around the world such as NYSTEM and CiRA to further guide us in the selection of the most suitable parameters for cell-based neurotransplantation in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Upper Extremity Flexion Synergy Is Minimally Expressed in Young Individuals With Unilateral Cerebral Palsy Following an Early Brain Injury</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.590198</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hemiparetic stroke in adulthood often results in the grouped movement pattern of the upper extremity flexion synergy thought to arise from an increased reliance on cortico-reticulospinal pathways due to a loss of lateral corticospinal projections. It is well established that the flexion synergy induces reaching constraints in individuals with adult-onset hemiplegia. The expression of the flexion synergy in individuals with brain injuries onset earlier in the lifespan is currently unknown. An early unilateral brain injury occurring prior to six months post full-term may preserve corticospinal projections which can be used for independent joint control and thus minimizing the expression of the flexion synergy. This study uses kinematics of a ballistic reaching task to evaluate the expression of the flexion synergy in individuals with pediatric hemiplegia (PH) ages six to seventeen years. Fifteen individuals with brain injuries before birth (n = 8) and around full-term (n = 7) and nine age-matched controls with no known neurological impairment completed a set of reaches in an admittance controlled robotic device. Descending drive, and the possible expression of the upper extremity flexion synergy, was modulated by increasing shoulder abduction loading. Individuals with early-onset PH achieved lower peak velocities when reaching with the paretic arm compared to controls; however, no differences in reaching distance were found between groups. Relative maintenance in reaching seen in individuals with early brain injuries highlights minimal expression of the flexion synergy. We interpret this conservation of independent control of the paretic shoulder and elbow as the use of more direct corticospinal projections instead of indirect cortico-reticulospinal pathways used in individuals with adult-onset hemiplegia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Myelin Water Imaging Demonstrates Lower Brain Myelination in Children and Adolescents With Poor Reading Ability</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.568395</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a means to non-invasively investigate the neurological links with dyslexia, a learning disability that affects one’s ability to read. Most previous brain MRI studies of dyslexia and reading skill have used structural or diffusion imaging to reveal regional brain abnormalities. However, volumetric and diffusion MRI lack specificity in their interpretation at the microstructural level. Myelin is a critical neural component for brain function and plasticity, and as such, deficits in myelin may impact reading ability. MRI can estimate myelin using myelin water fraction (MWF) imaging, which is based on evaluation of the proportion of short T2 myelin-associated water from multi-exponential T2 relaxation analysis, but has not yet been applied to the study of reading or dyslexia. In this study, MWF MRI, intelligence, and reading assessments were acquired in 20 participants aged 10–18 years with a wide range of reading ability to investigate the relationship between reading ability and myelination. Group comparisons showed markedly lower MWF by 16–69% in poor readers relative to good readers in the left and right thalamus, as well as the left posterior limb of the internal capsule, left/right anterior limb of the internal capsule, left/right centrum semiovale, and splenium of the corpus callosum. MWF over the entire group also correlated positively with three different reading scores in the bilateral thalamus as well as white matter, including the splenium of the corpus callosum, left posterior limb of the internal capsule, left anterior limb of the internal capsule, and left centrum semiovale. MWF imaging from T2 relaxation suggests that myelination, particularly in the bilateral thalamus, splenium, and left hemisphere white matter, plays a role in reading abilities. Myelin water imaging thus provides a potentially valuable in vivo imaging tool for the study of dyslexia and its remediation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Effects of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation on Brain Networks Related to Creative Thinking</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.541052</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human creative thinking is unique and capable of generating novel and valuable ideas. Recent research has clarified the contribution of different brain networks (default mode network, DN; executive control network; salience network) to creative thinking. However, the effects of brain stimulation on brain networks during creative thinking and on creative performance have not been clarified. The present study was designed to examine the changes in functional connectivity (FC) and effective connectivity (EC) of the large-scale brain network, and the ensuing changes in creative performance, induced by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Fourteen healthy male students underwent two tDCS sessions, one with actual stimulation and one with sham stimulation, on two separate days. Participants underwent tDCS (anode over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, DLPFC; cathode over the right inferior parietal lobule, IPL) for 20 min. Before and after the tDCS session, electroencephalography signals were acquired from 32 electrodes over the whole head during the creative thinking task. On FC analysis, the delta band FC between the posterior cingulate cortex and IPL significantly increased only after real stimulation. We also found that the change of flexibility score was significantly correlated with the change in: (i) delta band FC between mPFC and left lateral temporal cortex (LTC) and (ii) alpha band FC between IPL and right LTC. On EC analysis, decreased flow within the DN (from left LTC to right IPL) was observed. Our results reveal that tDCS could affect brain networks, particularly the DN, during creative thinking and modulate key FC in the generation of flexible creative ideas.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: C1q Regulates Horizontal Cell Neurite Confinement in the Outer Retina</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.583391</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;During development, neurons generate excess processes which are then eliminated in concert with circuit maturation. C1q is the initiating protein in the complement cascade and has been implicated in this process, but whether C1q-mediated elimination is targeted to particular neural compartments is unclear. Using the murine retina, we identify C1q as a specific regulator of horizontal cell neurite confinement. Subsets of horizontal cell dendritic and axonal neurites extend into the outer retina suggesting that complement achieves both cellular and subcellular selectivity. These alterations emerge as outer retina synapses become mature. C1q expression is restricted to retina microglia, and the loss of C1q results in decreased microglia activation. This pathway appears independent of the C3a receptor (C3aR) and complement receptor 3 (CR3), as horizontal cells are normal when either protein is absent. Together, these data identify a new role for C1q in cell and neurite-specific confinement and implicate microglia-mediated phagocytosis in this process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Activity of a vmPFC-DRN Pathway Corresponds With Resistance to Acute Social Defeat Stress</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00050</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) plays a critical role in stress resilience through top-down inhibition of key stress-sensitive limbic and hindbrain structures, including the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). In a model of experience-dependent stress resistance, socially dominant Syrian hamsters display fewer signs of anxiety following acute social defeat when compared to subordinate or control counterparts. Further, dominants activate vmPFC neurons to a greater degree during stress than do subordinates and become stress-vulnerable following pharmacological inhibition of the vmPFC. Dominants also display fewer stress-activated DRN neurons than subordinates do, suggesting that dominance experience gates activation of vmPFC neurons that inhibit the DRN during social defeat stress. To test whether social dominance alters stress-induced activity of a vmPFC-DRN pathway, we injected a retrograde tracer, cholera toxin B (CTB), into the DRN of dominant, subordinate, and control hamsters and used a dual-label immunohistochemical approach to identify vmPFC neurons co-labeled with CTB and the defeat-induced expression of an immediate early gene, cFos. Results indicate that dominant hamsters display more cFos+ and dual-labeled cells in layers V/VI of infralimbic and prelimbic subregions of the vmPFC compared to other animals. Furthermore, vmPFC-DRN activation corresponded directly with proactive behavioral strategies during defeat, which is indicative of stress resilience. Together, results suggest that recruiting the vmPFC-DRN pathway during acute stress corresponds with resistance to the effects of social defeat in dominant hamsters. Overall, these findings indicate that a monosynaptic vmPFC-DRN pathway can be engaged in an experience-dependent manner, which has implications for behavioral interventions aimed at alleviating stress-related psychopathologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes, once thought to be passive cells merely filling the space between neurons in the nervous system, are receiving attention as active modulators of the brain and spinal cord physiology by providing nutrients, maintaining homeostasis, and modulating synaptic transmission. Accumulating evidence indicates that astrocytes are critically involved in chronic pain regulation. Injury induces astrocytes to become reactive, and recent studies suggest that reactive astrocytes can have either neuroprotective or neurodegenerative effects. While the exact mechanisms underlying the transition from resting astrocytes to reactive astrocytes remain unknown, astrocytic calcium increase, coordinated by inflammatory molecules, has been suggested to trigger this transition. In this mini review article, we will discuss the roles of astrocytic calcium, channels contributing to calcium dynamics in astrocytes, astrocyte activations along the pain pathway, and possible relationships between astrocytic calcium dynamics and chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Three-Week Treadmill Exercise Enhances Persistent Inward Currents, Facilitates Dendritic Plasticity, and Upregulates the Excitability of Dorsal Raphe Serotonin Neurons in ePet-EYFP Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.575626</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Exercise plays a key role in preventing or treating mental or motor disorders caused by dysfunction of the serotonergic system. However, the electrophysiological and ionic channel mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of 3-week treadmill exercise on the electrophysiological and channel properties of dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). Serotonin (5-HT) neurons in ePet-EYFP mice, using whole-cell patch clamp recording. Treadmill exercise was induced in ePet-EYFP mice of P21–24 for 3 weeks, and whole-cell patch clamp recording was performed on EYFP-positive 5-HT neurons from DRN slices of P42–45 mice. Experiment data showed that 5-HT neurons in the DRN were a heterogeneous population with multiple firing patterns (single firing, phasic firing, and tonic firing). Persistent inward currents (PICs) with multiple patterns were expressed in 5-HT neurons and composed of Cav1.3 (Ca-PIC) and sodium (Na-PIC) components. Exercise hyperpolarized the voltage threshold for action potential (AP) by 3.1 ± 1.0 mV (control: n = 14, exercise: n = 18, p = 0.005) and increased the AP amplitude by 6.7 ± 3.0 mV (p = 0.031) and firing frequency by more than 22% especially within a range of current stimulation stronger than 70 pA. A 3-week treadmill exercise was sufficient to hyperpolarize PIC onset by 2.6 ± 1.3 mV (control: −53.4 ± 4.7 mV, n = 28; exercise: −56.0 ± 4.7 mV, n = 25, p = 0.050) and increase the PIC amplitude by 28% (control: 193.6 ± 81.8 pA; exercise: 248.5 ± 105.4 pA, p = 0.038). Furthermore, exercise hyperpolarized Na-PIC onset by 3.8 ± 1.8 mV (control: n = 8, exercise: n = 9, p = 0.049) and increased the Ca-PIC amplitude by 23% (p = 0.013). The exercise-induced enhancement of the PIC amplitude was mainly mediated by Ca-PIC and hyperpolarization of PIC onset by Na-PIC. Moreover, exercise facilitated dendritic plasticity, which was shown as the increased number of branch points by 1.5 ± 0.5 (p = 0.009) and dendritic branches by 2.1 ± 0.6 (n = 20, p = 0.001) and length by 732.0 ± 100.1 μm (p &amp;lt; 0.001) especially within the range of 50–200 μm from the soma. Functional analysis suggested that treadmill exercise enhanced Na-PIC for facilitation of spike initiation and Ca-PIC for regulation of repetitive firing. We concluded that PICs broadly existed in DRN 5-HT neurons and could influence serotonergic neurotransmission in juvenile mice and that 3-week treadmill exercise induced synaptic adaptations, enhanced PICs, and thus upregulated the excitability of the 5-HT neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Cerebrospinal Fluid IgM Levels in Association With Inflammatory Pathways in Multiple Sclerosis Patients</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.569827</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Intrathecal immunoglobulin M (IgM) synthesis has been demonstrated in the early disease stages of multiple sclerosis (MS) as a predictor factor of a worsening disease course. Similarly, increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) molecules related to B-cell intrathecal activity have been associated with a more severe MS progression. However, whether CSF levels of IgM are linked to specific inflammatory and clinical profile in MS patients at the time of diagnosis remains to be elucidated.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Using customized Bio-Plex assay, the protein levels of IgG, IgA, IgM, and of 34 other inflammatory molecules, related to B-cell, T-cell, and monocyte/macrophage activity, were analyzed in the CSF of 103 newly diagnosed relapsing–remitting MS patients and 36 patients with other neurological disorders. CSF IgM levels were also correlated with clinical and neuroradiological measures [advanced 3-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters], at diagnosis and after 2 years of follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;A 45.6% increase in CSF IgM levels was found in MS patients compared to controls (p = 0.013). CSF IgM levels correlated with higher CSF levels of CXCL13 (p = 0.039), CCL21 (p = 0.023), interleukin 10 (IL-10) (p = 0.025), IL-12p70 (p = 0.020), CX3CL1 (p = 0.036), and CHI3L1 (p = 0.048) and were associated with earlier age of patients at diagnosis (p = 0.008), white matter lesion (WML) number (p = 0.039) and disease activity (p = 0.033) after 2 years of follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;IgMs are the immunoglobulins mostly expressed in the CSF of naive MS patients compared to other neurological conditions at the time of diagnosis. The association between increased CSF IgM levels and molecules related to both B-cell immunity (IL-10) and recruitment (CXCL13 and CCL21) and to macrophage/microglia activity (IL-12p70, CX3CL1, and CHI3L1) suggests possible correlation between humoral and innate intrathecal immunity in early disease stage. Furthermore, the association of IgM levels with WMLs and MS clinical and MRI activity after 2 years supports the idea of key role of IgM in the disease course.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.558381</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and devastating primary brain tumor, leading to a uniform fatality after diagnosis. A major difficulty in eradicating GBM is the presence of microscopic residual infiltrating disease remaining after multimodality treatment. Glioma cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been pinpointed as the treatment-resistant tumor component that seeds ultimate tumor progression. Despite the key role of CSCs, the ideal preclinical model to study the genetic and epigenetic landmarks driving their malignant behavior while simulating an accurate interaction with the tumor microenvironment (TME) is still missing. The introduction of three-dimensional (3D) tumor platforms, such as organoids and 3D bioprinting, has allowed for a better representation of the pathophysiologic interactions between glioma CSCs and the TME. Thus, these technologies have enabled a more detailed study of glioma biology, tumor angiogenesis, treatment resistance, and even performing high-throughput screening assays of drug susceptibility. First, we will review the foundation of glioma biology and biomechanics of the TME, and then the most up-to-date insights about the applicability of these new tools in malignant glioma research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Pharmacological Targeting of CSF1R Inhibits Microglial Proliferation and Aggravates the Progression of Cerebral Ischemic Pathology</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00267</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke can induce rapid activation of the microglia. It has been reported that the microglia’s survival is dependent on colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) signaling and that pharmacological inhibition of CSF1R leads to morphological changes in the microglia in the healthy brain. However, the impact of CSF1R inhibition on neuronal structures and motor ability after ischemia–reperfusion remains unclear. In this study, we investigated microglial de-ramification, proliferation, and activation after inhibition of CSF1R by a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (ki20227) in a mouse model of global cerebral ischemia induced by bilateral common carotid artery ligation (BCAL). In addition to microglial morphology, we evaluated the mRNA expression of cytokines, chemokines, and inflammatory receptors. Our results show that pharmacological inhibition of CSF1R in ischemic mice resulted in the blockade of microglial proliferation and a shift in microglial morphology reflected by excessive de-ramification and a more activated phenotype accompanied by an enhanced innate immune response. Furthermore, we show that pharmacological inhibition of CSF1R in ischemic mice resulted in the aggravation of neuronal degeneration and behavioral impairment. Intravital two-photon imaging revealed that although pharmacological inhibition of CSF1R did not affect the recovery of dendritic structures, it caused a significant increase in spine elimination during reperfusion in ischemic mice. These findings suggest that pharmacological inhibition of CSF1R induces a blockade of microglial proliferation and causes acute activation of the microglia accompanied by a severe inflammatory response. It aggravates neuronal degeneration, loss of dendritic spines, and behavioral deficits after transient global cerebral ischemia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.586691</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent literature has reported a higher occurrence of cognitive impairment among individuals with Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) compared to older adults with normal vision. This pilot study explored potential links between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in AMD and cognitive status. Individuals with AMD (N = 21) and controls (N = 18) were genotyped for the SNPs CFHY402H, ARMS2A69S and FADS1 rs174547. Cognitive status was evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. The two groups differed significantly on which subscales were most difficult. The control group had difficulty with delayed recall while those with AMD had difficulty on delayed recall in addition to abstraction and orientation. Homozygous carriers of the FADS1 rs174547 SNP had significantly lower scores than heterozygotes or non-carriers on the MoCA. The results suggest that the FADS1 SNP may play a role in visual impairment/cognitive impairment comorbidity as reflected in the poorer cognitive scores among homozygotes with AMD compared to those carrying only one, or no copies of the SNP.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: To investigate relationships between whole-brain functional changes and the performance of multiple cognitive functions in early Parkinson’s disease (PD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: In the current study, we evaluated resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) data and neuropsychological assessments for various cognitive functions in a cohort with 84 early PD patients from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). Eigenvector centrality (EC) mapping based on rsfMRI was used to identify the functional connectivity of brain areas correlated with different neuropsychological scores at a whole-brain level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Our study demonstrated that in the early PD patients, scores of Letter Number Sequencing (LNS) were positively correlated with EC in the left inferior occipital gyrus (IOG) and lingual gyrus. The immediate recall scores of Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R) were positively correlated with EC in the left superior frontal gyrus. No correlation was found between the EC and other cognitive performance scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Functional alternations in the left occipital lobe (inferior occipital and lingual gyrus) and left superior frontal gyrus may account for the performance of working memory and immediate recall memory, respectively in early PD.

A stochastic compartmental network model of SARS-CoV-2 spread explores the simultaneous effects of policy choices in three domains: social distancing, hospital triaging, and testing. Considering policy domains together provides insight into how different policy decisions interact. The model incorporates important characteristics of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, such as heterogeneous risk factors and asymptomatic transmission, and enables a reliable qualitative comparison of policy choices despite the current uncertainty in key virus and disease parameters. Results suggest possible refinements to current policies, including emphasizing the need to reduce random encounters more than personal contacts, and testing low-risk symptomatic individuals before high-risk symptomatic individuals. The strength of social distancing of symptomatic individuals affects the degree to which asymptomatic cases drive the epidemic as well as the level of population-wide contact reduction needed to keep hospitals below capacity. The relative importance of testing and triaging also depends on the overall level of social distancing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ji4JQTufgp8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Current computational models suggest that paranoia may be explained by stronger higher-order beliefs about others and increased sensitivity to environments. However, it is unclear whether this applies to social contexts, and whether it is specific to harmful intent attributions, the live expression of paranoia. We sought to fill this gap this by fitting a computational model to data (n = 1754) from a modified serial dictator game, to explore whether pre-existing paranoia could be accounted by specific alterations to cognitive parameters characterising harmful intent attributions. We constructed a ‘Bayesian brain’ model of others’ intent, which we fitted to harmful intent and self-interest attributions made over 18 trials, across three different partners. We found that pre-existing paranoia was associated with greater uncertainty about other’s actions. It moderated the relationship between learning rates and harmful intent attributions, making harmful intent attributions less reliant on prior interactions. Overall, the magnitude of harmful intent attributions was directly related to their uncertainty, and importantly, the opposite was true for self-interest attributions. Our results explain how pre-existing paranoia may be the result of an increased need to attend to immediate experiences in determining intentional threat, at the expense of what is already known, and more broadly, they suggest that environments that induce greater probabilities of harmful intent attributions may also induce states of uncertainty, potentially as an adaptive mechanism to better detect threatening others. Importantly, we suggest that if paranoia were able to be explained exclusively by core domain-general alterations we wouldn’t observe differential parameter estimates underlying harmful-intent and self-interest attributions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5H8h9fwkQT8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

It has extensively been documented that human memory exhibits a wide range of systematic distortions, which have been associated with resource constraints. Resource constraints on memory can be formalised in the normative framework of lossy compression, however traditional lossy compression algorithms result in qualitatively different distortions to those found in experiments with humans. We argue that the form of distortions is characteristic of relying on a generative model adapted to the environment for compression. We show that this semantic compression framework can provide a unifying explanation of a wide variety of memory phenomena. We harness recent advances in learning deep generative models, that yield powerful tools to approximate generative models of complex data. We use three datasets, chess games, natural text, and hand-drawn sketches, to demonstrate the effects of semantic compression on memory performance. Our model accounts for memory distortions related to domain expertise, gist-based distortions, contextual effects, and delayed recall.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tKt-sHQH9RQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Reward-predictive representations generalize across tasks in reinforcement learning</title>

In computer science, reinforcement learning is a powerful framework with which artificial agents can learn to maximize their performance for any given Markov decision process (MDP). Advances over the last decade, in combination with deep neural networks, have enjoyed performance advantages over humans in many difficult task settings. However, such frameworks perform far less favorably when evaluated in their ability to generalize or transfer representations across different tasks. Existing algorithms that facilitate transfer typically are limited to cases in which the transition function or the optimal policy is portable to new contexts, but achieving “deep transfer” characteristic of human behavior has been elusive. Such transfer typically requires discovery of abstractions that permit analogical reuse of previously learned representations to superficially distinct tasks. Here, we demonstrate that abstractions that minimize error in predictions of reward outcomes generalize across tasks with different transition and reward functions. Such reward-predictive representations compress the state space of a task into a lower dimensional representation by combining states that are equivalent in terms of both the transition and reward functions. Because only state equivalences are considered, the resulting state representation is not tied to the transition and reward functions themselves and thus generalizes across tasks with different reward and transition functions. These results contrast with those using abstractions that myopically maximize reward in any given MDP and motivate further experiments in humans and animals to investigate if neural and cognitive systems involved in state representation perform abstractions that facilitate such equivalence relations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5Co9usdpMl0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Animals produce vocalizations that range in complexity from a single repeated call to hundreds of unique vocal elements patterned in sequences unfolding over hours. Characterizing complex vocalizations can require considerable effort and a deep intuition about each species’ vocal behavior. Even with a great deal of experience, human characterizations of animal communication can be affected by human perceptual biases. We present a set of computational methods for projecting animal vocalizations into low dimensional latent representational spaces that are directly learned from the spectrograms of vocal signals. We apply these methods to diverse datasets from over 20 species, including humans, bats, songbirds, mice, cetaceans, and nonhuman primates. Latent projections uncover complex features of data in visually intuitive and quantifiable ways, enabling high-powered comparative analyses of vocal acoustics. We introduce methods for analyzing vocalizations as both discrete sequences and as continuous latent variables. Each method can be used to disentangle complex spectro-temporal structure and observe long-timescale organization in communication.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vhqR04LaNoc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Clinical Features and Risk of Relapse in Children and Adults with Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein Antibody–Associated Disease</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25909?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main objective was to compare clinical features, disease course, and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody (Ab) dynamics between children and adults with MOG‐Ab–associated disease (MOGAD).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This retrospective multicentric, national study included 98 children and 268 adults with MOGAD between January 2014 and September 2019. Cox regression model for recurrent time‐to‐event data and Kaplan–Meier curves for time to antibody negativity were performed for the objectives.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isolated optic neuritis was the most frequent clinical presentation in both children (40.8%) and adults (55.9%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.013), and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis syndrome was more frequent in children (36.7% vs 5.6%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Compared to adults, children displayed better recovery (Expanded Disability Status Scale ≥ 3.0 at last follow‐up reached only by 10 of 97 [10.3%] vs 66/247 [26.7%], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). In the multivariate analysis, adults were at higher risk of relapse than children (hazard ratio = 1.41, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.12–1.78, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003). At 2 years, 64.2% (95% CI = 40.9–86.5) of nonrelapsing children became MOG‐Ab negative compared to 14.1% (95% CI = 4.7–38.3) of relapsing children (log‐rank &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), with no differences observed in adults (log‐rank &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.280).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MOGAD patients differ in the clinical presentation at onset, showing an age‐related shift in the clinical features across age groups. Compared to children, adults have a higher risk of relapse and worse functional recovery. Finally, children with monophasic disease become MOG‐Ab negative earlier than relapsing children, but this is not true in adults. Considering these differences, management and treatment guidelines should be considered independently in children and adults. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Causal Associations Between Modifiable Risk Factors and the Alzheimer's Phenome</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25918?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to infer causal relationships between 22 previously reported risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the “AD phenome”: AD, AD age of onset (AAOS), hippocampal volume, cortical surface area and thickness, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of amyloid‐β (Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;), tau, and ptau&lt;sub&gt;181&lt;/sub&gt;, and the neuropathological burden of neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and vascular brain injury (VBI).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polygenic risk scores (PRS) for the 22 risk factors were computed in 26,431 AD cases/controls and the association with AD was evaluated using logistic regression. Two‐sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to infer the causal effect of risk factors on the AD phenome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRS for increased education and diastolic blood pressure were associated with reduced risk for AD. MR indicated that only education was causally associated with reduced risk of AD, delayed AAOS, and increased cortical surface area and thickness. Total‐ and LDL‐cholesterol levels were causally associated with increased neuritic plaque burden, although the effects were driven by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; locus. Diastolic blood pressure and pulse pressure are causally associated with increased risk of VBI. Furthermore, total cholesterol was associated with decreased hippocampal volume; smoking initiation with decreased cortical thickness; type 2 diabetes with an earlier AAOS; and sleep duration with increased cortical thickness.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our comprehensive examination of the genetic evidence for the causal relationships between previously reported risk factors in AD using PRS and MR supports a causal role for education, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking, and diabetes with the AD phenome.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Prolonged Targeted Cardiovascular Epidural Stimulation Improves Immunological Molecular Profile: A Case Report in Chronic Severe Spinal Cord Injury</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.571011</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In individuals with severe spinal cord injury (SCI), the autonomic nervous system (ANS) is affected leading to cardiovascular deficits, which include significant blood pressure instability, with the prevalence of systemic hypotension and orthostatic intolerance resulting in an increased risk of stroke. Additionally, persons with SCI rostral to thoracic vertebral level 5 (T5), where sympathetic nervous system fibers exit the spinal cord and innervate the immune system, have clinically significant systemic inflammation and increased infection risk. Our recent studies show that lumbosacral spinal cord epidural stimulation (scES), applied at the lumbosacral level using targeted configurations that promote cardiovascular stability (CV-scES), can safely and effectively normalize blood pressure in persons with chronic SCI. Herein we present a case report in a female (age 27 years) with chronic clinically motor complete cervical SCI demonstrating that 97-sessions of CV-scES, which increased systemic blood pressure, improved orthostatic tolerance in association with increased cerebral blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery, also promoted positive immunological changes in whole-blood gene expression. Specifically, there was evidence of the down-regulation of inflammatory pathways and the up-regulation of adaptative immune pathways. The findings of this case report suggest that the autonomic effects of epidural stimulation, targeted to promote cardiovascular homeostasis, also improves immune system function, which has a significant benefit to long-term cardiovascular and immunologic health in individuals with long-standing SCI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration:www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT02307565.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Brain White-Matter Degeneration Due to Aging and Parkinson Disease as Revealed by Double Diffusion Encoding</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.584510</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microstructure imaging by means of multidimensional diffusion encoding is increasingly applied in clinical research, with expectations that it yields a parameter that better correlates with clinical disability than current methods based on single diffusion encoding. Under the assumption that diffusion within a voxel can be well described by a collection of diffusion tensors, several parameters of this diffusion tensor distribution can be derived, including mean size, variance of sizes, orientational dispersion, and microscopic anisotropy. The information provided by multidimensional diffusion encoding also enables us to decompose the sources of the conventional fractional anisotropy and mean kurtosis. In this study, we explored the utility of the diffusion tensor distribution approach for characterizing white-matter degeneration in aging and in Parkinson disease by using double diffusion encoding. Data from 23 healthy older subjects and 27 patients with Parkinson disease were analyzed. Advanced age was associated with greater mean size and size variances, as well as smaller microscopic anisotropy. By analyzing the parameters underlying diffusion kurtosis, we found that the reductions of kurtosis in aging and Parkinson disease reported in the literature are likely driven by the reduction in microscopic anisotropy. Furthermore, microscopic anisotropy correlated with the severity of motor impairment in the patients with Parkinson disease. The present results support the use of multidimensional diffusion encoding in clinical studies and are encouraging for its future clinical implementation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.575652</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) were considered to be a continuum of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) spectrum. The abnormal topological architecture and rich-club organization in the brain functional network can reveal the pathology of the AD spectrum. However, few studies have explored the disrupted patterns of diverse club organizations and the combination of rich- and diverse-club organizations in SCD and aMCI.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We collected resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 19 SCDs, 29 aMCIs, and 28 healthy controls (HCs) from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Graph theory analysis was used to analyze the network metrics and rich- and diverse-club organizations simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Compared with HC, the aMCI group showed altered small-world and network efficiency, whereas the SCD group remained relatively stable. The aMCI group showed reduced rich-club connectivity compared with the HC. In addition, the aMCI group showed significantly increased feeder connectivity and decreased local connectivity of the diverse club compared with the SCD group. The overlapping nodes of the rich club and diverse club showed a significant difference in nodal efficiency and shortest path length (L&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) between groups. Notably, the L&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; values of overlapping nodes in the SCD and aMCI groups were significantly associated with episodic memory.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The present study demonstrates that the network properties of SCD and aMCI have varying degrees of damage. The combination of the rich club and the diverse club can provide a novel insight into the pathological mechanism of the AD spectrum. The altered patterns in overlapping nodes might be potential biomarkers in the diagnosis of the AD spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.561462</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;α-Synuclein (aSyn) aggregation is an attractive target for therapeutic development for a range of neurodegenerative conditions, collectively termed synucleinopathies. Here, we probe the mechanism of action of a peptide 4554W, (KDGIVNGVKA), previously identified through intracellular library screening, to prevent aSyn aggregation and associated toxicity. We utilize NMR to probe association and identify that 4554W associates with a “partially aggregated” form of aSyn, with enhanced association occurring over time. We also report the ability of 4554W to undergo modification through deamidation of the central asparagine residue, occurring on the same timescale as aSyn aggregation in vitro, with peptide modification enhancing its association with aSyn. Additionally, we report that 4554W can act to reduce fibril formation of five Parkinson’s disease associated aSyn mutants. Inhibitory peptide binding to partially aggregated forms of aSyn, as identified here, is particularly attractive from a therapeutic perspective, as it would eliminate the need to administer the therapy at pre-aggregation stages, which are difficult to diagnose. Taken together the data suggest that 4554W could be a suitable candidate for future therapeutic development against wild-type, and most mutant aSyn aggregation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: In vivo Analysis of CRISPR/Cas9 Induced Atlastin Pathological Mutations in Drosophila</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.547746</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a highly dynamic network whose shape is thought to be actively regulated by membrane resident proteins. Mutation of several such morphology regulators cause the neurological disorder Hereditary Sp astic Paraplegia (HSP), suggesting a critical role of ER shape maintenance in neuronal activity and function. Human Atlastin-1 mutations are responsible for SPG3A, the earliest onset and one of the more severe forms of dominant HSP. Atlastin has been initially identified in Drosophila as the GTPase responsible for the homotypic fusion of ER membrane. The majority of SPG3A-linked Atlastin-1 mutations map to the GTPase domain, potentially interfering with atlastin GTPase activity, and to the three-helix-bundle (3HB) domain, a region critical for homo-oligomerization. Here we have examined the in vivo effects of four pathogenetic missense mutations (two mapping to the GTPase domain and two to the 3HB domain) using two complementary approaches: CRISPR/Cas9 editing to introduce such variants in the endogenous atlastin gene and transgenesis to generate lines overexpressing atlastin carrying the same pathogenic variants. We found that all pathological mutations examined reduce atlastin activity in vivo although to different degrees of severity. Moreover, overexpression of the pathogenic variants in a wild type atlastin background does not give rise to the loss of function phenotypes expected for dominant negative mutations. These results indicate that the four pathological mutations investigated act through a loss of function mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: A Systemic Review of Available Low-Cost EEG Headsets Used for Drowsiness Detection</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.553352</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Drowsiness is a leading cause of traffic and industrial accidents, costing lives and productivity. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals can reflect awareness and attentiveness, and low-cost consumer EEG headsets are available on the market. The use of these devices as drowsiness detectors could increase the accessibility of safety and productivity-enhancing devices for small businesses and developing countries. We conducted a systemic review of currently available, low-cost, consumer EEG-based drowsiness detection systems. We sought to determine whether consumer EEG headsets could be reliably utilized as rudimentary drowsiness detection systems. We included documented cases describing successful drowsiness detection using consumer EEG-based devices, including the Neurosky MindWave, InteraXon Muse, Emotiv Epoc, Emotiv Insight, and OpenBCI. Of 46 relevant studies, ~27 reported an accuracy score. The lowest of these was the Neurosky Mindwave, with a minimum of 31%. The second lowest accuracy reported was 79.4% with an OpenBCI study. In many cases, algorithmic optimization remains necessary. Different methods for accuracy calculation, system calibration, and different definitions of drowsiness made direct comparisons problematic. However, even basic features, such as the power spectra of EEG bands, were able to consistently detect drowsiness. Each specific device has its own capabilities, tradeoffs, and limitations. Widely used spectral features can achieve successful drowsiness detection, even with low-cost consumer devices; however, reliability issues must still be addressed in an occupational context.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Mental Effort When Playing, Listening, and Imagining Music in One Pianist’s Eyes and Brain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.576888</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We investigated “musical effort” with an internationally renowned, classical, pianist while playing, listening, and imagining music. We used pupillometry as an objective measure of mental effort and fMRI as an exploratory method of effort with the same musical pieces. We also compared a group of non-professional pianists and non-musicians by the use of pupillometry and a small group of non-musicians with fMRI. This combined approach of psychophysiology and neuroimaging revealed the cognitive work during different musical activities. We found that pupil diameters were largest when “playing” (regardless of whether there was sound produced or not) compared to conditions with no movement (i.e., “listening” and “imagery”). We found positive correlations between pupil diameters of the professional pianist during different conditions with the same piano piece (i.e., normal playing, silenced playing, listen, imagining), which might indicate similar degrees of load on cognitive resources as well as an intimate link between the motor imagery of sound-producing body motions and gestures. We also confirmed that musical imagery had a strong commonality with music listening in both pianists and musically naïve individuals. Neuroimaging provided evidence for a relationship between noradrenergic (NE) activity and mental workload or attentional intensity within the domain of music cognition. We found effort related activity in the superior part of the locus coeruleus (LC) and, similarly to the pupil, the listening and imagery engaged less the LC–NE network than the motor condition. The pianists attended more intensively to the most difficult piece than the non-musicians since they showed larger pupils for the most difficult piece. Non-musicians were the most engaged by the music listening task, suggesting that the amount of attention allocated for the same task may follow a hierarchy of expertise demanding less attentional effort in expert or performers than in novices. In the professional pianist, we found only weak evidence for a commonality between subjective effort (as rated measure-by-measure) and the objective effort gauged with pupil diameter during listening. We suggest that psychophysiological methods like pupillometry can index mental effort in a manner that is not available to subjective awareness or introspection.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Examining Sodium and Potassium Channel Conductances Involved in Hyperexcitability of Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy: A Mathematical and Cell Culture-Based Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.564980</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a prevalent, painful side effect which arises due to a number of chemotherapy agents. CIPN can have a prolonged effect on quality of life. Chemotherapy treatment is often reduced or stopped altogether because of the severe pain. Currently, there are no FDA-approved treatments for CIPN partially due to its complex pathogenesis in multiple pathways involving a variety of channels, specifically, voltage-gated ion channels. One aspect of neuropathic pain in vitro is hyperexcitability in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) peripheral sensory neurons. Our study employs bifurcation theory to investigate the role of voltage-gated ion channels in inducing hyperexcitability as a consequence of spontaneous firing due to the common chemotherapy agent paclitaxel. Our mathematical investigation of a reductionist DRG neuron model comprised of sodium channel Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.7, sodium channel Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.8, delayed rectifier potassium channel, A-type transient potassium channel, and a leak channel suggests that Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.8 and delayed rectifier potassium channel conductances are critical for hyperexcitability of small DRG neurons. Introducing paclitaxel into the model, our bifurcation analysis predicts that hyperexcitability is highest for a medium dose of paclitaxel, which is supported by multi-electrode array (MEA) recordings. Furthermore, our findings using MEA reveal that Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.8 blocker A-803467 and delayed rectifier potassium enhancer L-alpha-phosphatidyl-D-myo-inositol 4,5-diphosphate, dioctanoyl (PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) can reduce paclitaxel-induced hyperexcitability of DRG neurons. Our approach can be readily extended and used to investigate various other contributors of hyperexcitability in CIPN.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Reconfigurable Filtering of Neuro-Spike Communications Using Synthetically Engineered Logic Circuits</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.556628</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;High-frequency firing activity can be induced either naturally in a healthy brain as a result of the processing of sensory stimuli or as an uncontrolled synchronous activity characterizing epileptic seizures. As part of this work, we investigate how logic circuits that are engineered in neurons can be used to design spike filters, attenuating high-frequency activity in a neuronal network that can be used to minimize the effects of neurodegenerative disorders such as epilepsy. We propose a reconfigurable filter design built from small neuronal networks that behave as digital logic circuits. We developed a mathematical framework to obtain a transfer function derived from a linearization process of the Hodgkin-Huxley model. Our results suggest that individual gates working as the output of the logic circuits can be used as a reconfigurable filtering technique. Also, as part of the analysis, the analytical model showed similar levels of attenuation in the frequency domain when compared to computational simulations by fine-tuning the synaptic weight. The proposed approach can potentially lead to precise and tunable treatments for neurological conditions that are inspired by communication theory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Activity-Dependent Remodeling of Synaptic Protein Organization Revealed by High Throughput Analysis of STED Nanoscopy Images</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00057</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The organization of proteins in the apposed nanodomains of pre- and postsynaptic compartments is thought to play a pivotal role in synaptic strength and plasticity. As such, the alignment between pre- and postsynaptic proteins may regulate, for example, the rate of presynaptic release or the strength of postsynaptic signaling. However, the analysis of these structures has mainly been restricted to subsets of synapses, providing a limited view of the diversity of synaptic protein cluster remodeling during synaptic plasticity. To characterize changes in the organization of synaptic nanodomains during synaptic plasticity over a large population of synapses, we combined STimulated Emission Depletion (STED) nanoscopy with a Python-based statistical object distance analysis (pySODA), in dissociated cultured hippocampal circuits exposed to treatments driving different forms of synaptic plasticity. The nanoscale organization, characterized in terms of coupling properties, of presynaptic (Bassoon, RIM1/2) and postsynaptic (PSD95, Homer1c) scaffold proteins was differently altered in response to plasticity-inducing stimuli. For the Bassoon - PSD95 pair, treatments driving synaptic potentiation caused an increase in their coupling probability, whereas a stimulus driving synaptic depression had an opposite effect. To enrich the characterization of the synaptic cluster remodeling at the population level, we applied unsupervised machine learning approaches to include selected morphological features into a multidimensional analysis. This combined analysis revealed a large diversity of synaptic protein cluster subtypes exhibiting differential activity-dependent remodeling, yet with common features depending on the expected direction of plasticity. The expanded palette of synaptic features revealed by our unbiased approach should provide a basis to further explore the widely diverse molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Cholinergic Modulation of Glial Function During Aging and Chronic Neuroinflammation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.577912</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aging is a complex biological process that increases the risk of age-related cognitive degenerative diseases such as dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Lewy Body Dementia (LBD), and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Even non-pathological aging of the brain can involve chronic oxidative and inflammatory stress, which disrupts the communication and balance between the brain and the immune system. There has been an increasingly strong connection found between chronic neuroinflammation and impaired memory, especially in AD. While microglia and astrocytes, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), exerting beneficial effects during the acute inflammatory phase, during chronic neuroinflammation they can become more detrimental. Central cholinergic circuits are involved in maintaining normal cognitive function and regulating signaling within the entire cerebral cortex. While neuronal-glial cholinergic signaling is anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative, central cholinergic neuronal degeneration is implicated in impaired learning, memory sleep regulation, and attention. Although there is evidence of cholinergic involvement in memory, fewer studies have linked the cholinergic anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant pathways to memory processes during development, normal aging, and disease states. This review will summarize the current knowledge of cholinergic effects on microglia and astroglia, and their role in both anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant mechanisms, concerning normal aging and chronic neuroinflammation. We provided details on how stimulation of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine (α7nACh) receptors can be neuroprotective by increasing amyloid-β phagocytosis, decreasing inflammation and reducing oxidative stress by promoting the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathways and decreasing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. There is also evidence for astroglial α7nACh receptor stimulation mediating anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects by inhibiting the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway and activating the Nrf2 pathway respectively. We conclude that targeting cholinergic glial interactions between neurons and glial cells via α7nACh receptors could regulate neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, relevant to the treatment of several neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Sex Differences of Microglia and Synapses in the Hippocampal Dentate Gyrus of Adult Mouse Offspring Exposed to Maternal Immune Activation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.558181</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder affecting ∼1% of humans worldwide. It is earlier and more frequently diagnosed in men than woman, and men display more pronounced negative symptoms together with greater gray matter reductions. Our previous findings utilizing a maternal immune activation (mIA) mouse model of schizophrenia revealed exacerbated anxiety-like behavior and sensorimotor gating deficits in adult male offspring that were associated with increased microglial reactivity and inflammation in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). However, both male and female adult offspring displayed stereotypy and impairment of sociability. We hypothesized that mIA may lead to sex-specific alterations in microglial pruning activity, resulting in abnormal synaptic connectivity in the DG. Using the same mIA model, we show in the current study sex-specific differences in microglia and synapses within the DG of adult offspring. Specifically, microglial levels of cluster of differentiation (CD)68 and CD11b were increased in mIA-exposed females. Sex-specific differences in excitatory and inhibitory synapse densities were also observed following mIA. Additionally, inhibitory synaptic tone was increased in DG granule cells of both males and females, while changes in excitatory synaptic transmission occurred only in females with mIA. These findings suggest that phagocytic and complement pathways may together contribute to a sexual dimorphism in synaptic pruning and neuronal dysfunction in mIA, and may propose sex-specific therapeutic targets to prevent schizophrenia-like behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Axonal Degeneration in AD: The Contribution of Aβ and Tau</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.581767</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) represents the most common age-related neurodegenerative disorder, affecting around 35 million people worldwide. Despite enormous efforts dedicated to AD research over decades, there is still no cure for the disease. Misfolding and accumulation of Aβ and tau proteins in the brain constitute a defining signature of AD neuropathology, and mounting evidence has documented a link between aggregation of these proteins and neuronal dysfunction. In this context, progressive axonal degeneration has been associated with early stages of AD and linked to Aβ and tau accumulation. As the axonal degeneration mechanism has been starting to be unveiled, it constitutes a promising target for neuroprotection in AD. A comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of axonal destruction in neurodegenerative conditions is therefore critical for the development of new therapies aimed to prevent axonal loss before irreversible neuronal death occurs in AD. Here, we review current evidence of the involvement of Aβ and tau pathologies in the activation of signaling cascades that can promote axonal demise.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Gait Progression Over 6 Years in Parkinson’s Disease: Effects of Age, Medication, and Pathology</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.577435</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Gait disturbance is an early, cardinal feature of Parkinson’s disease (PD) associated with falls and reduced physical activity. Progression of gait impairment in Parkinson’s disease is not well characterized and a better understanding is imperative to mitigate impairment. Subtle gait impairments progress in early disease despite optimal dopaminergic medication. Evaluating gait disturbances over longer periods, accounting for typical aging and dopaminergic medication changes, will enable a better understanding of gait changes and inform targeted therapies for early disease. This study aimed to describe gait progression over the first 6 years of PD by delineating changes associated with aging, medication, and pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: One-hundred and nine newly diagnosed PD participants and 130 controls completed at least two gait assessments. Gait was assessed at 18-month intervals for up to 6 years using an instrumented walkway to measure sixteen spatiotemporal gait characteristics. Linear mixed-effects models assessed progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Ten gait characteristics significantly progressed in PD, with changes in four of these characteristics attributable to disease progression. Age-related changes also contributed to gait progression; changes in another two characteristics reflected both aging and disease progression. Gait impairment progressed irrespective of dopaminergic medication change for all characteristics except step width variability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Discrete gait impairments continue to progress in PD over 6 years, reflecting a combination of, and potential interaction between, disease-specific progression and age-related change. Gait changes were mostly unrelated to dopaminergic medication adjustments, highlighting limitations of current dopaminergic therapy and the need to improve interventions targeting gait decline.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A biophysically detailed description of the mechanisms of the primary vision is still being developed. We have incorporated a simplified, filter-based description of retino-thalamic visual signal processing into the detailed, conductance-based refractory density description of the neuronal population activity of the primary visual cortex. We compared four mechanisms of the direction selectivity (DS), three of them being based on asymmetrical projections of different types of thalamic neurons to the cortex, distinguishing between (i) lagged and nonlagged, (ii) transient and sustained, and (iii) On and Off neurons. The fourth mechanism implies a lack of subcortical bias and is an epiphenomenon of intracortical interactions between orientation columns. The simulations of the cortical response to moving gratings have verified that first three mechanisms provide DS to an extent compared with experimental data and that the biophysical model realistically reproduces characteristics of the visual cortex activity, such as membrane potential, firing rate, and synaptic conductances. The proposed model reveals the difference between the mechanisms of both the intact and the silenced cortex, favoring the second mechanism. In the fourth case, DS is weaker but significant; it completely vanishes in the silenced cortex.DS in the On-Off mechanism derives from the nonlinear interactions within the orientation map. Results of simulations can help to identify a prevailing mechanism of DS in V1. This is a step towards a comprehensive biophysical modeling of the primary visual system in the frameworks of the population rate coding concept.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xBo45prYMsk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Past work has shown that models incorporating human travel can improve the quality of influenza forecasts. Here, we develop and validate a metapopulation model of twelve European countries, in which international translocation of virus is driven by observed commuting and air travel flows, and use this model to generate influenza forecasts in conjunction with incidence data from the World Health Organization. We find that, although the metapopulation model fits the data well, it offers no improvement over isolated models in forecast quality. We discuss several potential reasons for these results. In particular, we note the need for data that are more comparable from country to country, and offer suggestions as to how surveillance systems might be improved to achieve this goal.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ALqFUQMwvak&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Immunohistochemical staining for calbindin reveals a variety regions of the ventral hippocampus within the brain of the banded mongoose. These regions include the dentate gyrus (DG), cornu Ammonis regions 3 (CA3) and 1 (CA1), the ventral subiculum (VS), presubiculum (PrS), and parasubiculum (PaS). Scale bar = 1 mm.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employing cyto‐, myelo‐, and chemoarchitectural staining techniques, we analyzed the structure of the hippocampal formation in the banded mongoose and domestic ferret, species belonging to the two carnivoran superfamilies, which have had independent evolutionary trajectories for the past 55 million years. Our observations indicate that, despite the time since sharing a last common ancestor, these species show extensive similarities. The four major portions of the hippocampal formation (cornu Ammonis, dentate gyrus, subicular complex, and entorhinal cortex) were readily observed, contained the same internal subdivisions, and maintained the topological relationships of these subdivisions that could be considered typically mammalian. In addition, adult hippocampal neurogenesis was observed in both species, occurring at a rate similar to that observed in other mammals. Despite the overall similarities, several differences to each other, and to other mammalian species, were observed. We could not find evidence for the presence of the CA2 and CA4 fields of the cornu Ammonis region. In the banded mongoose the dentate gyrus appears to be comprised of up to seven lamina, through the sublamination of the molecular and granule cell layers, which is not observed in the domestic ferret. In addition, numerous subtle variations in chemoarchitecture between the two species were observed. These differences may contribute to an overall variation in the functionality of the hippocampal formation between the species, and in comparison to other mammalian species. These similarities and variations are important to understanding to what extent phylogenetic affinities and constraints affect potential adaptive evolutionary plasticity of the hippocampal formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Changes in Day/Night Activity in the 6-OHDA-Induced Experimental Model of Parkinson’s Disease: Exploring Prodromal Biomarkers</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.590029</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The search for experimental models mimicking an early stage of Parkinson’s disease (PD) before motor manifestations is fundamental in order to explore early signs and get a better prognosis. Interestingly, our previous studies have indicated that 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) is a suitable model to induce an early degeneration of the nigrostriatal system without any gross motor impairment. Considering our previous findings, we aim to implement a novel system to monitor rats after intrastriatal injection of 6-OHDA to detect and analyze physiological changes underlying prodromal PD. Twenty male Sprague-Dawley rats were unilaterally injected with 6-OHDA (n = 10) or saline solution (n = 10) into the right striatum and placed in enriched environment cages where the activity was monitored. After 2 weeks, the amphetamine test was performed before the sacrifice. Immunohistochemistry was developed for the morphological evaluation and western blot analysis to assess molecular changes. Home-cage monitoring revealed behavioral changes in response to 6-OHDA administration including significant hyperactivity and hypoactivity during the light and dark phase, respectively, turning out in a change of the circadian timing. A preclinical stage of PD was functionally confirmed with the amphetamine test. Moreover, the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase expression was significantly correlated with the motor results, and 6-OHDA induced early proapoptotic events. Our findings provide evidence for a novel prodromal 6-OHDA model following a customized monitoring system that could give insights to detect non-motor deficits and molecular targets to test neuroprotective/neurorestorative agents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.581915</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cerebral ischemia induces neuronal cell death and causes various kinds of brain dysfunction. Therefore, prevention of neuronal cell death is most essential for protection of the brain. On the other hand, it has been reported that epigenetics including DNA methylation plays a pivotal role in pathogenesis of some diseases such as cancer. Accumulating evidences indicate that aberrant DNA methylation is related to cell death. However, DNA methylation after cerebral ischemia has not been fully understood yet. The aim of this present study was to investigate the relationships between DNA methylation and neuronal cell death after cerebral ischemia. We examined DNA methylation under the ischemic condition by using transient middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R) model rats and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)–treated cortical neurons in primary culture. In this study, we demonstrated that DNA methylation increased in these neurons 24 h after MCAO/R and that DNA methylation, possibly through activation of DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) 3a, increased in such neurons immediately after NMDA treatment. Furthermore, NMDA-treated neurons were protected by treatment with a DNMT inhibitor that were accompanied by inhibition of DNA methylation. Our results showed that DNA methylation would be an initiation factor of neuronal cell death and that inhibition of such methylation could become an effective therapeutic strategy for stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The brain extracellular space (ECS) is a continuous reticular compartment that lies between the cells of the brain. It is vast in extent relative to its resident cells, yet, at the same time the nano- to micrometer dimensions of its channels and reservoirs are commonly finer than the smallest cellular structures. Our conventional view of this compartment as largely static and of secondary importance for brain function is rapidly changing, and its active dynamic roles in signaling and metabolite clearance have come to the fore. It is further emerging that ECS microarchitecture is highly heterogeneous and dynamic and that ECS geometry and diffusional properties directly modulate local diffusional transport, down to the nanoscale around individual synapses. The ECS can therefore be considered an extremely complex and diverse compartment, where numerous physiological events are unfolding in parallel on spatial and temporal scales that span orders of magnitude, from milliseconds to hours, and from nanometers to centimeters. To further understand the physiological roles of the ECS and identify new ones, researchers can choose from a wide array of experimental techniques, which differ greatly in their applicability to a given sample and the type of data they produce. Here, we aim to provide a basic introduction to the available experimental techniques that have been applied to address the brain ECS, highlighting their main characteristics. We include current gold-standard techniques, as well as emerging cutting-edge modalities based on recent super-resolution microscopy. It is clear that each technique comes with unique strengths and limitations and that no single experimental method can unravel the unknown physiological roles of the brain ECS on its own.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Cross-Subject Commonality of Emotion Representations in Dorsal Motion-Sensitive Areas</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.567797</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Emotion perception is a crucial question in cognitive neuroscience and the underlying neural substrates have been the subject of intense study. One of our previous studies demonstrated that motion-sensitive areas are involved in the perception of facial expressions. However, it remains unclear whether emotions perceived from whole-person stimuli can be decoded from the motion-sensitive areas. In addition, if emotions are represented in the motion-sensitive areas, we may further ask whether the representations of emotions in the motion-sensitive areas can be shared across individual subjects. To address these questions, this study collected neural images while participants viewed emotions (joy, anger, and fear) from videos of whole-person expressions (contained both face and body parts) in a block-design functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment. Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) was conducted to explore the emotion decoding performance in individual-defined dorsal motion-sensitive regions of interest (ROIs). Results revealed that emotions could be successfully decoded from motion-sensitive ROIs with statistically significant classification accuracies for three emotions as well as positive versus negative emotions. Moreover, results from the cross-subject classification analysis showed that a person’s emotion representation could be robustly predicted by others’ emotion representations in motion-sensitive areas. Together, these results reveal that emotions are represented in dorsal motion-sensitive areas and that the representation of emotions is consistent across subjects. Our findings provide new evidence of the involvement of motion-sensitive areas in the emotion decoding, and further suggest that there exists a common emotion code in the motion-sensitive areas across individual subjects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Simulation of Large Scale Neural Models With Event-Driven Connectivity Generation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.522000</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Accurate simulations of brain structures is a major problem in neuroscience. Many works are dedicated to design better models or to develop more efficient simulation schemes. In this paper, we propose a hybrid simulation scheme that combines time-stepping second-order integration of Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) type neurons with event-driven updating of the synaptic currents. As the HH model is a continuous model, there is no explicit spike events. Thus, in order to preserve the accuracy of the integration method, a spike detection algorithm is developed that accurately determines spike times. This approach allows us to regenerate the outgoing connections at each event, thereby avoiding the storage of the connectivity. Consequently, memory consumption is significantly reduced while preserving execution time and accuracy of the simulations, especially the spike times of detailed point neuron models. The efficiency of the method, implemented in the SiReNe software&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, is demonstrated by the simulation of a striatum model which consists of more than 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; neurons and 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; synapses (each neuron has a fan-out of 504 post-synaptic neurons), under normal and Parkinson's conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: A Neural Network Model With Gap Junction for Topological Detection</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.571982</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Visual information processing in the brain goes from global to local. A large volume of experimental studies has suggested that among global features, the brain perceives the topological information of an image first. Here, we propose a neural network model to elucidate the underlying computational mechanism. The model consists of two parts. The first part is a neural network in which neurons are coupled through gap junctions, mimicking the neural circuit formed by alpha ganglion cells in the retina. Gap junction plays a key role in the model, which, on one hand, facilitates the synchronized firing of a neuron group covering a connected region of an image, and on the other hand, staggers the firing moments of different neuron groups covering disconnected regions of the image. These two properties endow the network with the capacity of detecting the connectivity and closure of images. The second part of the model is a read-out neuron, which reads out the topological information that has been converted into the number of synchronized firings in the retina network. Our model provides a simple yet effective mechanism for the neural system to detect the topological information of images in ultra-speed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Unsupervised Few-Shot Feature Learning via Self-Supervised Training</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00083</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Learning from limited exemplars (few-shot learning) is a fundamental, unsolved problem that has been laboriously explored in the machine learning community. However, current few-shot learners are mostly supervised and rely heavily on a large amount of labeled examples. Unsupervised learning is a more natural procedure for cognitive mammals and has produced promising results in many machine learning tasks. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised feature learning method for few-shot learning. The proposed model consists of two alternate processes, progressive clustering and episodic training. The former generates pseudo-labeled training examples for constructing episodic tasks; and the later trains the few-shot learner using the generated episodic tasks which further optimizes the feature representations of data. The two processes facilitate each other, and eventually produce a high quality few-shot learner. In our experiments, our model achieves good generalization performance in a variety of downstream few-shot learning tasks on Omniglot and MiniImageNet. We also construct a new few-shot person re-identification dataset FS-Market1501 to demonstrate the feasibility of our model to a real-world application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00071</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;New technologies for recording the activity of large neural populations during complex behavior provide exciting opportunities for investigating the neural computations that underlie perception, cognition, and decision-making. Non-linear state space models provide an interpretable signal processing framework by combining an intuitive dynamical system with a probabilistic observation model, which can provide insights into neural dynamics, neural computation, and development of neural prosthetics and treatment through feedback control. This brings with it the challenge of learning both latent neural state and the underlying dynamical system because neither are known for neural systems a priori. We developed a flexible online learning framework for latent non-linear state dynamics and filtered latent states. Using the stochastic gradient variational Bayes approach, our method jointly optimizes the parameters of the non-linear dynamical system, the observation model, and the black-box recognition model. Unlike previous approaches, our framework can incorporate non-trivial distributions of observation noise and has constant time and space complexity. These features make our approach amenable to real-time applications and the potential to automate analysis and experimental design in ways that testably track and modify behavior using stimuli designed to influence learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Transducin Partners Outside the Phototransduction Pathway</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.589494</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transducin mediates signal transduction in a classical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) phototransduction cascade. Interactions of transducin with the receptor and the effector molecules had been extensively investigated and are currently defined at the atomic level. However, partners and functions of rod transducin α (Gα&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and βγ (Gβ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) outside the visual pathway are not well-understood. In particular, light-induced redistribution of rod transducin from the outer segment to the inner segment and synaptic terminal (IS/ST) allows Gα&lt;sub&gt;t1&lt;/sub&gt; and/or Gβ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to modulate synaptic transmission from rods to rod bipolar cells (RBCs). Protein-protein interactions underlying this modulation are largely unknown. We discuss known interactors of transducin in the rod IS/ST compartment and potential pathways leading to the synaptic effects of light-dispersed Gα&lt;sub&gt;t1&lt;/sub&gt; and Gβ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Furthermore, we show that a prominent non-GPCR guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and a chaperone of Gα subunits, resistance to inhibitors of cholinesterase 8A (Ric-8A) protein, is expressed throughout the retina including photoreceptor cells. Recent structures of Ric-8A alone and in complexes with Gα subunits have illuminated the structural underpinnings of the Ric-8A activities. We generated a mouse model with conditional knockout of Ric-8A in rods in order to begin defining the functional roles of the protein in rod photoreceptors and the retina. Our analysis suggests that Ric-8A is not an obligate chaperone of Gα&lt;sub&gt;t1&lt;/sub&gt;. Further research is needed to investigate probable roles of Ric-8A as a GEF, trafficking chaperone, or a mediator of the synaptic effects of Gα&lt;sub&gt;t1&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Alterations in Intrinsic and Synaptic Properties of Hippocampal CA1 VIP Interneurons During Aging</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.554405</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Learning and memory deficits are hallmarks of the aging brain, with cortical neuronal circuits representing the main target in cognitive deterioration. While GABAergic inhibitory and disinhibitory circuits are critical in supporting cognitive processes, their roles in age-related cognitive decline remain largely unknown. Here, we examined the morphological and physiological properties of the hippocampal CA1 vasoactive intestinal peptide/calretinin-expressing (VIP+/CR+) type 3 interneuron-specific (I-S3) cells across mouse lifespan. Our data showed that while the number and morphological features of I-S3 cells remained unchanged, their firing and synaptic properties were significantly altered in old animals. In particular, the action potential duration and the level of steady-state depolarization were significantly increased in old animals in parallel with a significant decrease in the maximal firing frequency. Reducing the fast-delayed rectifier potassium or transient sodium conductances in I-S3 cell computational models could reproduce the age-related changes in I-S3 cell firing properties. However, experimental data revealed no difference in the activation properties of the Kv3.1 and A-type potassium currents, indicating that transient sodium together with other ion conductances may be responsible for the observed phenomena. Furthermore, I-S3 cells in aged mice received a stronger inhibitory drive due to concomitant increase in the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous inhibitory currents. These age-associated changes in the I-S3 cell properties occurred in parallel with an increased inhibition of their target interneurons and were associated with spatial memory deficits and increased anxiety. Taken together, these data indicate that VIP+/CR+ interneurons responsible for local circuit disinhibition survive during aging but exhibit significantly altered physiological properties, which may result in the increased inhibition of hippocampal interneurons and distorted mnemonic functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Neural Stimulation and Molecular Mechanisms of Plasticity and Regeneration: A Review</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00271</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural stimulation modulates the depolarization of neurons, thereby triggering activity-associated mechanisms of neuronal plasticity. Activity-associated mechanisms in turn play a major role in post-mitotic structure and function of adult neurons. Our understanding of the interactions between neuronal behavior, patterns of neural activity, and the surrounding environment is evolving at a rapid pace. Brain derived neurotrophic factor is a critical mediator of activity-associated plasticity, while multiple immediate early genes mediate plasticity of neurons following bouts of neural activity. New research has uncovered genetic mechanisms that govern the expression of DNA following changes in neural activity patterns, including RNAPII pause-release and activity-associated double stranded breaks. Discovery of novel mechanisms governing activity-associated plasticity of neurons hints at a layered and complex molecular control of neuronal response to depolarization. Importantly, patterns of depolarization in neurons are shown to be important mediators of genetic expression patterns and molecular responses. More research is needed to fully uncover the molecular response of different types of neurons-to-activity patterns; however, known responses might be leveraged to facilitate recovery after neural damage. Physical rehabilitation through passive or active exercise modulates neurotrophic factor expression in the brain and spinal cord and can initiate cortical plasticity commensurate with functional recovery. Rehabilitation likely relies on activity-associated mechanisms; however, it may be limited in its application. Electrical and magnetic stimulation direct specific activity patterns not accessible through passive or active exercise and work synergistically to improve standing, walking, and forelimb use after injury. Here, we review emerging concepts in the molecular mechanisms of activity-derived plasticity in order to highlight opportunities that could add value to therapeutic protocols for promoting recovery of function after trauma, disease, or age-related functional decline.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: A Systematic Review on Predictors of Working Memory Training Responsiveness in Healthy Older Adults: Methodological Challenges and Future Directions</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.575804</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Research on predictors of working memory training responsiveness, which could help tailor cognitive interventions individually, is a timely topic in healthy aging. However, the findings are highly heterogeneous, reporting partly conflicting results following a broad spectrum of methodological approaches to answer the question “who benefits most” from working memory training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: The present systematic review aimed to systematically investigate prognostic factors and models for working memory training responsiveness in healthy older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: Four online databases were searched up to October 2019 (MEDLINE Ovid, Web of Science, CENTRAL, and PsycINFO). The inclusion criteria for full texts were publication in a peer-reviewed journal in English/German, inclusion of healthy older individuals aged ≥55 years without any neurological and/or psychiatric diseases including cognitive impairment, and the investigation of prognostic factors and/or models for training responsiveness after targeted working memory training in terms of direct training effects, near-transfer effects to verbal and visuospatial working memory as well as far-transfer effects to other cognitive domains and behavioral variables. The study design was not limited to randomized controlled trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A total of 16 studies including n = 675 healthy older individuals with a mean age of 63.0–86.8 years were included in this review. Within these studies, five prognostic model approaches and 18 factor finding approaches were reported. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality in Prognosis Studies checklist, indicating that important information, especially regarding the domains study attrition, study confounding, and statistical analysis and reporting, was lacking throughout many of the investigated studies. Age, education, intelligence, and baseline performance in working memory or other cognitive domains were frequently investigated predictors across studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Given the methodological shortcomings of the included studies, no clear conclusions can be drawn, and emerging patterns of prognostic effects will have to survive sound methodological replication in future attempts to promote precision medicine approaches in the context of working memory training. Methodological considerations are discussed, and our findings are embedded to the cognitive aging literature, considering, for example, the cognitive reserve framework and the compensation vs. magnification account. The need for personalized cognitive prevention and intervention methods to counteract cognitive decline in the aging population is high and the potential enormous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Registration: PROSPERO, ID CRD42019142750.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Compromised Behavior and Gamma Power During Working Memory in Cognitively Healthy Individuals With Abnormal CSF Amyloid/Tau</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.574214</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Research shows that gamma activity changes in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), revealing synaptic pathology and potential therapeutic applications. We aim to explore whether cognitive challenge combined with quantitative EEG (qEEG) can unmask abnormal gamma frequency power in healthy individuals at high risk of developing AD. We analyzed low (30–50 Hz) and high gamma (50–80 Hz) power over six brain regions at EEG sensor level (frontal/central/parietal/left temporal/right temporal/occipital) in a dataset collected from an aging cohort during N-back working memory (WM) testing at two different load conditions (N = 0 or 2). Cognitively healthy (CH) study participants (≥60 years old) of both sexes were divided into two subgroups: normal amyloid/tau ratios (CH-NAT, n = 10) or pathological amyloid/tau (CH-PAT, n = 14) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). During low load (0-back) challenge, low gamma is higher in CH-PATs than CH-NATs over frontal and central regions (p = 0.014∼0.032, effect size (Cohen’s d) = 0.95∼1.11). However, during high load (2-back) challenge, low gamma is lower in CH-PATs compared to CH-NATs over the left temporal region (p = 0.045, Cohen’s d = −0.96), and high gamma is lower over the parietal region (p = 0.035, Cohen’s d = −1.02). Overall, our studies show a medium to large negative effect size across the scalp (Cohen’s d = −0.51∼−1.02). In addition, low gamma during 2-back is positively correlated with 0-back accuracy over all regions except the occipital region only in CH-NATs (r = 0.69∼0.77, p = 0.0098∼0.027); high gamma during 2-back correlated positively with 0-back accuracy over all regions in CH-NATs (r = 0.68∼0.78, p = 0.007∼0.030); high gamma during 2-back negatively correlated with 0-back response time over parietal, right temporal, and occipital regions in CH-NATs (r = −0.70∼−0.66, p = 0.025∼0.037). We interpret these preliminary results to show: (1) gamma power is compromised in AD-biomarker positive individuals, who are otherwise cognitively healthy (CH-PATs); (2) gamma is associated with WM performance in normal aging (CH-NATs) (most significantly in the frontoparietal region). Our pilot findings encourage further investigations in combining cognitive challenges and qEEG in developing neurophysiology-based markers for identifying individuals in the prodromal stage, to help improving our understanding of AD pathophysiology and the contributions of low- and high-frequency gamma oscillations in cognitive functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Exploring the sequence fitness landscape of a bridge between protein folds</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/pwH3Evehv4k/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Pengfei Tian, Robert B. Best&lt;/p&gt;

Most foldable protein sequences adopt only a single native fold. Recent protein design studies have, however, created protein sequences which fold into different structures apon changes of environment, or single point mutation, the best characterized example being the switch between the folds of the GA and GB binding domains of streptococcal protein G. To obtain further insight into the design of sequences which can switch folds, we have used a computational model for the fitness landscape of a single fold, built from the observed sequence variation of protein homologues. We have recently shown that such coevolutionary models can be used to design novel foldable sequences. By appropriately combining two of these models to describe the joint fitness landscape of GA and GB, we are able to describe the propensity of a given sequence for each of the two folds. We have successfully tested the combined model against the known series of designed GA/GB hybrids. Using Monte Carlo simulations on this landscape, we are able to identify pathways of mutations connecting the two folds. In the absence of a requirement for domain stability, the most frequent paths go via sequences in which neither domain is stably folded, reminiscent of the propensity for certain intrinsically disordered proteins to fold into different structures according to context. Even if the folded state is required to be stable, we find that there is nonetheless still a wide range of sequences which are close to the transition region and therefore likely fold switches, consistent with recent estimates that fold switching may be more widespread than had been thought.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pwH3Evehv4k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Visually guided homing of bumblebees in ambiguous situations: A behavioural and modelling study</title>

Returning home is a crucial task accomplished daily by many animals, including humans. Because of their tiny brains, insects, like bees or ants, are good study models for efficient navigation strategies. Bees and ants are known to rely mainly on learned visual information about the nest surroundings to pinpoint their barely visible nest-entrance. During the return, when the actual sight of the insect matches the learned information, the insect is easily guided home. Occasionally, modifications to the visual environment may take place while the insect is on a foraging trip. Here, we addressed the ecologically relevant question of how bumblebees’ homing is affected by such a situation. In an artificial setting, we habituated bees to be guided to their nest by two constellations of visual cues. After habituation, these cues were displaced during foraging trips into a conflict situation. We recorded bumblebees’ return flights in such circumstances and investigated where they search for their nest entrance following the degree of displacement between the two visually relevant cues. Bumblebees mostly searched at the fictive nest location as indicated by either cue constellation, but never at a compromise location between them. We compared these experimental results to the predictions of different types of homing models. We found that models guiding an agent by a single holistic view of the nest surroundings could not account for the bumblebees’ search behaviour in cue-conflict situations. Instead, homing models relying on multiple views were sufficient. We could further show that homing models required fewer views and got more robust to height changes if optic flow-based spatial information was encoded and learned, rather than just brightness information.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/t0GW-wD3XXc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s are associated with the prion-like propagation and aggregation of toxic proteins. A long standing hypothesis that amyloid-beta drives Alzheimer’s disease has proven the subject of contemporary controversy; leading to new research in both the role of tau protein and its interaction with amyloid-beta. Conversely, recent work in mathematical modeling has demonstrated the relevance of nonlinear reaction-diffusion type equations to capture essential features of the disease. Such approaches have been further simplified, to network-based models, and offer researchers a powerful set of computationally tractable tools with which to investigate neurodegenerative disease dynamics. Here, we propose a novel, coupled network-based model for a two-protein system that includes an enzymatic interaction term alongside a simple model of aggregate transneuronal damage. We apply this theoretical model to test the possible interactions between tau proteins and amyloid-beta and study the resulting coupled behavior between toxic protein clearance and proteopathic phenomenology. Our analysis reveals ways in which amyloid-beta and tau proteins may conspire with each other to enhance the nucleation and propagation of different diseases, thus shedding new light on the importance of protein clearance and protein interaction mechanisms in prion-like models of neurodegenerative disease.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KLXNjOQrBgw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Systematic modelling of the development of laminar projection origins in the cerebral cortex: Interactions of spatio-temporal patterns of neurogenesis and cellular heterogeneity</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/9VZgkBWsJfs/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Sarah F. Beul, Claus C. Hilgetag&lt;/p&gt;

The architectonic type principle conceptualizes structural connections between brain areas in terms of the relative architectonic differentiation of connected areas. It has previously been shown that spatio-temporal interactions between the time and place of neurogenesis could underlie multiple features of empirical mammalian connectomes, such as projection existence and the distribution of projection strengths. However, so far no mechanistic explanation for the emergence of typically observed laminar patterns of projection origins and terminations has been tested. Here, we expand an &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; model of the developing cortical sheet to explore which factors could potentially constrain the development of laminar projection patterns. We show that manipulations which rely solely on spatio-temporal interactions, namely the relative density of laminar compartments, a delay in the neurogenesis of infragranular layers relative to layer 1, and a delay in the neurogenesis of supragranular layers relative to infragranular layers, do not result in the striking correlation between supragranular contribution to projections and the relative differentiation of areas that is typically observed in the mammalian cortex. In contrast, we find that if we introduce systematic variation in cell-intrinsic properties, coupling them with architectonic differentiation, the resulting laminar projection patterns closely mirror the empirically observed patterns. We also find that the spatio-temporal interactions posited to occur during neurogenesis are necessary for the formation of the characteristic laminar patterns. Hence, our results indicate that the specification of the laminar patterns of projection origins may result from systematic variation in a number of cell-intrinsic properties, superimposed on the previously identified spatio-temporal interactions which are sufficient for the emergence of the architectonic type principle on the level of inter-areal connectivity &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9VZgkBWsJfs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Bacteriophages (phages) are critical players in the dynamics and function of microbial communities and drive processes as diverse as global biogeochemical cycles and human health. Phages tend to be predators finely tuned to attack specific hosts, even down to the strain level, which in turn defend themselves using an array of mechanisms. However, to date, efforts to rapidly and comprehensively identify bacterial host factors important in phage infection and resistance have yet to be fully realized. Here, we globally map the host genetic determinants involved in resistance to 14 phylogenetically diverse double-stranded DNA phages using two model &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; strains (K-12 and BL21) with known sequence divergence to demonstrate strain-specific differences. Using genome-wide loss-of-function and gain-of-function genetic technologies, we are able to confirm previously described phage receptors as well as uncover a number of previously unknown host factors that confer resistance to one or more of these phages. We uncover differences in resistance factors that strongly align with the susceptibility of K-12 and BL21 to specific phage. We also identify both phage-specific mechanisms, such as the unexpected role of cyclic-di-GMP in host sensitivity to phage N4, and more generic defenses, such as the overproduction of colanic acid capsular polysaccharide that defends against a wide array of phages. Our results indicate that host responses to phages can occur via diverse cellular mechanisms. Our systematic and high-throughput genetic workflow to characterize phage-host interaction determinants can be extended to diverse bacteria to generate datasets that allow predictive models of how phage-mediated selection will shape bacterial phenotype and evolution. The results of this study and future efforts to map the phage resistance landscape will lead to new insights into the coevolution of hosts and their phage, which can ultimately be used to design better phage therapeutic treatments and tools for precision microbiome engineering.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/iHWP51nHehA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Neural activity during a simple reaching task in macaques is counter to gating and rebound in basal ganglia–thalamic communication</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/iBXCAHu-EVs/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Bettina C. Schwab, Daisuke Kase, Andrew Zimnik, Robert Rosenbaum, Marcello G. Codianni, Jonathan E. Rubin, Robert S. Turner&lt;/p&gt;

Task-related activity in the ventral thalamus, a major target of basal ganglia output, is often assumed to be permitted or triggered by changes in basal ganglia activity through gating- or rebound-like mechanisms. To test those hypotheses, we sampled single-unit activity from connected basal ganglia output and thalamic nuclei (globus pallidus-internus [GPi] and ventrolateral anterior nucleus [VLa]) in monkeys performing a reaching task. Rate increases were the most common peri-movement change in both nuclei. Moreover, peri-movement changes generally began earlier in VLa than in GPi. Simultaneously recorded GPi-VLa pairs rarely showed short-time-scale spike-to-spike correlations or slow across-trials covariations, and both were equally positive and negative. Finally, spontaneous GPi bursts and pauses were both followed by small, slow reductions in VLa rate. These results appear incompatible with standard gating and rebound models. Still, gating or rebound may be possible in other physiological situations: simulations show how GPi-VLa communication can scale with GPi synchrony and GPi-to-VLa convergence, illuminating how synchrony of basal ganglia output during motor learning or in pathological conditions may render this pathway effective. Thus, in the healthy state, basal ganglia-thalamic communication during learned movement is more subtle than expected, with changes in firing rates possibly being dominated by a common external source.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/iBXCAHu-EVs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Subthalamic Nucleus Deep Brain Stimulation Modulates 2 Distinct Neurocircuits</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25906?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current understanding of the neuromodulatory effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) on large‐scale brain networks remains elusive, largely due to the lack of techniques that can reveal DBS‐induced activity at the whole‐brain level. Using a novel 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)‐compatible stimulator, we investigated whole‐brain effects of subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation in patients with Parkinson disease.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourteen patients received STN‐DBS treatment and participated in a block‐design functional MRI (fMRI) experiment, wherein stimulations were delivered during “ON” blocks interleaved with “OFF” blocks. fMRI responses to low‐frequency (60Hz) and high‐frequency(130Hz) STN‐DBS were measured 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postsurgery. To ensure reliability, multiple runs (48 minutes) of fMRI data were acquired at each postsurgical visit. Presurgical resting‐state fMRI (30 minutes) data were also acquired.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two neurocircuits showed highly replicable, but distinct responses to STN‐DBS. A circuit involving the globus pallidus internus (GPi), thalamus, and deep cerebellar nuclei was significantly activated, whereas another circuit involving the primary motor cortex (M1), putamen, and cerebellum showed DBS‐induced deactivation. These 2 circuits were dissociable in terms of their DBS‐induced responses and resting‐state functional connectivity. The GPi circuit was frequency‐dependent, selectively responding to high‐frequency stimulation, whereas the M1 circuit was responsive in a time‐dependent manner, showing enhanced deactivation over time. Finally, activation of the GPi circuit was associated with overall motor improvement, whereas M1 circuit deactivation was related to reduced bradykinesia.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concurrent DBS‐fMRI using 3T revealed 2 distinct circuits that responded differentially to STN‐DBS and were related to divergent symptoms, a finding that may provide novel insights into the neural mechanisms underlying DBS. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: The synergy of damage repair and retention promotes rejuvenation and prolongs healthy lifespans in cell lineages</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/mXRoa-zjcos/article</link>

Damaged proteins are inherited asymmetrically during cell division in the yeast &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, such that most damage is retained within the mother cell. The consequence is an ageing mother and a rejuvenated daughter cell with full replicative potential. Daughters of old and damaged mothers are however born with increasing levels of damage resulting in lowered replicative lifespans. Remarkably, these prematurely old daughters can give rise to rejuvenated cells with low damage levels and recovered lifespans, called second-degree rejuvenation. We aimed to investigate how damage repair and retention together can promote rejuvenation and at the same time ensure low damage levels in mother cells, reflected in longer health spans. We developed a dynamic model for damage accumulation over successive divisions in individual cells as part of a dynamically growing cell lineage. With detailed knowledge about single-cell dynamics and relationships between all cells in the lineage, we can infer how individual damage repair and retention strategies affect the propagation of damage in the population. We show that damage retention lowers damage levels in the population by reducing the variability across the lineage, and results in larger population sizes. Repairing damage efficiently in early life, as opposed to investing in repair when damage has already accumulated, counteracts accelerated ageing caused by damage retention. It prolongs the health span of individual cells which are moreover less prone to stress. In combination, damage retention and early investment in repair are beneficial for healthy ageing in yeast cell populations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mXRoa-zjcos&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Time varying methods to infer extremes in dengue transmission dynamics</title>

Dengue is an arbovirus affecting global populations. Frequent outbreaks occur, especially in equatorial cities such as Singapore, where year-round tropical climate, large daily influx of travelers and population density provide the ideal conditions for dengue to transmit. Little work has, however, quantified the peaks of dengue outbreaks, when health systems are likely to be most stretched. Nor have methods been developed to infer differences in exogenous factors which lead to the rise and fall of dengue case counts across extreme and non-extreme periods. In this paper, we developed time varying extreme mixture (tvEM) methods to account for the temporal dependence of dengue case counts across extreme and non-extreme periods. This approach permits inference of differences in climatic forcing across non-extreme and extreme periods of dengue case counts, quantification of their temporal dependence as well as estimation of thresholds with associated uncertainties to determine dengue case count extremities. Using tvEM, we found no evidence that weather affects dengue case counts in the near term for non-extreme periods, but that it has non-linear and mixed signals in influencing dengue through tvEM parameters in the extreme periods. Using the most appropriate tvEM specification, we found that a threshold at the 70&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; (95% credible interval 41.1, 83.8) quantile is optimal, with extreme events of 526.6, 1052.2 and 1183.6 weekly case counts expected at return periods of 5, 50 and 75 years. Weather parameters at a 1% scaled increase was found to decrease the long-run expected case counts, but larger increases would lead to a drastic expected rise from the baseline correspondingly. The tvEM approach can provide valuable inference on the extremes of time series, which in the case of infectious disease notifications, allows public health officials to understand the likely scale of outbreaks in the long run.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/I3cXdvxQa64&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

We show how highly-diverse ecological communities may display persistent abundance fluctuations, when interacting through resource competition and subjected to migration from a species pool. These fluctuations appear, robustly and predictably, in certain regimes of parameter space. Their origin is closely tied to the ratio of realized species diversity to the number of resources. This ratio is set by competition, through the balance between species being pushed out and invading. When this ratio is smaller than one, dynamics will reach stable equilibria. When this ratio is larger than one, the competitive exclusion principle dictates that fixed-points are either unstable or marginally stable. If they are unstable, the system is repelled from fixed points, and abundances forever fluctuate. While marginally-stable fixed points are in principle allowed and predicted by some models, they become structurally unstable at high diversity. This means that even small changes to the model, such as non-linearities in how resources combine to generate species’ growth, will result in persistent abundance fluctuations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-YwQ_ZWKQz0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Optimising risk-based surveillance for early detection of invasive plant pathogens</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/dZ_K3scbbW8/article</link>

Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) of plants continue to devastate ecosystems and livelihoods worldwide. Effective management requires surveillance to detect epidemics at an early stage. However, despite the increasing use of risk-based surveillance programs in plant health, it remains unclear how best to target surveillance resources to achieve this. We combine a spatially explicit model of pathogen entry and spread with a statistical model of detection and use a stochastic optimisation routine to identify which arrangement of surveillance sites maximises the probability of detecting an invading epidemic. Our approach reveals that it is not always optimal to target the highest-risk sites and that the optimal strategy differs depending on not only patterns of pathogen entry and spread but also the choice of detection method. That is, we find that spatial correlation in risk can make it suboptimal to focus solely on the highest-risk sites, meaning that it is best to avoid ‘putting all your eggs in one basket’. However, this depends on an interplay with other factors, such as the sensitivity of available detection methods. Using the economically important arboreal disease huanglongbing (HLB), we demonstrate how our approach leads to a significant performance gain and cost saving in comparison with conventional methods to targeted surveillance.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/dZ_K3scbbW8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>
