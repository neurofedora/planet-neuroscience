	<title>The Cerebellum: Spinocerebellar Ataxia-Like Presentation of the M233V PSEN1 Mutation</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01161-3</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PSEN1&lt;/em&gt; gene is considered to be the most common gene, which is responsible for the development of an autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease with early onset and sometimes broad phenotype. We present a patient with a spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)-like phenotype who was found to carry an M233V mutation. General and neurological exam was carried out. Brain MRI as well as genetic testing for SCAs 1, 2, 3, 6, and 17 were performed. The patient was then referred for a next-generation sequencing-based gene panel test with 723 genes included. A 26-year-old man of an Azerbaijani origin presented with a progressive impairment of coordination followed by memory impairment. Family history was positive for a similar disorder suggesting autosomal dominant inheritance. Brain MRI showed bilateral hippocampal atrophy (more pronounced in the left), as well as mild atrophy of the left temporoparietal cortex. Tests for SCAs 1, 2, 3, 6, and 17 came negative. Gene panel test showed c.697A &amp;gt; G heterozygous variant in the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PSEN1&lt;/em&gt; gene leading to a M233V amino acid change, which was validated by a Sanger sequencing. So far, M233V mutation has not been associated with a combination of cerebellar and cognitive features at onset. Our case contributes to a better characterization of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PSEN1&lt;/em&gt; mutations and expands the phenotype of the M233V carriers. We propose to consider &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PSEN1&lt;/em&gt; mutations in patients presenting with an SCA-like phenotype but negative for common types of SCA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A prompt diagnosis and treatment of patients with autoimmune cerebellar ataxia (CA) with antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD-Abs) may lead to a better prognosis. Herein, we report prodromal transient neurological symptoms that should raise clinical suspicion of CA with GAD-Abs. We initially identified a 70-year-old man who presented a first acute episode of vertigo, diplopia, and ataxia lasting 2 weeks. Two months later, he experienced a similar episode along with new-onset gaze-evoked nystagmus. After 4 months, downbeat nystagmus, left limb dysmetria, and gait ataxia progressively appeared, and an autoimmune CA was diagnosed based on the positivity of GAD-Abs in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We searched retrospectively for similar presentations in a cohort of 31 patients diagnosed with CA and GAD-Abs. We found 11 (35.4%) patients (all women, median age 62 years; 8/11 [72.7%] with autoimmune comorbidities) with transient neurological symptoms antedating CA onset by a median of 3 months, including vertigo in 9 (81.8%; described as paroxysmal in 8) and fluctuating diplopia in 3 (27.3%) patients. The identification of transient neurological symptoms of unknown etiology, such as paroxysmal vertigo and fluctuating diplopia, should lead to GAD-Abs testing in serum and CSF, especially in patients with autoimmune comorbidities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Beyond the Typical Syndrome: Understanding Non-motor Features in Niemann-Pick Type C Disease</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01156-0</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by storage of unesterified glycolipids and cholesterol in lysosome. NPC’s clinical presentation is highly heterogeneous, depending on the time of onset. It encompasses visceral, neurological, and/or psychiatric manifestations. As the motor findings are so important and devastating in this disease, there is a lack of description about non-motor symptoms, even though they play important role in quality of life of NPC patients. We described the most common non-motor findings in NPC like cognitive dysfunction, neuroimaging, psychiatric symptoms, sleep disorders, seizures, hearing problems, respiratory and other systemic features, bladder and fecal dysfunction, hypersalivation, and malnutrition. In this review, we highlighted the importance of these undervalued symptoms and their management. Specific measures of all aforementioned clinical features may work as relevant biomarkers in order to evaluate successful therapies in future clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) represent a large group of heredodegenerative diseases, with great phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity. However, in the clinical neurological practice, some symptoms and signs might help differentiate the SCAs. This study’s aims were to evaluate the frequency of upward gaze palsy (UGP) and investigate its role in assisting in the clinical differentiation of SCAs. We included 419 patients with SCAs (248 with SCA3, 95 with SCA10, 38 with SCA2, 22 with SCA1, 12 with SCA7, and 4 with SCA6). This study compared UGP with other known markers of disease severity—age of onset, disease duration, SARA score, and size of CAG expansion, and also other semiologic features, as bulging eyes. This sign was significantly more prevalent in SCA3 (64.11%), compared with SCA10 (3.16%; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and other SCAs (SCA1, SCA2, SCA7–11.84%; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). UGP showed very high sensibility ins SCA3 (92.9), although lacking of specificity (64.1%). The odds ratio (OR) of UGP were also very high, 23.52 (95% CI 12.38–44.69), and was significantly correlated with larger CAG expansions, age, and disease duration in SCA3 patients, but not with age of onset or severity of the ataxic syndrome. This study showed that UGP is highly suggestive of SCA3 and has high sensitivity for the differential diagnosis among SCAs, and it could be of great value for bedside semiologic tool.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Feasibility and Acceptability of Lee Silverman Voice Treatment in Progressive Ataxias</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Communication difficulties have considerable impact on people with progressive ataxia, yet there are currently no evidence-based treatments. LSVT LOUD® focuses on the production of healthy vocal loudness whilst also improving breath support, vocal quality, loudness and articulation in participating patients. This study aimed to investigate whether Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT LOUD®) can improve communication effectiveness in these patients. We performed a rater-blinded, single-arm study investigating LSVT LOUD® treatment in a population of patients with progressive ataxia including Friedreich’s ataxia (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 18), spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 1), idiopathic cerebellar ataxia (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 1), and spastic paraplegia 7 (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 1). Twenty-one patients were recruited to the study, with 19 completing treatment. Sessions were administered via Skype in the LSVT-X format, meaning two sessions per week over a period of 8 weeks. Assessments included two baseline and two post-treatment measures and focused on outcome measures covering aspects ranging from physiological function to impact and participation. Results indicate improvements in patient-perceived outcomes for 14 of the 19 participants, in both speech and psychosocial domains. Speech data furthermore demonstrate significant improvements in prolonged vowel duration, and voice quality measures. Intelligibility and naturalness evaluations showed no change post-treatment. Patients reported high acceptability of the treatment itself, as well as administration by Skype. This is the largest treatment study for people with progressive ataxia published to date. It provides an indication that LSVT LOUD® can have a positive impact on communication in this patient group and could form the basis for larger-scale trials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Treatment of Primary Autoimmune Cerebellar Ataxia with Mycophenolate</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01152-4</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Immune-mediated ataxias account for a substantial number of sporadic otherwise idiopathic ataxias. Despite some well-characterised entities such as paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration where diagnostic markers exist, the majority of immune ataxias remained undiagnosed and untreated. We present here our experience in the treatment of suspected primary autoimmune cerebellar ataxia (PACA) using mycophenolate. All patients reported attend the Sheffield Ataxia Centre on a regular basis and had undergone extensive investigations, including genetic testing using next-generation sequencing, with other causes of ataxia excluded. The diagnosis of PACA was strongly suspected based on investigations, pattern of disease progression, and cerebellar involvement. Patients were treated with mycophenolate and monitored using MR spectroscopy of the cerebellar vermis. Thirty patients with PACA are reported here. Of these, 22 received mycophenolate (group 1). The remaining 8 were not on treatment (group 2-control group). Out of the 22 treated patients, 4 underwent serial MR spectroscopy prior to starting treatment and thus were used as controls making the total number of patients in the control group 12. The mean change of the MRS within the vermis (NAA/Cr area ratio) in the treatment group was + 0.144 ± 0.09 (improved) and in the untreated group − 0.155 ± 0.06 (deteriorated). The difference was significant. We also demonstrated a strong correlation between the spectroscopy and the SARA score. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of mycophenolate in the treatment of PACA. The results suggest that immune-mediated ataxias are potentially treatable, and that there is a need for early diagnosis to prevent permanent neurological deficit. The recently published diagnostic criteria for PACA would hopefully aid the diagnosis and treatment of this entity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Acoustic Speech Analytics Are Predictive of Cerebellar Dysfunction in Multiple Sclerosis</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Speech production relies on motor control and cognitive processing and is linked to cerebellar function. In diseases where the cerebellum is impaired, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), speech abnormalities are common and can be detected by instrumental assessments. However, the potential of speech assessments to be used to monitor cerebellar impairment in MS remains unexplored. The aim of this study is to build an objectively measured speech score that reflects cerebellar function, pathology and quality of life in MS. Eighty-five people with MS and 21 controls participated in the study. Speech was independently assessed through objective acoustic analysis and blind expert listener ratings. Cerebellar function and overall disease disability were measured through validated clinical scores; cerebellar pathology was assessed via magnetic resonance imaging, and validated questionnaires informed quality of life. Selected speech variables were entered in a regression model to predict cerebellar function. The resulting model was condensed into one composite speech score and tested for prediction of abnormal 9-hole peg test (9HPT), and for correlations with the remaining cerebellar scores, imaging measurements and self-assessed quality of life. Slow rate of syllable repetition and increased free speech pause percentage were the strongest predictors of cerebellar impairment, complemented by phonatory instability. Those variables formed the acoustic composite score that accounted for 54% of variation in cerebellar function, correlated with cerebellar white matter volume (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.3, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p =&lt;/em&gt; 0.017), quality of life (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.5, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and predicted an abnormal 9HPT with 85% accuracy. An objective multi-feature speech metric was highly representative of motor cerebellar impairment in MS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Trehalose in Machado-Joseph Disease: Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01150-6</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is relatively prevalent among the Yemenite Jewish subpopulation living in Israel. Currently, there is no treatment able to modify the disease progression. Trehalose is a disaccharide with protein-stabilizing and autophagy-enhancing properties. In animal models of MJD, trehalose showed reduction of cerebellar lesion size and improved motor function. This study was designed to be a proof-of-concept, phase 2 study lasting 6 to 12 months, to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of weekly IV administration of 15 g or 30 g 10% trehalose solution in 14 MJD patients. Primary endpoints were safety and tolerability, which were assessed by various clinical and laboratory tests. Secondary endpoints were changes in the Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) score, Neurological Examination Score for Spinocerebellar Ataxia (NESSCA), time to do 9-hole peg test (9HPT), time to do 8-meter walk (8MW), and quality of life assessed by the World Health Organization Quality-of-Life Questionnaire-BREF (WHOQoL-BREF). Trehalose was well tolerated, and no serious drug-related adverse events were noted. The average SARA score, NESSCA, and time to do 9HPT and 8MW and the WHOQoL-BREF for all patients remained stable at 6 months. Six patients received treatment for as long as 12 months and continued to remain stable on all the above tests. IV trehalose seems to be safe in humans and probably effective to stabilize neurological impairment in MJD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The Cerebellum: EMG Rectification Is Detrimental for Identifying Abnormalities in Corticomuscular and Intermuscular Coherence in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 2</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Corticomuscular and intermuscular coherence (CMC, IMC) reflect connectivity between neuronal activity in the motor cortex measured by electroencephalography (EEG) and muscular activity measured by electromyography (EMG), or between activity in different muscles, respectively. There is an ongoing debate on the appropriateness of EMG rectification prior to coherence estimation. This work examines the effects of EMG rectification in CMC and IMC estimation in 20 spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) patients, 16 prodromal SCA2 gene mutation carriers, and 26 healthy controls during a repetitive upper or lower limb motor task. Coherence estimations were performed using the non-rectified raw EMG signal vs. the rectified EMG signal. EMG rectification decreases the level of significance of lower beta-frequency band CMC and IMC values in SCA2 patients and prodromal SCA2 mutation carriers vs. healthy controls, and also results in overall lower coherence values. EMG rectification is detrimental for beta-frequency band CMC and IMC estimation. One likely reason for this effect is distortion of coherence estimation in high-frequency signals, where the level of amplitude cancelation is high.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The cerebellum plays a critical role in promoting learning of new motor tasks, which is an essential function for motor recovery. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the cerebellum can be used to enhance learning. In this study, we investigated the effects of cerebellar intermittent theta burst stimulation (c-iTBS), a high-frequency rTMS protocol, on visuo-motor learning in a sample of hemiparetic patients due to recent stroke in the territory of the contralateral middle cerebral artery. Eight stroke patients were enrolled for the purposes of the study in the chronic stage of recovery (i.e., at least 6 months after stroke). In two sessions, Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with real or sham c-iTBS applied over the cerebellar hemisphere ipsilateral to the affected body side. c-iTBS was applied immediately before the learning phase of a visuo-motor adaptation task. Real, but not sham, c-iTBS improved visuo-motor learning as revealed by an increased performance in of the learning phase of the visuo-moto adaptation task. Moreover, we also found that real but not sham c-iTBS induced a sustained improvement in the re-adaptation of the recently learned skill (i.e., when patients were re-tested after 30 min). Taken together, these data point to c-iTBS as a potential novel strategy to promote motor learning in patients with stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

In order to determine the diagnostic yield of Array-CGH in such conditions, all the tests performed in the last 10-year activity of a single referral center in children who present, besides the neurodevelopmental impairment, cerebellar abnormalities have been systematically gathered. The study demonstrates that, except for Dandy-Walker malformation or poly-malformative phenotypes, chromosomal microarray analysis should be discouraged as first-line diagnostic test in pediatric ataxias with neurodevelopmental disability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We sought to assess structural and functional patterns of cerebellum in multiple system atrophy (cerebellar type), and investigate the associations of structural and functional cerebellar gray matter abnormalities. We collected magnetic resonance imaging data of 18 patients with multiple system atrophy (cerebellar type) and 18 health control subjects. The gray matter loss across the motor and cognitive cerebellar territories in patients was assessed using voxel-based morphometry. And change in the connectivity between the cerebellum and large-scale cortical networks was assessed using resting-state functional MRI analysis. Furthermore, we assessed the relationship between the extent of cerebellar atrophy and reduced-activation in the cerebellar-cortical and subthalamo-cerebellar functional connectivities. We confirmed the gray matter loss across the motor and cognitive cerebellar territories in patients and found that the extent of cerebellar atrophy was correlated with decreased connectivity between the cerebellum and large-scale cortical networks, including the default, frontal parietal, and sensorimotor networks. The volume reduction in the motor cerebellum was closely associated with the clinical motor severity. A post hoc analysis showed reduced-activation in the subthalamo-cerebellar functional connectivity without the subthalamic nucleus atrophy. These results emphasized significant atrophy in the cerebellar subsystem and its association with the large-scale cortical networks in multiple system atrophy (cerebellar type), which may improve our understanding of the neural pathophysiology mechanisms of disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cerebellar volume, in particular vermal lobule areas VI–VII, have been extensively researched in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), although findings are often unclear. The aim of the present study is to consolidate all existing cerebellar and age data of individuals with ASD, and compare this data to typically developing (TD) controls. Raw data, or the means and standard deviations of cerebellar volume and age, were obtained from 17 studies (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cerebellum&lt;/sub&gt;: 421 ASD and 370 TD participants; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;VI–VII&lt;/sub&gt;: 506 ASD and 290 TD participants). Total cerebellar volume, or VI–VII area, was plotted against age and lines of fit of ASD and TD data were compared. Mean differences in cerebellar volume and VI–VII area between participants with ASD and TD participants were then compared via ANCOVA analyses. Findings revealed multiple differences in VI–VII area between participants with ASD and TD participants below 18 years of age. Additionally, cerebellar volume was greater in males with ASD than TD males between 2 and 4 years. In the present study, cerebellar volume and VI–VII area show different rates of change across age for those with autism compared with those without. These morphological differences provide a neurobiological justification to investigate related behavioural correlates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (CGNPs) give rise to the cerebellar granule neurons in the developing cerebellum. Generation of large number of these neurons is made possible by the high proliferation rate of CGNPs in the external granule layer (EGL) in the dorsal cerebellum. Here, we show that upregulation of β-catenin can maintain murine CGNPs in a state of proliferation. Further, we show that β-catenin mRNA and protein levels can be regulated by the mitogen Sonic hedgehog (Shh). Shh signaling led to an increase in the level of the transcription factor N-myc. N-myc was found to bind the β-catenin promoter, and the increase in β-catenin mRNA and protein levels could be prevented by blocking N-myc upregulation downstream of Shh signaling. Furthermore, blocking Wingless-type MMTV integration site (Wnt) signaling by Wnt signaling pathway inhibitor Dickkopf 1 (Dkk-1) in the presence of Shh did not prevent the upregulation of β-catenin. We propose that in culture, Shh signaling regulates β-catenin expression through N-myc and results in increased CGNP proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) represents one of the main forms of dementia that afflicts our society. The expression of several genes has been associated with disease development. Despite this, the number of genes known to be capable of discriminating between AD patients according to sex remains deficient. In our study, we performed a transcriptomes meta-analysis on a large court of brains of healthy control subjects (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 2139) (NDHC) and brains of AD patients (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 1170). Our aim was to verify the brain expression levels of CHI3L2 and its correlation with genes associated with microglia-mediated neuroinflammation (IBA1), alteration of the blood–brain barrier (PECAM1), and neuronal damage (CALB1). We showed that the CHI3L2, IBA1, PECAM1, and CALB1 expression levels were modulated in the brains of patients with AD compared to NDHC subjects. Furthermore, both in NDHC and in AD patient’s brains, the CHI3L2 expression levels were directly correlated with IBA1 and PECAM1 and inversely with CALB1. Additionally, the expression levels of CHI3L2, PECAM1, and CALB1 but not of IBA1 were sex-depended. By stratifying the samples according to age and sex, correlation differences emerged between the expression levels of CHI3L2, IBA1, PECAM1, and CALB1 and the age of NDHC subjects and AD patients. CHI3L2 represents a promising gene potentially involved in the key processes underlying Alzheimer’s disease. Its expression in the brains of sex-conditioned AD patients opens up new possible sex therapeutic strategies aimed at controlling imbalance in disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To explore plasma protein panels as potential biomarkers to screen for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) among elderly Chinese individuals with different educational backgrounds. Forty-four illiterate, 36 lower education (1–6 years), and 55 higher education (7 years or more) elderly individuals were included in the present study. Among all subjects, 67 were healthy individuals and 68 were diagnosed with MCI. Fifty plasma proteins in blood samples collected from these subjects were analyzed via the Luminex assay. Binary logistic regression was utilized to explore diagnostic models for MCI among the three educational subgroups. Then, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were conducted for the clinical validity of the MCI models. Among the analyzed proteins, clusterin was used in the model of MCI among the total sample with a sensitivity (se) of 67.6%, a specificity (sp) of 59.7%, and a classification rate of 63.68%. The MCI model for the illiterate group included cystatin C, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and apolipoprotein A-I (se: 71.4%, sp.: 82.6%, accuracy: 77.25%). The sensitivity, specificity, and classification rate of the diagnostic model of MCI in elderly adults with lower education (human serum albumin) were each 75.0%. Additionally, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy rate of the diagnostic model for MCI elderly individuals with higher education (alpha-acid glycoprotein + soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 + pancreatic polypeptide) were 77.8%, 89.3%, and 83.60%, respectively. The performance of diagnostic models for MCI based on different educational levels is superior to that of diagnostic models for MCI without grouping by educational level.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Downregulation of Cancer-Associated lncRNAs in Peripheral Blood of Multiple Sclerosis Patients</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Recent studies have shown contribution of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the pathogenesis of immune-related disorders including multiple sclerosis (MS). Based on the role of these transcripts in the regulation of immune response, peripheral levels of lncRNAs can reflect the level of immune activation. In the present study, we quantified expression of four lncRNAs namely &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SPRY4-IT1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;HOXA-AS2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LINC-ROR&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;MEG3&lt;/em&gt; in venous blood of MS patients and controls using quantitative real-time PCR method. Relative expressions of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SPRY4-IT1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;HOXA-AS2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LINC-ROR&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;MEG3&lt;/em&gt; were significantly lower in female MS patients compared with female healthy subjects. For &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;MEG3&lt;/em&gt;, this pattern of expression was also observed in male subjects. However, for other lncRNAs, no significant difference was detected between male patients and male controls. Expression of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;HOXA-AS2&lt;/em&gt; was correlated with progression index (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.36, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Besides, there was a significant correlation between expression of this lncRNA and expression of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LINC-ROR&lt;/em&gt; in MS patients (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.44, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). There was no other correlation between expression of lncRNAs and clinical data in MS patients. In control group, expressions of none of lncRNAs were correlated with age of persons. Notably, significant correlations were demonstrated between expression levels of all lncRNAs in healthy subjects with &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; values ranging from 0.23 to 0.42. The current investigation shows dysregulation of lncRNAs in MS patients in a sex-specific manner and warrants further studies to unravel the clinical and therapeutic implications of such dysregulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most serious brain tumor and shows a high rate of drug resistance. Wnt signaling is a very important pathway in GBM that can activate/inhibit other pathways, such as apoptosis and autophagy. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of a combination of temozolomide (TMZ) plus curcumin or nanomicellar-curcumin on the inhibition of GBM growth in vitro, via effects on autophagy, apoptosis, and the Wnt signaling pathway. Two concentrations of curcumin and nanomicellar-curcumin (i.e., 20 μM and 50 μM) alone, and in combination with TMZ (50 μM) were used to induce cytotoxicity in the U87 GBM cell line. Wnt signaling–, autophagy-, and apoptosis-related genes were assessed by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blots. All treatments (except 20 μM curcumin alone) significantly decreased the viability of U87 cells compared to controls. Curcumin (50 μM), nanomicellar-curcumin alone and in combination with TMZ significantly decreased the invasion and migration of U87 cells. Autophagy-related proteins (Beclin 1, LC3-I, LC3-II) were significantly increased. Apoptosis-related proteins (Bcl-2 and caspase 8) were also significantly increased, while Bax protein was significantly decreased. The expression levels of Wnt pathway–associated genes (β-catenin, cyclin D1, Twist, and ZEB1) were significantly reduced.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Serine Incorporator 2 (SERINC2) Expression Predicts an Unfavorable Prognosis of Low-Grade Glioma (LGG): Evidence from Bioinformatics Analysis</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Serine Incorporator 2 (SERINC2) is a transmembrane protein that incorporates serine into membrane lipids. The function of SERINC2 in tumors has been reported, but the role of SERINC2 in gliomas is not fully understood. RNA-sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (530 cases of low-grade glioma (LGG) and 173 cases of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)) and microarray data from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (Accession No. GSE16011, 284 cases gliomas were included) were acquired. Bioinformatics analysis was performed as the primary method to examine the function of SERINC2 and its correlated genes in glioma. SERINC2 was highly expressed in GBM compared with LGG and normal brain tissues. Elevated SERINC2 expression predicted shorter 5-, 10-, and 15-year overall survival (OS) of LGG patients and isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH-1) mutation-type LGG patients but had no effect on the OS of GBM patients. Cox regression analysis showed that SERINC2 was an independent factor in LGG OS. Methylation analysis found that 13 CpG methylation sites (methylation450k) correlated with SERINC2 expression in LGG. The mRNA expression level of SERINC2 was significant lower in the DNA deletion group than in the intact and amplification groups. A total of 390 copositive and 244 conegative correlation genes with SERINC2 were obtained from LGG in TCGA-LGG and GSE16011. Gene ontology (GO) category and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses showed that the copositive correlation genes were primarily enriched in the mitotic process and cell cycle. Combining the results from the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of SERINC2 correlation genes and CytoHubba led to the selection of 10 hub genes (CDC20, FN1, AURKB, AURKA, KIF2C, BIRC5, CCNB2, UBE2C, CCNA2, and CENPE). OncoLnc analysis confirmed that high expression levels of these hub genes were associated with poor OS in LGG. Our results suggested that aberrant SERINC2 expression existed in glioma and that its expression might be a potential prognostic marker in LGG patients. CDC20, FN1, AURKB, AURKA, KIF2C, BIRC5, CCNB2, UBE2C, CCNA2, and CENPE may be potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for LGG.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: MicroRNA-330 Directs Downregulation of the GABA B R2 in the Pathogenesis of Pancreatic Cancer Pain</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive and deadly malignancies with a very poor prognosis. Pancreatic cancer-induced visceral pain is very common and is generally presented among the initial symptoms in patients; such pain is strongly associated with poor quality of life, impaired functional activity, and decreased survival. However, the principal neurobiological mechanisms of pain caused by pancreatic cancer have not been fully elucidated. Accumulating studies have shown that miRNAs play a major role in chronic pain by suppressing key molecules involved in nociception. In the present study, we report that microRNA (miR)-330 is highly expressed in the spinal dorsal horn (SDH) of nude mice with pancreatic cancer pain. Mimicking pancreatic carcinoma-induced SDH miR-330 upregulation by microinjection of miR-330 mimic into the SDH significantly induced abdominal mechanical allodynia in normal nude mice. Additionally, we found that the expression of GABA&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R2 was significantly decreased in the SDH of nude mice with pancreatic cancer pain and was regulated directly by miR-330 both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, inhibition of miR-330 rescued the expression of GABA&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R2 and alleviated pancreatic carcinoma-induced abdominal pain hypersensitivity in nude mice with pancreatic carcinoma. These results show that miR-330 participates in the genesis of pancreatic carcinoma-induced pain hypersensitivity by inhibiting GABA&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R2 expression in the SDH and might be a potential therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most prevalent representation of dementia, is a neurodegenerative disease resulting from the degenerative disturbance of the central nervous system. Previous studies have indicated that miR-107 is reduced in the brain neocortex of patients with AD; however, its underlying mechanism is not clear. Therefore, the objective of this study was to explore the question of whether miR-107 participates in AD development. The study confirmed that the miR-107 expression levels were dramatically decreased in patients with AD and in beta-amyloid (Aβ) (Aβ)-treated SH-SY5Y cells compared with control groups. Upregulation of miR-107 reversed the inhibitory role of Aβ on cell proliferation and viability. In addition, miR-107 upregulation also ameliorated the Aβ-induced inflammation and apoptosis of SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, using bioinformatic prediction, dual-luciferase reporter assay (DLRA), quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and Western blot (WB), miR-107 was confirmed to reduce the expression level of FGF7, and it subsequently deactivated the FGFR2/PI3K/Akt pathway. Moreover, FGF7 overexpression counteracted the role of miR-107 in the viability, proliferation, inflammation, and apoptosis of Aβ-induced SH-SY5Y cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is the second most common type of dementia that accounts for 15 to 30%. To date, VCI still lacks an effective therapeutic strategy and an objective diagnostic tool. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that control gene expression at the post-translational level, playing an essential role in the pathogenesis of VCI. Moreover, accumulating evidence has indicated that miRNAs could be used as therapeutic strategies and diagnostic biomarkers of diseases. In this review, we summarize various mechanisms of miRNA-based therapeutics and candidate miRNAs for clinical diagnosis in VCI. Results showed that miRNAs participate in VCI via different mechanisms, including neuronal death, inflammation, oxidative stress, blood-brain barrier permeability, and synaptic translation. Circulating miRNAs of VCI have been detected in serum, plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid with various diagnostic power. Taking together, miRNAs are a potential biomarker for being a therapeutic agent and a diagnostic tool of VCI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Mutations in the dystrophin gene could cause Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), which is the most common muscular disorder in pediatrics. Considering the growing evidence on appropriateness of gene therapies for DMD, precise genetic diagnosis seems essential. Hence, we conducted a study to determine mutational patterns in Iranian children with DMD. To detect all probable large mutations in the dystrophin gene, 314 DMD patients were evaluated using the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Subjects who were MLPA-negative underwent the next generation sequencing (NGS) to identify potential point mutations. MLPA detected deletions (79.93%) and duplications (5.41%) along the dystrophin gene of 268 patients. Distribution of large mutations was heterogeneous and followed hotspot pattern throughout the gene. From 46 patients who were MLPA-negative, 43 exhibited point mutations including nonsense in 7.64%, frameshifts in 4.77%, splicing in 0.96%, and missense variations in 0.32% of participants. Most of the point mutations were located between exons 19 and 40. In three patients (1%), no mutation was found using either MLPA or NGS. Two subjects had novel nonsense mutations (L1675X and E1199X) in their dystrophin gene, which were considered as the possible reason for elimination of major domains of the gene. The results of this study provided invaluable information regarding the distribution of various large and small mutations in Iranian individuals with DMD. Besides, the novel nonsense mutations L1675X and E1199X were identified within the highly conserved residues, leading to elimination of significant domains of the dystrophin gene.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Glioma is the most common primary brain tumor in humans and the most deadly. Stem cells, which are characterized by therapeutic resistance and self-renewal, play a critical role in glioma, and therefore the identification of stem cell-related genes in glioma is important. In this study, we collected and evaluated the epigenetically regulated-mRNA expression-based stemness index (EREG-mRNAsi) of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, &lt;a class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot; href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/&quot;&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/&lt;/a&gt;) for glioma patient samples, corrected through tumor purity. After EREG-mRNAsi correction, glioma pathological grade and survival were analyzed. The differentially expressed gene (DEG) co-expression network was constructed by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) in TCGA glioma samples to find modules of interest and key genes. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway-enrichment analysis were performed to identify the function of significant genetic modules. Protein–protein interaction (PPI) and co-expression network analysis of key genes was performed for further analysis. In this experiment, we found that corrected EREG-mRNAsi was significantly up-regulated in glioma samples and increased with glioma grade, with G4 having the highest stemness index. Patients with higher corrected EREG-mRNAsi scores had worse overall survival. Fifty-one DEGs in the brown gene module were found to be positively related to EREG-mRNAsi via WGCNA. GO and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis showed that chromosome segregation and cell cycle molecular function were the major functions in key DEGs. Among these key DEGs, BUB1 showed high connectivity and co-expression, and also high connectivity in PPI. Fifty-one key genes were verified to play a critical role in glioma stem cells. These genes may serve as primary therapeutic targets to inhibit the activity of glioma stem cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Olfaction in most animals is mediated by neurons bearing cilia that are accessible to the environment. Olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) in chordates usually have multiple cilia, each with a centriole at its base. OSNs differentiate from stem cells in the olfactory epithelium, and how the epithelium generates cells with many centrioles is not yet understood. We show that centrioles are amplified via centriole rosette formation in both embryonic development and turnover of the olfactory epithelium in adult mice, and rosette-bearing cells often have free centrioles in addition. Cells with amplified centrioles can go on to divide, with centrioles clustered at each pole. Additionally, we found that centrioles are amplified in immediate neuronal precursors (INPs) concomitant with elevation of mRNA for polo-like kinase 4 (Plk4) and SCL/Tal1-interrupting locus gene (Stil), key regulators of centriole duplication. These results support a model in which centriole amplification occurs during a transient state characterized by elevated Plk4 and Stil in early INP cells. These cells then go on to divide at least once to become OSNs, demonstrating that cell division with amplified centrioles, known to be tolerated in disease states, can occur as part of a normal developmental program.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/3ahmJn3nuIU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hyperparameter optimisation is a crucial process in searching the optimal
machine learning model. The efficiency of finding the optimal hyperparameter
settings has been a big concern in recent researches since the optimisation
process could be time-consuming, especially when the objective functions are
highly expensive to evaluate. In this paper, we introduce an intelligent
evolutionary optimisation algorithm which applies machine learning technique to
the traditional evolutionary algorithm to accelerate the overall optimisation
process of tuning machine learning models in classification problems. We
demonstrate our Intelligent Evolutionary Optimisation (IEO)in a series of
controlled experiments, comparing with traditional evolutionary optimisation in
hyperparameter tuning. The empirical study shows that our approach accelerates
the optimisation speed by 30.40% on average and up to 77.06% in the best
scenarios.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many deep neural networks are built by using stacked convolutional layers of
fixed and single size (often 3$\times$3) kernels. This paper describes a method
for training the size of convolutional kernels to provide varying size kernels
in a single layer. The method utilizes a differentiable, and therefore
backpropagation-trainable Gaussian envelope which can grow or shrink in a base
grid. Our experiments compared the proposed adaptive layers to ordinary
convolution layers in a simple two-layer network, a deeper residual network,
and a U-Net architecture. The results in the popular image classification
datasets such as MNIST, MNIST-CLUTTERED, CIFAR-10, Fashion, and ``Faces in the
Wild'' showed that the adaptive kernels can provide statistically significant
improvements on ordinary convolution kernels. A segmentation experiment in the
Oxford-Pets dataset demonstrated that replacing a single ordinary convolution
layer in a U-shaped network with a single 7$\times$7 adaptive layer can improve
its learning performance and ability to generalize.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;State-of-the-art Neural Network Architectures (NNAs) are challenging to
design and implement efficiently in hardware. In the past couple of years, this
has led to an explosion in research and development of automatic Neural
Architecture Search (NAS) tools. AutomML tools are now used to achieve state of
the art NNA designs and attempt to optimize for hardware usage and design. Much
of the recent research in the auto-design of NNAs has focused on convolution
networks and image recognition, ignoring the fact that a significant part of
the workload in data centers is general-purpose deep neural networks. In this
work, we develop and test a general multilayer perceptron (MLP) flow that can
take arbitrary datasets as input and automatically produce optimized NNAs and
hardware designs. We test the flow on six benchmarks. Our results show we
exceed the performance of currently published MLP accuracy results and are
competitive with non-MLP based results. We compare general and common GPU
architectures with our scalable FPGA design and show we can achieve higher
efficiency and higher throughput (outputs per second) for the majority of

high performing hardware shows the power of co-design by correlating accuracy

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06118</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cortical circuits are characterized by exquisitely complex connectivity
patterns that emerge during development from undifferentiated networks. The
development of these circuits is governed by a combination of precise molecular
cues that dictate neuronal identity and location along with activity dependent
mechanisms that help establish, refine, and maintain neuronal connectivity.
Here we ask whether simple plasticity mechanisms can lead to assembling a
cortical microcircuit with canonical inter-laminar connectivity, starting from
a network with all-to-all connectivity. The target canonical microcircuit is
based on the pattern of connections between cortical layers typically found in
multiple cortical areas in rodents, cats and monkeys. We use a computational
model as a proof-of-principle to demonstrate that classical and reverse
spike-timing dependent plasticity rules lead to a formation of networks that
resemble canonical microcircuits. The model converges to biologically
reasonable solutions provided that there is a balance between potentiation and
depression and enhanced inputs to layer 4, only for a small combination of
plasticity rules. The model makes specific testable predictions about the
learning computations operant across cortical layers and their dynamic
deployment during development.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06037</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Learning ensembles can substantially improve the generalization performance
of low-bias high-variance estimators such as deep decision trees and deep nets.
Improvements have also been found when Genetic Programming (GP) is used to
learn the estimators. Yet, the best way to learn ensembles in GP remains to be
determined, especially considering that the population of GP can be exploited
to learn ensemble members simultaneously. Some existing works lack any
exploitation of the population, i.e., they evolve each ensemble member
separately, thus resulting simple but expensive. Other works achieve
simultaneous ensemble learning by means of rather involved mechanisms, thus
being efficient but also potentially hard to adopt in practice (e.g., due to
the interplay of several hyper-parameters). This work attempts to fill the gap
between existing works by proposing a new GP algorithm that is both simple but
performant, named Simple Simultaneous Ensemble Genetic Programming (2SEGP).
2SEGP is obtained by minor modifications to fitness evaluation and selection of
a classic GP algorithm, and its only drawback is an (arguably small) increase
of the fitness evaluation cost from the classic $\mathcal{O}(n \ell)$ to
$\mathcal{O}(n(\ell + \beta))$, with $n$ the number of observations and
$\ell$/$\beta$ the estimator/ensemble size. Experimental comparisons on 9
datasets between supervised classification and regression show that, despite
its simplicity, 2SEGP fares very competitively with state-of-the-art (ensemble
and not) GP algorithms. Because our algorithm is simple, efficient and
effective, we believe it can be of interest for the community as well as for
practitioners.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Constrained Optimization solution algorithms are restricted to point based

wherein both the objective function and constraints can be non-convex resulting

fronts. Local or global convexification is a common workaround when faced with
non-convex forms. However, such an approach is often restricted to a strict
class of functions, deviation from which results in sub-optimal solution to the
original problem. We present neural solutions for extracting optimal sets as
approximate manifolds, where unmodified, non-convex objectives and constraints
are defined as modeler guided, domain-informed $L_2$ loss function. This
promotes interpretability since modelers can confirm the results against known
analytical forms in their specific domains. We present synthetic and realistic
cases to validate our approach and compare against known solvers for

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;With the unprecedented demand for location-based services in indoor
scenarios, wireless indoor localization has become essential for mobile users.
While GPS is not available at indoor spaces, WiFi RSS fingerprinting has become
popular with its ubiquitous accessibility. However, it is challenging to
achieve robust and efficient indoor localization with two major challenges.
First, the localization accuracy can be degraded by the random signal
fluctuations, which would influence conventional localization algorithms that
simply learn handcrafted features from raw fingerprint data. Second, mobile
users are sensitive to the localization delay, but conventional indoor
localization algorithms are computation-intensive and time-consuming. In this
paper, we propose EdgeLoc, an edge-IoT framework for efficient and robust
indoor localization using capsule networks. We develop a deep learning model
with the CapsNet to efficiently extract hierarchical information from WiFi
fingerprint data, thereby significantly improving the localization accuracy.
Moreover, we implement an edge-computing prototype system to achieve a nearly
real-time localization process, by enabling mobile users with the deep-learning
model that has been well-trained by the edge server. We conduct a real-world
field experimental study with over 33,600 data points and an extensive
synthetic experiment with the open dataset, and the experimental results
validate the effectiveness of EdgeLoc. The best trade-off of the EdgeLoc system
achieves 98.5% localization accuracy within an average positioning time of only

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Backpropagation algorithms on recurrent artificial neural networks require an

so-called reservoirs require either extensive fine-tuning or neuroplasticity
with unsupervised learning rules. We propose a new local plasticity rule named
P-CRITICAL designed for automatic reservoir tuning that translates well to
Intel's Loihi research chip, a recent neuromorphic processor. We compare our
approach on well-known datasets from the machine learning community while using
a spiking neuronal architecture. We observe an improved performance on tasks
coming from various modalities without the need to tune parameters. Such
algorithms could be a key to end-to-end energy-efficient neuromorphic-based

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.12515</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In deep learning, it is usually assumed that the shape of the loss surface is
fixed. Differently, a novel concept of deformation operator is first proposed
in this paper to deform the loss surface, thereby improving the optimization.
Deformation function, as a type of deformation operator, can improve the
generalization performance. Moreover, various deformation functions are
designed, and their contributions to the loss surface are further provided.
Then, the original stochastic gradient descent optimizer is theoretically
proved to be a flat minima filter that owns the talent to filter out the sharp
minima. Furthermore, the flatter minima could be obtained by exploiting the
proposed deformation functions, which is verified on CIFAR-100, with
visualizations of loss landscapes near the critical points obtained by both the
original optimizer and optimizer enhanced by deformation functions. The
experimental results show that deformation functions do find flatter regions.
Moreover, on ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, popular convolutional neural
networks enhanced by deformation functions are compared with the corresponding
original models, where significant improvements are observed on all of the
involved models equipped with deformation functions. For example, the top-1
test accuracy of ResNet-20 on CIFAR-100 increases by 1.46%, with insignificant
additional computational overhead.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Liquid Time-constant Networks. (arXiv:2006.04439v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04439</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We introduce a new class of time-continuous recurrent neural network models.
Instead of declaring a learning system's dynamics by implicit nonlinearities,
we construct networks of linear first-order dynamical systems modulated via
nonlinear interlinked gates. The resulting models represent dynamical systems
with varying (i.e., \emph{liquid}) time-constants coupled to their hidden
state, with outputs being computed by numerical differential equation solvers.
These neural networks exhibit stable and bounded behavior, yield superior
expressivity within the family of neural ordinary differential equations, and
give rise to improved performance on time-series prediction tasks. To
demonstrate these properties, we first take a theoretical approach to find
bounds over their dynamics, and compute their expressive power by the
\emph{trajectory length} measure in a latent trajectory space. We then conduct
a series of time-series prediction experiments to manifest the approximation
capability of Liquid Time-Constant Networks (LTCs) compared to modern RNNs.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09203</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We present a novel modular object detection convolutional neural network that
significantly improves the accuracy of object detection. The network consists
of two stages in a hierarchical structure. The first stage is a network that
detects general classes. The second stage consists of separate networks to
refine the classification and localization of each of the general classes
objects. Compared to a state of the art object detection networks the
classification error in the modular network is improved by approximately 3-5
times, from 12% to 2.5 %-4.5%. This network is easy to implement and has a 0.94
mAP. The network architecture can be a platform to improve the accuracy of
widespread state of the art object detection networks and other kinds of deep
learning networks. We show that a deep learning network initialized by transfer
learning becomes more accurate as the number of classes it later trained to
detect becomes smaller.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Multi-Objective Evolutionary Design of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Classification. (arXiv:1912.01369v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01369</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Early advancements in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architectures are
primarily driven by human expertise and by elaborate design processes.
Recently, neural architecture search was proposed with the aim of automating
the network design process and generating task-dependent architectures. While
existing approaches have achieved competitive performance in image
classification, they are not well suited to problems where the computational
budget is limited for two reasons: (1) the obtained architectures are either
solely optimized for classification performance, or only for one deployment
scenario; (2) the search process requires vast computational resources in most
approaches. To overcome these limitations, we propose an evolutionary algorithm
for searching neural architectures under multiple objectives, such as
classification performance and floating-point operations (FLOPs). The proposed
method addresses the first shortcoming by populating a set of architectures to
approximate the entire Pareto frontier through genetic operations that
recombine and modify architectural components progressively. Our approach
improves computational efficiency by carefully down-scaling the architectures
during the search as well as reinforcing the patterns commonly shared among
past successful architectures through Bayesian model learning. The integration
of these two main contributions allows an efficient design of architectures
that are competitive and in most cases outperform both manually and
automatically designed architectures on benchmark image classification
datasets: CIFAR, ImageNet, and human chest X-ray. The flexibility provided from
simultaneously obtaining multiple architecture choices for different compute
requirements further differentiates our approach from other methods in the
literature. Code is available at https://github.com/mikelzc1990/nsganetv1

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Built to Last: Functional and structural mechanisms in the moth olfactory network mitigate effects of neural injury. (arXiv:1808.01279v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01279</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Most organisms suffer neuronal damage throughout their lives, which can
impair performance of core behaviors. Their neural circuits need to maintain
function despite injury, which in particular requires preserving key system
outputs. In this work, we explore whether and how certain structural and
functional neuronal network motifs act as injury mitigation mechanisms.
Specifically, we examine how (i) Hebbian learning, (ii) high levels of noise,
and (iii) parallel inhibitory and excitatory connections contribute to the
robustness of the olfactory system in the Manduca sexta moth. We simulate
injuries on a detailed computational model of the moth olfactory network
calibrated to in vivo data. The injuries are modeled on focal axonal swellings,
a ubiquitous form of axonal pathology observed in traumatic brain injuries and
other brain disorders. Axonal swellings effectively compromise spike train
propagation along the axon, reducing the effective neural firing rate delivered
to downstream neurons. All three of the network motifs examined significantly
mitigate the effects of injury on readout neurons, either by reducing injury's
impact on readout neuron responses or by restoring these responses to
pre-injury levels. These motifs may thus be partially explained by their value
as adaptive mechanisms to minimize the functional effects of neural injury.
More generally, robustness to injury is a vital design principle to consider
when analyzing neural systems.

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Mechanism of Zinc Excitotoxicity: A Focus on AMPK</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.577958</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Over the last 20 years, it has been shown that complex signaling cascades are involved in zinc excitotoxicity. Free zinc rapidly induces PKC activation, which causes reactive oxygen species (ROS) production at least in part through NADPH oxidase. It also promotes neuronal nitric oxide synthase, thereby increasing nitric oxide (NO) production. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation and Egr-1 transcription factor activity were quickly induced by zinc, too. These concurrent actions of kinases consequently produce oxygen free radical, ROS, and NO, which may cause severe DNA damage. Following the excessive activity of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 depletes NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/ATP in the cells. Zinc excitotoxicity exhibits distinct characteristics of apoptosis, too. Activation of caspase-3 is induced by liver kinase B1 (LKB1)-AMP-activated kinase (AMPK)-Bim cascade signaling and induction of p75NTR receptors and p75NTR-associated Death Executor. Thus, zinc excitotoxicity is a mechanism of neuronal cell death showing various cell death patterns. In addition to the above signaling cascades, individual intracellular organelles also play a crucial role in zinc excitotoxicity. Mitochondria and lysosomes function as zinc reservoirs, and as such, are capable of regulating zinc concentration in the cytoplasm. However, when loaded with too much zinc, they may undergo mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening, and lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP), both of which are well-established mechanisms of cell death. Since zinc excitotoxicity has been reported to be associated with acute brain injuries, including stroke, trauma, and epilepsy, we performed to find the novel AMPK inhibitors as therapeutic agents for these diseases. Since we thought acute brain injury has complicated neuronal death pathways, we tried to see the neuroprotection against zinc excitotoxicity, calcium-overload excitotoxicity, oxidative damage, and apoptosis. We found that two chemicals showed significant neuroprotection against all cellular neurotoxic models we tested. Finally, we observed the reduction of infarct volume in a rat model of brain injury after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). In this review, we introduced the AMPK-mediated cell death mechanism and novel strategy for the development of stroke therapeutics. The hope is that this understanding would provide a rationale for acute brain injury and eventually find new therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: The Role of Autophagy in Manganese-Induced Neurotoxicity</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.574750</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Manganese (Mn), an essential micronutrient, acts as a cofactor for multiple enzymes. Epidemiological investigations have shown that an excessive level of Mn is an important environmental factor involved in neurotoxicity. Frequent pollution of air and water by Mn is a serious threat to the health of the population. Overexposure to Mn is particularly detrimental to the central nervous system, leading to symptoms similar to several neurological disorders. Many different mechanisms have been implicated in Mn-induced neurotoxicity, including oxidative/nitrosative stress, toxic protein aggregation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, dysregulation of autophagy, and the apoptotic cascade, which together promote the progressive neurodegeneration of nerve cells. As a compensatory regulatory mechanism, autophagy plays dual roles in various biological activities under pathological stress conditions. Dysregulation of autophagy is involved in the development of neurodegenerative disorders, with recent emerging evidence indicating a strong, complex relationship between autophagy and Mn-induced neurotoxicity. This review discusses the connection between autophagy and Mn-induced neurotoxicity, especially alpha-synuclein oligomerization, ER stress, and aberrated protein S-nitrosylation, which will provide new insights to profoundly explore the precise mechanisms of Mn-induced neurotoxicity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Cold Exposure After Exercise Impedes the Neuroprotective Effects of Exercise on Thermoregulation and UCP4 Expression in an MPTP-Induced Parkinsonian Mouse Model</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.573509</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Moderate exercise and mild hypothermia have protective effects against brain injury and neurodegeneration. Running in a cold environment alters exercise-induced hyperthermia and outcomes; however, evaluations of post-exercise cold exposure related to exercise benefits for the brain are relatively rare. We investigated the effects of 4°C cold exposure after exercise on exercise-induced thermal responses and neuroprotection in an MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine)-induced Parkinsonian mouse model. Male C57BL/6J mice were pretreated with MPTP for five consecutive days and follow-up treadmill exercise for 4 weeks. After 1-h running at a 22°C temperature, the mice were exposed to a 4°C environment for 2 h. An MPTP injection induced a transient drop in body and brain temperatures, while mild brain hypothermia was found to last for 4 weeks after MPTP treatment. Preventing brain hypothermia by exercise or 4°C exposure was associated with an improvement in MPTP-induced striatal uncoupling protein 4 (UCP4) downregulation and nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration. However, 4°C exposure after exercise abrogated the exercise-induced beneficial effects and thermal responses in MPTP-treated mice, including a low amplitude of exercise-induced brain hyperthermia and body temperature while at rest after exercise. Our findings elucidate that post-exercise thermoregulation and UCP4 expression are important in the neuroprotective effects of exercise against MPTP toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Susceptibility and Volume Measures of the Mammillary Bodies Between Mild Cognitively Impaired Patients and Healthy Controls</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.572595</link>
	<content:encoded>Purpose&lt;p&gt;To investigate the baseline values and differences for susceptibility and volume of the mammillary bodies between mild cognitively impaired (MCI) patients and healthy controls (HCs), and further explore their differences in relation to gender, MCI subtypes and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotypes.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;T1-weighted and multi-echo gradient echo imaging sequences were acquired on a 3T MR scanner to evaluate the T1W based volume and susceptibility differences in the mammillary body for 47 MCI and 47 HCs. T-tests were performed to compare volume and susceptibility between groups, and right and left hemispheres. Correlation analysis was used to relate the volume and mean susceptibility as a function of age in MCI and HC groups separately, and to investigate the relationship of susceptibility with the neuro-psychological scales in the MCI group.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Susceptibility was found to be elevated within the right mammillary body in MCI patients compared to HCs (p &amp;lt; 0.05). There were no differences for the mammillary body volumes between the MCI and HC groups, although there was a reduction in volume with age for the MCI group (p = 0.007). Women showed decreased mammillary body volume compared to men in the HC group (p = 0.004). No significant differences were found in relation to MCI subtypes and APOE genotypes. No significant correlations were observed between mammillary body susceptibility with neuro-psychological scales.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This work provides a quantitative baseline for both the volume and susceptibility of the mammillary body which can be used for future studies of cognitive impairment patients underlying the pathology of the Papez circuit.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Neuroanatomical and Microglial Alterations in the Striatum of Levodopa-Treated, Dyskinetic Hemi-Parkinsonian Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.567222</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dyskinesia associated with chronic levodopa treatment in Parkinson’s disease is associated with maladaptive striatal plasticity. The objective of this study was to examine whether macroscale structural changes, as captured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) accompany this plasticity and to identify plausible cellular contributors in a rodent model of levodopa-induced dyskinesia. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were rendered hemi-parkinsonian by stereotaxic injection of 6-hydroxydopamine into the left medial forebrain bundle prior to chronic treatment with saline (control) or levodopa to induce abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs), reflective of dyskinesia. Perfusion-fixed brains underwent ex vivo structural MRI before sectioning and staining for cellular markers. Chronic treatment with levodopa induced significant AIMs (p &amp;lt; 0.0001 versus saline). The absolute volume of the ipsilateral, lesioned striatum was increased in levodopa-treated rats resulting in a significant difference in percentage volume change when compared to saline-treated rats (p &amp;lt; 0.01). Moreover, a significant positive correlation was found between this volume change and AIMs scores for individual levodopa-treated rats (r = 0.96; p &amp;lt; 0.01). The density of Iba1+ cells was increased within the lesioned versus intact striatum (p &amp;lt; 0.01) with no difference between treatment groups. Conversely, Iba1+ microglia soma size was significantly increased (p &amp;lt; 0.01) in the lesioned striatum of levodopa-treated but not saline-treated rats. Soma size was not, however, significantly correlated with either AIMs or MRI volume change. Although GFAP+ astrocytes were elevated in the lesioned versus intact striatum (p &amp;lt; 0.001), there was no difference between treatment groups. No statistically significant effects of either lesion or treatment on RECA1, a marker for blood vessels, were observed. Collectively, these data suggest chronic levodopa treatment in 6-hydroxydopamine lesioned rats is associated with increased striatal volume that correlates with the development of AIMs. The accompanying increase in number and size of microglia, however, cannot alone explain this volume expansion. Further multi-modal studies are warranted to establish the brain-wide effects of chronic levodopa treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Reproducibility of Glutamate, Glutathione, and GABA Measurements in vivo by Single-Voxel STEAM Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy at 7-Tesla in Healthy Individuals</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.566643</link>
	<content:encoded>Background and Purpose&lt;p&gt;Derangements in brain glutamate, glutathione, and γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) are implicated in a range of neurological disorders. Reliable methods to measure these compounds non-invasively in vivo are needed. We evaluated the reproducibility of their measurements in brain regions involved in the default mode network using quantitative MRS at 7-Tesla in healthy individuals.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Ten right-handed healthy volunteers underwent 7-Tesla MRI scans on 2 separate days, not more than 2 weeks apart. On each day two scanning sessions took place, with a re-positioning break in between. High-resolution isotropic anatomical scans were acquired prior to each scan, followed by single-voxel &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-MRS using the STEAM pulse sequence on an 8 mL midline cubic voxel, positioned over the posterior cingulate and precuneus regions. Concentrations were corrected for partial-volume effects.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Maximal Cramér-Rao lower bounds for glutamate, glutathione, and GABA were 2.0, 8.0, and 14.0%, respectively. Mean coefficients of variation within sessions were 5.9 ± 4.8%, 9.3 ± 7.6%, and 11.5 ± 8.8%, and between sessions were 4.6 ± 4.5%, 8.3 ± 5.7%, and 9.2 ± 8.7%, respectively. The mean (±SD) Dice’s coefficient for voxel overlap was 90 ± 4% within sessions and 86 ± 7% between sessions.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Glutamate, glutathione, and GABA can be reliably quantified using STEAM MRS at 7-Tesla from the posterior cingulate and precuneus cortices of healthy human subjects. STEAM MRS at 7-Tesla may be used to study the metabolic behavior of this important resting-state hub in various disease states.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Electrophysiological and Neuroimaging Studies – During Resting State and Sensory Stimulation in Disorders of Consciousness: A Review</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.555093</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A severe brain injury may lead to a disorder of consciousness (DOC) such as coma, vegetative state (VS), minimally conscious state (MCS) or locked-in syndrome (LIS). Till date, the diagnosis of DOC relies only on clinical evaluation or subjective scoring systems such as Glasgow coma scale, which fails to detect subtle changes and thereby results in diagnostic errors. The high rate of misdiagnosis and inability to predict the recovery of consciousness for DOC patients have created a huge research interest in the assessment of consciousness. Researchers have explored the use of various stimulation and neuroimaging techniques to improve the diagnosis. In this article, we present the important findings of resting-state as well as sensory stimulation methods and highlight the stimuli proven to be successful in the assessment of consciousness. Primarily, we review the literature based on (a) application/non-use of stimuli (i.e., sensory stimulation/resting state-based), (b) type of stimulation used (i.e., auditory, visual, tactile, olfactory, or mental-imagery), (c) electrophysiological signal used (EEG/ERP, fMRI, PET, EMG, SCL, or ECG). Among the sensory stimulation methods, auditory stimulation has been extensively used, since it is easier to conduct for these patients. Olfactory and tactile stimulation have been less explored and need further research. Emotionally charged stimuli such as subject’s own name or narratives in a familiar voice or subject’s own face/family pictures or music result in stronger responses than neutral stimuli. Studies based on resting state analysis have employed measures like complexity, power spectral features, entropy and functional connectivity patterns to distinguish between the VS and MCS patients. Resting-state EEG and fMRI are the state-of-the-art techniques and have a huge potential in predicting the recovery of coma patients. Further, EMG and mental-imagery based studies attempt to obtain volitional responses from the VS patients and thus could detect their command-following capability. This may provide an effective means to communicate with these patients. Recent studies have employed fMRI and PET to understand the brain-activation patterns corresponding to the mental imagery. This review promotes our knowledge about the techniques used for the diagnosis of patients with DOC and attempts to provide ideas for future research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Relationship Between Basic Properties of BOLD Fluctuations and Calculated Metrics of Complexity in the Human Connectome Project</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.550923</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) creates a rich four-dimensional data set that can be analyzed in a variety of ways. As more researchers come to view the brain as a complex dynamical system, tools are increasingly being drawn from other fields to characterize the complexity of the brain’s activity. However, given that the signal measured with rs-fMRI arises from the hemodynamic response to neural activity, the extent to which complexity metrics reflect neural complexity as compared to signal properties related to image quality remains unknown. To provide some insight into this question, correlation dimension, approximate entropy and Lyapunov exponent were calculated for different rs-fMRI scans from the same subject to examine their reliability. The metrics of complexity were then compared to several properties of the rs-fMRI signal from each brain area to determine if basic signal features could explain differences in the complexity metrics. Differences in complexity across brain areas were highly reliable and were closely linked to differences in the frequency profiles of the rs-fMRI signal. The spatial distributions of the complexity and frequency metrics suggest that they are both influenced by location-dependent signal properties that can obscure changes related to neural activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00900</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Increasingly, neuroimaging researchers are exploring the use of real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) as a way to access a participant’s ongoing brain function throughout a scan. This approach presents novel and exciting experimental applications ranging from monitoring data quality in real time, to delivering neurofeedback from a region of interest, to dynamically controlling experimental flow, or interfacing with remote devices. Yet, for those interested in adopting this method, the existing software options are few and limited in application. This presents a barrier for new users, as well as hinders existing users from refining techniques and methods. Here we introduce a free, open-source rt-fMRI package, the Pyneal toolkit, designed to address this limitation. The Pyneal toolkit is python-based software that offers a flexible and user friendly framework for rt-fMRI, is compatible with all three major scanner manufacturers (GE, Siemens, Phillips), and, critically, allows fully customized analysis pipelines. In this article, we provide a detailed overview of the architecture, describe how to set up and run the Pyneal toolkit during an experimental session, offer tutorials with scan data that demonstrate how data flows through the Pyneal toolkit with example analyses, and highlight the advantages that the Pyneal toolkit offers to the neuroimaging community.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Do Musicians Have Better Mnemonic and Executive Performance Than Actors? Influence of Regular Musical or Theater Practice in Adults and in the Elderly</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.557642</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The effects of musical practice on cognition are well established yet rarely compared with other kinds of artistic training or expertise. This study aims to compare the possible effect of musical and theater regular practice on cognition across the lifespan. Both of these artistic activities require many hours of individual or collective training in order to reach an advanced level. This process requires the interaction between higher-order cognitive functions and several sensory modalities (auditory, verbal, visual and motor), as well as regular learning of new pieces. This study included participants with musical or theater practice, and healthy controls matched for age (18–84 years old) and education. The objective was to determine whether specific practice in these activities had an effect on cognition across the lifespan, and a protective influence against undesirable cognitive outcomes associated with aging. All participants underwent a battery of cognitive tasks that evaluated processing speed, executive function, fluency, working memory, verbal and visual long-term memories, and non-verbal reasoning abilities. Results showed that music and theater artistic practices were strongly associated with cognitive enhancements. Participants with musical practice were better in executive functioning, working memory and non-verbal reasoning, whereas participants with regular acting practice had better long-term verbal memory and fluency performance. Thus, taken together, results suggest a differential effect of these artistic practices on cognition across the lifespan. Advanced age did not seem to reduce the benefit, so future studies should focus on the hypothetical protective effects of artistic practice against cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: A Simplified CNN Classification Method for MI-EEG via the Electrode Pairs Signals</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00338</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A brain-computer interface (BCI) based on electroencephalography (EEG) can provide independent information exchange and control channels for the brain and the outside world. However, EEG signals come from multiple electrodes, the data of which can generate multiple features. How to select electrodes and features to improve classification performance has become an urgent problem to be solved. This paper proposes a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) structure with separated temporal and spatial filters, which selects the raw EEG signals of the electrode pairs over the motor cortex region as hybrid samples without any preprocessing or artificial feature extraction operations. In the proposed structure, a 5-layer CNN has been applied to learn EEG features, a 4-layer max pooling has been used to reduce dimensionality, and a fully-connected (FC) layer has been utilized for classification. Dropout and batch normalization are also employed to reduce the risk of overfitting. In the experiment, the 4 s EEG data of 10, 20, 60, and 100 subjects from the Physionet database are used as the data source, and the motor imaginations (MI) tasks are divided into four types: left fist, right fist, both fists, and both feet. The results indicate that the global averaged accuracy on group-level classification can reach 97.28%, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve stands out at 0.997, and the electrode pair with the highest accuracy on 10 subjects dataset is FC3-FC4, with 98.61%. The research results also show that this CNN classification method with minimal (2) electrode can obtain high accuracy, which is an advantage over other methods on the same database. This proposed approach provides a new idea for simplifying the design of BCI systems, and accelerates the process of clinical application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Oscillatory Bursting as a Mechanism for Temporal Coupling and Information Coding</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00082</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Even the simplest cognitive processes involve interactions between cortical regions. To study these processes, we usually rely on averaging across several repetitions of a task or across long segments of data to reach a statistically valid conclusion. Neuronal oscillations reflect synchronized excitability fluctuations in ensembles of neurons and can be observed in electrophysiological recordings in the presence or absence of an external stimulus. Oscillatory brain activity has been viewed as sustained increase in power at specific frequency bands. However, this perspective has been challenged in recent years by the notion that oscillations may occur as transient burst-like events that occur in individual trials and may only appear as sustained activity when multiple trials are averaged together. In this review, we examine the idea that oscillatory activity can manifest as a transient burst as well as a sustained increase in power. We discuss the technical challenges involved in the detection and characterization of transient events at the single trial level, the mechanisms that might generate them and the features that can be extracted from these events to study single-trial dynamics of neuronal ensemble activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.524791</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The differentiation of neurons and formation of connections between cells is the basis of both the adult phenotype and behaviors tied to cognition, perception, reproduction, and survival. Such behaviors are associated with local (circuits) and global (connectome) brain networks. A solid understanding of how these networks emerge is critical. This opinion piece features a guided tour of early developmental events in the emerging connectome, which is crucial to a new view on the connectogenetic process. Connectogenesis includes associating cell identities with broader functional and developmental relationships. During this process, the transition from developmental cells to terminally differentiated cells is defined by an accumulation of traits that ultimately results in neuronal-driven behavior. The well-characterized developmental and cell biology of Caenorhabditis elegans will be used to build a synthesis of developmental events that result in a functioning connectome. Specifically, our view of connectogenesis enables a first-mover model of synaptic connectivity to be demonstrated using data representing larval synaptogenesis. In a first-mover model of Stackelberg competition, potential pre- and postsynaptic relationships are shown to yield various strategies for establishing various types of synaptic connections. By comparing these results to what is known regarding principles for establishing complex network connectivity, these strategies are generalizable to other species and developmental systems. In conclusion, we will discuss the broader implications of this approach, as what is presented here informs an understanding of behavioral emergence and the ability to simulate related biological phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Changes in Metabolism and Proteostasis Drive Aging Phenotype in Aplysia californica Sensory Neurons</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.573764</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aging is associated with cognitive declines that originate in impairments of function in the neurons that make up the nervous system. The marine mollusk Aplysia californica (Aplysia) is a premier model for the nervous system uniquely suited to investigation of neuronal aging due to uniquely identifiable neurons and molecular techniques available in this model. This study describes the molecular processes associated with aging in two populations of sensory neurons in Aplysia by applying RNA sequencing technology across the aging process (age 6–12 months). Differentially expressed genes clustered into four to five coherent expression patterns across the aging time series in the two neuron populations. Enrichment analysis of functional annotations in these neuron clusters revealed decreased expression of pathways involved in energy metabolism and neuronal signaling, suggesting that metabolic and signaling pathways are intertwined. Furthermore, increased expression of pathways involved in protein processing and translation suggests that proteostatic stress also occurs in aging. Temporal overlap of enrichment for energy metabolism, proteostasis, and neuronal function suggests that cognitive impairments observed in advanced age result from the ramifications of broad declines in energy metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Obesity and diabetes as comorbidities for COVID-19: Underlying mechanisms and the role of viral–bacterial interactions</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61330</link>
	<content:encoded>Obesity and diabetes are established comorbidities for COVID-19. Adipose tissue demonstrates high expression of ACE2 which SARS- CoV-2 exploits to enter host cells. This makes adipose tissue a reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 viruses and thus increases the integral viral load. Acute viral infection results in ACE2 downregulation. This relative deficiency can lead to disturbances in other systems controlled by ACE2, including the renin-angiotensin system. This will be further increased in the case of pre-conditions with already compromised functioning of these systems, such as in patients with obesity and diabetes. Here, we propose that interactions of virally-induced ACE2 deficiency with obesity and/or diabetes leads to a synergistic further impairment of endothelial and gut barrier function. The appearance of bacteria and/or their products in the lungs of obese and diabetic patients promotes interactions between viral and bacterial pathogens, resulting in a more severe lung injury in COVID-19.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Mutational resilience of antiviral restriction favors primate TRIM5α in host-virus evolutionary arms races</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59988</link>
	<content:encoded>Host antiviral proteins engage in evolutionary arms races with viruses, in which both sides rapidly evolve at interaction interfaces to gain or evade immune defense. For example, primate TRIM5α uses its rapidly evolving ‘v1’ loop to bind retroviral capsids, and single mutations in this loop can dramatically improve retroviral restriction. However, it is unknown whether such gains of viral restriction are rare, or if they incur loss of pre-existing function against other viruses. Using deep mutational scanning, we comprehensively measured how single mutations in the TRIM5α v1 loop affect restriction of divergent retroviruses. Unexpectedly, we found that the majority of mutations increase weak antiviral function. Moreover, most random mutations do not disrupt potent viral restriction, even when it is newly acquired via a single adaptive substitution. Our results indicate that TRIM5α’s adaptive landscape is remarkably broad and mutationally resilient, maximizing its chances of success in evolutionary arms races with retroviruses.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Global landscape of phenazine biosynthesis and biodegradation reveals species-specific colonization patterns in agricultural soils and crop microbiomes</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59726</link>
	<content:encoded>Phenazines are natural bacterial antibiotics that can protect crops from disease. However, for most crops it is unknown which producers and specific phenazines are ecologically relevant, and whether phenazine biodegradation can counter their effects. To better understand their ecology, we developed and environmentally-validated a quantitative metagenomic approach to mine for phenazine biosynthesis and biodegradation genes, applying it to &amp;gt;800 soil and plant-associated shotgun-metagenomes. We discover novel producer-crop associations and demonstrate that phenazine biosynthesis is prevalent across habitats and preferentially enriched in rhizospheres, whereas biodegrading bacteria are rare. We validate an association between maize and &lt;i&gt;Dyella japonica&lt;/i&gt;, a putative producer abundant in crop microbiomes. &lt;i&gt;D. japonica&lt;/i&gt; upregulates phenazine biosynthesis during phosphate limitation and robustly colonizes maize seedling roots. This work provides a global picture of phenazines in natural environments and highlights plant-microbe associations of agricultural potential. Our metagenomic approach may be extended to other metabolites and functional traits in diverse ecosystems.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Transport of DNA within cohesin involves clamping on top of engaged heads by Scc2 and entrapment within the ring by Scc3</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59560</link>
	<content:encoded>In addition to extruding DNA loops, cohesin entraps within its SMC-kleisin ring (S-K) individual DNAs during G1 and sister DNAs during S-phase. All three activities require related hook-shaped proteins called Scc2 and Scc3. Using thiol-specific crosslinking we provide rigorous proof of entrapment activity in vitro. Scc2 alone promotes entrapment of DNAs in the E-S and E-K compartments, between ATP-bound engaged heads and the SMC hinge and associated kleisin, respectively. This does not require ATP hydrolysis nor is it accompanied by entrapment within S-K rings, which is a slower process requiring Scc3. Cryo-EM reveals that DNAs transported into E-S/E-K compartments are ‘clamped’ in a sub-compartment created by Scc2’s association with engaged heads whose coiled coils are folded around their elbow. We suggest that clamping may be a recurrent feature of cohesin complexes active in loop extrusion and that this conformation precedes the S-K entrapment required for sister chromatid cohesion.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: SWELL1 regulates skeletal muscle cell size, intracellular signalling, adiposity and glucose metabolism</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58941</link>
	<content:encoded>Maintenance of skeletal muscle is beneficial in obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Mechanical stimulation can regulate skeletal muscle differentiation, growth and metabolism, however the molecular mechanosensor remains unknown. Here, we show that SWELL1 (&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;rrc8a&lt;/i&gt;) functionally encodes a swell-activated anion channel that regulates PI3K-AKT, ERK1/2, mTOR signaling, muscle differentiation, myoblast fusion, cellular oxygen consumption, and glycolysis in skeletal muscle cells. LRRC8A over-expression in &lt;i&gt;Lrrc8a &lt;/i&gt;KO myotubes boosts PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling to supra-normal levels and fully rescues myotube formation. Skeletal muscle targeted &lt;i&gt;Lrrc8a &lt;/i&gt;KO mice have smaller myofibers, generate less force &lt;i&gt;ex vivo, &lt;/i&gt;and exhibit reduced exercise endurance, associated with increased adiposity under basal conditions, and glucose intolerance and insulin resistance when raised on a high-fat diet, compared to WT mice. These results reveal that the LRRC8 complex regulates insulin-PI3K-AKT-mTOR signalling in skeletal muscle to influence skeletal muscle differentiation &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and skeletal myofiber size, muscle function, adiposity and systemic metabolism &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58511</link>
	<content:encoded>The temperature-dependence of many important mosquito-borne diseases has never been quantified. These relationships are critical for understanding current distributions and predicting future shifts from climate change. We used trait-based models to characterize temperature-dependent transmission of 10 vector–pathogen pairs of mosquitoes (&lt;i&gt;Culex pipiens&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cx. quinquefascsiatus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cx. tarsalis&lt;/i&gt;, and others) and viruses (West Nile, Eastern and Western Equine Encephalitis, St. Louis Encephalitis, Sindbis, and Rift Valley Fever viruses), most with substantial transmission in temperate regions. Transmission is optimized at intermediate temperatures (23–26°C) and often has wider thermal breadths (due to cooler lower thermal limits) compared to pathogens with predominately tropical distributions (in previous studies). The incidence of human West Nile virus cases across US counties responded unimodally to average summer temperature and peaked at 24°C, matching model-predicted optima (24–25°C). Climate warming will likely shift transmission of these diseases, increasing it in cooler locations while decreasing it in warmer locations.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58237</link>
	<content:encoded>This article examines why many studies fail to replicate statistically significant published results. We address this issue within a general statistical framework that also allows us to include various questionable research practices (QRPs) that are thought to reduce replicability. The analyses indicate that the base rate of true effects is the major factor that determines the replication rate of scientific results. Specifically, for purely statistical reasons, replicability is low in research domains where true effects are rare (e.g., search for effective drugs in pharmacology). This point is under-appreciated in current scientific and media discussions of replicability, which often attribute poor replicability mainly to QRPs.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Erasable labeling of neuronal activity using a reversible calcium marker</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57249</link>
	<content:encoded>Understanding how the brain encodes and processes information requires the recording of neural activity that underlies different behaviors. Recent efforts in fluorescent protein engineering have succeeded in developing powerful tools for visualizing neural activity, in general by coupling neural activity to different properties of a fluorescent protein scaffold. Here, we take advantage of a previously unexploited class of reversibly switchable fluorescent proteins to engineer a new type of calcium sensor. We introduce rsCaMPARI, a genetically encoded calcium marker engineered from a reversibly switchable fluorescent protein that enables spatiotemporally precise marking, erasing, and remarking of active neuron populations under brief, user-defined time windows of light exposure. rsCaMPARI photoswitching kinetics are modulated by calcium concentration when illuminating with blue light, and the fluorescence can be reset with violet light. We demonstrate the utility of rsCaMPARI for marking and remarking active neuron populations in freely swimming zebrafish.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Deep learning in in-vitro fertilization is currently being evaluated in the development of assistive tools for the determination of transfer order and implantation potential using time-lapse data collected through expensive imaging hardware. Assistive tools and algorithms that can work with static images, however, can help in improving the access to care by enabling their use with images acquired from traditional microscopes that are available to virtually all fertility centers. Here, we evaluated the use of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), trained using single timepoint images of embryos collected at 113 hours post-insemination, in embryo selection amongst 97 clinical patient cohorts (742 embryos) and observed an accuracy of 90% in choosing the highest quality embryo available. Furthermore, a CNN trained to assess an embryo’s implantation potential directly using a set of 97 euploid embryos capable of implantation outperformed 15 trained embryologists (75.26% vs. 67.35%, P&amp;lt;0.0001) from 5 different fertility centers.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54962</link>
	<content:encoded>Human decisions are based on finite information, which makes them inherently imprecise. But what determines the degree of such imprecision? Here, we develop an efficient coding framework for higher-level cognitive processes in which information is represented by a finite number of discrete samples. We characterize the sampling process that maximizes perceptual accuracy or fitness under the often-adopted assumption that full adaptation to an environmental distribution is possible, and show how the optimal process differs when detailed information about the current contextual distribution is costly. We tested this theory on a numerosity discrimination task, and found that humans efficiently adapt to contextual distributions, but in the way predicted by the model in which people must economize on environmental information. Thus, understanding decision behavior requires that we account for biological restrictions on information coding, challenging the often-adopted assumption of precise prior knowledge in higher-level decision systems.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Investigating cortical buffering effects of acute moderate and light intensity exercise: a cTBS study targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.14.297010v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: The beneficial effects of both single-session bouts of aerobic exercise and therapeutic exercise interventions on the cortical regions associated with executive functions (i.e., prefrontal cortex (PFC)) have been well documented. However, it remains unclear whether aerobic exercise can be used to offset temporary fluctuations in cortical activity. Objective: The current study sought to determine whether a single session of moderate intensity aerobic exercise can offset the attenuating effects of continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Methods: Twenty-two right-handed participants between 18-30 years completed a 20 minute session of light intensity (10% heart rate reserve (HRR)) and moderate intensity (50% HRR) exercise in a counterbalanced order. Following each exercise session, participants received active cTBS to the left dlPFC. Changes in executive functions were quantified using a flanker paradigm employed at baseline, post-exercise and post-cTBS time points. Additionally, EEG methodologies were used to measure changes in inhibitory control specific event-related potential components (i.e., P3 and N2) in response to the flanker task. Results: Behavioural results from the flanker task revealed a significant improvement in task performance following an acute bout of moderate intensity exercise. Furthermore, the effect of cTBS in both light and moderate intensity conditions were non significant. Similarly, EEG data from P3 and N2 ERP components revealed no changes to amplitude across time and condition. P3 latency data revealed a significant effect of time in the light intensity condition, such that latency was faster following cTBS. Similarly, latency data within the N2 ERP component revealed a significant effect of time on congruent trials in the light intensity condition; N2 latency was faster following cTBS. Conclusion: The current study revealed that light and moderate intensity exercise may provide a buffer to cTBS- induced attenuation of the dlPFC. This study provides empirical and theoretical implications on the potential for exercise to promote cognitive control.</content:encoded>

Using fMRI, we invited participants to engage in self-criticism and self-reassurance toward written descriptions of negative life events (mistakes, setbacks, failures).

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.12.294702v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Dopamine is known to be involved in several important cognitive processes, most notably in learning from rewards and in the ability to attend to task-relevant aspects of the environment. Both of these features of dopaminergic signalling have been studied separately in research involving Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, who exhibit diminished levels of dopamine. Here, we tie together some of the commonalities in the effects of dopamine on these aspects of cognition by having PD patients (ON and OFF dopaminergic medication) and healthy controls (HCs) perform two tasks that probe these processes. Within-patient behavioural measures of distractibility, from an attentional capture task, and learning performance, from a probabilistic classification reinforcement learning task, were included in one model to assess the role of distractibility during learning. Dopamine medication state and distractibility level were found to have an interactive effect on learning performance; less distractibility in PD ON was associated with higher accuracy during learning, and this was altered in PD OFF. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquired during the learning task furthermore allowed us to assess multivariate patterns of positive and negative outcomes in fronto-striatal and visual brain regions involved in both learning processes and the executive control of attention. Here, we demonstrate that while PD ON show a clearer distinction between outcomes than OFF in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and putamen, PD OFF show better distinction of activation patterns in visual regions that respond to the stimuli presented during the task. These results demonstrate that dopamine plays a key role in modulating the interaction between attention and learning at the level of both behaviour and activation patterns in the brain.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Context influences how individuals with misophonia respond to sounds</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.12.292391v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Misophonia is a newly researched condition in which specific sounds cause an intense, aversive response in individuals, characterized by negative emotions and autonomic arousal. Although virtually any sound can become a misophonic trigger, the most common sounds appear to be bodily sounds related to chewing and eating as well as other repetitive sounds. An intriguing aspect of misophonia is the fact that many misophonic individuals report that they are triggered more, or even only, by sounds produced by specific individuals, and less, or not at all, by sounds produced by animals (although there are always exceptions). In general, anecdotal evidence suggests that misophonic triggers involve a combination of sound stimuli and contextual cues. The aversive stimulus is more than just a sound and can be thought of as a Gestalt of features which includes sound as a necessary component as well as additional contextual information. In this study, we explore how contextual information influences misophonic responses to human chewing, as well as sonically similar sounds produced by non-human sources. The current study revealed that the exact same sound can be perceived as being much more or less aversive depending on the contextual information presented alongside the auditory information. The results of this study provide a foundation for potential cognitive based therapies.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Kinetic modeling of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dynamics in the mitochondria of HeLa cells</title>

Hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) promotes a range of phenotypes depending on its intracellular concentration and dosing kinetics, including cell death. While this qualitative relationship has been well established, the quantitative and mechanistic aspects of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; signaling are still being elucidated. Mitochondria, a putative source of intracellular H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, have recently been demonstrated to be particularly vulnerable to localized H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; perturbations, eliciting a dramatic cell death response in comparison to similar cytosolic perturbations. We sought to improve our dynamic and mechanistic understanding of the mitochondrial H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reaction network in HeLa cells by creating a kinetic model of this system and using it to explore basal and perturbed conditions. The model uses the most current quantitative proteomic and kinetic data available to predict reaction rates and steady-state concentrations of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and its reaction partners within individual mitochondria. Time scales ranging from milliseconds to one hour were simulated. We predict that basal, steady-state mitochondrial H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will be in the low nM range (2–4 nM) and will be inversely dependent on the total pool of peroxiredoxin-3 (Prx3). Neglecting efflux of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the cytosol, the mitochondrial reaction network is expected to control perturbations well up to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation rates ~50 μM/s (0.25 nmol/mg-protein/s), above which point the Prx3 system would be expected to collapse. Comparison of these results with redox Western blots of Prx3 and Prx2 oxidation states demonstrated reasonable trend agreement at short times (≤ 15 min) for a range of experimentally perturbed H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation rates. At longer times, substantial efflux of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the mitochondria to the cytosol was evidenced by peroxiredoxin-2 (Prx2) oxidation, and Prx3 collapse was not observed. A refined model using Monte Carlo parameter sampling was used to explore rates of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; efflux that could reconcile model predictions of Prx3 oxidation states with the experimental observations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qaOTtVEjQpE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Segmenting cell nuclei within microscopy images is a ubiquitous task in biological research and clinical applications. Unfortunately, segmenting low-contrast overlapping objects that may be tightly packed is a major bottleneck in standard deep learning-based models. We report a Nuclear Segmentation Tool (NuSeT) based on deep learning that accurately segments nuclei across multiple types of fluorescence imaging data. Using a hybrid network consisting of U-Net and Region Proposal Networks (RPN), followed by a watershed step, we have achieved superior performance in detecting and delineating nuclear boundaries in 2D and 3D images of varying complexities. By using foreground normalization and additional training on synthetic images containing non-cellular artifacts, NuSeT improves nuclear detection and reduces false positives. NuSeT addresses common challenges in nuclear segmentation such as variability in nuclear signal and shape, limited training sample size, and sample preparation artifacts. Compared to other segmentation models, NuSeT consistently fares better in generating accurate segmentation masks and assigning boundaries for touching nuclei.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6H1w9aq1dx0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Cells adjust their metabolism in response to mutations, but how this reprogramming depends on the genetic context is not well known. Specifically, the absence of individual enzymes can affect reprogramming, and thus the impact of mutations in cell growth. Here, we examine this issue with an &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; model of &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae’s&lt;/i&gt; metabolism. By quantifying the variability in the growth rate of 10000 different mutant metabolisms that accumulated changes in their reaction fluxes, in the presence, or absence, of a specific enzyme, we distinguish a subset of modifier genes serving as buffers or potentiators of variability. We notice that the most potent modifiers refer to the glycolysis pathway and that, more broadly, they show strong pleiotropy and epistasis. Moreover, the evidence that this subset depends on the specific growing condition strengthens its systemic underpinning, a feature only observed before in a toy model of a gene-regulatory network. Some of these enzymes also modulate the effect that biochemical noise and environmental fluctuations produce in growth. Thus, the reorganization of metabolism induced by mutations has not only direct physiological implications but also transforms the influence that other mutations have on growth. This is a general result with implications in the development of cancer therapies based on metabolic inhibitors.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/s2w3TaMvmvA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Effects of spatial heterogeneity on bacterial genetic circuits</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/iHe1xFAT38w/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Carlos Barajas, Domitilla Del Vecchio&lt;/p&gt;

Intracellular spatial heterogeneity is frequently observed in bacteria, where the chromosome occupies part of the cell’s volume and a circuit’s DNA often localizes within the cell. How this heterogeneity affects core processes and genetic circuits is still poorly understood. In fact, commonly used ordinary differential equation (ODE) models of genetic circuits assume a well-mixed ensemble of molecules and, as such, do not capture spatial aspects. Reaction-diffusion partial differential equation (PDE) models have been only occasionally used since they are difficult to integrate and do not provide mechanistic understanding of the effects of spatial heterogeneity. In this paper, we derive a reduced ODE model that captures spatial effects, yet has the same dimension as commonly used well-mixed models. In particular, the only difference with respect to a well-mixed ODE model is that the association rate constant of binding reactions is multiplied by a coefficient, which we refer to as the binding correction factor (BCF). The BCF depends on the size of interacting molecules and on their location when fixed in space and it is equal to unity in a well-mixed ODE model. The BCF can be used to investigate how spatial heterogeneity affects the behavior of core processes and genetic circuits. Specifically, our reduced model indicates that transcription and its regulation are more effective for genes located at the cell poles than for genes located on the chromosome. The extent of these effects depends on the value of the BCF, which we found to be close to unity. For translation, the value of the BCF is always greater than unity, it increases with mRNA size, and, with biologically relevant parameters, is substantially larger than unity. Our model has broad validity, has the same dimension as a well-mixed model, yet it incorporates spatial heterogeneity. This simple-to-use model can be used to both analyze and design genetic circuits while accounting for spatial intracellular effects.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/iHe1xFAT38w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: A disordered encounter complex is central to the yeast Abp1p SH3 domain binding pathway</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/b4C6QlnTZ6E/article</link>

Protein-protein interactions are involved in a wide range of cellular processes. These interactions often involve intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and protein binding domains. However, the details of IDP binding pathways are hard to characterize using experimental approaches, which can rarely capture intermediate states present at low populations. SH3 domains are common protein interaction domains that typically bind proline-rich disordered segments and are involved in cell signaling, regulation, and assembly. We hypothesized, given the flexibility of SH3 binding peptides, that their binding pathways include multiple steps important for function. Molecular dynamics simulations were used to characterize the steps of binding between the yeast Abp1p SH3 domain (AbpSH3) and a proline-rich IDP, ArkA. Before binding, the N-terminal segment 1 of ArkA is pre-structured and adopts a polyproline II helix, while segment 2 of ArkA (C-terminal) adopts a 3&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; helix, but is far less structured than segment 1. As segment 2 interacts with AbpSH3, it becomes more structured, but retains flexibility even in the fully engaged state. Binding simulations reveal that ArkA enters a flexible encounter complex before forming the fully engaged bound complex. In the encounter complex, transient nonspecific hydrophobic and long-range electrostatic contacts form between ArkA and the binding surface of SH3. The encounter complex ensemble includes conformations with segment 1 in both the forward and reverse orientation, suggesting that segment 2 may play a role in stabilizing the correct binding orientation. While the encounter complex forms quickly, the slow step of binding is the transition from the disordered encounter ensemble to the fully engaged state. In this transition, ArkA makes specific contacts with AbpSH3 and buries more hydrophobic surface. Simulating the binding between ApbSH3 and ArkA provides insight into the role of encounter complex intermediates and nonnative hydrophobic interactions for other SH3 domains and IDPs in general.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/b4C6QlnTZ6E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

In this study we analyze the growth-phase dependent metabolic states of &lt;i&gt;Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus&lt;/i&gt; by constructing a fully compartmented, mass and charge-balanced genome-scale metabolic model of this predatory bacterium (&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;CH457). Considering the differences between life cycle phases driving the growth of this predator, growth-phase condition-specific models have been generated allowing the systematic study of its metabolic capabilities. Using these computational tools, we have been able to analyze, from a system level, the dynamic metabolism of the predatory bacteria as the life cycle progresses. We provide computational evidences supporting potential axenic growth of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bacteriovorus&lt;/i&gt;’s in a rich medium based on its encoded metabolic capabilities. Our systems-level analysis confirms the presence of “energy-saving” mechanisms in this predator as well as an abrupt metabolic shift between the attack and intraperiplasmic growth phases. Our results strongly suggest that predatory bacteria’s metabolic networks have low robustness, likely hampering their ability to tackle drastic environmental fluctuations, thus being confined to stable and predictable habitats. Overall, we present here a valuable computational testbed based on predatory bacteria activity for rational design of novel and controlled biocatalysts in biotechnological/clinical applications.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/a0JK3GT3FqQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Global change causes widespread decline of coral reefs. In order to counter the anticipated disappearance of coral reefs by the end of this century, many initiatives are emerging, including creation of marine protected areas (MPAs), reef restoration projects, and assisted evolution initiatives. Such efforts, although critically important, are locally constrained. We propose to build a “Noah's Ark” biological repository for corals that taps into the network of the world’s public aquaria and coral reef scientists. Public aquaria will serve not only as a reservoir for the purpose of conservation, restoration, and research of reef-building corals but also as a laboratory for the implementation of operations for the selection of stress-resilient and resistant genotypes. The proposed project will provide a global dimension to coral reef education and protection as a result of the involvement of a network of public and private aquaria.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/GT4HInMaQ5E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Plant nucleotide-binding (NB) leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor (NLR) proteins function as intracellular immune receptors that perceive the presence of pathogen-derived virulence proteins (effectors) to induce immune responses. The 2 major types of plant NLRs that “sense” pathogen effectors differ in their N-terminal domains: these are Toll/interleukin-1 receptor resistance (TIR) domain-containing NLRs (TNLs) and coiled-coil (CC) domain-containing NLRs (CNLs). In many angiosperms, the RESISTANCE TO POWDERY MILDEW 8 (RPW8)-CC domain containing NLR (RNL) subclass of CNLs is encoded by 2 gene families, &lt;i&gt;ACTIVATED DISEASE RESISTANCE 1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;ADR1&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;N REQUIREMENT GENE 1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;NRG1&lt;/i&gt;), that act as “helper” NLRs during multiple sensor NLR-mediated immune responses. Despite their important role in sensor NLR-mediated immunity, knowledge of the specific, redundant, and synergistic functions of helper RNLs is limited. We demonstrate that the ADR1 and NRG1 families act in an unequally redundant manner in basal resistance, effector-triggered immunity (ETI) and regulation of defense gene expression. We define RNL redundancy in ETI conferred by some TNLs and in basal resistance against virulent pathogens. We demonstrate that, in &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt;, the 2 RNL families contribute specific functions in ETI initiated by specific CNLs and TNLs. Time-resolved whole genome expression profiling revealed that RNLs and “classical” CNLs trigger similar transcriptome changes, suggesting that RNLs act like other CNLs to mediate ETI downstream of sensor NLR activation. Together, our genetic data confirm that RNLs contribute to basal resistance, are fully required for TNL signaling, and can also support defense activation during CNL-mediated ETI.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/S08uZX3utkc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Clinical variability in spinal muscular atrophy type III</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report natural history data in a large cohort of 199 spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type III patients assessed using the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE). The aim of the study was to establish annual rate and possible patterns of progression according to a number of variables, such as age of onset, age at assessment, &lt;i&gt;SMN2&lt;/i&gt; copy number and functional status.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HFMSE longitudinal changes were assessed using piecewise linear mixed‐effects models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dependency in the data due to repeated measures was accounted for by a random intercept per individual and an unstructured covariance R matrix was used as correlation structure. An additional descriptive analysis was performed for 123 patients, for a total of 375 12‐month assessments.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A break point at age 7 was set for the whole cohort and for SMA IIIA and IIIB. Age, SMA type and ambulatory status were significantly associated with changes in mean HFMSE score while sex and &lt;i&gt;SMN2&lt;/i&gt; copy number were not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increase in response before the break point of age 7 is significant only for SMA IIIA (β = 1.79, p &amp;lt; .0001). After the break point the change in the rate of HFMSE score significantly decrease for both SMA IIIA (β = −1.15, p &amp;lt; .0001) and IIIB (β = −0.69, p = 0.002).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings contribute to the understanding of the natural history of type III SMA and will be helpful in the interpretation of the real‐world data of patients treated with commercially available drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05359</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Can the powerful backpropagation of error (backprop) reinforcement learning
algorithm be formulated in a manner suitable for implementation in neural
circuitry? The primary challenge is to ensure that any candidate formulation
uses only local information, rather than relying on global (error) signals, as
in orthodox backprop. Recently several algorithms for approximating backprop
using only local signals, such as predictive coding and equilibrium-prop, have
been proposed. However, these algorithms typically impose other requirements
which challenge biological plausibility: for example, requiring complex and
precise connectivity schemes (predictive coding), or multiple sequential
backwards phases with information being stored across phases
(equilibrium-prop). Here, we propose a novel local algorithm, Activation
Relaxation (AR), which is motivated by constructing the backpropagation
gradient as the equilibrium point of a dynamical system. Our algorithm
converges robustly and exactly to the correct backpropagation gradients,
requires only a single type of neuron, utilises only a single backwards phase,
and can perform credit assignment on arbitrary computation graphs. We
illustrate these properties by training deep neural networks on visual
classification tasks, and we describe simplifications to the algorithm which
remove further obstacles to neurobiological implementation (for example, the
weight-transport problem, and the use of nonlinear derivatives), while
preserving performance.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Integration of Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire-Neurons in Deep Learning Architectures. (arXiv:2004.13532v2 [cs.NE] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13532</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Up to now, modern Machine Learning is mainly based on fitting high
dimensional functions to enormous data sets, taking advantage of huge hardware
resources. We show that biologically inspired neuron models such as the
Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons provide novel and efficient ways of
information encoding. They can be integrated in Machine Learning models, and
are a potential target to improve Machine Learning performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, we derived simple update-rules for the LIF units from the differential
equations, which are easy to numerically integrate. We apply a novel approach
to train the LIF units supervisedly via backpropagation, by assigning a
constant value to the derivative of the neuron activation function exclusively
for the backpropagation step. This simple mathematical trick helps to
distribute the error between the neurons of the pre-connected layer. We apply
our method to the IRIS blossoms image data set and show that the training
technique can be used to train LIF neurons on image classification tasks.
Furthermore, we show how to integrate our method in the KERAS (tensorflow)
framework and efficiently run it on GPUs. To generate a deeper understanding of
the mechanisms during training we developed interactive illustrations, which we
provide online.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this study we want to contribute to the current efforts to enhance
Machine Intelligence by integrating principles from biology.

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Brain Vital Signs Detect Information Processing Differences When Neuromodulation Is Used During Cognitive Skills Training</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00358</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Neuromodulation through translingual neurostimulation (TLNS) has been shown to initiate long-lasting processes of neuronal reorganization with a variety of outcomes (i.e., neuroplasticity). Non-invasive TLNS is increasingly accessible through the Portable Neuromodulation Stimulator (PoNS&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;), a medical device that delivers electrical stimulation to the tongue to activate the trigeminal (V) and facial (VII) cranial nerves. Anecdotal reports from previous clinical studies have suggested incidental improvements in cognitive function. To objectively explore this observation, we examined TLNS-related effects on the semantic N400 brain vital sign cognitive response during cognitive skills training in healthy individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Thirty-seven healthy volunteers were randomized to receive simultaneous TLNS (treatment) or no TLNS (control) while undergoing cognitive skills training. Cognitive training was conducted for two 20-min sessions (morning and afternoon/evening) over 3 consecutive days. Brain vital signs were evaluated at baseline, Day 1, and Day 3. Analyses focused on cognitive processing as measured by N400 changes in amplitude and latency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Over the 3-day course of cognitive training, the N400 amplitude decreased significantly in the control group due to habituation (p = 0.028). In contrast, there was no significant change in the TLNS treatment group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: TLNS led to a sustained N400 response during cognitive skills training, as measured by the brain’s vital signs framework. The study findings suggest differential learning effects due to neuromodulation, consistent with increased attention and cognitive vigilance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Dropout in Neural Networks Simulates the Paradoxical Effects of Deep Brain Stimulation on Memory</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00273</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuromodulation techniques such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) are a promising treatment for memory-related disorders including anxiety, addiction, and dementia. However, the outcomes of such treatments appear to be somewhat paradoxical, in that these techniques can both disrupt and enhance memory even when applied to the same brain target. In this article, we hypothesize that disruption and enhancement of memory through neuromodulation can be explained by the dropout of engram nodes. We used a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits and letters and applied dropout at different stages to simulate DBS effects on engrams. We showed that dropout applied during training improved the accuracy of prediction, whereas dropout applied during testing dramatically decreased the accuracy of prediction, which mimics enhancement and disruption of memory, respectively. We further showed that transfer learning of neural networks with dropout had increased the accuracy and rate of learning. Dropout during training provided a more robust “skeleton” network and, together with transfer learning, mimicked the effects of chronic DBS on memory. Overall, we showed that the dropout of engram nodes is a possible mechanism by which neuromodulation techniques such as DBS can both disrupt and enhance memory, providing a unique perspective on this paradox.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: A large accessory protein interactome is rewired across environments</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/62365</link>
	<content:encoded>To characterize how protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks change, we quantified the relative PPI abundance of 1.6 million protein pairs in the yeast &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; across 9 growth conditions, with replication, for a total of 44 million measurements. Our multi-condition screen identified 13,764 pairwise PPIs, a 3-fold increase over PPIs identified in one condition. A few 'immutable' PPIs are present across all conditions, while most 'mutable' PPIs are rarely observed. Immutable PPIs aggregate into highly connected 'core' network modules, with most network remodeling occurring within a loosely connected 'accessory' module. Mutable PPIs are less likely to co-express, co-localize, and be explained by simple mass action kinetics, and more likely to contain proteins with intrinsically disordered regions, implying that environment-dependent association and binding is critical to cellular adaptation. Our results show that protein interactomes are larger than previously thought and contain highly dynamic regions that reorganize to drive or respond to cellular changes.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we determined the structure of the &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli &lt;/i&gt;70S ribosome with a global resolution of 2.0 Å. The maps reveal unambiguous positioning of protein and RNA residues, their detailed chemical interactions, and chemical modifications. Notable features include the first examples of isopeptide and thioamide backbone substitutions in ribosomal proteins, the former likely conserved in all domains of life. The maps also reveal extensive solvation of the small (30S) ribosomal subunit, and interactions with A-site and P-site tRNAs, mRNA, and the antibiotic paromomycin. The maps and models of the bacterial ribosome presented here now allow a deeper phylogenetic analysis of ribosomal components including structural conservation to the level of solvation. The high quality of the maps should enable future structural analysis of the chemical basis for translation and aid the development of robust tools for cryo-EM structure modeling and refinement.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Vascular control of the CO2/H+ dependent drive to breathe</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59499</link>
	<content:encoded>Respiratory chemoreceptors regulate breathing in response to changes in tissue CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Blood flow is a fundamental determinant of tissue CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, yet little is known regarding how regulation of vascular tone in chemoreceptor regions contributes to respiratory behavior. Previously, we showed in rat that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-vasoconstriction in the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) supports chemoreception by a purinergic-dependent mechanism (Hawkins et al. 2017). Here, we show in mice that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; dilates arterioles in other chemoreceptor regions, thus demonstrating CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; vascular reactivity in the RTN is unique. We also identify P2Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in RTN smooth muscle cells as the substrate responsible for this response. Specifically, pharmacological blockade or genetic deletion of P2Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from smooth muscle cells blunted the ventilatory response to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and re-expression of P2Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors only in RTN smooth muscle cells fully rescued the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; chemoreflex. These results identify P2Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in RTN smooth muscle cells as requisite determinants of respiratory chemoreception.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57067</link>
	<content:encoded>The proportion of research outputs published in open access journals or made available on other freely-accessible platforms has increased over the past two decades, driven largely by funder mandates, institutional policies, grass-roots advocacy, and changing attitudes in the research community. However, the relative effectiveness of these different interventions has remained largely unexplored. Here we present a robust, transparent and updateable method for analysing how these interventions affect the open access performance of individual institutes. We studied 1,207 institutions from across the world, and found that, in 2017, the top-performing universities published around 80-90% of their research open access. The analysis also showed that publisher-mediated (gold) open access was popular in Latin American and African universities, whereas the growth of open access in Europe and North America has mostly been driven by repositories.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: TMEM79/MATTRIN defines a pathway for Frizzled regulation and is required for Xenopus embryogenesis</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56793</link>
	<content:encoded>Wnt signaling through the Frizzled (FZD) family of serpentine receptors is essential for embryogenesis and homeostasis, and stringent control of the FZD protein level is critical for stem cell regulation. Through CRISPR/Cas9 genome-wide screening in human cells, we identified TMEM79/MATTRIN, an orphan multi-span transmembrane protein, as a specific inhibitor of Wnt/FZD signaling. TMEM79 interacts with FZD during biogenesis and promotes FZD degradation independent of ZNRF3/RNF43 ubiquitin ligases (R-spondin receptors). TMEM79 interacts with &lt;i&gt;u&lt;/i&gt;biquitin-&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;pecific &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;rotease 8 (USP8), whose activating mutations underlie human tumorigenesis. TMEM79 specifically inhibits USP8 deubiquitination of FZD, thereby governing USP8 substrate specificity and promoting FZD degradation. Tmem79 and Usp8 genes have a pre-bilaterian origin, and Tmem79 inhibition of Usp8 and Wnt signaling is required for anterior neural development and gastrulation in &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; embryos. &lt;i&gt;TMEM79&lt;/i&gt; is a predisposition gene for Atopic dermatitis, suggesting deregulation of Wnt/FZD signaling a possible cause for this most common yet enigmatic inflammatory skin disease.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.14.297283v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The proliferation of neural progenitor cells provides the cellular substrate from which the nervous system is sculpted during development. The {delta}-protocadherin family of homophilic cell adhesion molecules is essential for the normal development of the nervous system and has been linked to an array of neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the biological functions of {delta}-protocadherins are not well-defined. Here, we show that the {delta}-protocadherins regulate proliferation in neural progenitor cells, as lesions in each of six, individual {delta}-protocadherin genes increase cell division in the developing hindbrain. Moreover, Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling is upregulated in {delta}-protocadherin mutants and inhibition of the canonical Wnt pathway occludes the observed proliferation increases. We show that the {delta}-protocadherins physically associate with the Wnt receptor Ryk, and that Ryk is required for the increased proliferation in protocadherin mutants. Thus, the {delta}-protocadherins act as novel regulators of Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling during neural development and could provide lineage-restricted local regulation of canonical Wnt signaling and cell proliferation.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Polycomb represses a gene network controlling puberty via modulation of histone demethylase Kdm6b expression</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.14.297135v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Female puberty is subject to Polycomb Group (PcG)-dependent transcriptional repression. Kiss1, a puberty-activating gene, is a key target of this silencing mechanism. Using a gain-of-function approach and a systems biology strategy we now show that EED, an essential PcG component, acts in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus to alter the functional organization of a gene network involved in the stimulatory control of puberty. A central node of this network is Kdm6b, which encodes an enzyme that erases the PcG-dependent histone modification H3K27me3. Kiss1 is a first neighbor in the network; genes encoding glutamatergic receptors and potassium channels are second neighbors. By repressing Kdm6b expression, EED increases H3K27me3 abundance at these gene promoters, reducing gene expression throughout a gene network controlling puberty activation. These results indicate that Kdm6b repression is a basic mechanism used by PcG to modulate the biological output of puberty-activating gene networks.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Interacting effects of frontal lobe neuroanatomy and working memory capacity to older listeners' speech recognition in noise</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.14.296343v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Many older adults are struggling with understanding spoken language, particularly when background noise is present interferes with comprehension. In the present study, we investigated a potential interaction between two well-known factors associated with greater speech-in-noise (SiN) reception thresholds in older adults, namely a) lower working memory capacity and b) age-related structural decline of frontal lobe regions. In a sample of older adults (N=25) and younger controls (N=13) with normal pure-tone thresholds, SiN reception thresholds and working memory capacity were assessed. Furthermore, T1-weighted structural MR-images were recorded to analyze neuroanatomical traits (i.e., cortical thickness (CT) and cortical surface area (CSA)) of the cortex. As expected, the older group showed greater SiN reception thresholds compared to the younger group. We also found consistent age-related atrophy (i.e., lower CT) in brain regions associated with SiN recognition namely the superior temporal lobe bilaterally, the right inferior frontal and precentral gyrus, as well as the left superior frontal gyrus. Those older participants with greater atrophy in these brain regions also showed greater SiN reception thresholds. Interestingly, the association between CT in the left superior frontal gyrus and SiN reception thresholds was moderated by individual working memory capacity. Older adults with greater working memory capacity benefitted more strongly from thicker frontal lobe regions when it comes to improve SiN recognition. Overall, our results fit well into the literature showing that age-related structural decline in auditory- and cognition-related brain areas is associated with greater SiN reception thresholds in older adults. However, we highlight that this association changes as a function of individual working memory capacity. We therefore believe that future interventions to improve SiN recognition in older adults should take into account the role of the frontal lobe as well as individual working memory capacity.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.14.296038v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Mutations in the RNA binding protein (RBP) FUS cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and result in its nuclear depletion and cytoplasmic mislocalisation, with cytoplasmic gain of function thought to be crucial in pathogenesis. Here, we show that expression of mutant FUS at physiological levels drives translation inhibition in both mouse and human motor neurons. Rather than acting directly on the translation machinery, we find that mutant FUS forms cytoplasmic condensates that promote the phase separation of FMRP, another RBP associated with neurodegeneration and robustly involved in translation regulation. FUS and FMRP co-partition and repress translation in vitro. In our in vivo model, FMRP RNA targets are depleted from ribosomes. Our results identify a novel paradigm by which FUS mutations favour the condensed state of other RBPs, impacting on crucial biological functions, such as protein translation.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Memory specificity is linked to repetition effects in event-related potentials across the lifespan</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.14.295972v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Our memories depend on our brain's ability to form internal representations of relevant aspects of the world that can later be retrieved. The specificity with which past experiences can be remembered varies across the lifespan, possibly due to differences in how precisely information is encoded. This memory formation can be investigated through repetition effects, the common finding that neural activity is altered (suppressed or enhanced) when stimuli are repeated. However, whether differences in this indirect measure of memory formation relate to lifespan age differences in memory specificity has not yet been established. In the present study, we examined repetition effects in event-related potentials and their relation to recognition specificity. During incidental encoding, children (aged 7-9 years), young adults (18-30 years), and older adults (65-76 years) viewed repeated object images from different categories. During subsequent recognition, old, similar, and new objects were presented, allowing for a differentiation of memory for the specific item versus the general category. We identified neural repetition suppression effects in all age groups, and repetition enhancement for adults. Furthermore, individual item recognition performance comprising lure discrimination was positively associated with the magnitude of the neural repetition effects. These brain-behavior associations did not differ between age groups, indicating common neural mechanisms of memory formation. In sum, our findings demonstrate that neural repetition effects reflect encoding mechanisms that facilitate the formation of highly specific memory representations and highlight their significance as a neural indicator of individual differences in episodic memory encoding across the lifespan.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.14.295931v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Vocal behaviour can be dramatically changed by both neural circuit development and postnatal maturation of the body. During song learning in songbirds, both the song system and syringeal muscles are functionally changing, but it is unknown if maturation of sound generators within the syrinx contributes to vocal development. Here we densely sample the respiratory pressure control space of the zebra finch syrinx in vitro. We show that the syrinx produces sound very efficiently and that key acoustic parameters, minimal fundamental frequency, entropy and source level, do not change over development in both sexes. Thus, our data suggests that the observed acoustic changes in vocal development must be attributed to changes in the motor control pathway, from song system circuitry to muscle force, and not by material property changes in the avian analog of the vocal folds. We propose that in songbirds, muscle use and training driven by the sexually dimorphic song system are the crucial drivers that lead to sexual dimorphism of the syringeal skeleton and musculature. The size and properties of the instrument are thus not changing, while its player is.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.14.295600v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Blood flow regulation in the brain is dynamically regulated to meet the metabolic demands of active neuronal populations. Recent evidence has demonstrated that capillary endothelial cells are essential mediators of neurovascular coupling that sense neuronal activity and generate a retrograde, propagating, hyperpolarizing signal that dilates upstream arterioles. Here, we tested the hypothesis that transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) channels in capillary endothelial cells are significant contributors to functional hyperemic responses that underlie neurovascular coupling in the brain. Using an integrative ex vivo and in vivo approach, we demonstrate the functional presence of TRPA1 channels in brain capillary endothelial cells, and show that activation of these channels within the capillary bed, including the post-arteriole transitional region covered by ensheathing mural cells, initiates a retrograde signal that dilates upstream parenchymal arterioles. Notably, this signaling exhibits a unique biphasic mode of propagation that begins within the capillary network as a short-range, Ca2+ signal dependent on endothelial pannexin-1 channel/purinergic P2X receptor communication pathway and then is converted to a rapid, inward-rectifying K+ channel-mediated electrical signal in the post-arteriole transitional region that propagates upstream to parenchymal arterioles. Two-photon laser-scanning microscopy further demonstrated that conductive vasodilation occurs in vivo, and that TRPA1 is necessary for functional hyperemia within the somatosensory cortex of mice. Together, these data establish a role for endothelial TRPA1 channels as sensors of neuronal activity and show that they respond accordingly by initiating a vasodilatory response that redirects blood to regions of metabolic demand.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.14.286765v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Emotional memory processing, such as fear memory, engages a large neuronal network of brain regions including the cerebellum. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms of the cerebellar cortex modulating the fear memory network is largely unknown. Here, we illustrate a novel mechanism by which synaptic signaling in cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) via STAT3 regulates long-term fear memory. Firstly, we generated PC-specific STAT3 knockout (STAT3PKO) mice. Transcriptome analyses revealed that STAT3 deletion results in transcriptional changes that lead to an increase in the expression of glutamate receptors. The amplitude of AMPA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents at parallel fiber to PC synapses was larger in STAT3PKO mice than in wild-type littermates. Conditioning at the parallel fiber induced long-term depression of parallel fiber-PC synapses in STAT3PKO mice while the same manipulation induced long-term potentiation in wild-type littermates. Interestingly, STAT3PKO mice showed an aberrantly enhanced long-term fear memory. Neuronal activity in fear-related regions increased in fear-conditioned STAT3PKO mice. Our data suggest that STAT3-dependent molecular regulation in PCs is indispensable for proper expression of fear memory processing.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Sustained neural activity correlates with rapid perceptual learning of auditory patterns</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.13.295568v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Recurring structures forming regular patterns are common in sounds. Learning such patterns is thought to be crucial for accurate auditory perceptual organization (scene analysis) and efficient recognition and prediction of sounds. The current study investigated the behavioral and neural signatures of rapid perceptual learning of regular patterns in sounds. In six behavioral and EEG experiments with over 120 human participants from both sexes, we show that individuals are faster to detect regular patterns, are more sensitive to pattern deviations, and are more accurate at judging the temporal order of pattern onset relative to a visual stimulus when patterns are repeated compared to novel. Sustained neural activity indexed perceptual learning in two ways. First, sustained activity increased earlier for repeated compared to novel regular patterns when participants attended to sounds, but not when they ignored them; this earlier response increase mirrored the rapid perceptual learning we observed behaviorally. Second, the magnitude of sustained activity was reduced for repeated compared to novel patterns, independent of whether participants attended to or ignored sounds. The reduction in the magnitude of sustained activity appeared only for later stimulus presentations, suggesting it is not directly related to perceptual learning, but to processes enabled by learning. Our study thus reveals neural markers of perceptual learning of auditory patterns, and of processes that may be related to reduced novelty or better prediction of learned auditory patterns.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.13.295469v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Internal states of reward expectation play a central role in influencing the strength of spatial memories. At the cellular level, spatial memories are represented through the firing dynamics of hippocampal place cells. However, it remains unclear how internal states of reward expectation influence place cell dynamics and exert their effects on spatial memories. Here we show that when reward expectation is altered, the same environment becomes encoded by a distinct ensemble of place cells at all locations. Further, when reward expectation is high versus low, place cells demonstrate enhanced reliability during navigation and greater stability across days at all locations within the environment. These findings reveal that when rewards are expected, neuromodulatory circuits that represent internal reward expectation support and strengthen the encoding and retrieval of spatial information by place cells at all locations that lead to reward. This enhanced spatial memory can be used to guide future decisions about which locations are most likely to lead to rewards that are crucial for survival.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.13.295444v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Previous behavioral studies implicated the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) in stimulus associations, and also in retrieval of remote associative memory based on EEG theta oscillations. To investigate the neural mechanisms underlying these processes, RSC neurons and local field potentials (LFPs) were simultaneously recorded from well-trained rats performing a cue-reward association task. In the task, simultaneous presentation of two multimodal conditioned stimuli (configural CSs) predicted a reward outcome opposite to that associated with individual presentation of each elemental CS. Here, we show neurophysiological evidence that the RSC is involved in stimulus-stimulus association where configural CSs are discriminated from each elementary CS that is a constituent of the configural CSs, and that memory retrieval of rewarding CSs is associated with theta oscillation of RSC neurons during CS presentation, which is phase-locked to LFP theta cycles.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Grid cells in entorhinal cortex (EC) encode an individual's location in space and rely on environmental cues and self-motion cues derived from the individual's body.

However, it is currently unknown whether BSC impacts grid cell activity and how such changes relate to experimental modulations of BSC. Integrating BSC with a spatial navigation task and an fMRI measure to detect grid cell-like representation (GCLR) in humans, we report a robust GCLR modulation in EC when participants navigated during an enhanced BSC state. These changes were further associated with improved spatial navigation performance and increased activity in posterior parietal and retrosplenial cortex. These data link entorhinal grid cell activity with BSC and show that BSC modulates ego- versus allocentric spatial processes about an individual's location in space in a distributed spatial navigation system.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.13.291898v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Group-level studies do not capture individual differences in network organization, an important prerequisite for understanding neural substrates shaping behavior and for developing interventions in clinical conditions. Recent studies have employed &quot;fingerprinting&quot; analyses on functional connectivity to identify subjects' idiosyncratic features. Here, we develop a complementary approach based on an edge-centric model of functional connectivity, which focuses on the co-fluctuations of edges. We first show whole-brain edge functional connectivity (eFC) to be a robust substrate that improves identifiability over nodal FC (nFC) across different datasets and parcellations. Next, we characterized subjects' identifiability at different spatial scales, from single nodes to the level of functional systems and clusters using k-means clustering. Across spatial scales, we find that heteromodal brain regions exhibit consistently greater identifiability than unimodal, sensorimotor, and limbic regions. Lastly, we show that identifiability can be further improved by reconstructing eFC using specific subsets of its principal components. In summary, our results highlight the utility of the edge-centric network model for capturing meaningful subject-specific features and sets the stage for future investigations into individual differences using edge-centric models.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Schizophrenia is a psychotic brain disorder in which patients exhibit aberrant connectivity between different regions of the brain. Neuroimaging is a state-of-the-art technique that is now increasingly been employed in clinical investigation of Schizophrenia. In the present study, we have used resting-state functional magnetic resonance neuroimaging (rsfMRI) to elucidate the cause-and-effect relationships among four regions of the brain including occipital, temporal, and frontal lobes and hippocampus in Schizophrenia. For that, we have employed independent component analysis, a seed-based temporal correlation analysis, and Granger causality analysis for measuring causal relationships amongst four regions of the brain in schizophrenia patients. Eighteen subjects with nine patients and nine controls were evaluated in the study. Our results show that Schizophrenia patients exhibit significantly different activation patterns across the selected regions of the brain in comparison with the control. In addition to that, we also observed an aberrant causal relationship between these four regions of the brain. In particular, the temporal and frontal lobes of patients with schizophrenia had a significantly lowered causal relationship with the other areas of the brain. Taken together, the study elucidates the dysregulated brain activity in Schizophrenia patients, decodes its causal mapping and provides novel insights towards employment in clinical evaluation of Schizophrenia.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Live fluorescence imaging has shown the dynamic nature of dendritic spines, with changes in shape occurring both during development and in response to activity. The structure of a dendritic spine positively correlates with its functional efficacy. Learning and memory studies have shown that great deal of the information stored by a neuron is contained in the synapses. High precision tracking of synaptic structures can give hints about the dynamic nature of memory and help us to understand how memories evolve both in biological and artificial neural networks. Experiments that aim to investigate the dynamics behind the structural changes of dendritic spines require the collection and analysis of large time-series datasets. In this paper, we present an open-source software called SpineS for the automatic longitudinal structural analysis of dendritic spines with additional features for manual intervention to ensure optimal analysis. Our extensive experimental analyses on multiple datasets demonstrate that SpineS can achieve a high-level performance on samples collected both by two-photon and confocal imaging systems.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: A new model of decision processing in instrumental learning tasks</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.12.294512v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Learning and decision making are interactive processes, yet cognitive modelling of error-driven learning and decision making have largely evolved separately. Recently, evidence accumulation models (EAMs) of decision making and reinforcement learning (RL) models of error-driven learning have been combined into joint RL-EAMs that can in principle address these interactions. However, we show that the most commonly used combination, based on the diffusion decision model (DDM) for binary choice, consistently fails to capture crucial aspects of response times observed during reinforcement learning. We propose a new RL-EAM based on an advantage racing diffusion (ARD) framework for choices among two or more options that not only addresses this problem but captures stimulus difficulty, speed-accuracy trade-off, and stimulus-response-mapping reversal effects. The RL-ARD avoids fundamental limitations imposed by the DDM on addressing effects of absolute values of choices, as well as extensions beyond binary choice, and provides a computationally tractable basis for wider applications.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.12.294421v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Imaging of the brain in its native state at high resolution poses major challenges to visualization techniques. Two-photon microscopy integrated with the thinned-skull or optical clearing skull technique provides a minimally invasive tool for in vivo imaging of the cortex of mice without activating immune response and inducing brain injury. However, the imaging contrast and resolution are severely compromised by the optical heterogeneity of the skull, limiting the imaging depth to the superficial layer. Here, we develop adaptive optics two-photon microscopy for high-resolution transcranial imaging of layer 5 pyramidal neurons up to 700 m below pia in living mice. In particular, an optimized configuration of imaging system and new wavefront sensing algorithm are proposed for accurate correction for the aberrations induced by the skull window and brain tissue. We investigated microglia-plaque interaction in living brain of Alzheimer's disease and demonstrated high-precision laser dendrotomy and single-spine ablation.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Dissociable influences of reward and punishment on adaptive cognitive control</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.11.294157v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>When deciding how to allocate cognitive control to a given task, people must consider both positive outcomes (e.g., praise) and negative outcomes (e.g., admonishment). However, it is unclear how these two forms of incentives differentially influence the amount and type of cognitive control a person chooses to allocate to achieve task goals. To address this question, we had participants perform a self-paced incentivized cognitive control task, varying the magnitude of reward for a correct response and punishment for an incorrect response. Formalizing control allocation as a process of adjusting parameters of a drift diffusion model (DDM), we show that participants engaged in different strategies in response to reward (primarily adjusting drift rate) versus punishment (primarily adjusting response threshold). We demonstrate that this divergent set of strategies is optimal for maximizing reward rate while minimizing effort costs. Finally, we show that these dissociable patterns of behavior enable us to infer the motivational salience of positive versus negative incentives for a given individual. These results provide a normative and mechanistic account for how reward and punishment differentially influence the adaptive allocation of cognitive control.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.11.293951v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was initially described as a viral infection of the respiratory tract. It is now known, however, that many other biological systems are affected, including the central nervous system (CNS). Neurological manifestations such as stroke, encephalitis, and psychiatric conditions have been reported in COVID-19 patients, but its neurotropic potential is still debated. Here, we investigate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the brain from an infant patient deceased from COVID-19. The susceptibility to virus infection was compatible with the expression levels of viral receptor ACE2, which is increased in the ChP in comparison to other brain areas. To better comprehend the dynamics of the viral infection in neural cells, we exposed human neurospheres to SARS-CoV-2. Similarly to the human tissue, we found viral RNA in neurospheres, although viral particles in the culture supernatant were not infective. Based on our observations in vivo and in vitro, we hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 does not generate productive infection in developing neural cells and that infection of ChP weakens the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier allowing viruses, immune cells, and cytokines to access the CNS, causing neural damage in the young brain.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Distributional Transformation improves Decoding Accuracy when Predicting Chronological Age from Structural MRI</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.11.293811v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>When predicting a certain subject-level variable (e.g. age in years) from measured biological data (e.g. structural MRI scans), the decoding algorithm does not always preserve the distribution of the variable to predict. In such a situation, distributional transformation (DT), i.e. mapping the predicted values to the variable's distribution in the training data, might improve decoding accuracy. Here, we tested the potential of DT within the 2019 Predictive Analytics Competition (PAC) which aimed at predicting chronological age of adult human subjects from structural MRI data. In a low-dimensional setting, i.e. with less features than observations, we applied multiple linear regression, support vector regression and deep neural networks for out-of-sample prediction of subject age. We found that (i) when the number of features is low, no method outperforms linear regression; and (ii) except when using deep regression, distributional transformation increases decoding performance, reducing the mean absolute error (MAE) by about half a year. We conclude that DT can be advantageous when predicting variables that are non-controlled, but have an underlying distribution in healthy or diseased populations.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Behavioral Time Scale Plasticity of Place Fields: Mathematical Analysis</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.11.293787v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Traditional synaptic plasticity experiments and models depend on tight temporal correlations between pre- and postsynaptic activity. These tight temporal correlations, on the order of tens of milliseconds, are incompatible with significantly longer behavioral time scales, and as such might not be able to account for plasticity induced by behavior. Indeed, recent findings in hippocampus suggest that rapid, bidirectional synaptic plasticity which modifies place fields in CA1 operates at behavioral time scales. These experimental results suggest that presynaptic activity generates synaptic eligibility traces both for potentiation and depression, which last on the order of seconds. These traces can be converted to changes in synaptic efficacies by the activation of an instructive signal that depends on naturally occurring or experimentally induced plateau potentials. We have developed a simple mathematical model that is consistent with these observations. This model can be fully analyzed to find the fixed points of induced place fields, the convergence to these fixed points, and how these fixed points depend on system parameters such as the size and shape of presynaptic place fields, the animal's velocity, and the parameters of the plasticity rule.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Sensory feedback-dependent coding of arm position in local field potentials of the posterior parietal cortex</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.11.293365v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Although multisensory integration is crucial for sensorimotor function, it is still unclear how sensory cues provided by the visual and proprioceptive systems are combined in the brain during motor behaviors. Here we characterized the effects of multisensory interactions on local field potential (LFP) activity obtained from the superior parietal lobule (SPL) as non-human primates performed an arm position maintenance task with either unimodal (proprioceptive) or bimodal (visual-proprioceptive) sensory feedback. Based on previous analyses of spiking activity, and observations that LFP and spikes are highly correlated in some cortical areas, we hypothesized that evoked LFP responses would be tuned to arm location but would be suppressed on bimodal trials, relative to unimodal trials. We also expected to see a substantial number of recording sites with enhanced beta band spectral power for only one set of feedback conditions, as was previously observed for spiking activity. We found that evoked activity and beta band power were tuned to arm location at many individual sites, though this tuning often differed between unimodal and bimodal trials. At the population level, both evoked and beta band activity were consistent with feedback-dependent tuning to arm location, while beta band activity also showed evidence of suppression on bimodal trials. The results suggest that multisensory interactions can alter the tuning and gain of arm position-related LFP activity in the SPL and that this activity can be used to decode the arm location under varying sensory conditions.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Chronic Exposure to Glucocorticoids Induces Suboptimal Decision-Making in Mice</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.11.293217v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Anxio-depressive symptoms as well as severe cognitive dysfunction including aberrant decision-making (DM) are documented in neuropsychiatric patients with hypercortisolaemia. Yet, the influence of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis on DM processes remains poorly understood. As a tractable mean to approach this human condition, adult male C57BL/6JRj mice were chronically treated with corticosterone (CORT) prior to behavioural, physiological and neurobiological evaluation. The behavioural data indicate that chronic CORT delays the acquisition of contingencies required to orient responding towards optimal DM performance in a mouse Gambling Task (mGT). Specifically, CORT-treated animals show a longer exploration and a delayed onset of the optimal DM performance. Remarkably, the proportion of individuals performing suboptimally in the mGT is increased in the CORT condition. This variability seems to be better accounted for by variations in sensitivity to negative rather than to positive outcome. Besides, CORT-treated animals perform worse than control animals in a spatial working memory (WM) paradigm and in a motor learning task. Finally, Western blotting neurobiological analyses show that chronic CORT downregulates glucocorticoid receptor expression in the medial Prefrontal Cortex (mPFC). Besides, corticotropin-releasing factor signalling in the mPFC of CORT individuals negatively correlates with their DM performance. Collectively, this study describes how chronic exposure to glucocorticoids induces suboptimal DM under uncertainty in a mGT, hampers WM and motor learning processes, thus affecting specific emotional, motor, cognitive and neurobiological endophenotypic dimensions relevant for precision medicine in biological psychiatry.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Does pericentral mu-rhythm power corticomotor excitability? A matter of EEG perspective</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.11.292789v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Electroencephalography (EEG) and single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (spTMS) of the primary motor hand area (M1-HAND) have been combined to explore whether the instantaneous expression of pericentral mu-rhythm drives fluctuations in corticomotor excitability, but this line of research has yielded diverging results. Objectives: To re-assess the relationship between the mu-rhythm power expressed in left pericentral cortex and the amplitude of motor potentials (MEP) evoked with spTMS in left M1-HAND. Methods: 15 non-preselected healthy young participants received spTMS to the motor hot spot of left M1-HAND. Regional expression of mu-rhythm was estimated online based on a radial source at motor hotspot and informed the timing of spTMS which was applied either during epochs belonging to the highest or lowest quartile of regionally expressed mu-power. Using MEP amplitude as dependent variable, we computed a linear mixed-effects model, which included mu-power and mu-phase at the time of stimulation and the inter-stimulus interval (ISI) as fixed effects and subject as a random effect. Mu-phase was estimated by post-hoc sorting of trials into four discrete phase bins. We performed a follow-up analysis on the same EEG-triggered MEP data set in which we isolated mu-power at the sensor level using a Laplacian montage centered on the electrode above the M1-HAND. Results: Pericentral mu-power traced as radial source at motor hot spot did not significantly modulate the MEP, but mu-power determined by the surface Laplacian did, showing a positive relation between mu-power and MEP amplitude. In neither case, there was an effect of mu-phase on MEP amplitude.</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Immunohistochemical staining for vesicular glutamate transporter 2 reveals the glomeruli in the main olfactory bulb of the brain of the African wild dog. Stereological estimates of the numbers of glomeruli reveal that the African wild dog has up to 1700 glomeruli. Scale bar = 250 μm.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employing a range of neuroanatomical stains, we detail the organization of the main and accessory olfactory systems of the African wild dog. The organization of both these systems follows that typically observed in mammals, but variations of interest were noted. Within the main olfactory bulb, the size of the glomeruli, at approximately 350 μm in diameter, are on the larger end of the range observed across mammals. In addition, we estimate that approximately 3,500 glomeruli are present in each main olfactory bulb. This larger main olfactory bulb glomerular size and number of glomeruli indicates that enhanced peripheral processing of a broad range of odorants is occurring in the main olfactory bulb of the African wild dog. Within the accessory olfactory bulb, the glomeruli did not appear distinct, rather forming a homogenous syncytia‐like arrangement as seen in the domestic dog. In addition, the laminar organization of the deeper layers of the accessory olfactory bulb was indistinct, perhaps as a consequence of the altered architecture of the glomeruli. This arrangement of glomeruli indicates that rather than parcellating the processing of semiochemicals peripherally, these odorants may be processed in a more nuanced and combinatorial manner in the periphery, allowing for more rapid and precise behavioral responses as required in the highly social group structure observed in the African wild dog. While having a similar organization to that of other mammals, the olfactory system of the African wild dog has certain features that appear to correlate to their environmental niche.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Schwann cells (SCs) were found to have sensory and motor phenotypes and associated with the modality specific promotion of sensory and motor nerve regeneration. To explore the differences between them, we established a workflow to obtain highly purified SCs derived from sensory nerve (SNdSCs) and motor nerve (MNdSCs) from B6; D2‐Tg(s100B‐EGFP)1Wjt/J mice. The SNdSCs and MNdSCs were isolated from dorsal and ventral roots by FACS sorting. The proteome of SNdSCs and MNdSCs was compared by a quantitative proteomic analysis based on iTRAQ labeling and the mouse Schwann proteome was obtained. Several differentially expressed proteins between SNdSCs and MNdSCs were verified.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwann cells (SCs) are myelin‐forming glial cells of the peripheral nervous system. Recent studies suggested that SCs comprise two phenotypes: sensory SCs and motor SCs, which are associated with the modality‐specific promotion of sensory and motor axon growth during peripheral neuronal regeneration. However, the molecular basis of the two phenotypic SCs is unclear. We established a workflow to obtain highly purified SCs derived from sensory nerve (SNdSCs) and motor nerve (MNdSCs) from B6; D2‐Tg(s100B‐EGFP)1Wjt/J mice. Subsequently, a quantitative proteomic analysis based on iTRAQ labeling was performed to compare the proteome of SNdSCs and MNdSCs. A total of 6,567 proteins were identified, of which 63 and 11 proteins were overexpressed in SNdSCs and MNdSCs, respectively. Three of the overexpressed proteins were further validated by western blot and immunocytochemistry: GMFB and CNPase, which were overexpressed in sensory SNdSCs, and histone H4, which was overexpressed in MNdSCs. The expression pattern of the three proteins was also validated in the dorsal roots and ventral roots. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that proteins highly expressed in SNdSCs are mainly involved in RNA processing and protein synthesis, while those overexpressed in MNdSCs are related to cell proliferation. Real‐time cell analysis confirmed that the proliferation activity of MNdSCs is higher than that of SNdSCs. This study is the first to provide a proteomic view of the differential phenotype of mouse SNdSCs and MNdSCs. The data may serve as a valuable source for the study of the biological characteristics of these two SC phenotypes and their roles in nerve‐specific regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The brain can rapidly process and transfer information between cortical brain networks by dynamically transitioning between brain states. Here we study the switching activity between functional brain networks that have been estimated at various spatial scales from n = 100 to n = 1000 using resting-state fMRI data. We also generate timeseries at different temporal scales from milliseconds to seconds using whole-brain modelling. We calculate the entropy of switching activity between functional brain networks which represents the richness of the dynamical repertoire. We provide evidence that the entropy of functional network occurrence follows an inverted U-shaped curve with a maximum at a spatial scale between 200 and 300 regions and at a temporal scale of 200 milliseconds.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.11.293878v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Naturalistic stimuli, such as movies, activate a substantial portion of the human brain, invoking a response shared across individuals. Encoding models that predict the neural response to a given stimulus can be very useful for studying brain function. However, existing neural encoding models focus on limited aspects of naturalistic stimuli, ignoring the complex and dynamic interactions of modalities in this inherently context-rich paradigm. Using movie watching data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP, N=158) database, we build group-level models of neural activity that incorporate several inductive biases about information processing in the brain, including hierarchical processing, assimilation over longer timescales and multi-sensory auditory-visual interactions. We demonstrate how incorporating this joint information leads to remarkable prediction performance across large areas of the cortex, well beyond the visual and auditory cortices into multi-sensory sites and frontal cortex. Furthermore, we illustrate that encoding models learn high-level concepts that generalize remarkably well to alternate task-bound paradigms. Taken together, our findings underscore the potential of neural encoding models as a powerful tool for studying brain function in ecologically valid conditions.</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Location and size of preterm cerebellar hemorrhage and childhood development</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25899?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To examine the association between cerebellar hemorrhage (CBH) &lt;i&gt;size&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;location&lt;/i&gt; and preschool‐age neurodevelopment in very preterm neonates.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preterm MRIs of 221 very preterm neonates (median GA 27.9) were manually segmented for CBH quantification and location. Neurodevelopmental assessments at chronological age 4.5 years included motor (MABC‐2), visuomotor integration (Beery VMI‐6), cognitive (WPPSI‐III), and behavioral (CBCL) outcomes. Multivariable linear regression models examined the association between CBH size and 4.5‐year outcomes accounting for sex, gestational age, and supratentorial injury. Probabilistic maps assessed CBH location and likelihood of a lesion to predict adverse outcome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty‐six neonates had CBH: 14 (6%) with only punctate CBH and 22 (10%) with ≥1 larger CBH. CBH occurred mostly in the inferior aspect of the posterior lobes. CBH total volume was independently associated with MABC‐2 motor scores at 4.5 years (β=‐0.095, 95% CI [‐0.184, ‐0.005]) with a standardized β coefficient (‐0.16) that was similar to that of white matter injury volume (standardized β=‐0.22). CBH size was similarly associated with visuomotor integration and externalizing behavior but not cognition. Voxel‐wise odds ratio and lesion‐symptom maps demonstrated that CBH extending more deeply into the cerebellum predicted adverse motor, visuomotor, and behavioral outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CBH size and location on preterm MRI were associated with reduced preschool motor and visuomotor function and more externalizing behavior independent of supratentorial brain injury in a dose‐dependent fashion. The volumetric quantification and localisation of CBH, even when punctate, may allow opportunity to improve motor and behavioral outcomes by providing targeted intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Sensitivity–Specificity of Tau and Amyloid β Positron Emission Tomography in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25893?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To examine associations between tau and amyloid β (Aβ) molecular positron emission tomography (PET) and both Alzheimer‐related pathology and 4‐repeat tau pathology in autopsy‐confirmed frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty‐four patients had [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]‐flortaucipir–PET and died with FTLD (progressive supranuclear palsy [PSP], n = 10; corticobasal degeneration [CBD], n = 10; FTLD‐TDP, n = 3; and Pick disease, n = 1). All but 1 had Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)‐PET. Braak staging, Aβ plaque and neurofibrillary tangle counts, and semiquantitative tau lesion scores were performed. Flortaucipir standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were calculated in a temporal meta region of interest (meta‐ROI), entorhinal cortex and cortical/subcortical regions selected to match the tau lesion analysis. Global PiB SUVR was calculated. Autoradiography was performed in 1 PSP patient, with digital pathology used to quantify tau burden.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nine cases (37.5%) had Aβ plaques. Global PiB SUVR correlated with Aβ plaque count, with 100% specificity and 50% sensitivity for diffuse plaques. Twenty‐one (87.5%) had Braak stages I to IV. Flortaucipir correlated with neurofibrillary tangle counts in entorhinal cortex, but entorhinal and meta‐ROI SUVRs were not elevated in Braak IV or primary age‐related tauopathy. Flortaucipir uptake patterns differed across FTLD pathologies and could separate PSP and CBD. Flortaucipir correlated with tau lesion score in red nucleus and midbrain tegmentum across patients, but not in cortical or basal ganglia regions. Autoradiography demonstrated minimal uptake of flortaucipir, although flortaucipir correlated with quantitative tau burden across regions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular PET shows expected correlations with Alzheimer‐related pathology but lacks sensitivity to detect mild Alzheimer pathology in FTLD. Regional flortaucipir uptake was able to separate CBD and PSP. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Age‐related alterations in functional connectivity along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus and its subfields</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23259?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal circuit alterations that differentially affect hippocampal subfields are associated with age‐related memory decline. Additionally, functional organization along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus has revealed distinctions between anterior and posterior (A‐P) connectivity. Here, we examined the functional connectivity (FC) differences between young and older adults at high‐resolution within the medial temporal lobe network (entorhinal, perirhinal, and parahippocampal cortices), allowing us to explore how hippocampal subfield connectivity across the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus changes with age. Overall, we found reliably greater connectivity for younger adults than older adults between the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex (PHC) and perirhinal cortex (PRC). This drop in functional connectivity was more pronounced in the anterior regions of the hippocampus than the posterior ones, consistent for each of the hippocampal subfields. Further, intra‐hippocampal connectivity also reflected an age‐related decrease in functional connectivity within the anterior hippocampus in older adults that was offset by an increase in posterior hippocampal functional connectivity. Interestingly, the anterior–posterior dysfunction in older adults between hippocampus and PHC was predictive of lure discrimination performance on the Mnemonic similarity task (MST), suggesting a role in memory performance. While age‐related dysfunction within the hippocampal subfields has been well‐documented, these results suggest that the age‐related dysfunction in hippocampal connectivity across the longitudinal axis may also contribute significantly to memory decline in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Sequencing analysis for the lesion site of the rat SCI model revealed that the injury significantly stimulated the expression of circRNA‐2960, which acted as a miRNA‐124 sponge to regulate the downstream pathways. Increased circRNA‐2960 expression in SCI decreased the activity of miRNA‐124, which further promoted neuroinflammation and apoptosis

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent studies have shown that circular RNAs (circRNAs) are involved in many human diseases, but their roles in secondary damage after spinal cord injury (SCI) remain unclear. In the current study circRNA sequencing was performed in the damaged tissues of SCI rats on the seventh day after injury, and related molecular mechanisms were investigated. Quantitative PCR validations of molecules that exhibited significantly altered expression in SCI mice were performed. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses were conducted to assess differentially expressed circRNAs. A novel circRNA‐2960 was the most significantly upregulated in the SCI group. It could downregulate its target molecule miRNA‐124, then exacerbate the inflammatory response and induce apoptosis at the lesion site. Disrupting circRNA‐2960 expression promoted recovery of tissues affected by secondary SCI damage. The results of the present study may provide new insight into the mechanisms of secondary injury in SCI, and a new molecular marker for the diagnosis and treatment of SCI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Social defeat stress induces sex‐specific inflammatory cytokine/chemokine responses in the periphery and sex‐specific transcriptional regulation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Treatment with dihydrocaffeic acid/malvidin‐glucoside modulates periphery inflammation and gene expression in the prefrontal cortex and alleviates depression‐like phenotype. CSDS, chronic social defeat stress; DHCA, dihydrocaffeic acid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major depressive disorder affects ~20% of the world population and is characterized by strong sexual dimorphism with females being two to three times more likely to develop this disorder. Previously, we demonstrated that a combination therapy with dihydrocaffeic acid and malvidin‐glucoside to synergistically target peripheral inflammation and stress‐induced synaptic maladaptation in the brain was effective in alleviating chronic social defeat stress (CSDS)‐induced depression‐like phenotype in male mice. Here, we test the combination therapy in a female CSDS model for depression and compared sex‐specific responses to stress in the periphery and the central nervous system. Similar to male mice, the combination treatment is also effective in promoting resilience against the CSDS‐induced depression‐like behavior in female mice. However, there are sex‐specific differences in peripheral immune responses and differential gene regulation in the prefrontal cortex to chronic stress and to the treatment. These data indicate that while therapeutic approaches to combat stress‐related disorders may be effective in both sexes, the mechanisms underlying these effects differ, emphasizing the need for inclusion of both sexes in preclinical studies using animal models.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Deep Brain Stimulation for Chronic Cluster Headache: Meta‐Analysis of Individual Patient Data</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25887?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a treatment option for refractory chronic cluster headache (CCH). Despite several recent prospective case series reporting a good outcome, the effectiveness and the optimal stimulation target of DBS for CCH remain unclear. We aimed to obtain precise estimates and predictors of long‐term pain relief in an individual patient data meta‐analysis. Furthermore, we aimed to construct a probabilistic stimulation map of effective DBS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We invited investigators of published cohorts of patients undergoing DBS for CCH, identified by a systematic review of MEDLINE from inception to Febuary 15, 2019, to provide individual patient data on baseline covariates, pre‐ and postoperative headache scores at median (12‐month) and long‐term follow‐up, in addition to individual imaging data to obtain individual electrode positions. We calculated a stimulation map using voxel‐wise statistical analysis. We used multiple regression analysis to estimate predictors of pain relief.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among 40 patients from four different cohorts representing ~50% of all previously published cases, we found a significant 77% mean reduction in headache attack frequency over a mean follow‐up of 44 months, with an overall response rate of 75%. Positive outcome was not associated with baseline covariates. We identified 2 hotspots of stimulation covering the midbrain ventral and retrorubral tegmentum.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study supports the hypothesis that DBS provides long‐term pain relief for the majority of CCH patients. Our stimulation map of the region of influence of therapeutic DBS identified an optimal anatomical target site that can help surgeons to guide their surgical planning in the future.

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Development and migration of the zebrafish rhombencephalic octavolateral efferent neurons</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25021?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Development and migration of the zebrafish rhombencephalic octavolateral efferent neurons&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/49422eee-17be-4e2d-92b7-dca59ead60ba/cne25021-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we provide an overview of rhombencephalic octavolateral efferent neuron (OEN) development in the zebrafish. OENs are born in two groups: the rostral (REN) group is born in r4 with the facial branchiomotor neurons (FBMNs), while the caudal (CEN) group is born in r5. From there, the OENs migrate alongside the FBMNs to r6 and r7, where they cluster into bilateral nuclei. However, we identify several key differences between the mechanisms OENs and FBMNs use to migrate.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In vertebrate animals, motor and sensory efferent neurons carry information from the central nervous system (CNS) to peripheral targets. These two types of efferent systems sometimes bear a close resemblance, sharing common segmental organization, axon pathways, and chemical messengers. Here, we focus on the development of the octavolateral efferent neurons (OENs) and their interactions with the closely‐related facial branchiomotor neurons (FBMNs) in zebrafish. Using live‐imaging approaches, we investigate the birth, migration, and projection patterns of OENs. We find that OENs are born in two distinct groups: a group of rostral efferent neurons (RENs) that arises in the fourth segment, or rhombomere (r4), of the hindbrain and a group of caudal efferent neurons (CENs) that arises in r5. Both RENs and CENs then migrate posteriorly through the hindbrain between 18 and 48 hrs postfertilization, alongside the r4‐derived FBMNs. Like the FBMNs, migration of the r4‐derived RENs depends on function of the segmental identity gene &lt;i&gt;hoxb1a&lt;/i&gt;; unlike the FBMNs, however, both OEN populations move independently of &lt;i&gt;prickle1b&lt;/i&gt;. Further, we investigate whether the previously described “pioneer” neuron that leads FBMN migration through the hindbrain is an r4‐derived FBMN/REN or an r5‐derived CEN. Our experiments verify that the pioneer is an r4‐derived neuron and reaffirm its role in leading FBMN migration across the r4/5 border. In contrast, the r5‐derived CENs migrate independently of the pioneer. Together, these results indicate that the mechanisms OENs use to navigate the hindbrain differ significantly from those employed by FBMNs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Photoreceptor morphology and anatomy, including their density distribution and orientation were studied in the skate &lt;i&gt;Leucoraja erinacea&lt;/i&gt;. In addition to a dorsal visual streak, which is typical in elasmobranchs, photoreceptors were noticeably tilted, a finding that has to date not received much attention. Skate &lt;i&gt;L. erinacea&lt;/i&gt; (left), and image of a whole‐mounted retina showing retinal photoreceptors (right).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studying retinal specializations offers insights into eye functionality and visual ecology. Using light microscopic techniques, including retinal whole‐mounts, we investigated photoreceptor densities in the retina of the skate &lt;i&gt;Leucoraja erinacea.&lt;/i&gt; We show that photoreceptors are not sized or oriented in the same way, and that they are not evenly distributed across the retina. There was a dorsally located horizontal visual streak with increased photoreceptor density, with additional local maxima in which densities were highest. Photoreceptors were longest and thinnest inside this visual streak, becoming shorter and thicker toward the periphery and toward the ventral retina. Furthermore, in the peripheral retinal parts, photoreceptors (particularly the outer segments) were noticeably tilted with respect to the retinal long axis. In order to understand how photoreceptors are tilted inside the eye, we used computerized tomography (CT) and micro‐CT, to obtain geometrical dimensions of the whole skate eye. These CT/micro‐CT data provided us with the outlines of the skate eye and the location of the retina and this enabled us to reconstruct how photoreceptors tilt in an intact eye. Findings were analyzed relative to previously published ganglion cell distributions in this species, showing a posteriorly located retinal area with photoreceptor: ganglion cell convergence as low as 39:1. Some peripheral areas showed ratios as high as 391:1. We frame our findings in terms of the animal's anatomy: body and eye shape, specifically the location of the tapetum, as well as the visual demands associated with lifestyle and habitat type. A speculative function in polarization sensitivity is discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep neural networks excel at finding hierarchical representations that solve
complex tasks over large data sets. How can we humans understand these learned
representations? In this work, we present network dissection, an analytic
framework to systematically identify the semantics of individual hidden units
within image classification and image generation networks. First, we analyze a
convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on scene classification and discover
units that match a diverse set of object concepts. We find evidence that the
network has learned many object classes that play crucial roles in classifying
scene classes. Second, we use a similar analytic method to analyze a generative
adversarial network (GAN) model trained to generate scenes. By analyzing
changes made when small sets of units are activated or deactivated, we find
that objects can be added and removed from the output scenes while adapting to
the context. Finally, we apply our analytic framework to understanding
adversarial attacks and to semantic image editing.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: A Network Guided-Reaction Diffusion-Model of AT[N] Biomarkers in Alzheimer's Disease. (arXiv:2009.04854v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04854</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Currently, many studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are investigating the
neurobiological factors behind the acquisition of beta-amyloid (A), pathologic
tau (T), and neurodegeneration ([N]) biomarkers from neuroimages. However, a
system-level mechanism of how these neuropathological burdens promote
neurodegeneration and why AD exhibits characteristic progression is largely
elusive. In this study, we combined the power of systems biology and network
neuroscience to understand the dynamic interaction and diffusion process of
AT[N] biomarkers from an unprecedented amount of longitudinal Amyloid PET scan,
MRI imaging, and DTI data. Specifically, we developed a network-guided
biochemical model to jointly (1) model the interaction of AT[N] biomarkers at
each brain region and (2) characterize their propagation pattern across the
fiber pathways in the structural brain network, where the brain resilience is
also considered as a moderator of cognitive decline. Our biochemical model
offers a greater mathematical insight to understand the physiopathological
mechanism of AD progression by studying the system dynamics and stability.
Thus, an in-depth system-level analysis allows us to gain a new understanding
of how AT[N] biomarkers spread throughout the brain, capture the early sign of
cognitive decline, and predict the AD progression from the preclinical stage.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sketch drawings are an intuitive visual domain that generally preserves
semantics. Previous work has shown that recurrent neural networks are capable
of producing sketch drawings of a single or few classes at a time. In this work
we focus on the representations developed by training a generative model to
produce sketches from pixel images across many classes in a sketch domain. We
find that the embeddings learned by this sketching model are extremely
informative for visual tasks and infer compositional information. We then use
them to exceed state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised few-shot
classification on the Omniglot and mini-ImageNet benchmarks. We also leverage
the generative capacity of our model to produce high quality sketches of novel
classes based on just a single example.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04765</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain decoding, understood as the process of mapping brain activities to the
stimuli that generated them, has been an active research area in the last
years. In the case of language stimuli, recent studies have shown that it is
possible to decode fMRI scans into an embedding of the word a subject is
reading. However, such word embeddings are designed for natural language
processing tasks rather than for brain decoding. Therefore, they limit our
ability to recover the precise stimulus. In this work, we propose to directly
classify an fMRI scan, mapping it to the corresponding word within a fixed
vocabulary. Unlike existing work, we evaluate on scans from previously unseen
subjects. We argue that this is a more realistic setup and we present a model
that can decode fMRI data from unseen subjects. Our model achieves 5.22% Top-1
and 13.59% Top-5 accuracy in this challenging task, significantly outperforming
all the considered competitive baselines. Furthermore, we use the decoded words
to guide language generation with the GPT-2 model. This way, we advance the
quest for a system that translates brain activities into coherent text.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: On Artificial Life and Emergent Computation in Physical Substrates. (arXiv:2009.04518v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04518</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In living systems, we often see the emergence of the ingredients necessary
for computation -- the capacity for information transmission, storage, and
modification -- begging the question of how we may exploit or imitate such
biological systems in unconventional computing applications. What can we gain
from artificial life in the advancement of computing technology? Artificial
life provides us with powerful tools for understanding the dynamic behavior of
biological systems and capturing this behavior in manmade substrates. With this
approach, we can move towards a new computing paradigm concerned with
harnessing emergent computation in physical substrates not governed by the
constraints of Moore's law and ultimately realize massively parallel and
distributed computing technology. In this paper, we argue that the lens of
artificial life offers valuable perspectives for the advancement of
high-performance computing technology. We first present a brief foundational
background on artificial life and some relevant tools that may be applicable to
unconventional computing. Two specific substrates are then discussed in detail:
biological neurons and ensembles of nanomagnets. These substrates are the focus
of the authors' ongoing work, and they are illustrative of the two sides of the
approach outlined here -- the close study of living systems and the
construction of artificial systems to produce life-like behaviors. We conclude
with a philosophical discussion on what we can learn from approaching
computation with the curiosity inherent to the study of artificial life. The
main contribution of this paper is to present the great potential of using
artificial life methodologies to uncover and harness the inherent computational
power of physical substrates toward applications in unconventional
high-performance computing.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13376</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We provide two characterizations, one axiomatic and the other
neuro-computational, of the dependence of choice probabilities on deadlines,
within the widely used softmax representation \[ p_{t}\left( a,A\right)
=\dfrac{e^{\frac{u\left( a\right) }{\lambda \left( t\right) }+\alpha \left(
a\right) }}{\sum_{b\in A}e^{\frac{u\left( b\right) }{\lambda \left( t\right)
}+\alpha \left( b\right) }}% \] where $p_{t}\left( a,A\right) $ is the
probability that alternative $a$ is selected from the set $A$ of feasible
alternatives if $t$ is the time available to decide, $\lambda$ is a time
dependent noise parameter measuring the unit cost of information, $u$ is a time
independent utility function, and $\alpha$ is an alternative-specific bias that
determines the initial choice probabilities and possibly reflects prior
information.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our axiomatic analysis provides a behavioral foundation of softmax (also
known as Multinomial Logit Model when $\alpha$ is constant). Our
neuro-computational derivation provides a biologically inspired algorithm that
may explain the emergence of softmax in choice behavior. Jointly, the two
approaches provide a thorough understanding of soft-maximization in terms of
internal causes (neurophysiological mechanisms) and external effects (testable
implications).

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04559</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We study the question of how concepts that have structure get represented in
the brain. Specifically, we introduce a model for hierarchically structured
concepts and we show how a biologically plausible neural network can recognize
these concepts, and how it can learn them in the first place. Our main goal is
to introduce a general framework for these tasks and prove formally how both
(recognition and learning) can be achieved.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We show that both tasks can be accomplished even in presence of noise. For
learning, we analyze Oja's rule formally, a well-known biologically-plausible
rule for adjusting the weights of synapses. We complement the learning results
with lower bounds asserting that, in order to recognize concepts of a certain
hierarchical depth, neural networks must have a corresponding number of layers.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Learning differentially reorganizes brain activity and connectivity. (arXiv:1810.08840v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08840</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human learning is a complex process in which future behavior is altered via
the reorganization of brain activity and connectivity. It remains unknown
whether activity and connectivity differentially reorganize during learning,
and, if so, how that differential reorganization tracks stages of learning
across distinct brain areas. Here, we address this gap in knowledge by
measuring brain activity and functional connectivity in a longitudinal fMRI
experiment in which healthy adult human participants learn the values of novel
objects over the course of four days. An increasing similarity in activity or
functional connectivity across subjects during learning reflects reorganization
toward a common functional architecture. We assessed the presence of
reorganization in activity and connectivity both during value learning and
during the resting-state, allowing us to differentiate common elicited
processes from intrinsic processes. We found a complex and dynamic
reorganization of brain connectivity and activity--as a function of time,
space, and performance--that occurs while subjects learn. Spatially localized
brain activity reorganizes across the brain to a common functional architecture
early in learning, and this reorganization tracks early learning performance.
In contrast, spatially distributed connectivity reorganizes across the brain to
a common functional architecture as training progresses, and this
reorganization tracks later learning performance. Particularly good performance
is associated with a sticky connectivity, that persists into the resting state.
Broadly, our work uncovers distinct principles of reorganization in activity
and connectivity at different phases of value learning, which inform the
ongoing study of learning processes more generally.

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Histone Deacetylase 6 and the Disease Mechanisms of α-Synucleinopathies</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.586453</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The abnormal accumulation of α-Synuclein (α-Syn) is a prominent pathological feature in a group of diseases called α-Synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and multiple system atrophy (MSA). The formation of Lewy bodies (LBs) and glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) in neurons and oligodendrocytes, respectively, is highly investigated. However, the molecular mechanisms behind α-Syn improper folding and aggregation remain unclear. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is a Class II deacetylase, containing two active catalytic domains and a ubiquitin-binding domain. The properties of HDAC6 and its exclusive cytoplasmic localization allow HDAC6 to modulate the microtubule dynamics, acting as a specific α-tubulin deacetylase. Also, HDAC6 can bind ubiquitinated proteins, facilitating the formation of the aggresome, a cellular defense mechanism to cope with higher levels of misfolded proteins. Several studies report that the aggresome shares similarities in size and composition with LBs and GCIs. HDAC6 is found to co-localize with α-Syn in neurons and in oligodendrocytes, together with other aggresome-related proteins. The involvement of HDAC6 in several neurodegenerative diseases is already under discussion, however, the results obtained by modulating HDAC6 activity are not entirely conclusive. The main goal of this review is to summarize and critically discuss previous in vitro and in vivo data regarding the specific role of HDAC6 in the context of α-Syn accumulation and protein aggregation in α-Synucleinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Food Anticipatory Activity on Circadian Time Scales Is Not Dependent on Central Serotonin: Evidence From Tryptophan Hydroxylase-2 and Serotonin Transporter Knockout Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.534238</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A number of studies implicate biogenic amines in regulating circadian rhythms. In particular, dopamine and serotonin influence the entrainment of circadian rhythms to daily food availability. To study circadian entrainment to feeding, food availability is typically restricted to a short period within the light cycle daily. This results in a notable increase in pre-meal activity, termed “food anticipatory activity” (FAA), which typically develops within about 1 week of scheduled feeding. Several studies have implicated serotonin as a negative regulator of FAA: (1) aged rats treated with serotonin 5-HT2 and 3 receptor antagonists showed enhanced FAA, (2) mice lacking for the 2C serotonin receptor demonstrate enhanced FAA, and (3) pharmacologically increased serotonin levels suppressed FAA while decreased serotonin levels enhanced FAA in mice. We sought to confirm and extend these findings using genetic models with impairments in central serotonin production or re-uptake, but were surprised to find that both serotonin transporter (Slc6a4) and tryptophan hydroxylase-2 knockout mice demonstrated a normal behavioral response to timed, calorie restricted feeding. Our data suggest that FAA is largely independent of central serotonin and/or serotonin reuptake and that serotonin may not be a robust negative regulator of FAA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: NWB Query Engines: Tools to Search Data Stored in Neurodata Without Borders Format</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.00027</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Neurodata Without Borders (abbreviation NWB) format is a current technology for storing neurophysiology data along with the associated metadata. Data stored in the format is organized into separate HDF5 files, each file usually storing the data associated with a single recording session. While the NWB format provides a structured method for storing data, so far there have not been tools which enable searching a collection of NWB files in order to find data of interest for a particular purpose. We describe here three tools to enable searching NWB files. The tools have different features making each of them most useful for a particular task. The first tool, called the NWB Query Engine, is written in Java. It allows searching the complete content of NWB files. It was designed for the first version of NWB (NWB 1) and supports most (but not all) features of the most recent version (NWB 2). For some searches, it is the fastest tool. The second tool, called “search_nwb” is written in Python and also allow searching the complete contents of NWB files. It works with both NWB 1 and NWB 2, as does the third tool. The third tool, called “nwbindexer” enables searching a collection of NWB files using a two-step process. In the first step, a utility is run which creates an SQLite database containing the metadata in a collection of NWB files. This database is then searched in the second step, using another utility. Once the index is built, this two-step processes allows faster searches than are done by the other tools, but does not enable as complete of searches. All three tools use a simple query language which was developed for this project. Software integrating the three tools into a web-interface is provided which enables searching NWB files by submitting a web form.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.578546</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this article, we review recent advances in research on rhythm and musical beat perception, focusing on the role of predictive processes in auditory motor interactions. We suggest that experimental evidence of the motor system’s role in beat perception, including in passive listening, may be explained by the generation and maintenance of internal predictive models, concordant with the Active Inference framework of sensory processing. We highlight two complementary hypotheses for the neural underpinnings of rhythm perception: The Action Simulation for Auditory Prediction hypothesis (Patel and Iversen, 2014) and the Gradual Audiomotor Evolution hypothesis (Merchant and Honing, 2014) and review recent experimental progress supporting each of these hypotheses. While initial formulations of ASAP and GAE explain different aspects of beat-based timing–the involvement of motor structures in the absence of movement, and physical entrainment to an auditory beat respectively–we suggest that work under both hypotheses provide converging evidence toward understanding the predictive role of the motor system in the perception of rhythm, and the specific neural mechanisms involved. We discuss future experimental work necessary to further evaluate the causal neural mechanisms underlying beat and rhythm perception.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We aimed to enhance the performance of naming and sentence production in chronic post-stroke aphasia by tablet-based language training combined with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) conducted on non-consecutive days. We applied a deblocking method involved in stimulation–facilitation therapy to six participants with chronic aphasia who performed naming and sentence production tasks for impaired modalities, immediately after a spoken-word picture-matching task for an intact modality. The participants took part in two conditional sessions: a tDCS condition in which they performed a spoken word-picture matching task while we delivered an anodal tDCS over the left inferior frontal cortex; and a sham condition in which sham stimulation was delivered. We hypothesized that, compared with the sham stimulation, the application of anodal tDCS over the left inferior frontal cortex during the performance of tasks requiring access to semantic representations would enhance the deblocking effect, thereby improving the performances for subsequent naming and sentence production. Our results showed greater improvements 2 weeks after training with tDCS than those after training with sham stimulation. The accuracy rate of naming was significantly higher in the tDCS condition than in the sham condition, regardless of whether the words were trained or not. Also, we found a significant improvement in the production of related words and sentences for the untrained words in the tDCS condition, compared with that found pre-training, while in the sham condition we found no significant improvement compared with that found pre-training. These results support our hypothesis and suggest the effectiveness of the use of tDCS during language training on non-consecutive days.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Sex Differences in Neural Responses to the Perception of Social Interactions</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.565132</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Social interaction is critical to emotional well-being. Previous studies have suggested sex differences in the perception of social interaction. However, the findings depend on the nature of interactions and whether it involves facial emotions. Here, we explored sex differences in neural responses to the perception of social interaction using the Human Connectome Project data. Participants (n = 969, 505 women) were engaged in a social cognition task with geometric objects moving and colliding to simulate social interaction. Behaviorally, men relative to women demonstrated higher accuracy in perceiving social vs. random interactions. Men vs. women showed higher activation in the right superior temporal gyrus, bilateral occipital and posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus, and women vs. men showed higher activation in the right inferior frontal cortex, during exposure to social vs. random interactions. In whole-brain regressions, the differences in accuracy rate in identifying social vs. random interactions (AR&lt;sub&gt;SOC&lt;/sub&gt; – AR&lt;sub&gt;RAN&lt;/sub&gt;) were associated with higher activation in the paracentral lobule (PCL) and lower activation in bilateral anterior insula (AI), pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA), and left middle frontal gyrus (MFG) in men and women combined, lower activation in bilateral AI, preSMA and left MFG in men alone, and higher activation in the PCL and the medial orbitofrontal cortex in women alone. The latter sex differences were confirmed by slope tests. Further, the PCL activity mediated the correlation between an internalizing syndromal score, as assessed by the Achenbach Self-Report, and (AR&lt;sub&gt;SOC&lt;/sub&gt; – AR&lt;sub&gt;RAN&lt;/sub&gt;) across all subjects. These findings highlighted sex differences in the behavioral and neural processes underlying the perception of social interaction, as well as the influence of internalizing traits on these processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: A Theoretical Framework for How We Learn Aesthetic Values</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00345</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;How do we come to like the things that we do? Each one of us starts from a relatively similar state at birth, yet we end up with vastly different sets of aesthetic preferences. These preferences go on to define us both as individuals and as members of our cultures. Therefore, it is important to understand how aesthetic preferences form over our lifetimes. This poses a challenging problem: to understand this process, one must account for the many factors at play in the formation of aesthetic values and how these factors influence each other over time. A general framework based on basic neuroscientific principles that can also account for this process is needed. Here, we present such a framework and illustrate it through a model that accounts for the trajectories of aesthetic values over time. Our framework is inspired by meta-analytic data of neuroimaging studies of aesthetic appraisal. This framework incorporates effects of sensory inputs, rewards, and motivational states. Crucially, each one of these effects is probabilistic. We model their interactions under a reinforcement-learning circuitry. Simulations of this model and mathematical analysis of the framework lead to three main findings. First, different people may develop distinct weighing of aesthetic variables because of individual variability in motivation. Second, individuals from different cultures and environments may develop different aesthetic values because of unique sensory inputs and social rewards. Third, because learning is stochastic, stemming from probabilistic sensory inputs, motivations, and rewards, aesthetic values vary in time. These three theoretical findings account for different lines of empirical research. Through our study, we hope to provide a general and unifying framework for understanding the various aspects involved in the formation of aesthetic values over time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Retrospective Evaluation of Sequential Events and the Influence of Preference-Dependent Working Memory: A Computational Examination</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00065</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Humans organize sequences of events into a single overall experience, and evaluate the aggregated experience as a whole, such as a generally pleasant dinner, movie, or trip. However, such evaluations are potentially computationally taxing, and so our brains must employ heuristics (i.e., approximations). For example, the peak-end rule hypothesis suggests that we average the peaks and end of a sequential event vs. integrating every moment. However, there is no general model to test viable hypotheses quantitatively. Here, we propose a general model and test among multiple specific ones, while also examining the role of working memory. The models were tested with a novel picture-rating task. We first compared averaging across entire sequences vs. the peak-end heuristic. Correlation tests indicated that averaging prevailed, with peak and end both still having significant prediction power. Given this, we developed generalized order-dependent and relative-preference-dependent models to subsume averaging, peak and end. The combined model improved the prediction power. However, based on limitations of relative-preference—including imposing a potentially arbitrary ranking among preferences—we introduced an absolute-preference-dependent model, which successfully explained the remembered utilities. Yet, because using all experiences in a sequence requires too much memory as real-world settings scale, we then tested “windowed” models, i.e., evaluation within a specified window. The windowed (absolute) preference-dependent (WP) model explained the empirical data with long sequences better than without windowing. However, because fixed-windowed models harbor their own limitations—including an inability to capture peak-event influences beyond a fixed window—we then developed discounting models. With (absolute) preference-dependence added to the discounting rate, the results showed that the discounting model reflected the actual working memory of the participants, and that the preference-dependent discounting (PD) model described different features from the WP model. Taken together, we propose a combined WP-PD model as a means by which people evaluate experiences, suggesting preference-dependent working-memory as a significant factor underlying our evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Mitochondrial Unfolded Protein Response: A Hinge Between Healthy and Pathological Aging</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.581849</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aging is the time-dependent functional decline that increases the vulnerability to different forms of stress, constituting the major risk factor for the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Dysfunctional mitochondria significantly contribute to aging phenotypes, accumulating particularly in post-mitotic cells, including neurons. To cope with deleterious effects, mitochondria feature different mechanisms for quality control. One such mechanism is the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR&lt;sup&gt;MT&lt;/sup&gt;), which corresponds to the transcriptional activation of mitochondrial chaperones, proteases, and antioxidant enzymes to repair defective mitochondria. Transcription of target UPR&lt;sup&gt;MT&lt;/sup&gt; genes is epigenetically regulated by Histone 3-specific methylation. Age-dependency of this regulation could explain a differential UPR&lt;sup&gt;MT&lt;/sup&gt; activity in early developmental stages or aged organisms. At the same time, precise tuning of mitochondrial stress responses is crucial for maintaining neuronal homeostasis. However, compared to other mitochondrial and stress response programs, the role of UPR&lt;sup&gt;MT&lt;/sup&gt; in neurodegenerative disease is barely understood and studies in this topic are just emerging. In this review, we document the reported evidence characterizing the evolutionarily conserved regulation of the UPR&lt;sup&gt;MT&lt;/sup&gt; and summarize the recent advances in understanding the role of the pathway in neurodegenerative diseases and aging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Effects of Embryonic Inflammation and Adolescent Psychosocial Environment on Cognition and Hippocampal Staufen in Middle-Aged Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.578719</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Accumulating evidence has indicated that embryonic inflammation could accelerate age-associated cognitive impairment, which can be attributed to dysregulation of synaptic plasticity-associated proteins, such as RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Staufen is a double-stranded RBP that plays a critical role in the modulation of synaptic plasticity and memory. However, relatively few studies have investigated how embryonic inflammation affects cognition and neurobiology during aging, or how the adolescent psychosocial environment affects inflammation-induced remote cognitive impairment. Consequently, the aim of this study was to investigate whether these adverse factors can induce changes in Staufen expression, and whether these changes are correlated with cognitive impairment. In our study, CD-1 mice were administered lipopolysaccharides (LPS, 50 μg/kg) or an equal amount of saline (control) intraperitoneally during days 15–17 of gestation. At 2 months of age, male offspring were randomly exposed to stress (S), an enriched environment (E), or not treated (CON) and then assigned to five groups: LPS, LPS+S, LPS+E, CON, and CON+S. Mice were evaluated at 3-month-old (young) and 15-month-old (middle-aged). Cognitive function was assessed using the Morris water maze test, while Staufen expression was examined at both the protein and mRNA level using immunohistochemistry/western blotting and RNAscope technology, respectively. The results showed that the middle-aged mice had worse cognitive performance and higher Staufen expression than young mice. Embryonic inflammation induced cognitive impairment and increased Staufen expression in the middle-aged mice, whereas adolescent stress/an enriched environment would accelerated/mitigated these effects. Meanwhile, Staufen expression was closely correlated with cognitive performance. Our findings suggested embryonic inflammation can accelerate age-associated learning and memory impairments, and these effects may be related to the Staufen expression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

These visual changes involve both the afferent and efferent parts of the visual system, which correspond to the sensory and eye movement aspects of vision, respectively. There are fewer, but a growing number of studies, that focus on the detection of predementia stages. Visual biomarkers that detect these stages are paramount in the development of successful disease-modifying therapies by identifying appropriate research participants and in identifying those who would receive future therapies. This review provides a summary and update on common afferent and efferent visual markers of AD with a focus on mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and preclinical disease detection. We further propose future directions in this area. Given the ease of performing visual tests, the accessibility of the eye, and advances in ocular technology, visual measures have the potential to be effective, practical, and non-invasive biomarkers of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Cerebral Fructose Metabolism as a Potential Mechanism Driving Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.560865</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The loss of cognitive function in Alzheimer’s disease is pathologically linked with neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid deposition, and loss of neuronal communication. Cerebral insulin resistance and mitochondrial dysfunction have emerged as important contributors to pathogenesis supporting our hypothesis that cerebral fructose metabolism is a key initiating pathway for Alzheimer’s disease. Fructose is unique among nutrients because it activates a survival pathway to protect animals from starvation by lowering energy in cells in association with adenosine monophosphate degradation to uric acid. The fall in energy from fructose metabolism stimulates foraging and food intake while reducing energy and oxygen needs by decreasing mitochondrial function, stimulating glycolysis, and inducing insulin resistance. When fructose metabolism is overactivated systemically, such as from excessive fructose intake, this can lead to obesity and diabetes. Herein, we present evidence that Alzheimer’s disease may be driven by overactivation of cerebral fructose metabolism, in which the source of fructose is largely from endogenous production in the brain. Thus, the reduction in mitochondrial energy production is hampered by neuronal glycolysis that is inadequate, resulting in progressive loss of cerebral energy levels required for neurons to remain functional and viable. In essence, we propose that Alzheimer’s disease is a modern disease driven by changes in dietary lifestyle in which fructose can disrupt cerebral metabolism and neuronal function. Inhibition of intracerebral fructose metabolism could provide a novel way to prevent and treat this disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Non-linear Relationship Between Plasma Amyloid-β 40 Level and Cognitive Decline in a Cognitively Normal Population</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.557005</link>
	<content:encoded>Objectives&lt;p&gt;Recent studies regarding the relationships between plasma amyloid-β (Aβ) levels and cognitive performance had inconsistent results. In this study, we aimed to characterize the relationship between cognitive decline and plasma Aβ levels in a large-sample cognitively normal population.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;This population-based, prospective cohort study included 1,240 participants with normal cognition. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used to assess cognitive function at baseline and 2 years later. Restricted cubic splines, multivariate logistic regression, and multivariate linear regression models were used to evaluate the type of relationship between cognitive decline during the 2-year follow-up period and plasma Aβ levels (Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;, Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;, and Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;/&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Participants with moderate Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; levels had the highest risk of cognitive decline during a 2-year follow-up relative to individuals with low Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; [odds ratio (OR): 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.45–0.81, p &amp;lt; 0.001] or high Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; (OR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.49–0.87, p = 0.004) levels. The association between Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; and cognitive decline did not depend on sex, education level, or APOE ε4 status. There was an interaction found between age (≤ 65 and &amp;gt; 65 years) and Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; (p for interaction = 0.021). In individuals older than 65 years, there was a positive linear relationship between plasma Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; and cognitive decline (OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.00–1.04, p = 0.027). For participants ≤ 65 years old, the lower Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; and higher Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; groups had a lower risk of cognitive decline than the medium Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; group (OR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.50–0.94, p = 0.02; OR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.45–0.86, p = 0.004). None of relationship between plasma Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;, Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;/&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; and cognitive decline was found during a 2-year follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The relationship between plasma Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; and cognitive decline was not linear, but an inverted-U shape in a cognitively normal population. The underlying mechanism requires further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Weaker Braking Force, A New Marker of Worse Gait Stability in Alzheimer Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.554168</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Braking force is a gait marker associated with gait stability. This study aimed to determine the alteration of braking force and its correlation with gait stability in Alzheimer disease (AD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A total of 32 AD patients and 32 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in this study. Gait parameters (braking force, gait variability, and fall risk) in the walking tests of Free walk, Barrier, and Count backward were measured by JiBuEn&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; gait analysis system. Gait variability was calculated by the coefficient of variation (COV) of stride time, stance time, and swing time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The braking force of AD was significantly weaker than HCs in three walking tests (P &amp;lt; 0.001, P &amp;lt; 0.001, P = 0.007). Gait variability of AD showed significant elevation than HCs in the walking of Count backward (COV&lt;sub&gt;stride&lt;/sub&gt;: P = 0.013; COV&lt;sub&gt;swing&lt;/sub&gt;: P = 0.006). Fall risk of AD was significantly higher than HCs in three walking tests (P = 0.001, P = 0.001, P = 0.001). Braking force was negatively associated with fall risks in three walking tests (P &amp;lt; 0.001, P &amp;lt; 0.001, P &amp;lt; 0.001). There were significant negative correlations between braking force and gait variability in the walking of Free walk (COV&lt;sub&gt;stride&lt;/sub&gt;: P = 0.018; COV&lt;sub&gt;swing&lt;/sub&gt;: P = 0.013) and Barrier (COV&lt;sub&gt;stride&lt;/sub&gt;: P = 0.002; COV&lt;sub&gt;swing&lt;/sub&gt;: P = 0.001), but not Count backward (COV&lt;sub&gt;stride&lt;/sub&gt;: P = 0.888; COV&lt;sub&gt;swing&lt;/sub&gt;: P = 0.555).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Braking force was weaker in AD compared to HCs, reflecting the worse gait stability of AD. Our study suggests that weakening of braking force may be a new gait marker to indicate cognitive and motor impairment and predict fall risk in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Association Between Peripheral Adiponectin and Lipids Levels and the Therapeutic Response to Donepezil Treatment in Han Chinese Patients With Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.532386</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) including donepezil (DNP) are considered to be the most promising therapeutic possibilities of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The response to DNP in AD patients varies and it is valuable to identify the potential markers that can predict the efficacy. Moreover, DNP has been found to affect bone function, but the exact mechanism is still unclear. Lipids and adipokine may link to AD and DNP directly or indirectly and might be potential biomarkers or therapeutic drug targets. The goal of this study was to investigate the relationships among adiponectin (APN), lipids levels, and the response to DNP, and to identify whether the effect of DNP in AD treatment is related to its effect on the level of APN in systemic circulation. The study recruited 85 AD patients with DNP treatment, of whom 47 were DNP responders and 38 were DNP nonresponders. The Mini-Mental State Examination was performed to evaluate the memory impairment. Plasma APN was measured with ELISA. The genotypes of single nucleotide polymorphisms rs1501299 and rs22417661 in APN for each patient were identified. Plasma lipids were quantified with gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Correlations among APN, lipid metabolomics, and DNP responded were evaluated. APN was significantly decreased in DNP responders. Methyl stearate and glycerol-3-phosphate, used for characterizing adipogenic differentiation, were significantly decreased in DNP responders compared to DNP nonresponders. APN and small-molecule lipids can be used as potential biomarkers to evaluate the efficacy of DNP. The results of metabolomics indicated that there was no change in the metabolic pathway of fatty acid metabolism and glucose metabolism in DNP responders, suggesting that APN-related biological function did not decrease in DNP responders. Our result suggests that more attention should be pay to the sources and biological functions of APN in AD with DNP treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Effects of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) on Balance Control in Older Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00275</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Recently, considerable research has been conducted to study the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on balance control in older adults. We completed a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of tDCS on balance control in this population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A search strategy based on the PICOS principle was used to find the literatures in the databases of PubMed, EMBASE, EBSCO, Web of Science. The quality and risk of bias in the studies were independently assessed by two researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Ten studies were included in the systematic review. A meta-analysis was completed on six of these ten, with a total of 280 participants. As compared to sham (i.e., control), tDCS induced significant improvement with low heterogeneity in balance control in older adults. Specifically, tDCS induced large effects on the performance of the timed-up-and-go test, the Berg balance scale, and standing postural sway (e.g., sway area) and gait (e.g., walking speed) in dual task conditions (standardized mean differences (SMDs) = −0.99~3.41 95% confidence limits (CL): −1.52~4.50, p &amp;lt; 0.006, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;lt; 52%). Moderate-to-large effects of tDCS were also observed in the standing posture on a static or movable platform (SMDs = 0.37~1.12 95%CL: −0.09~1.62, p &amp;lt; 0.03, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;lt; 62%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our analysis indicates that tDCS holds promise to promote balance in older adults. These results warrant future studies of larger sample size and rigorous study design and results report, as well as specific research to establish the relationship between the parameter of tDCS and the extent of tDCS-induced improvement in balance control in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00184</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background and Purpose: Previous studies found inconsistent results regarding the relationship between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and catecholamines, such as dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), and epinephrine (EPI). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the results of previous studies on this relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: Literature retrieval of eligible studies was performed in four databases (Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, and PsycARTICLES). Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated to assess differences in catecholamine concentrations between the AD groups and controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Thirteen studies met the eligibility criteria. Compared with the controls, significant lower concentrations of NE (SMD = −1.10, 95% CI: −2.01 to −0.18, p = 0.019) and DA (SMD = −1.12, 95% CI: −1.88 to −0.37, p = 0.003) were observed in patients with AD. No difference was found in the concentrations of EPI between the two groups (SMD = −0.74, 95% CI: −1.85 to 0.37, p = 0.189).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Overall, these findings are in line with the hypothesis that reduced NE and DA may be an important indicator for AD (Registration number CRD42018112816).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60878</link>
	<content:encoded>Cell-cell and cell-matrix junctions transmit mechanical forces during tissue morphogenesis and homeostasis. α-Catenin links cell-cell adhesion complexes to the actin cytoskeleton, and mechanical load strengthens its binding to F-actin in a direction-sensitive manner. Specifically, optical trap experiments revealed that force promotes a transition between weak and strong actin-bound states. Here, we describe the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the F-actin-bound αE-catenin actin-binding domain, which in solution forms a 5-helix bundle. In the actin-bound structure, the first helix of the bundle dissociates and the remaining four helices and connecting loops rearrange to form the interface with actin. Deletion of the first helix produces strong actin binding in the absence of force, suggesting that the actin-bound structure corresponds to the strong state. Our analysis explains how mechanical force applied to αE-catenin or its homolog vinculin favors the strongly bound state, and the dependence of catch bond strength on the direction of applied force.</content:encoded>

Downregulation of NCLX causes mtCa&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; overload, mitochondrial depolarization, decreased expression of cell-cycle genes and reduced tumor size in xenograft and spontaneous colorectal cancer mouse models. Concomitantly, NCLX downregulation drives metastatic spread, chemoresistance, and expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal, hypoxia, and stem cell pathways. Mechanistically, mtCa&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; overload leads to increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, which activate HIF1α signaling supporting metastasis of NCLX-null tumor cells. Thus, loss of NCLX is a novel driver of metastasis, indicating that regulation of mtCa&lt;sup&gt;2+ &lt;/sup&gt;is a novel therapeutic approach in metastatic colorectal cancer.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Understanding the cellular constituents of the prostate is essential for identifying the cell of origin for prostate adenocarcinoma. Here we describe a comprehensive single-cell atlas of the adult mouse prostate epithelium, which displays extensive heterogeneity. We observe distal lobe-specific luminal epithelial populations (LumA, LumD, LumL, and LumV), a proximally-enriched luminal population (LumP) that is not lobe-specific, and a periurethral population (PrU) that shares both basal and luminal features. Functional analyses suggest that LumP and PrU cells have multipotent progenitor activity in organoid formation and tissue reconstitution assays. Furthermore, we show that mouse distal and proximal luminal cells are most similar to human acinar and ductal populations, that a PrU-like population is conserved between species, and that the mouse lateral prostate is most similar to the human peripheral zone. Our findings elucidate new prostate epithelial progenitors, and help resolve long-standing questions about anatomical relationships between the mouse and human prostate.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58668</link>
	<content:encoded>Post-transcriptional mechanisms regulating cell surface synaptic organizing complexes that control the properties of connections in brain circuits are poorly understood. Alternative splicing regulates the prototypical synaptic organizing complex, neuroligin-neurexin. In contrast to the well-studied neuroligin splice site B, little is known about splice site A. We discovered that inclusion of the positively charged A1 insert in mouse neuroligin-1 increases its binding to heparan sulphate, a modification on neurexin. The A1 insert increases neurexin recruitment, presynaptic differentiation, and synaptic transmission mediated by neuroligin-1. We propose that the A1 insert could be a target for alleviating the consequences of deleterious &lt;i&gt;NLGN1/3&lt;/i&gt; mutations, supported by assays with the autism-linked neuroligin-1-P89L mutant. An enrichment of neuroligin-1 A1 in GABAergic neuron types suggests a role in synchrony of cortical circuits. Altogether, these data reveal an unusual mode by which neuroligin splicing controls synapse development through protein-glycan interaction and identify it as a potential therapeutic target.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Stress-activated MAPK signalling controls fission yeast actomyosin ring integrity by modulating formin For3 levels</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57951</link>
	<content:encoded>Cytokinesis, which enables the physical separation of daughter cells once mitosis has been completed, is executed in fungal and animal cells by a contractile actin- and myosin-based ring (CAR). In the fission yeast &lt;i&gt;Schizosaccharomyces pombe &lt;/i&gt;the formin For3 nucleates actin cables and also co-operates for CAR assembly during cytokinesis. Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs) regulate essential adaptive responses in eukaryotic organisms to environmental changes. We show that the Stress Activated Protein Kinase pathway (SAPK) and its effector, MAPK Sty1, downregulates CAR assembly in &lt;i&gt;S. pombe&lt;/i&gt; when its integrity becomes compromised during cytoskeletal damage and stress by reducing For3 levels. Accurate control of For3 levels by the SAPK pathway may thus represent a novel regulatory mechanism of cytokinesis outcome in response to environmental cues. Conversely, SAPK signalling favours CAR assembly and integrity in its close relative &lt;i&gt;S. japonicus, &lt;/i&gt;revealing a remarkable evolutionary divergence of this response within the fission yeast clade.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57790</link>
	<content:encoded>Microbial communities feature an immense diversity of species and this diversity is linked to outcomes ranging from ecosystem stability to medical prognoses. Yet the mechanisms underlying microbial diversity are under debate. While simple resource-competition models don't allow for coexistence of a large number of species, it was recently shown that metabolic trade-offs can allow unlimited diversity. Does this diversity persist with more realistic, intermittent nutrient supply? Here, we demonstrate theoretically that in serial dilution culture, metabolic trade-offs allow for high diversity. When a small amount of nutrient is supplied to each batch, the serial dilution dynamics mimic a chemostat-like steady state. If more nutrient is supplied, community diversity shifts due to an 'early-bird' effect. The interplay of this effect with different environmental factors and diversity-supporting mechanisms leads to a variety of relationships between nutrient supply and diversity, suggesting that real ecosystems may not obey a universal nutrient-diversity relationship.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Neural variability determines coding strategies for natural self-motion in macaque monkeys</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57484</link>
	<content:encoded>We have previously reported that central neurons mediating vestibulo-spinal reflexes and self-motion perception optimally encode natural self-motion (Mitchell et al., 2018). Importantly however, the vestibular nuclei also comprise other neuronal classes that mediate essential functions such as the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) and its adaptation. Here we show that heterogeneities in resting discharge variability mediate a trade-off between faithful encoding and optimal coding via temporal whitening. Specifically, neurons displaying lower variability did not whiten naturalistic self-motion but instead faithfully represented the stimulus' detailed time course, while neurons displaying higher variability displayed temporal whitening. Using a well-established model of VOR pathways, we demonstrate that faithful stimulus encoding is necessary to generate the compensatory eye movements found experimentally during naturalistic self-motion. Our findings suggest a novel functional role for variability towards establishing different coding strategies: 1) faithful stimulus encoding for generating the VOR; 2) optimized coding via temporal whitening for other vestibular functions.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57212</link>
	<content:encoded>During mitosis chromosomes reorganise into highly compact, rod-shaped forms, thought to consist of consecutive chromatin loops around a central protein scaffold. Condensin complexes are involved in chromatin compaction, but the contribution of other chromatin proteins, DNA sequence and histone modifications is less understood. A large region of fission yeast DNA inserted into a mouse chromosome was previously observed to adopt a mitotic organisation distinct from that of surrounding mouse DNA. Here we show that a similar distinct structure is common to a large subset of insertion events in both mouse and human cells and is coincident with the presence of high levels of heterochromatic H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3). Hi-C and microscopy indicate that the heterochromatinised fission yeast DNA is organised into smaller chromatin loops than flanking euchromatic mouse chromatin. We conclude that heterochromatin alters chromatin loop size, thus contributing to the distinct appearance of heterochromatin on mitotic chromosomes.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Structural Insights into Human Acid-sensing Ion Channel 1a Inhibition by Snake Toxin Mambalgin1</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57096</link>
	<content:encoded>Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are proton-gated cation channels that are involved in diverse neuronal processes including pain sensing. Peptide toxin Mambalgin1 (Mamba1) from black mamba snake venom can reversibly inhibit the conductance of ASICs, showing an analgesic effect. However, the detailed inhibitory mechanism of Mamba1 on ASIC1s, especially how Mamba1 binding to extracellular domain affects the conformational changes of the transmembrane domain of ASICs remains elusive. Here, we present single-particle cryo-EM structures of human ASIC1a (hASIC1a) and hASIC1a-Mamba1 complex at resolutions of 3.56 and 3.90 Å, respectively. The structures revealed the inhibited conformation of hASIC1a upon Mamba1 binding. The combination of the structural and physiological data indicates that Mamba1 prefers to bind hASIC1a in a closed state and reduces the proton sensitivity of the channel, representing a closed-state trapping mechanism.</content:encoded>

Biological systems are composed of countless interlocking feedback loops. Reactor control systems—such as Chi-Bio (https://chi.bio/), recently published in &lt;i&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/i&gt;—enable biologists to drive multiple processes within living biological samples, using a single experimental framework. Consequently, the dynamic relationships between many biological variables can be explored simultaneously in situ. Similar multivariable experimental reactors are employed beyond biology in the study of active matter and non-equilibrium chemical reactions, in which physical systems are maintained far from equilibrium through the continuous introduction of energy or matter. Inexpensive state-of-the-art components enable open-source implementation of such multiparameter architectures, which represent a move away from expensive systems optimised for single measurements, towards affordable and reconfigurable multi-measurement systems. The transfer of well-understood engineering knowledge into the hands of biological and chemical specialists via open-source channels allows rapid cycles of experimental development and heralds a change in experimental capability that is driving increased theoretical and practical understanding of out-of-equilibrium systems across a wide range of scientific fields.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/uhGeh_uSlwI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A 10‐year‐old girl presented with ileus, urinary retention, dry mouth, lack of tears, fixed dilated pupils, and diffuse anhidrosis 7 days after a febrile illness. We hypothesized that her syndrome was due to autoimmunity against muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, blocking their activation. Using an indirect enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay for all 5 muscarinic receptors (M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;–M&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), we identified in the patient's serum antibodies that selectively bound to M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptors.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Surgical Outcomes Can Be Inferred Based on Structural Connectome Hubs: A Machine Learning Study</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25888?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of medication‐resistant focal epilepsy in adults. Despite removal of medial temporal structures, more than one‐third of patients continue to have disabling seizures postoperatively. Seizure refractoriness implies that extramedial regions are capable of influencing the brain network and generating seizures. We tested whether abnormalities of structural network integration could be associated with surgical outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presurgical magnetic resonance images from 121 patients with drug‐resistant TLE across 3 independent epilepsy centers were used to train feed‐forward neural network models based on tissue volume or graph‐theory measures from whole‐brain diffusion tensor imaging structural connectomes. An independent dataset of 47 patients with TLE from 3 other epilepsy centers was used to assess the predictive values of each model and regional anatomical contributions toward surgical treatment results.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The receiver operating characteristic area under the curve based on regional betweenness centrality was 0.88, significantly higher than a random model or models based on gray matter volumes, degree, strength, and clustering coefficient. Nodes most strongly contributing to the predictive models involved the bilateral parahippocampal gyri, as well as the superior temporal gyri.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Network integration in the medial and lateral temporal regions was related to surgical outcomes. Patients with abnormally integrated structural network nodes were less likely to achieve seizure freedom. These findings are in line with previous observations related to network abnormalities in TLE and expand on the notion of underlying aberrant plasticity. Our findings provide additional information on the mechanisms of surgical refractoriness. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;h2&gt;Graphical Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the capacity of a systemic growth hormone (GH) injection to induce STAT5 phosphorylation in the mouse brain, we identified several neurochemically distinct neuronal populations in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus that are directly responsive to GH, including tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)‐, somatostatin (SST)‐, thyrotropin‐releasing hormone (TRH)‐ and corticotropin‐releasing hormone (CRH)‐producing neurons.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple neuroendocrine, autonomic and behavioral responses are regulated by the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH). Previous studies have shown that PVH neurons express the growth hormone (GH) receptor (GHR), although the role of GH signaling on PVH neurons is still unknown. Given the great heterogeneity of cell types located in the PVH, we performed a detailed analysis of the neurochemical identity of GH‐responsive cells to understand the possible physiological importance of GH action on PVH neurons. GH‐responsive cells were detected via the phosphorylated form of the signal transducer and activator of transcription‐5 (pSTAT5) in adult male mice that received an intraperitoneal GH injection. Approximately 51% of GH‐responsive cells in the PVH co‐localized with the vesicular glutamate transporter 2. Rare co‐localizations between pSTAT5 and vesicular GABA transporter or vasopressin were observed, whereas approximately 20% and 38% of oxytocin and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) cells, respectively, were responsive to GH in the PVH. Approximately 55%, 35% and 63% of somatostatin, thyrotropin‐releasing hormone (TRH) and corticotropin‐releasing hormone (CRH) neurons expressed GH‐induced pSTAT5, respectively. Additionally, 8%, 49% and 75% of neuroendocrine TH, TRH and CRH neurons, and 67%, 32% and 74% of nonneuroendocrine TH, TRH and CRH neurons were responsive to GH in the PVH of Fluoro‐Gold‐injected mice. Our findings suggest that GH action on PVH neurons is involved in the regulation of the thyroid, somatotropic and adrenal endocrine axes, possibly influencing homeostatic and stress responses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;
VTA MC3R neurons are a likely site of interaction between homeostatic and hedonic feeding circuits.
VTA MC3R neurons send efferent projections to, and receive afferent input from, multiple brain regions involved in feeding, reward, and aversion.
Very few POMC and AgRP neurons were labeled by monosynaptic rabies from multiple VTA neuron subtypes.



&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system is involved in the regulation of multiple behaviors, including feeding, and evidence demonstrates that the melanocortin system can act on the mesolimbic DA system to control feeding and other behaviors. The melanocortin‐3 receptor (MC3R) is an important component of the melanocortin system, but its overall role is poorly understood. Because MC3Rs are highly expressed in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and are likely to be the key interaction point between the melanocortin and mesolimbic DA systems, we set out to identify both the efferent projection patterns of VTA MC3R neurons and the location of the neurons providing afferent input to them. VTA MC3R neurons were broadly connected to neurons across the brain but were strongly connected to a discrete set of brain regions involved in the regulation of feeding, reward, and aversion. Surprisingly, experiments using monosynaptic rabies virus showed that proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and agouti‐related protein (AgRP) neurons in the arcuate nucleus made few direct synapses onto VTA MC3R neurons or any of the other major neuronal subtypes in the VTA, despite being extensively labeled by general retrograde tracers injected into the VTA. These results greatly contribute to our understanding of the anatomical interactions between the melanocortin and mesolimbic systems and provide a foundation for future studies of VTA MC3R neurons and the circuits containing them in the control of feeding and other behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Ivanova et al., use sparse labeling of mural cells in the retina to identify pericyte diversity and to selectively manipulate capillary blood flow.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pericytes are a unique class of mural cells essential for angiogenesis, maintenance of the vasculature and are key players in microvascular pathology. However, their diversity and specific roles are poorly understood, limiting our insight into vascular physiology and the ability to develop effective therapies. Here, in the mouse retina, a tractable model of the CNS, we evaluated distinct classes of mural cells along the vascular tree for both structural characterization and physiological manipulation of blood flow. To accomplish this, we first tested three inducible mural cell‐specific mouse lines using a sensitive Ai14 reporter and tamoxifen application either by a systemic injection, or by local administration in the form of eye drops. The specificity and pattern of cre activation varied significantly across the three lines, under either the PDGFRβ or NG2 promoter (Pdgfrβ‐CreRha, Pdgfrβ‐CreCsln, and Cspg4‐Cre). In particular, a mouse line with Cre under the NG2 promoter resulted in sparse TdTomato labeling of mural cells, allowing for an unambiguous characterization of anatomical features of individual sphincter cells and capillary pericytes. Furthermore, in one PDGFRβ line, we found that focal eye drop application of tamoxifen led to an exclusive Cre‐activation in pericytes, without affecting arterial mural cells. We then used this approach to boost capillary blood flow by selective expression of Halorhodopsin, a highly precise hyperpolarizing optogenetic actuator. The ability to exclusively target capillary pericytes may prove a precise and potentially powerful tool to treat microcirculation deficits, a common pathology in numerous diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04216</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Emotions are a central key for understanding human beings and of fundamental
importance regarding their impact in human and animal behaviors. They have been
for a long time a subject of study for various scholars including in particular
philosophers and mystics. In modern science, the emotional phenomenon has
attracted for a few decades an increasing number of studies, notably in the
fields of Psychology, Psychiatry, Neuroscience and Biochemistry. However, since
our perception of emotions is not, so far, directly detectable nor recordable
by our measure instruments, Physics and Mathematics have not been so far used
academically to provide a precise description of the phenomenon of feeling an
emotion. Relying upon the works of O. Elahi and on the hypothesis that the
human soul and its psyche may manifest in ourselves (in both conscious and
unconscious manner) in an analog way as electromagnetic waves, we propose here
a few mathematical descriptions consistent with the human personal experience,
of the feeling and cognition of emotions. As far as we know, such a
mathematical description has never been provided before. It allows a
quantitative (intensity) and qualitative (nature of feelings/frequency) of the
emotional phenomenon which provides a novel scientific approach of the nature
of the mind, complementary to the on going research of physiological
manifestation of emotions. We anticipate such an approach and the associated
mathematical modeling to become an important tool to describe emotions and
their subsequent behavior. In complement of the modeling of oscillations and
brain dynamics, it provides a fruitful direction of research with potentially
broad and deep impacts in both applied mathematics, physics, cognitive and
behavioral sciences.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We show that the core reasons that complex and hypercomplex valued neural
networks offer improvements over their real-valued counterparts is the weight
sharing mechanism and treating multidimensional data as a single entity. Their
algebra linearly combines the dimensions, making each dimension related to the
others. However, both are constrained to a set number of dimensions, two for
complex and four for quaternions. Here we introduce novel vector map
convolutions which capture both of these properties provided by
complex/hypercomplex convolutions, while dropping the unnatural dimensionality
constraints they impose. This is achieved by introducing a system that mimics
the unique linear combination of input dimensions, such as the Hamilton product
for quaternions. We perform three experiments to show that these novel vector
map convolutions seem to capture all the benefits of complex and hyper-complex
networks, such as their ability to capture internal latent relations, while
avoiding the dimensionality restriction.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04006</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, the dissipated heat of a thermodynamic work extraction
process upper bounds the non-predictive information, which the associated
system encodes about its environment. Thus, emergent information processing
capabilities can be understood from the perspective of a pressure towards high
thermodynamic efficiency. On the other hand, the second law of thermodynamics
plays a crucial role in the emergence of complex, self-organising dissipative
structures. Such structures are thermodynamically favoured, because they can
dissipate free energy reservoirs, which would not be accessible otherwise.
Thereby, they allow a closed system to move from one meta-stable state to
another meta-stable state of higher entropy. This paper will argue, that these
two views are not contradictory, but that their combination allows to
understand the transition from simple self-organising dissipative structures to
complex information processing systems. If the efficiency required by a
dissipative structure to harvest enough work from the channeled flow of free
energy to maintain its own structure is high, there is a drive for this system
to be predictive. Still, the existence of this dissipative system is
thermodynamically favoured, compared to a situation without any dissipative
structure. Due to the emergence of a hierarchy of dissipative systems, which by
themselves are non-equilibrium structures that can be dissipated, such a drive
develops naturally, as one ascends in this hierarchy further and further away
from the initial driving disequilibrium.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Episodic Memories: How do the Hippocampus and the Entorhinal Ring Attractors Cooperate to Create Them?</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.559186</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The brain is capable of registering a constellation of events, encountered only once, as an episodic memory that can last for a lifetime. As evidenced by the clinical case of the patient HM, memories preserving their episodic nature still depend on the hippocampal formation, several years after being created, while semantic memories are thought to reside in neocortical areas. The neurobiological substrate of one-time learning and life-long storing in the brain, that must exist at the cellular and circuit level, is still undiscovered. The breakthrough is delayed by the fact that studies jointly investigating the rodent hippocampus and entorhinal cortex are mostly targeted at understanding the spatial aspect of learning. Here, we present the concept of an entorhinal cortical module, termed EPISODE module, that could explain how the representations of different elements constituting episodic memories can be linked together at the stage of encoding. The new model that we propose here reconciles the structural and functional observations made in the entorhinal cortex and explains how the downstream hippocampal processing organizes the representations into meaningful sequences.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The consensus that synaptic failure is the earliest cause of cognitive deterioration in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has initially led to investigate structural (dendritic spines) and physiological (LTP) synaptic dysfunctions in mouse models of AD with established cognitive alterations. The challenge is now to track down ultra-early alterations in spines to uncover causes rather than disease’s symptoms. This review article pinpoints dysregulations of the postsynaptic density (PSD) protein network which alter the morphology and function of spines in pre- and early- symptomatic hAPP mouse models of AD, and, hence, inform on primary causes of neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: The Role of Copper in Tau-Related Pathology in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.572308</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;All tauopathies, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), are characterized by the intracellular accumulation of abnormal forms of tau protein in neurons and glial cells, which negatively affect microtubule stability. Under physiological conditions, tubulin-associated unit (Tau) protein is intrinsically disordered, almost without secondary structure, and is not prone to aggregation. In AD, it assembles, and forms paired helical filaments (PHFs) that further build-up neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Aggregates are composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein that is more prone to aggregation. The pathology of AD is also linked to disturbed copper homeostasis, which promotes oxidative stress (OS). Copper imbalance is widely observed in AD patients. Deregulated copper ions may initiate and exacerbate tau hyperphosphorylation and formation of β-sheet-rich tau fibrils that ultimately contribute to synaptic failure, neuronal death, and cognitive decline observed in AD patients. The present review summarizes factors affecting the process of tau aggregation, conformational changes of small peptide sequences in the microtubule-binding domain required for these motifs to act as seeding sites in aggregation, and the role of copper in OS induction, tau hyperphosphorylation and tau assembly. A better understanding of the various factors that affect tau aggregation under OS conditions may reveal new targets and novel pharmacological approaches for the therapy of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Overexpression of GSK-3β in Adult Tet-OFF GSK-3β Transgenic Mice, and Not During Embryonic or Postnatal Development, Induces Tau Phosphorylation, Neurodegeneration and Learning Deficits</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.561470</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;GSK-3β or tau-kinase I is particularly abundant in the central nervous system (CNS), playing a key role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Accordingly, transgenic mouse models overexpressing this kinase recapitulate some aspects of this disease, such as tau hyperphosphorylation, neuronal death, and microgliosis. These alterations have been studied in mouse models showing GSK-3β overexpression from birth. In this case, some of these alterations may be due to adaptations that occur during development. Here we explored the potential of the Tet-OFF conditional system in the murine CamKIIα-tTA/GSK-3β model to increase the activity of GSK-3β only during adulthood. To this end, the overexpression of GSK-3β remained OFF during embryonic and postnatal development by administration of doxycycline in drinking water for 6 months, while it was turned ON in adult animals by removal of the treatment for 6 months. In these conditions, the CamKIIα-tTA/GSK-3β mouse is characterized by an increase in phosphorylated tau, cell death, and microgliosis. Furthermore, the increase in GSK-3β expression in the adult animals triggered a cognitive deficit, as determined through the hippocampus-dependent object recognition test (OR). These results demonstrate that the GSK-3β plays a key role in AD and that previously published data with other transgenic models are neither caused by or a consequence of adaptations to high levels of the enzyme during development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: The Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein Regulates Striatal Medium Spiny Neuron Synapse Density and Dendritic Spine Morphology</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00161</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein that mediates the transport, stability, and translation of hundreds of brain RNAs, is critically involved in regulating synaptic function. Loss of FMRP, as in fragile X syndrome (FXS), is a leading monogenic cause of autism and results in altered structural and functional synaptic plasticity, widely described in the hippocampus and cortex. Though FXS is associated with hyperactivity, impaired social interaction, and the development of repetitive or stereotyped behaviors, all of which are influenced by striatal activity, few studies have investigated the function of FMRP here. Utilizing a cortical-striatal co-culture model, we find that striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) lacking FMRP fail to make normal increases in PSD95 expression over a short time period and have significant deficits in dendritic spine density and colocalized synaptic puncta at the later measured time point compared to wildtype (WT) MSNs. Acute expression of wtFMRP plasmid in Fmr1 KO co-cultures results in contrasting outcomes for these measures on MSNs at the more mature time point, reducing spine density across multiple spine types but making no significant changes in colocalized puncta. FMRP’s KH2 and RGG RNA-binding domains are required for normal elimination of PSD95, and interruption of these domains slightly favors elimination of immature spine types. Further, KH2 is required for normal levels of colocalized puncta. Our data are largely consistent with a basal role for FMRP and its RNA-binding domains in striatal synapse stabilization on developing MSNs, and in light of previous findings, suggest distinct regional and/or cell type-specific roles for FMRP in regulating synapse structure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: miRNA Alterations Elicit Pathways Involved in Memory Decline and Synaptic Function in the Hippocampus of Aged Tg4-42 Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.580524</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The transcriptome of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) species is increasingly focused in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) research. NcRNAs comprise, among others, transfer RNAs, long non-coding RNAs and microRNAs (miRs), each with their own specific biological function. We used smallRNASeq to assess miR expression in the hippocampus of young (3 month old) and aged (8 month old) Tg4-42 mice, a model system for sporadic AD, as well as age-matched wildtype controls. Tg4-42 mice express N-truncated Aβ&lt;sub&gt;4–42&lt;/sub&gt;, develop age-related neuron loss, reduced neurogenesis and behavioral deficits. Our results do not only confirm known miR-AD associations in Tg4-42 mice, but more importantly pinpoint 22 additional miRs associated to the disease. Twenty-five miRs were differentially expressed in both aged Tg4-42 and aged wildtype mice while eight miRs were differentially expressed only in aged wildtype mice, and 33 only in aged Tg4-42 mice. No significant alteration in the miRNome was detected in young mice, which indicates that the changes observed in aged mice are down-stream effects of Aβ-induced pathology in the Tg4-42 mouse model for AD. Targets of those miRs were predicted using miRWalk. For miRs that were differentially expressed only in the Tg4-42 model, 128 targets could be identified, whereas 18 genes were targeted by miRs only differentially expressed in wildtype mice and 85 genes were targeted by miRs differentially expressed in both mouse models. Genes targeted by differentially expressed miRs in the Tg4-42 model were enriched for negative regulation of long-term synaptic potentiation, learning or memory, regulation of trans-synaptic signaling and modulation of chemical synaptic transmission obtained. This untargeted miR sequencing approach supports previous reports on the Tg4-42 mice as a valuable model for AD. Furthermore, it revealed miRs involved in AD, which can serve as biomarkers or therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: From Coarse to Fine-Grained Parcellation of the Cortical Surface Using a Fiber-Bundle Atlas</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.00032</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this article, we present a hybrid method to create fine-grained parcellations of the cortical surface, from a coarse-grained parcellation according to an anatomical atlas, based on cortico-cortical connectivity. The connectivity information is obtained from segmented superficial and deep white matter bundles, according to bundle atlases, instead of the whole tractography. Thus, a direct matching between the fiber bundles and the cortical regions is obtained, avoiding the problem of finding the correspondence of the cortical parcels among subjects. Generating parcels from segmented fiber bundles can provide a good representation of the human brain connectome since they are based on bundle atlases that contain the most reproducible short and long connections found on a population of subjects. The method first processes the tractography of each subject and extracts the bundles of the atlas, based on a segmentation algorithm. Next, the intersection between the fiber bundles and the cortical mesh is calculated, to define the initial and final intersection points of each fiber. A fiber filtering is then applied to eliminate misclassified fibers, based on the anatomical definition of each bundle and the labels of Desikan-Killiany anatomical parcellation. A parcellation algorithm is then performed to create a subdivision of the anatomical regions of the cortex, which is reproducible across subjects. This step resolves the overlapping of the fiber bundle extremities over the cortical mesh within each anatomical region. For the analysis, the density of the connections and the degree of overlapping, is considered and represented with a graph. One of our parcellations, an atlas composed of 160 parcels, achieves a reproducibility across subjects of ≈0.74, based on the average Dice's coefficient between subject's connectivity matrices, rather than ≈0.73 obtained for a macro anatomical parcellation of 150 parcels. Moreover, we compared two of our parcellations with state-of-the-art atlases, finding a degree of similarity with dMRI, functional, anatomical, and multi-modal atlases. The higher similarity was found for our parcellation composed of 185 sub-parcels with another parcellation based on dMRI data from the same database, but created with a different approach, leading to 130 parcels in common based on a Dice's coefficient ≥0.5.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Tracking Changes in Frontal Lobe Hemodynamic Response in Individual Adults With Developmental Language Disorder Following HD tDCS Enhanced Phonological Working Memory Training: An fNIRS Feasibility Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00362</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Current research suggests a neurobiological marker of developmental language disorder (DLD) in adolescents and young adults may be an atypical neural profile coupled with behavioral performance that overlaps with that of normal controls. Although many imaging techniques are not suitable for the study of speech and language processing in DLD populations, fNIRS may be a viable option. In this study we asked if fNIRS can be used to identify atypical cortical activation patterns in individual adults with DLD and track potential changes in cortical activation patterns following a phonological working memory training protocol enhanced with anodal HD tDCS stimulation to the presupplementary motor area (preSMA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was two-fold: (1) to determine if fNIRS can be used to identify atypical hemodynamic responses in individual young adults with DLD during active spoken word processing and, (2) to determine if fNIRS can detect changes in hemodynamic response in these same adults with DLD following anodal HD tDCS enhanced phonological working memory training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Two adult subjects with DLD (female, age 25) completed a total of two sessions of fNIRs working memory task prior to and following one session of a non-word repetition task paired with anodal HD tDCS (1.0 mA tDCS; 20 min) to the preSMA. Standardized z-scores of behavioral measures (accuracy and reaction time) and changes in hemodynamic response during an n-back working memory task for the two participants with DLD was compared to that of a normative sample of 21 age- and gender- matched normal controls (ages 18 to 25) prior to and following phonological working memory training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Individual standardized z-scores for each participant with DLD indicated that prior to training, hemoglobin response in the prefrontal lobe for both participants was markedly different from each other and normal controls. Following training, standard scores showed that the hemodynamic response for both participants moved within normal limits for ROIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: These findings highlight the feasibility of fNIRS to establish individual differences in the link between behavior and neural patterns in single subjects with DLD, as well as track individual differences in changes in brain activity following working memory training.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Brain Vital Signs Detect Cognitive Improvements During Combined Physical Therapy and Neuromodulation in Rehabilitation From Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: A Case Report</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00347</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Using a longitudinal case study design, we have tracked the recovery of motor function following severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) through a multimodal neuroimaging approach. In 2006, Canadian Soldier Captain (retired) Trevor Greene (TG) was attacked with an axe to the head while on tour in Afghanistan. TG continues intensive daily rehabilitation, which recently included the integration of physical therapy (PT) with neuromodulation using translingual neurostimulation (TLNS) to facilitate neuroplasticity. Recent findings with PT + TLNS demonstrated that recovery of motor function occurred beyond conventional time limits, currently extending past 14-years post-injury. To investigate whether PT + TLNS similarly resulted in associated cognitive function improvements, we examined event-related potentials (ERPs) with the brain vital signs framework. In parallel with motor function improvements, brain vital signs detected significant increases in basic attention (as measured by P300 response amplitude) and cognitive processing (as measured by contextual N400 response amplitude). These objective cognitive improvements corresponded with TG’s self-reported improvements, including a noteworthy and consistent reduction in ongoing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The findings provide valuable insight into the potential importance of non-invasive neuromodulation in cognitive rehabilitation, in addition to initial indications for physical rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Degeneracy and Complexity in Neuro-Behavioral Correlates of Team Coordination</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00328</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Team coordination—members of a group acting together rather than performing specific actions individually—is essential for success in many real-world tasks such as military missions, sports, workplace, or school interactions. However, team coordination is highly variable, which is one reason why its underlying neural processes are largely unknown. Here we used dual electroencephalography (EEG) in dyads to study the neurobehavioral dynamics of team coordination in an ecologically valid task that places intensive demands on joint performance. We present a novel conceptual framework to interpret neurobehavioral variability in terms of degeneracy, a fundamental property of complex biological systems said to enhance flexibility and robustness. We characterize degeneracy conceptually in terms of a manifold representing the geometric locus of the dynamics in the high dimensional state-space of neurobehavioral signals. The geometry and dimensionality of the manifold are determined by task constraints and team coordination requirements which restrict the manifold to trajectories that are conducive to successful task performance. Our results indicate that team coordination is associated with dimensionality reduction of the manifold as evident in increased inter-brain phase coherence of beta and gamma rhythms during critical phases of task performance where subjects exchange information. Team coordination was also found to affect the shape of the manifold manifested as a symmetry breaking of centro-parietal wavelet power patterns across subjects in trials with high team coordination. These results open a conceptual and empirical path to identifying the mechanisms underlying team performance in complex tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Assessing the Impact of Ih Conductance on Cross-Frequency Coupling in Model Pyramidal Neurons</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00081</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Large cortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons are elements of neuronal circuitry that have been implicated in cross-frequency coupling (CFC) during cognitive tasks. We investigate potential mechanisms for CFC within these neurons by examining the role that the hyperpolarization-activated mixed cation current (I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;) plays in modulating CFC characteristics in multicompartment neuronal models. We quantify CFC along the soma-apical dendrite axis and tuft of three models configured to have different spatial distributions of I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; conductance density: (1) exponential gradient along the soma-apical dendrite axis, (2) uniform distribution, and (3) no I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; conductance. We simulated two current injection scenarios: distal apical 4 Hz modulation and perisomatic 4 Hz modulation, each with perisomatic, mid-apical, and distal apical 40 Hz injections. We used two metrics to quantify CFC strength—modulation index and height ratio—and we analyzed CFC phase properties. For all models, CFC was strongest in distal apical regions when the 40 Hz injection occurred near the soma and the 4 Hz modulation occurred in distal apical dendrite. The strongest CFC values were observed in the model with uniformly distributed I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; conductance density, but when the exponential gradient in I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; conductance density was added, CFC strength decreased by almost 50%. When I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; was in the model, regions with much larger membrane potential fluctuations at 4 Hz than at 40 Hz had stronger CFC. Excluding the I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; conductance from the model resulted in CFC either reduced or comparable in strength relative to the model with the exponential gradient in I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; conductance. The I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; conductance also imposed order on the phase characteristics of CFC such that minimum (maximum) amplitude 40 Hz membrane potential oscillations occurred during I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; conductance deactivation (activation). On the other hand, when there was no I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; conductance, phase relationships between minimum and maximum 40 Hz oscillation often inverted and occurred much closer together. This analysis can help experimentalists discriminate between CFC that originates from different underlying physiological mechanisms and can help illuminate the reasons why there are differences between CFC strength observed in different regions of the brain and between different populations of neurons based on the configuration of the I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; conductance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Kinematic Changes in a Mouse Model of Penetrating Hippocampal Injury and Their Recovery After Intranasal Administration of Endometrial Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Extracellular Vesicles</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.579162</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Locomotion speed changes appear following hippocampal injury. We used a hippocampal penetrating brain injury mouse model to analyze other kinematic changes. We found a significant decrease in locomotion speed in both open-field and tunnel walk tests. We described a new quantitative method that allows us to analyze and compare the displacement curves between mice steps. In the tunnel walk, we marked mice with indelible ink on the knee, ankle, and metatarsus of the left and right hindlimbs to evaluate both in every step. Animals with hippocampal damage exhibit slower locomotion speed in both hindlimbs. In contrast, in the cortical injured group, we observed significant speed decrease only in the right hindlimb. We found changes in the displacement patterns after hippocampal injury. Mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles had been used for the treatment of several diseases in animal models. Here, we evaluated the effects of intranasal administration of endometrial mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles on the outcome after the hippocampal injury. We report the presence of vascular endothelial growth factor, granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and interleukin 6 in these vesicles. We observed locomotion speed and displacement pattern preservation in mice after vesicle treatment. These mice had lower pyknotic cells percentage and a smaller damaged area in comparison with the nontreated group, probably due to angiogenesis, wound repair, and inflammation decrease. Our results build up on the evidence of the hippocampal role in walk control and suggest that the extracellular vesicles could confer neuroprotection to the damaged hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Comparison of CRISPR/Cas Endonucleases for in vivo Retinal Gene Editing</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.570917</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;CRISPR/Cas has opened the prospect of direct gene correction therapy for some inherited retinal diseases. Previous work has demonstrated the utility of adeno-associated virus (AAV) mediated delivery to retinal cells in vivo; however, with the expanding repertoire of CRISPR/Cas endonucleases, it is not clear which of these are most efficacious for retinal editing in vivo. We sought to compare CRISPR/Cas endonuclease activity using both single and dual AAV delivery strategies for gene editing in retinal cells. Plasmids of a dual vector system with SpCas9, SaCas9, Cas12a, CjCas9 and a sgRNA targeting YFP, as well as a single vector system with SaCas9/YFP sgRNA were generated and validated in YFP-expressing HEK293A cell by flow cytometry and the T7E1 assay. Paired CRISPR/Cas endonuclease and its best performing sgRNA was then packaged into an AAV2 capsid derivative, AAV7m8, and injected intravitreally into CMV-Cre:Rosa26-YFP mice. SpCas9 and Cas12a achieved better knockout efficiency than SaCas9 and CjCas9. Moreover, no significant difference in YFP gene editing was found between single and dual CRISPR/SaCas9 vector systems. With a marked reduction of YFP-positive retinal cells, AAV7m8 delivered SpCas9 was found to have the highest knockout efficacy among all investigated endonucleases. We demonstrate that the AAV7m8-mediated delivery of CRISPR/SpCas9 construct achieves the most efficient gene modification in neurosensory retinal cells in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Critical periods of brain development are epochs of heightened plasticity driven by environmental influence necessary for normal brain function. Recent studies are beginning to shed light on the possibility that timely interventions during critical periods hold potential to reorient abnormal developmental trajectories in animal models of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. In this review, we re-examine the criteria defining critical periods, highlighting the recently discovered mechanisms of developmental plasticity in health and disease. In addition, we touch upon technological improvements for modeling critical periods in human-derived neural networks in vitro. These scientific advances associated with the use of developmental manipulations in the immature brain of animal models are the basic preclinical systems that will allow the future translatability of timely interventions into clinical applications for neurodevelopmental disorders such as intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: PHF-Core Tau as the Potential Initiating Event for Tau Pathology in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00247</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, around 50 million people have dementia. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia and one of the major causes of disability and dependency among the elderly worldwide. Clinically, AD is characterized by impaired memory accompanied by other deficiencies in the cognitive domain. Neuritic plaques (NPs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are histopathological lesions that define brains with AD. NFTs consist of abundant intracellular paired helical filaments (PHFs) whose main constituent is tau protein. Tau undergoes posttranslational changes including hyperphosphorylation and truncation, both of which favor conformational changes in the protein. The sequential pathological processing of tau is illustrated with the following specific markers: pT231, TG3, AT8, AT100, and Alz50. Two proteolysis sites for tau have been described—truncation at glutamate 391 and at aspartate 421—and which can be demonstrated by reactivity with the antibodies 423 and TauC-3, respectively. In this review, we describe the molecular changes in tau protein as pre-NFTs progress to extracellular NFTs and during which the formation of a minimal nucleus of the filament, as the PHF core, occurs. We also analyzed the PHF core as the initiator of PHFs and tau phosphorylation as a protective neuronal mechanism against the assembly of the PHF core.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Limitations and Promise of Retinal Tissue From Human Pluripotent Stem Cells for Developing Therapies of Blindness</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00179</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The self-formation of retinal tissue from pluripotent stem cells generated a tremendous promise for developing new therapies of retinal degenerative diseases, which previously seemed unattainable. Together with use of induced pluripotent stem cells or/and CRISPR-based recombineering the retinal organoid technology provided an avenue for developing models of human retinal degenerative diseases “in a dish” for studying the pathology, delineating the mechanisms and also establishing a platform for large-scale drug screening. At the same time, retinal organoids, highly resembling developing human fetal retinal tissue, are viewed as source of multipotential retinal progenitors, young photoreceptors and just the whole retinal tissue, which may be transplanted into the subretinal space with a goal of replacing patient’s degenerated retina with a new retinal “patch.” Both approaches (transplantation and modeling/drug screening) were projected when Yoshiki Sasai demonstrated the feasibility of deriving mammalian retinal tissue from pluripotent stem cells, and generated a lot of excitement. With further work and testing of both approaches in vitro and in vivo, a major implicit limitation has become apparent pretty quickly: the absence of the uniform layer of Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE) cells, which is normally present in mammalian retina, surrounds photoreceptor layer and develops and matures first. The RPE layer polarize into apical and basal sides during development and establish microvilli on the apical side, interacting with photoreceptors, nurturing photoreceptor outer segments and participating in the visual cycle by recycling 11-trans retinal (bleached pigment) back to 11-cis retinal. Retinal organoids, however, either do not have RPE layer or carry patches of RPE mostly on one side, thus directly exposing most photoreceptors in the developing organoids to neural medium. Recreation of the critical retinal niche between the apical RPE and photoreceptors, where many retinal disease mechanisms originate, is so far unattainable, imposes clear limitations on both modeling/drug screening and transplantation approaches and is a focus of investigation in many labs. Here we dissect different retinal degenerative diseases and analyze how and where retinal organoid technology can contribute the most to developing therapies even with a current limitation and absence of long and functional outer segments, supported by RPE.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Downregulation of TrkC Receptors Increases Dendritic Arborization of Purkinje Cells in the Developing Cerebellum of the Opossum, Monodelphis domestica</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00056</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In therian mammals, the cerebellum is one of the late developing structures in the brain. Specifically, the proliferation of cerebellar granule cells occurs after birth, and even in humans, the generation of these cells continues during the first year of life. The main difference between marsupials and eutherians is that the majority of the brain structures in marsupials develop after birth. Herein, we report that in the newborn laboratory opossum (Monodelphis domestica), the cerebellar primordium is distinguishable in Nissl-stained sections. Additionally, bromodeoxyuridine birthdating experiments revealed that the first neurons form the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) and Purkinje cells, and are generated within postnatal days (P) 1 and 5. Three weeks after birth, progenitors of granule cells in the external germinal layer (EGL) proliferate, producing granule cells. These progenitor cells persist for a long time, approximately 5 months. Furthermore, to study the effects of neurotrophic tropomyosin receptor kinase C (TrkC) during cerebellar development, cells were obtained from P3 opossums and cultured for 8 days. We found that TrkC downregulation stimulates dendritic branching of Purkinje neurons, which was surprising. The number of dendritic branches was higher in Purkinje cells transfected with the shRNA TrkC plasmid. However, there was no morphological change in the number of dendritic branches of granule cells transfected with either control or shRNA TrkC plasmids. We suggest that inhibition of TrkC activity enables NT3 binding to the neurotrophic receptor p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt; that promotes dendritic arborization of Purkinje cells. This effect of TrkC receptors on dendritic branching is cell type specific, which could be explained by the strong expression of TrkC in Purkinje cells but not in granule cells. The data indicate a new role for TrkC receptors in Monodelphis opossum.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.581524</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Amyloid protein deposition is a common mechanism of hereditary amyloidosis (HA) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Mutations of gelsolin (GSN), cystatin C (CST3), transthyretin (TTR), and integral membrane protein 2B (ITM2B) genes can lead to HA. But the relationship is unclear between these genes and AD. Genes targeted sequencing (GTS), including GSN, CST3, TTR, and ITM2B, was performed in a total of 636 patients with clinical AD and 365 normal controls from China. As a result, according to American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines, two novel likely pathogenic frame-shift mutations (GSN:c.1036delA:p.K346fs and GSN:c.8_35del:p.P3fs) were detected in five patients with AD, whose initial symptom was memory decline, accompanied with psychological and behavioral abnormalities later. Interestingly, the patient with K346fs mutation, presented cerebral β-amyloid protein deposition, had an early onset (48 years) and experienced rapid progression, while the other four patients with P3fs mutation had a late onset [(Mean ± SD): 69.50 ± 5.20 years] and a long course of illness [(Mean ± SD): 9.24 ± 4.86 years]. Besides, we also discovered 17 variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in these four genes. To our knowledge, we are the first to report AD phenotype with GSN mutations in patients with AD in the Chinese cohort. Although mutations in the GSN gene are rare, it may explain a small portion of clinically diagnosed AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A subsequent attempt to replicate this finding by the present author was not successful (Markel, 2020). Gagliano et al. attribute this lack of replication to differences in the experimental set-ups used in the original work and the replication attempt (Gagliano et al., 2020). Here, based on a comparison of the two set-ups, I argue that these differences are unable to explain the lack of replication in Markel, 2020.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Soluble collectin-12 mediates C3-independent docking of properdin that activates the alternative pathway of complement</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60908</link>
	<content:encoded>Properdin stabilizes the alternative C3 convertase (C3bBb), whereas its role as pattern recognition molecule mediating complement activation is disputed for decades. Previously, we have found that soluble collectin-12 (sCL-12) synergizes complement alternative pathway (AP) activation. However, whether this observation is C3 dependent is unknown. By application of the C3-inhibitor Cp40, we found that properdin in normal human serum bound to &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus fumigatus&lt;/i&gt; solely in a C3b-dependent manner. Cp40 also prevented properdin binding when properdin-depleted serum reconstituted with purified properdin was applied, in analogy with the findings achieved by C3-depleted serum. However, when opsonized with sCL-12, properdin bound in a C3-independent manner exclusively via its tetrameric structure and directed &lt;i&gt;in situ &lt;/i&gt;C3bBb assembly. In conclusion, a prerequisite for properdin binding and &lt;i&gt;in situ &lt;/i&gt;C3bBb assembly was the initial docking of sCL-12. This implies a new important function of properdin in host defence bridging pattern recognition and specific AP activation.</content:encoded>

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can map cell types, states and transitions during dynamic biological processes such as tissue development and regeneration. Many trajectory inference methods have been developed to order cells by their progression through a dynamic process. However, when time series data is available, most of these methods do not consider the available time information when ordering cells and are instead designed to work only on a single scRNA-seq data snapshot. We present Tempora, a novel cell trajectory inference method that orders cells using time information from time-series scRNA-seq data. In performance comparison tests, Tempora inferred known developmental lineages from three diverse tissue development time series data sets, beating state of the art methods in accuracy and speed. Tempora works at the level of cell clusters (types) and uses biological pathway information to help identify cell type relationships. This approach increases gene expression signal from single cells, processing speed, and interpretability of the inferred trajectory. Our results demonstrate the utility of a combination of time and pathway information to supervise trajectory inference for scRNA-seq based analysis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GfF2CqpX5cA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Learning and generalization in spatial domains is often thought to rely on a “cognitive map”, representing relationships between spatial locations. Recent research suggests that this same neural machinery is also recruited for reasoning about more abstract, conceptual forms of knowledge. Yet, to what extent do spatial and conceptual reasoning share common computational principles, and what are the implications for behavior? Using a within-subject design we studied how participants used spatial or conceptual distances to generalize and search for correlated rewards in successive multi-armed bandit tasks. Participant behavior indicated sensitivity to both spatial and conceptual distance, and was best captured using a Bayesian model of generalization that formalized distance-dependent generalization and uncertainty-guided exploration as a Gaussian Process regression with a radial basis function kernel. The same Gaussian Process model best captured human search decisions and judgments in both domains, and could simulate realistic learning curves, where we found equivalent levels of generalization in spatial and conceptual tasks. At the same time, we also find characteristic differences between domains. Relative to the spatial domain, participants showed reduced levels of uncertainty-directed exploration and increased levels of random exploration in the conceptual domain. Participants also displayed a one-directional transfer effect, where experience in the spatial task boosted performance in the conceptual task, but not vice versa. While confidence judgments indicated that participants were sensitive to the uncertainty of their knowledge in both tasks, they did not or could not leverage their estimates of uncertainty to guide exploration in the conceptual task. These results support the notion that value-guided learning and generalization recruit cognitive-map dependent computational mechanisms in spatial and conceptual domains. Yet both behavioral and model-based analyses suggest domain specific differences in how these representations map onto actions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6jq1i9COfCE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Paramagnetic rim lesions, rare in other neurological conditions (52% of MS vs 7% of non‐MS cases), yielded high specificity (93%) in differentiating MS from non‐MS.

&lt;p&gt;Postnatal development of the SMI‐32 labeling in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGNd) of kittens aged 0‐123 postnatal days, and in adults (Ad). Left – a representational examples of the SMI‐32 labeling, in kittens aged 0 days, 10 days, and in adult. Right – a number of SMI‐32 immunopositive (SMI‐32(+)) neurons in layers A, A1, and Cm of the LGNd. Different phases of the postnatal development (eyes opening, precritical period, critical period maximum) are marked by colors.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accumulation of the heavy‐chain neurofilaments reflects the maturation status of neuronal structures. The spatial distribution and postnatal developmental dynamic of neurons expressing non‐phosphorylated heavy‐chain neurofilaments (labeled by SMI‐32 antibody) were analysed in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGNd) of the cat. Both interlaminar and intralaminar differences in the dynamic of SMI‐32 staining were observed. The following results were obtained: (1) Ascending dorsoventral gradient in the density of SMI‐32 immunopositive (SMI‐32(+)) neurons (the greatest neuronal density in layer Cm, the minor in the top sublayer of layer A). This gradient was most prominent at the earliest stages of postnatal development (1st‐2nd weeks) and slowly flattened up to adulthood; (2) Layer A1 exhibits increases in SMI‐32‐positive cells earlier than layer A; (3) The general transient increment in the number and density of SMI‐32(+) neurons around 2‐5 postnatal weeks. Since SMI‐32 antibody is considered to be a putative marker for Y cells forming a motion processing stream, we suggest that peculiarities of SMI‐32 staining at geniculate level could reflect the heterogeneity of Y cell subpopulations and the heterochrony of their postnatal maturation.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Sex‐specific association between infant caudate volumes and a polygenic risk score for major depressive disorder&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5b1d93b6-1d81-43f9-a833-211890c179e2/jnr24722-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A polygenic risk score for major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with sex‐specific brain structural alterations in the infant bilateral caudate which is crucially implicated in MDD in adults. Our results suggest that sex‐specific polygenic influences on early caudate volume development might contribute to the sexually dimorphic prevalence of MDD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polygenic risk scores for major depressive disorder (PRS‐MDD) have been identified in large genome‐wide association studies, and recent findings suggest that PRS‐MDD might interact with environmental risk factors to shape human limbic brain development as early as in the prenatal period. Striatal structures are crucially involved in depression; however, the association of PRS‐MDD with infant striatal volumes is yet unknown. In this study, 105 Finnish mother–infant dyads (44 female, 11–54 days old) were investigated to reveal how infant PRS‐MDD is associated with infant dorsal striatal volumes (caudate, putamen) and whether PRS‐MDD interacts with prenatal maternal depressive symptoms (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, gestational weeks 14, 24, 34) on infant striatal volumes. A robust sex‐specific main effect of PRS‐MDD on bilateral infant caudate volumes was observed. PRS‐MDD were more positively associated with caudate volumes in boys compared to girls. No significant interaction effects of genotype PRS‐MDD with the environmental risk factor “prenatal maternal depressive symptoms” (genotype‐by‐environment interaction) nor significant interaction effects of genotype with prenatal maternal depressive symptoms and sex (genotype‐by‐environment‐by‐sex interaction) were found for infant dorsal striatal volumes. Our study showed that a higher PRS‐MDD irrespective of prenatal exposure to maternal depressive symptoms is associated with smaller bilateral caudate volumes, an indicator of greater susceptibility to major depressive disorder, in female compared to male infants. This sex‐specific polygenic effect might lay the ground for the higher prevalence of depression in women compared to men.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Capturing Multiple Timescales of Adaptation to Second-Order Statistics With Generalized Linear Models: Gain Scaling and Fractional Differentiation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00060</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Single neurons can dynamically change the gain of their spiking responses to take into account shifts in stimulus variance. Moreover, gain adaptation can occur across multiple timescales. Here, we examine the ability of a simple statistical model of spike trains, the generalized linear model (GLM), to account for these adaptive effects. The GLM describes spiking as a Poisson process whose rate depends on a linear combination of the stimulus and recent spike history. The GLM successfully replicates gain scaling observed in Hodgkin-Huxley simulations of cortical neurons that occurs when the ratio of spike-generating potassium and sodium conductances approaches one. Gain scaling in the GLM depends on the length and shape of the spike history filter. Additionally, the GLM captures adaptation that occurs over multiple timescales as a fractional derivative of the stimulus envelope, which has been observed in neurons that include long timescale afterhyperpolarization conductances. Fractional differentiation in GLMs requires long spike history that span several seconds. Together, these results demonstrate that the GLM provides a tractable statistical approach for examining single-neuron adaptive computations in response to changes in stimulus variance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Inter- and Intra-subject Template-Based Multivariate Synchronization Index Using an Adaptive Threshold for SSVEP-Based BCIs</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00717</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) has been widely used in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Many studies have proved that the Multivariate synchronization index (MSI) is an efficient method for recognizing the frequency components in SSVEP-based BCIs. Despite its success, the recognition accuracy has not been satisfactory because the simplified pre-constructed sine-cosine waves lack abundant features from the real electroencephalogram (EEG) data. Recent advances in addressing this issue have achieved a significant improvement in recognition accuracy by using individual calibration data. In this study, a new extension based on inter- and intra-subject template signals is introduced to improve the performance of the standard MSI method. Through template transfer, inter-subject similarity and variability are employed to enhance the robustness of SSVEP recognition. Additionally, most existed methods for SSVEP recognition utilize a fixed time window (TW) to perform frequency domain analysis, which limits the information transfer rate (ITR) of BCIs. For addressing this problem, a novel adaptive threshold strategy is integrated into the extension of MSI, which uses a dynamic window to extract the temporal features of SSVEPs and recognizes the stimulus frequency based on a pre-set threshold. The pre-set threshold contributes to obtaining an appropriate and shorter signal length for frequency recognition and filtering ignored-invalid trials. The proposed method is evaluated on a 12-class SSVEP dataset recorded from 10 subjects, and the result shows that this achieves higher recognition accuracy and information transfer rate when compared with the CCA, MSI, Multi-set CCA, and Individual Template-based CCA. This paper demonstrates that the proposed method is a promising approach for developing high-speed BCIs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Influence of Multiple Cardiovascular Risk Factors on Task-Switching in Older Adults: An fMRI Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.561877</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Not only are the effects of cardiovascular risk factors such as high blood pressure and low fitness on executive functions and brain activations in older adults scarcely investigated, no fMRI study has investigated the combined effects of multiple risk factors on brain activations in older adults. This fMRI study examined the independent and combined effects of two cardiovascular risk factors, arterial plasticity, and physical fitness, on brain activations during task-switching in older adults. The effects of these two risk factors on age-related differences in activation between older and younger adults were also examined. Independently, low physical fitness and low arterial plasticity were related to reduced suppressions of occipital brain regions. The combined effects of these two risks on occipital regions were greater than the independent effects of either risk factor. Age-related overactivations in frontal cortex were observed in low fitness older adults. Brain-behavior correlation indicates that these frontal overactivations are maladaptive to older adults’ task performance. It is possible that the resulting effects of cardiovascular risks on the aging brain, especially the maladaptive overactivations of frontal brain regions by high risk older adults, contribute to often found posterior-anterior shift in aging (PASA) brain activations. Furthermore, observed age-related differences in brain activations during task-switching can be partially attributed to individual differences in cardiovascular risks among older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00343</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Steady-state visual evoked potentials (ssVEPs) are commonly used for functional objective diagnostics. In general, the main response at the stimulation frequency is used. However, some studies reported the main response at the second harmonic of the stimulation frequency. The aim of our study was to analyze the influence of the stimulus design on the harmonic components of ssVEPs. We studied 22 subjects (8 males, mean age ± SD = 27 ± 4.8 years) using a circular layout (r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0–1.6°, r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.6–3.5°, r&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 3.5–6.4°, r&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = 6.4–10.9°, and r&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = 10.9–18°). At a given eccentricity, the stimulus was presented according to a 7.5 Hz square wave with 50% duty cycle. To analyze the influence of the stimulus eccentricity, a background luminance of 30 cd/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; was added to suppress foveal stray light effects; to analyze the influence of simultaneous foveal and peripheral stimulations, stimulations are performed without stray light suppression. For statistical analysis, medians M of the amplitude ratios for amplitudes at the second harmonic to the first harmonic and the probability of the occurrence of the main response at the second harmonic P(MCSH) are calculated. For stimulations with foveal stray light suppression, the medians were M&lt;sub&gt;0 –1.6^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.45, M&lt;sub&gt;1.6 –3.5^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.45, M&lt;sub&gt;3.5 –6.4^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.76, M&lt;sub&gt;6.4 –10.9^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.72, and M&lt;sub&gt;10.9 –18^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.48, and the probabilities were P&lt;sub&gt;0–1.6^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt;(MCSH) = 0.05, P&lt;sub&gt;1.6 –3.5^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt;(MCSH) = 0.05, P&lt;sub&gt;3.5 –6.4^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt;(MCSH) = 0.32, P&lt;sub&gt;6.4 –10.9^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt;(MCSH) = 0.29, and P&lt;sub&gt;10.9 –18^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt;(MCSH) = 0.30. For stimulations without foveal stray light suppression, the medians M were M&lt;sub&gt;0 –1.6^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.29, M&lt;sub&gt;1.6 –3.5^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.37, M&lt;sub&gt;3.5 –6.4^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.98, M&lt;sub&gt;6.4 –10.9 ^^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.08, and M&lt;sub&gt;10.9 –18^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.24, and the probabilities were P&lt;sub&gt;0–1.6^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt;(MCSH) = 0.09, P&lt;sub&gt;1.6 –3.5^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt;(MCSH) = 0.05, P&lt;sub&gt;3.5 –6.4^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt;(MCSH) = 0.50, P&lt;sub&gt;6.4 –10.9^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt;(MCSH) = 0.55, and P&lt;sub&gt;10.9 –18^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt;(MCSH) = 0.55. In conclusion, the stimulus design has an influence on the harmonic components of ssVEPs. An increase in stimulation eccentricity during extrafoveal stimulation leads to a transition of the main response to the second harmonic. The effect is enhanced by a simultaneous foveal stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: A Generalized Linear Model of a Navigation Network</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00056</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Navigation by mammals is believed to rely on a network of neurons in the hippocampal formation, which includes the hippocampus, the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), and additional nearby regions. Neurons in these regions represent spatial information by tuning to the position, orientation, and speed of the animal in the form of head direction cells, speed cells, grid cells, border cells, and unclassified spatially modulated cells. While the properties of single cells are well studied, little is known about the functional structure of the network in the MEC. Here, we use a generalized linear model to study the network of spatially modulated cells in the MEC. We found connectivity patterns between all spatially encoding cells and not only grid cells. In addition, the neurons’ past activity contributed to the overall activity patterns. Finally, position-modulated cells and head direction cells differed in the dependence of the activity on the history. Our results indicate that MEC neurons form a local interacting network to support spatial information representations and suggest an explanation for their complex temporal properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Chewing Efficiency, Global Cognitive Functioning, and Dentition: A Cross-sectional Observational Study in Older People With Mild Cognitive Impairment or Mild to Moderate Dementia</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00225</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Previous studies suggest an association between poor mastication and cognitive impairment. The role of chewing efficiency and dentition in this relation is unclear. The aim was to examine global cognitive functioning and dentition as predictors for chewing efficiency, in older people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: In this observational cross-sectional study, 136 people with MCI or dementia were included. The chewing efficiency was assessed with a two-colored chewing gum and analyzed with the Chewing Efficiency Analysis software. The level of global cognitive functioning was measured with the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) by trained clinical staff. An oral examination was performed by a dentist and included the number of present teeth, the number of occluding pairs, and the presence of prostheses. Age, gender, and educational years were derived from the medical records. Univariate and multivariate backward stepwise linear regression analyses were used to evaluate global cognitive functioning and dentition as predictors for chewing efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The mean age of the participants was 82.1 (SD 5.8) years, and 74 (54.4%) were female. The participants had a median MMSE score of 22.4 (IQR 18.0–26.0) and a median Chewing Efficiency Analysis score of 0.46 (IQR 0.14–0.59). The median number of teeth was 13.0 (IQR 0.0–23.0), and the median number of occluding pairs was 0.0 (IQR 0.0–7.0). Sixty-four (47.4%) of the participants wore full prosthesis in the upper jaw. In univariate linear regression analyses, predictive factors for the Chewing Efficiency Analysis score were age, MMSE score, full prosthesis in the upper jaw, number of present teeth, and number of occluding pairs. In the multivariate model, full prosthesis in the upper jaw and number of occluding pairs were significant predictors for the Chewing Efficiency Analysis score. Participants with full prosthesis in the upper jaw had a lower Chewing Efficiency Analysis score than participants with natural dentition in the upper jaw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Better mastication is associated with a higher number of occluding pairs. Full prosthesis in the upper jaw is related to a lower chewing efficiency. Global cognitive functioning is not associated with mastication in older people with MCI or mild-to-moderate dementia. This might be explained by sufficient capacity for compensation of reduced mastication in this group.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

We present VALERIE (Visualising alternative splicing events from single-cell ribonucleic acid-sequencing experiments), an R package for visualising alternative splicing events at single-cell resolution. To explore any given specified genomic region, corresponding to an alternative splicing event, VALERIE generates an ensemble of informative plots to visualise cell-to-cell heterogeneity of alternative splicing profiles across single cells and performs statistical tests to compare percent spliced-in (PSI) values across the user-defined groups of cells. Among the features available, VALERIE displays PSI values, in lieu of read coverage, which is more suitable for representing alternative splicing profiles for a large number of samples typically generated by single-cell RNA-sequencing experiments. VALERIE is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN): https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/VALERIE/index.html.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pAUzcfXxr9I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Detection and segmentation of macrophage cells in fluorescence microscopy images is a challenging problem, mainly due to crowded cells, variation in shapes, and morphological complexity. We present a new deep learning approach for cell detection and segmentation that incorporates previously learned nucleus features. A novel fusion of feature pyramids for nucleus detection and segmentation with feature pyramids for cell detection and segmentation is used to improve performance on a microscopic image dataset created by us and provided for public use, containing both nucleus and cell signals. Our experimental results indicate that cell detection and segmentation performance significantly benefit from the fusion of previously learned nucleus features. The proposed feature pyramid fusion architecture clearly outperforms a state-of-the-art Mask R-CNN approach for cell detection and segmentation with relative mean average precision improvements of up to 23.88% and 23.17%, respectively.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0yEy1ii-hDo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Learning to avoid harmful consequences can be a costly trial-and-error process. In such situations, social information can be leveraged to improve individual learning outcomes. Here, we investigated how participants used their own experiences and others’ social cues to avoid harm. Participants made repeated choices between harmful and safe options, each with different probabilities of generating shocks, while also seeing the image of a social partner. Some partners made predictive gaze cues towards the harmful choice option while others cued an option at random, and did so using neutral or fearful facial expressions. We tested how learned social information about partner reliability transferred across contexts by letting participants encounter the same partner in multiple trial blocks while facing novel choice options. Participants’ decisions were best explained by a reinforcement learning model that independently learned the probabilities of options being safe and of partners being reliable and combined these combined these estimates to generate choices. Advice from partners making a fearful facial expression influenced participants’ decisions more than advice from partners with neutral expressions. Our results showed that participants made better decisions when facing predictive partners and that they cached and transferred partner reliability estimates into new blocks. Using simulations we show that participants’ transfer of social information into novel contexts is better adapted to variable social environments where social partners may change their cuing strategy or become untrustworthy. Finally, we found no relation between autism questionnaire scores and performance in our task, but do find autism trait related differences in learning rate parameters.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wfNEGcxtR64&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Existing models for assessing microbiome sequencing such as operational taxonomic units (OTUs) can only test predictors’ effects on OTUs. There is limited work on how to estimate the correlations between multiple OTUs and incorporate such relationship into models to evaluate longitudinal OTU measures. We propose a novel approach to estimate OTU correlations based on their taxonomic structure, and apply such correlation structure in Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) models to estimate both predictors’ effects and OTU correlations. We develop a two-part Microbiome Taxonomic Longitudinal Correlation (MTLC) model for multivariate zero-inflated OTU outcomes based on the GEE framework. In addition, longitudinal and other types of repeated OTU measures are integrated in the MTLC model. Extensive simulations have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the MTLC method. Compared with the existing methods, the MTLC method shows robust and consistent estimation, and improved statistical power for testing predictors’ effects. Lastly we demonstrate our proposed method by implementing it into a real human microbiome study to evaluate the obesity on twins.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AiYetAL6ehI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Delay-period activity in frontal, parietal, and occipital cortex tracks noise and biases in visual working memory</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/je9VB-_-tso/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Qing Yu, Matthew F. Panichello, Ying Cai, Bradley R. Postle, Timothy J. Buschman&lt;/p&gt;

Working memory is imprecise, and these imprecisions can be explained by the combined influences of random diffusive error and systematic drift toward a set of stable states (“attractors”). However, the neural correlates of diffusion and drift remain unknown. Here, we investigated how delay-period activity in frontal and parietal cortex, which is known to correlate with the decline in behavioral memory precision observed with increasing memory load, might relate to diffusion and drift. We analyzed data from an existing experiment in which subjects performed delayed recall for line orientation, at different loads, during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning. To quantify the influence of drift and diffusion, we modeled subjects’ behavior using a discrete attractor model and calculated within-subject correlation between frontal and parietal delay-period activity and whole-trial estimates of drift and diffusion. We found that although increases in frontal and parietal activity were associated with increases in both diffusion and drift, diffusion explained the most variance in frontal and parietal delay-period activity. In comparison, a subsequent whole-brain regression analysis showed that drift, rather than diffusion, explained the most variance in delay-period activity in lateral occipital cortex. These results are consistent with a model of the differential recruitment of general frontoparietal mechanisms in response to diffusive noise and of stimulus-specific biases in occipital cortex.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/je9VB-_-tso&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: In vivo antiviral host transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 by viral load, sex, and age</title>

Despite limited genomic diversity, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has shown a wide range of clinical manifestations in different patient populations. The mechanisms behind these host differences are still unclear. Here, we examined host response gene expression across infection status, viral load, age, and sex among shotgun RNA sequencing profiles of nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs from 430 individuals with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and 54 negative controls. SARS-CoV-2 induced a strong antiviral response with up-regulation of antiviral factors such as &lt;i&gt;OAS1-3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;IFIT1-3&lt;/i&gt; and T helper type 1 (Th1) chemokines &lt;i&gt;CXCL9/10/11&lt;/i&gt;, as well as a reduction in transcription of ribosomal proteins. SARS-CoV-2 culture in human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures replicated the in vivo antiviral host response 7 days post infection, with no induction of interferon-stimulated genes after 3 days. Patient-matched longitudinal specimens (mean elapsed time = 6.3 days) demonstrated reduction in interferon-induced transcription, recovery of transcription of ribosomal proteins, and initiation of wound healing and humoral immune responses. Expression of interferon-responsive genes, including &lt;i&gt;ACE2&lt;/i&gt;, increased as a function of viral load, while transcripts for B cell–specific proteins and neutrophil chemokines were elevated in patients with lower viral load. Older individuals had reduced expression of the Th1 chemokines &lt;i&gt;CXCL9/10/11&lt;/i&gt; and their cognate receptor &lt;i&gt;CXCR3&lt;/i&gt;, as well as &lt;i&gt;CD8A&lt;/i&gt; and granzyme B, suggesting deficiencies in trafficking and/or function of cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Relative to females, males had reduced B cell–specific and NK cell–specific transcripts and an increase in inhibitors of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signaling, possibly inappropriately throttling antiviral responses. Collectively, our data demonstrate that host responses to SARS-CoV-2 are dependent on viral load and infection time course, with observed differences due to age and sex that may contribute to disease severity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/H9Tm0EdCyZs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Leiomodin creates a leaky cap at the pointed end of actin-thin filaments</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/dMzzfXTBLHU/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Dmitri Tolkatchev, Garry E. Smith Jr., Lauren E. Schultz, Mert Colpan, Gregory L. Helms, John R. Cort, Carol C. Gregorio, Alla S. Kostyukova&lt;/p&gt;

Improper lengths of actin-thin filaments are associated with altered contractile activity and lethal myopathies. Leiomodin, a member of the tropomodulin family of proteins, is critical in thin filament assembly and maintenance; however, its role is under dispute. Using nuclear magnetic resonance data and molecular dynamics simulations, we generated the first atomic structural model of the binding interface between the tropomyosin-binding site of cardiac leiomodin and the N-terminus of striated muscle tropomyosin. Our structural data indicate that the leiomodin/tropomyosin complex only forms at the pointed end of thin filaments, where the tropomyosin N-terminus is not blocked by an adjacent tropomyosin protomer. This discovery provides evidence supporting the debated mechanism where leiomodin and tropomodulin regulate thin filament lengths by competing for thin filament binding. Data from experiments performed in cardiomyocytes provide additional support for the competition model; specifically, expression of a leiomodin mutant that is unable to interact with tropomyosin fails to displace tropomodulin at thin filament pointed ends and fails to elongate thin filaments. Together with previous structural and biochemical data, we now propose a molecular mechanism of actin polymerization at the pointed end in the presence of bound leiomodin. In the proposed model, the N-terminal actin-binding site of leiomodin can act as a “swinging gate” allowing limited actin polymerization, thus making leiomodin a leaky pointed-end cap. Results presented in this work answer long-standing questions about the role of leiomodin in thin filament length regulation and maintenance.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/dMzzfXTBLHU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Selective enhancement of low-gamma activity by tACS improves phonemic processing and reading accuracy in dyslexia</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/dE3pBlrvRXY/article</link>

The phonological deficit in dyslexia is associated with altered low-gamma oscillatory function in left auditory cortex, but a causal relationship between oscillatory function and phonemic processing has never been established. After confirming a deficit at 30 Hz with electroencephalography (EEG), we applied 20 minutes of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to transiently restore this activity in adults with dyslexia. The intervention significantly improved phonological processing and reading accuracy as measured immediately after tACS. The effect occurred selectively for a 30-Hz stimulation in the dyslexia group. Importantly, we observed that the focal intervention over the left auditory cortex also decreased 30-Hz activity in the right superior temporal cortex, resulting in reinstating a left dominance for the oscillatory response. These findings establish a causal role of neural oscillations in phonological processing and offer solid neurophysiological grounds for a potential correction of low-gamma anomalies and for alleviating the phonological deficit in dyslexia.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/dE3pBlrvRXY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Promotes Gait Training in Parkinson Disease</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25881?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine whether priming with 1 or 25Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) will enhance the benefits from treadmill training up to 3 months postintervention in people with Parkinson disease (PD), and to evaluate the underlying changes in cortical excitability.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This randomized double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial was conducted between October 2016 and December 2018. Fifty‐one participants with PD were randomized to receive 12 sessions of rTMS (25Hz, 1Hz, or sham) followed by treadmill training. All participants were assessed at baseline and 1 day, 1 month, and 3 months postintervention. Primary outcome was fastest walking speed, and secondary outcomes were timed up‐and‐go test (TUG), dual‐task TUG (DT‐TUG), motor section of the Movement Disorder Society–Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS‐UPDRS‐III), and electrophysiological evaluation of cortical excitability by TMS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1 and 25Hz rTMS groups produced a greater improvement in fastest walking speed at 1 day and 3 months postintervention than the sham group. Only the 1 and 25Hz rTMS groups sustained the improvements in TUG, and had a significant improvement in DT‐TUG and MDS‐UPDRS‐III for up to 3 months. Behavioral improvements correlated with increased cortical silent period and short‐interval intracortical inhibition in both groups receiving real rTMS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Priming with 1 and 25Hz rTMS can augment the benefits of treadmill training and lead to long‐term motor improvement up to 3 months postintervention. The motor improvement at follow‐up was associated with a normalization of cortical excitability, which in turn suggests an alteration of the homeostatic plasticity range. Rebalancing cortical excitability by rTMS appears critical for plasticity induction. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Ocular dominance plasticity: Molecular mechanisms revisited</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25001?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ocular dominance plasticity (ODP) is a type of cortical plasticity operating in visual cortex of mammals that are endowed with binocular vision based on the competition‐driven disparity. Earlier, a molecular mechanism was proposed that catecholamines play an important role in the maintenance of ODP in kittens. Having survived the initial test, the hypothesis was further advanced to identify noradrenaline (NA) as a key factor that regulates ODP in the immature cortex. Later, the ODP‐promoting effect of NA is extended to the adult with age‐related limitations. Following the enhanced NA availability, the chain events downstream lead to the β‐adrenoreceptor‐induced cAMP accumulation, which in turn activates the protein kinase A. Eventually, the protein kinase translocates to the cell nucleus to activate cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB). CREB is a cellular transcription factor that controls the transcription of various genes, underpinning neuronal plasticity and long‐term memory. In the advent of molecular genetics in that various types of new tools have become available with relative ease, ODP research has lightly adopted in the rodent model the original concepts and methodologies. Here, after briefly tracing the strategic maturation of our quest, the review moves to the later development of the field, with the emphasis placed around the following issues: (a) Are we testing ODP per se? (b) What does monocular deprivation deprive of the immature cortex? (c) The critical importance of binocular competition, (d) What is the adult plasticity? (e) Excitation–Inhibition balance in local circuits, and (f) Species differences in the animal models.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;The evolution of syllable structure in speech depended upon a coupling between vocalization and oscillatory movement of the jaw. Using functional MRI, we identify the neural basis of this coupling by demonstrating overlapping representations between the larynx and the jaw muscles in the human motor cortex.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A prominent model of the origins of speech, known as the “frame/content” theory, posits that oscillatory lowering and raising of the jaw provided an evolutionary scaffold for the development of syllable structure in speech. Because such oscillations are nonvocal in most nonhuman primates, the evolution of speech required the addition of vocalization onto this scaffold in order to turn such jaw oscillations into vocalized syllables. In the present functional MRI study, we demonstrate overlapping somatotopic representations between the larynx and the jaw muscles in the human primary motor cortex. This proximity between the larynx and jaw in the brain might support the coupling between vocalization and jaw oscillations to generate syllable structure. This model suggests that humans inherited voluntary control of jaw oscillations from ancestral species, but added voluntary control of vocalization onto this via the evolution of a new brain area that came to be situated near the jaw region in the human motor cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.581097</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a highly developed synapse linking motor neuron activity with muscle contraction. A complex of molecular cascades together with the specialized NMJ architecture ensures that each action potential arriving at the motor nerve terminal is translated into an action potential in the muscle fiber. The muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) is a key molecular component located at the postsynaptic muscle membrane responsible for the generation of the endplate potential (EPP), which usually exceeds the threshold potential necessary to activate voltage-gated sodium channels and triggers a muscle action potential. Two AChR isoforms are found in mammalian muscle. The fetal isoform is present in prenatal stages and is involved in the development of the neuromuscular system whereas the adult isoform prevails thereafter, except after denervation when the fetal form is re-expressed throughout the muscle. This review will summarize the structural and functional differences between the two isoforms and outline congenital and autoimmune myasthenic syndromes that involve the isoform specific AChR subunits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Unique and specific functions of the four mammalian p38 kinases are found in all major cell types in the brain. Mechanisms of p38 activation and downstream phosphorylation substrates in these different contexts are outlined and how they contribute to functions of p38 in physiological and under disease conditions. Results in different model organisms demonstrated that p38 kinases are involved in cognitive functions, including functions related to anxiety, addiction behavior, neurotoxicity, neurodegeneration, and decision making. Finally, the role of p38 kinases in psychiatric and neurological conditions and the current progress on therapeutic inhibitors targeting p38 kinases are covered and implicate p38 kinases in a multitude of CNS-related physiological and disease states.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Development and Validation of CRISPR Activator Systems for Overexpression of CB1 Receptors in Neurons</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00168</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Gene therapy approaches using viral vectors for the overexpression of target genes have been for several years the focus of gene therapy research against neurological disorders. These approaches deliver robust expression of therapeutic genes, but are typically limited to the delivery of single genes and often do not manipulate the expression of the endogenous locus. In the last years, the advent of CRISPR-Cas9 technologies have revolutionized many areas of scientific research by providing novel tools that allow simple and efficient manipulation of endogenous genes. One of the applications of CRISPR-Cas9, termed CRISPRa, based on the use of a nuclease-null Cas9 protein (dCas9) fused to transcriptional activators, enables quick and efficient increase in target endogenous gene expression. CRISPRa approaches are varied, and different alternatives exist with regards to the type of Cas9 protein and transcriptional activator used. Several of these approaches have been successfully used in neurons in vitro and in vivo, but have not been so far extensively applied for the overexpression of genes involved in synaptic transmission. Here we describe the development and application of two different CRISPRa systems, based on single or dual Lentiviral and Adeno-Associated viral vectors and VP64 or VPR transcriptional activators, and demonstrate their efficiency in increasing mRNA and protein expression of the Cnr1 gene, coding for neuronal CB1 receptors. Both approaches were similarly efficient in primary neuronal cultures, and achieved a 2–5-fold increase in Cnr1 expression, but the AAV-based approach was more efficient in vivo. Our dual AAV-based VPR system in particular, based on Staphylococcus aureus dCas9, when injected in the hippocampus, displayed almost complete simultaneous expression of both vectors, high levels of dCas9 expression, and good efficiency in increasing Cnr1 mRNA as measured by in situ hybridization. In addition, we also show significant upregulation of CB1 receptor protein in vivo, which is reflected by an increased ability in reducing neurotransmitter release, as measured by electrophysiology. Our results show that CRISPRa techniques could be successfully used in neurons to target overexpression of genes involved in synaptic transmission, and can potentially represent a next-generation gene therapy approach against neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Gene Expression Profile at the Motor Endplate of the Neuromuscular Junction of Fast-Twitch Muscle</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00154</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a prototypic chemical synapse between the spinal motor neuron and the motor endplate. Gene expression profiles of the motor endplate are not fully elucidated. Collagen Q (ColQ) is a collagenic tail subunit of asymmetric forms of acetylcholinesterase and is driven by two distinct promoters. pColQ1 is active throughout the slow-twitch muscle, whereas pColQ1a is active at the motor endplate of fast-twitch muscle. We made a transgenic mouse line that expresses nuclear localization signal (NLS)-attached Cre recombinase under the control of pColQ1a (pColQ1a-Cre mouse). RiboTag mouse expresses an HA-tagged ribosomal subunit, RPL22, in cells expressing Cre recombinase. We generated pColQ1a-Cre:RiboTag mouse, and confirmed that HA-tagged RPL22 was enriched at the NMJ of tibialis anterior (TA) muscle. Next, we confirmed that Chrne and Musk that are specifically expressed at the NMJ were indeed enriched in HA-immunoprecipitated (IP) RNA, whereas Sox10 and S100b, markers for Schwann cells, and Icam1, a marker for vascular endothelial cells, and Pax3, a marker for muscle satellite cells, were scarcely detected. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of RNA-seq data showed that “phosphatidylinositol signaling system” and “extracellular matrix receptor interaction” were enriched at the motor endplate. Subsequent analysis revealed that genes encoding diacylglycerol kinases, phosphatidylinositol kinases, phospholipases, integrins, and laminins were enriched at the motor endplate. We first characterized the gene expression profile under translation at the motor endplate of TA muscle using the RiboTag technique. We expect that our gene expression profiling will help elucidate molecular mechanisms of the development, maintenance, and pathology of the NMJ.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: The Discovery and Characterization of Targeted Perikaryal-Specific Brain Lesions With Excitotoxins</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00927</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The neurotoxic action of glutamic acid was first described by Lucas and Newhouse, who demonstrated neural degeneration in the inner layers of the neonatal mouse retina after systemic treatment with L-glutamate. Olney extended these findings by showing that neuronal degeneration affected other brain structures including neurons within the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the area postrema, that the lesion spared axons passing through these areas, and that the neurotoxic potency of glutamate analogs correlated with their excitatory potency, resulting in the designation “excitotoxins.” As this method affected only a small number of brain regions, it was not suitable for targeted brain lesions. The Coyle laboratory showed that direct injection of the potent glutamate receptor agonist, kainic acid, into the rat striatum caused a rapid degeneration of intrinsic neurons while sparing axons of passage or termination including the unmyelinated dopaminergic terminals. Kainic acid also exhibited this perikaryal-specific and axon-sparing profile when injected into the cerebellum, hippocampus and eye. However, neuronal vulnerability was highly variable, with hippocampal CA3, pyriform cortex and amygdala neurons exhibiting great sensitivity due to kainate’s high convulsive activity. In a comparison study, ibotenic acid, a potent glutamatergic agonist isolated from the amanita muscaria mushroom, was found to have excitotoxic potency comparable to kainate but was far less epileptogenic. Ibotenate produced spherical, perikaryal-specific lesions regardless of the site of injection, and experiments with specific glutamate receptor antagonists showed that its effects were mediated by the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor. Because of this uniform neurotoxicity and near ubiquitous efficacy, ibotenic acid became the excitotoxic lesioning agent of choice. The discovery of the excitotoxic properties of the tryptophan metabolite quinolinic acid and of the anti-excitotoxic, neuroprotective effects of the related metabolite kynurenic acid in the Schwarcz laboratory then gave rise to the concept that these endogenous compounds may play causative roles in the neuropathology of a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00925</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) could highly induce coagulopathy through breaking the dynamic balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis systems, which may be a major contributor to the progressive secondary injury cascade that occurs after TBI. Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) inhibition is reported to exert neuroprotection in TBI, making it a potential regulatory target involved in TBI-induced coagulation disorder. PTEN level is controlled in a major way by E3 ligase-mediated degradation through the ubiquitin–proteasome system. The C terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) has been shown to regulate proteasomal degradation and ubiquitination level of PTEN. In the present study, CHIP was overexpressed and knocked down in mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells (bEnd.3) and tissues during the early phase of TBI. In vitro cell proliferation, cell apoptosis, migration capacity, and invasion capacity were determined. The changes of procoagulant and apoptosis molecules after TBI were also detected as well as the micrangium density and blood–brain barrier permeability after in vivo TBI. In vitro results demonstrated that CHIP overexpression facilitated bEnd.3 cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and downregulated cell apoptosis and the expressions of procoagulant molecules through promoting PTEN ubiquitination in a simulated TBI model with stretch-induced injury treatment. In vivo experiments also demonstrated that CHIP overexpression suppressed post-TBI apoptosis and procoagulant protein expressions, as well as increased microvessel density, reduced hemorrhagic injury, and blood–brain barrier permeability. These findings suggested that the upregulation of CHIP may attenuate apoptosis and procoagulant activity, facilitate brain repair, and thus exerts neuroprotective effects in TBI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Alzheimer’s Retinopathy: Seeing Disease in the Eyes</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00921</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The neurosensory retina emerges as a prominent site of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology. As a CNS extension of the brain, the neuro retina is easily accessible for noninvasive, high-resolution imaging. Studies have shown that along with cognitive decline, patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD often suffer from visual impairments, abnormal electroretinogram patterns, and circadian rhythm disturbances that can, at least in part, be attributed to retinal damage. Over a decade ago, our group identified the main pathological hallmark of AD, amyloid β-protein (Aβ) plaques, in the retina of patients including early-stage clinical cases. Subsequent histological, biochemical and in vivo retinal imaging studies in animal models and in humans corroborated these findings and further revealed other signs of AD neuropathology in the retina. Among these signs, hyperphosphorylated tau, neuronal degeneration, retinal thinning, vascular abnormalities and gliosis were documented. Further, linear correlations between the severity of retinal and brain Aβ concentrations and plaque pathology were described. More recently, extensive retinal pericyte loss along with vascular platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β deficiency were discovered in postmortem retinas of MCI and AD patients. This progressive loss was closely associated with increased retinal vascular amyloidosis and predicted cerebral amyloid angiopathy scores. These studies brought excitement to the field of retinal exploration in AD. Indeed, many questions still remain open, such as queries related to the temporal progression of AD-related pathology in the retina compared to the brain, the relations between retinal and cerebral changes and whether retinal signs can predict cognitive decline. The extent to which AD affects the retina, including the susceptibility of certain topographical regions and cell types, is currently under intense investigation. Advances in retinal amyloid imaging, hyperspectral imaging, optical coherence tomography, and OCT-angiography encourage the use of such modalities to achieve more accurate, patient- and user-friendly, noninvasive detection and monitoring of AD. In this review, we summarize the current status in the field while addressing the many unknowns regarding Alzheimer’s retinopathy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Individual Baseline Performance and Electrode Montage Impact on the Effects of Anodal tDCS Over the Left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00349</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), applied over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (lDLPFC), can produce significant effects on working memory (WM) performance and associated neurophysiological activity. However, results from previous studies are inconsistent and occasionally contradictory. This inconsistency may be attributed to methodological and individual differences during experiments. This study therefore investigated two hypotheses: (1) A multichannel-optimized montage was expected to be more effective than a classical bipolar montage, because of increased focality. (2) The subjects were expected to benefit differently from the stimulation depending on their initial task performance. In a sham-controlled crossover study, 24 healthy participants received bipolar, multichannel, and sham stimulation for 20 min in randomized order, targeting the lDLPFC while performing a 2-back WM task. After stimulation, electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded at rest and during 2-back and nontarget continuous performance task (CPT) performance. Bipolar and multichannel stimulations were both well tolerated and effectively blinded. We found no effect of stimulation on behavioral performance or neuronal oscillations comparing the classical bipolar or multichannel montage with sham stimulation. We did, however, find an interaction between stimulation and initial task performance. For multichannel stimulation, initially low-performing participants tended to improve their WM performance while initially high-performing participants tended to worsen their performance compared to sham stimulation. Both tDCS montages induced changes in neural oscillatory power, which correlated with baseline performance. The worse the participants’ initial WM performance was, the more task-related theta power was induced by multichannel and bipolar stimulation. The same effect was observed for alpha power in the nontarget task following multichannel stimulation. Notably, we were not able to show a superiority of multichannel stimulation compared to bipolar stimulation. Still, comparing both montages with sham stimulation, multichannel stimulation led to stronger effects than bipolar stimulation. The current study highlights the importance of investigating different parameters with potential influence on tDCS effects in combination. Our results demonstrate how individual differences in cognitive performance and electrode montages influence effects of tDCS on neuropsychological performance. These findings support the idea of an individualized and optimized stimulation setting, potentially leading to increased tDCS effects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Using Communication to Modulate Neural Synchronization in Teams</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00332</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Throughout training and team performance, teams may be assessed based on their communication patterns to identify which behaviors contributed to the team’s performance; however, this process of establishing meaning in communication is burdensome and time consuming despite the low monetary cost. A current topic in team research is developing covert measures, which are easier to analyze in real-time, to identify team processes as they occur during team performance; however, little is known about how overt and covert measures of team process relate to one another. In this study, we investigated the relationship between overt (communication) and covert (neural) measures of team process by manipulating the interaction partner (participant or experimenter) team members worked with and the type of task (decision-making or action-based) teams performed to assess their effects on team neural synchronization (measured as neurodynamic entropy) and communication (measured as both flow and content). The results indicated that the type of task affected how the teams structured their communication but had unpredictable effects on the neural synchronization of the team when averaged across the task session. The interaction partner did not affect team neural synchronization when averaged. However, there were significant relationships when communication and neural processes were examined over time between the neurodynamic entropy and the communication flow time series due to both the type of task and the interaction partner. Specifically, significant relationships across time were observed when participants were interacting with the other participant, during the second task trial, and across different regions of the cortex depending on the type of task being performed. The findings from the time series analyses suggest that factors that are previously known to affect communication (interaction partner and task type) also structure the relationship between team communication and neural synchronization—cross-level effects—but only when examined across time. Future research should consider these factors when developing new conceptualizations of team process measurement for measuring team performance over time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Effects of Nicotine Gum Administration on Vision (ENIGMA-Vis): Study Protocol of a Double-Blind, Randomized, and Controlled Clinical Trial</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00314</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Studies reported that tobacco addiction was related to visual impairments, but one unresolved issue is whether the impairments are related to the many compounds existing in the cigarettes or to the effects of nicotine. On the other hand, nicotine gum can be used as replacement therapy or as a neuroprotective agent for some diseases. The main purpose of this controlled trial is to investigate the effects of nicotine gum on vision. The ENIGMA-Vis trial aims to compare two dosages of nicotine gum (2 and 4 mg) and a placebo gum in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 100 participants to be allocated into a single group assignment of repeated measures (two studies; N = 50 for each one). Eligibility criteria are healthy non-smokers not diagnosed with substance abuse and without an acute or chronic medical condition. Intervention will last three sessions for each participant with a window frame of 1 week per session. Study outcomes are (1) short-term effects of nicotine gum on contrast sensitivity; (2) short-term effects of nicotine gum on chromatic contrast discrimination; and (3) whether demographics, body mass index, or serum cotinine predicts response of visual processing. This study addresses an important gap in the effects of nicotine on vision. One of the main takeaways of this study is to understand the effects of nicotine on contrast sensitivity and chromatic contrast discrimination. This information will provide a further understanding of how nicotine interacts with early visual processes and help determine how the different components present during smoking can affect vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration Number: RBR-46tjy3.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00273</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are used to establish patient-specific cell lines and are ideal models to mirror the pathological features of diseases and investigate their underlying mechanisms in vitro, especially for rare genic diseases. Here, a de novo mutation c.1509dupA (p.R503fs) in fused in sarcoma (FUS) was detected in a patient with sporadic juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (JALS). JALS is a rare and severe form of ALS with unclear pathogenesis and no effective cure. An induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line carrying the de novo mutation was established, and it represents a good tool to study JALS pathogenesis and gene therapy strategies for the treatment of this condition. The established human iPSC line carrying the de novoFUS mutation strongly expressed pluripotency markers and could be differentiated into three embryonic germ layers with no gross chromosomal aberrations. Furthermore, the iPSCs could be successfully differentiated into motor neurons exhibiting the pathological characteristics of ALS. Our results indicate that this line may be useful for uncovering the pathogenesis of sporadic JALS and screen for drugs to treat this disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Morphological Responses of Excitatory Prelimbic and Orbitofrontal Cortical Neurons to Excess Corticosterone in Adolescence and Acute Stress in Adulthood</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00045</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Considerable evidence indicates that chronic stress and excess glucocorticoids induce neuronal remodeling in prefrontal cortical (PFC) regions. Adolescence is also characterized by a structural reorganization of PFC neurons, yet interactions between stress- and age-related structural plasticity are still being determined. We quantified dendritic spine densities on apical dendrites of excitatory neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex, prelimbic subregion (PL). Densities decreased across adolescent development, as expected, and spine volume increased. Unexpectedly, exposure to excess corticosterone (CORT) throughout adolescence did not cause additional dendritic spine loss detectable in adulthood. As a positive control dendrite population expected to be sensitive to CORT, we imaged neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), confirming CORT-induced dendritic spine attrition on basal arbors of layer V neurons. We next assessed the effects of acute, mild stress in adulthood: On PL neurons, an acute stressor increased the density of mature, mushroom-shaped spines. Meanwhile, on OFC neurons, dendritic spine volumes and lengths were lower in mice exposed to both CORT and an acute stressor (also referred to as a “double hit”). In sum, prolonged exposure to excess glucocorticoids during adolescence can have morphological and also metaplastic consequences, but they are not global. Anatomical considerations are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Circulating Exosome microRNAs as Diagnostic Biomarkers of Dementia</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.580199</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dementia is a syndrome of acquired cognitive impairment that leads to a significant decline in a patient’s daily life, ability to learn, and the ability to communicate with others. Dementia occurs in many diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies, frontotemporal dementia, and Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD). Although the analysis of biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and peripheral blood physicochemical analysis can indicate neurological impairment, there are currently no sensitive biomarkers for early clinical diagnosis of dementia or for identifying the cause of dementia. Previous studies have suggested that circulating micro (mi)RNAs may be used as biomarkers for diagnosing neurological disorders. However, miRNAs are susceptible to interference by other components in the peripheral circulation, bringing into question the diagnostic value of circulating miRNAs. Exosomes secreted by most cell types contain proteins, mRNAs, and miRNAs that are closely associated with changes in cellular functions. Exosome miRNAs (ex-miRNAs) are highly stable and resistant to degradation. Therefore, these may serve as useful biomarkers for the early clinical diagnosis of dementia. Here, we review studies of ex-miRNAs that commonly cause clinical dementia and explore whether ex-miRNAs may be used as early diagnostic biomarkers of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Here we investigated the effects of the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) performed with natural speaking, on the results of linguistic activations. We found that overt speaking during fMRI induced few artifacts and did not significantly affect the results, allowing the identification of areas involved in primary motor control and prosodic regulation of speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid motion artifacts, almost all speech‐related functional magnetic resonance imagings (fMRIs) are performed covertly to detect language activations. This method may be difficult to execute, especially by patients with brain tumors, and does not allow the identification of phonological areas. Here, we aimed to evaluate overt task feasibility. Thirty‐three volunteers participated in this study. They performed two functional sessions of covert and overt generation of a short sentence semantically linked with a word. Three main contrasts were performed: Covert and Overt for the isolation of language‐activated areas, and Overt &amp;gt; Covert for the isolation of the motor cortical activation of speech. fMRI data preprocessing was performed with and without unwarping, and with and without regression of movement parameters as confounding variables. All types of results were compared to each other. For the Overt contrast, Dice coefficients showed strong overlap between each pair of types of results: 0.98 for the pair with and without unwarping, and 0.9 for the pair with and without movement parameter regression. The Overt &amp;gt; Covert contrast allowed isolation of motor laryngeal activations with high statistical reliability and revealed the right‐lateralized temporal activity related to acoustic feedback. Overt speaking during magnetic resonance imaging induced few artifacts and did not significantly affect the results, allowing the identification of areas involved in primary motor control and prosodic regulation of speech. Unwarping and motion artifact regression in the postprocessing step, seem to not be necessary. Changes in lateralization of cortical activity by overt speech shall be explored before using these tasks for presurgical mapping.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

We conducted Mendelian randomization analyses where genetic variants indexed expected effects of modulating lipid‐lowering drug targets on PD.

	<title>Hippocampus: Interindividual differences in memory system local field potential activity predict behavioral strategy on a dual‐solution T‐maze</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23258?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individuals can use diverse behavioral strategies to navigate their environment including hippocampal‐dependent place strategies reliant upon cognitive maps and striatal‐dependent response strategies reliant upon egocentric body turns. The existence of multiple memory systems appears to facilitate successful navigation across a wide range of environmental and physiological conditions. The mechanisms by which these systems interact to ultimately generate a unitary behavioral response, however, remain unclear. We trained 20 male, Sprague–Dawley rats on a dual‐solution T‐maze while simultaneously recording local field potentials that were targeted to the dorsolateral striatum and dorsal hippocampus. Eight rats spontaneously exhibited a place strategy while the remaining 12 rats exhibited a response strategy. Interindividual differences in behavioral strategy were associated with distinct patterns of LFP activity between the dorsolateral striatum and dorsal hippocampus. Specifically, striatal‐hippocampal theta activity was in‐phase in response rats and out‐of‐phase in place rats and response rats exhibited elevated striatal‐hippocampal coherence across a wide range of frequency bands. These contrasting striatal‐hippocampal activity regimes were (a) present during both maze‐learning and a 30 min premaze habituation period and (b) could be used to train support vector machines to reliably predict behavioral strategy. Distinct patterns of neuronal activity across multiple memory systems, therefore, appear to bias behavioral strategy selection and thereby contribute to interindividual differences in behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Developmental onset of enduring long‐term potentiation in mouse hippocampus</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23257?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis of long‐term potentiation (LTP) provides a powerful window into cellular mechanisms of learning and memory. Prior work shows late LTP (L‐LTP), lasting &amp;gt;3 hr, occurs abruptly at postnatal day 12 (P12) in the &lt;i&gt;stratum radiatum&lt;/i&gt; of rat hippocampal area CA1. The goal here was to determine the developmental profile of synaptic plasticity leading to L‐LTP in the mouse hippocampus. Two mouse strains and two mutations known to affect synaptic plasticity were chosen: C57BL/6J and &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;−/y&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; on the C57BL/6J background, and 129SVE and &lt;i&gt;Hevin&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Sparcl1&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;) on the 129SVE background. Like rats, hippocampal slices from all of the mice showed test pulse‐induced depression early during development that was gradually resolved with maturation by 5 weeks. All the mouse strains showed a gradual progression between P10‐P35 in the expression of short‐term potentiation (STP), lasting ≤1 hr. In the 129SVE mice, L‐LTP onset (&amp;gt;25% of slices) occurred by 3 weeks, reliable L‐LTP (&amp;gt;50% slices) was achieved by 4 weeks, and &lt;i&gt;Hevin&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; advanced this profile by 1 week. In the C57BL/6J mice, L‐LTP onset occurred significantly later, over 3–4 weeks, and reliability was not achieved until 5 weeks. Although some of the &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;−/y&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; mice showed L‐LTP before 3 weeks, reliable L‐LTP also was not achieved until 5 weeks. L‐LTP onset was not advanced in any of the mouse genotypes by multiple bouts of theta‐burst stimulation at 90 or 180 min intervals. These findings show important species differences in the onset of STP and L‐LTP, which occur at the same age in rats but are sequentially acquired in mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Ontogeny of the electric organ discharge and of the papillae of the electrocytes in the weakly electric fish Campylomormyrus rhynchophorus (Teleostei: Mormyridae)&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ad8fb53b-4c7a-4e24-9ed2-7bafbe8ea5ec/cne25003-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electric organ (EO) of mormyrid weakly electric fish is located in the tail on either side of the spinal cord. It consists of dorsal and ventral columns of serially arranged electrocytes which are derivatives of muscle cells. In &lt;i&gt;Campylomormyrus rhynchophorus&lt;/i&gt; it produces a long triphasic discharge. We investigated the development of the EOD and the morphology of the electrocytes in order to correlate ontogenetic changes in length and shape of the EOD with dynamic morphological characteristics of the electrocyte, in particular the formation of surface evaginations (papillae) of the anterior face of electrocytes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electric organ of the mormyrid weakly electric fish, &lt;i&gt;Campylomormyrus rhynchophorus&lt;/i&gt; (Boulenger, 1898), undergoes changes in both the electric organ discharge (EOD) and the light and electron microscopic morphology as the fish mature from the juvenile to the adult form. Of particular interest was the appearance of papillae, surface specializations of the uninnervated anterior face of the electrocyte, which have been hypothesized to increase the duration of the EOD. In a 24.5 mm long juvenile the adult electric organ (EO) was not yet functional, and the electrocytes lacked papillae. A 40 mm long juvenile, which produced a short biphasic EOD of 1.3 ms duration, shows small papillae (average area 136 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). In contrast, the EOD of a 79 mm long juvenile was triphasic. The large increase in duration of the EOD to 23.2 ms was accompanied by a small change in size of the papillae (average area 159 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Similarly, a 150 mm long adult produced a triphasic EOD of comparable duration to the younger stage (24.7 ms) but featured a prominent increase in size of the papillae (average area 402 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Thus, there was no linear correlation between EOD duration and papillary size. The most prominent ultrastructural change was at the level of the myofilaments, which regularly extended into the papillae, only in the oldest specimen—probably serving a supporting function. Physiological mechanisms, like gene expression levels, as demonstrated in some &lt;i&gt;Campylomormyrus&lt;/i&gt; species, might be more important concerning the duration of the EOD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Dynamic Properties of a Brain Network During Spatial Working Memory Tasks in College Students With ADHD Traits</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.580813</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This study investigated deficits of spatial working memory in college students with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) traits using event-related potentials (ERPs) and the spatial 2-back task. We also computed sensory-level activity using EEG data and investigated theta and alpha neural oscillations, phase-locking values (PLV), and brain networks. Based on the scores from the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) and Conners’ Adult ADHD Rating Scales (CAARS), an ADHD-trait group (n = 40) and a normal control group (n = 41) were selected. Participants were required to respond to whether the presented stimulus was at the same location as that presented two trials earlier. The ADHD-trait group showed significantly slower response times than the control group in the spatial 2-back task. In terms of spectrum, the ADHD-trait group showed significantly reduced theta power than the control group. In contrast, the ADHD-trait group exhibited an increased alpha power compared to the control group with the 250–1000 ms interval after stimulus onset. In terms of the PLV, the ADHD-trait group showed significantly weaker theta phase synchrony and fewer connection numbers in frontal-occipital areas than the control group. In terms of the theta brain network, the ADHD-trait group showed a significantly lower clustering coefficient and longer characteristic path length than the control group for the theta band. The present results indicate that college students with ADHD traits have deficits in spatial working memory and that these abnormal activities in neural oscillation, functional connectivity, and the network may contribute to spatial working memory deficits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Learning Long Temporal Sequences in Spiking Networks by Multiplexing Neural Oscillations</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00078</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many cognitive and behavioral tasks—such as interval timing, spatial navigation, motor control, and speech—require the execution of precisely-timed sequences of neural activation that cannot be fully explained by a succession of external stimuli. We show how repeatable and reliable patterns of spatiotemporal activity can be generated in chaotic and noisy spiking recurrent neural networks. We propose a general solution for networks to autonomously produce rich patterns of activity by providing a multi-periodic oscillatory signal as input. We show that the model accurately learns a variety of tasks, including speech generation, motor control, and spatial navigation. Further, the model performs temporal rescaling of natural spoken words and exhibits sequential neural activity commonly found in experimental data involving temporal processing. In the context of spatial navigation, the model learns and replays compressed sequences of place cells and captures features of neural activity such as the emergence of ripples and theta phase precession. Together, our findings suggest that combining oscillatory neuronal inputs with different frequencies provides a key mechanism to generate precisely timed sequences of activity in recurrent circuits of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>VPS10P (vacuolar protein sorting 10 protein) domain receptors are neuronal sorting receptors that direct cargo proteins to their destined location in subcellular compartments of the soma, dendrites, and the axon. Protein sorting by receptors such as SORLA, sortilin, and SorCS2 controls functional integrity and viability of neurons, whereas sorting receptor dysfunctions are linked to acute, psychiatric, and neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we discuss molecular mechanisms that define ligand repertoire and sorting path and that control plasticity of VPS10P domain receptor expression in the healthy brain and in response to injury.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Astrocytes control multiple processes in the nervous system in health and disease. It is now clear that specific astrocyte subsets or activation states are associated with specific genomic programs and functions. The advent of novel genomic technologies has enabled rapid progress in the characterization of astrocyte heterogeneity and its control by astrocyte interactions with other cells in the central nervous system (CNS). In this review, we provide an overview of the multifaceted roles of astrocytes in the context of CNS inflammation, highlighting recent discoveries on astrocyte subsets and their regulation. We explore mechanisms of crosstalk between astrocytes and other cells in the CNS in the context of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration and discuss how these interactions shape pathological outcomes.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Variation of pro‐vasopressin processing in parvocellular and magnocellular neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus: Evidence from the vasopressin‐related glycopeptide copeptin&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/cd81417a-11a0-4379-9874-ac745cd4c184/cne25026-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is a neuropeptide produced in multiple nuclei including the paraventricular nucleus and the supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus, and the suprachiasmatic nucleus. The &lt;i&gt;AVP&lt;/i&gt; gene encodes prepro‐AVP that comprise the signal peptide, AVP, neurophysin (NPII), and the related glycopeptide copeptin. Here, we report not only that there are species differences between rodents and primates in the processing of the pro‐AVP precursor and production of free copeptin, but also that the processing may not be the same in different groups of pro‐AVP‐expressing cells within a given species.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is synthesized in parvocellular‐ and magnocellular neuroendocrine neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. Whereas magnocellular AVP neurons project primarily to the posterior pituitary, parvocellular AVP neurons project to the median eminence and to extrahypothalamic areas. The &lt;i&gt;AVP&lt;/i&gt; gene encodes pre‐provasopressin that comprises the signal peptide, AVP, neurophysin (NPII), and a copeptin glycopeptide. In the present study, we used an N‐terminal copeptin antiserum to examine copeptin expression in magno‐ and parvocellular neurons in the hypothalamus in the mouse, rat, and macaque monkey. Although magnocellular NPII‐expressing neurons exhibited strong N‐terminal copeptin immunoreactivity in all three species, most parvocellular neurons that expressed NPII were devoid of copeptin immunoreactivity in mouse (~90%) and in rat (~53%), whereas in monkey hypothalamus, all NPII‐immunoreactive parvocellular neurons contained strong copeptin immunoreactivity. Immunoelectron microscopy in the mouse clearly showed copeptin‐immunoreactivity co‐localized with NPII‐immunoreactivity in neurosecretory vesicles in the internal median eminence and posterior pituitary, but not in the external median eminence. Intracerebroventricular administration of a prohormone convertase inhibitor, hexa‐&lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;‐arginine amide (D6R) resulted in a marked reduction of copeptin‐immunoreactivity in the NPII‐immunoreactive magnocellular PVN neurons in the mouse, suggesting that low protease activity and incomplete processing of pro‐vasopressin could explain the disproportionally low levels of N‐terminal copeptin expression in rodent AVP (NPII)‐expressing parvocellular neurons. Current use of the assay of copeptin as a surrogate for vasopressin means that physiologic and phylogenetic aspects of copeptin expression among neuroendocrine neurons require further exploration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A comprehensive look at the whole brain serotonergic projection using the SERT‐EGFP transgenic mice. The area specific pattern and rostro‐caudal change from the raphe nuclei in brainstem were mapped.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is well established that serotonergic fibers distribute throughout the brain. Abnormal densities or patterns of serotonergic fibers have been implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders. Although many classical studies have examined the distribution pattern of serotonergic fibers, most of them were either limited to specific brain areas or had limitations in demonstrating the fine axonal morphology. In this study, we utilize male mice expressing GFP under the SERT promoter to map the topography of serotonergic fibers across the rostro‐caudal extent of each brain area. We demonstrate previously unreported regional density and fine‐grained anatomy of serotonergic fibers. Our findings include: 1) SERT fibers distribute abundantly in the thalamic nuclei close to the midline and dorsolateral areas, in most of the hypothalamic nuclei with few exceptions such as the median eminence and arcuate nuclei, and within the basal amygdaloid complex and lateral septal nuclei, 2) the source fibers of innervation of the hippocampus traverse through the septal nuclei before reaching its destination, 3) unique, filamentous type of straight terminal fibers within the nucleus accumbens, 4) laminar pattern of innervation in the hippocampus, olfactory bulb and cortex with heterogenicity in innervation density among the layers, 5) cortical labelling density gradually decreases rostro‐caudally, 6) fibers traverse and distribute mostly within the gray matter, leaving the white fiber bundles uninnervated, and 7) most of the highly labelled nuclei and cortical areas have predominant anatomical connection to limbic structures. In conclusion, we provide novel, regionally specific insights on the distribution map of serotonergic fibers using transgenic mouse.&lt;/p&gt;

At the macroscale, the brain operates as a network of interconnected neuronal populations, which display coordinated rhythmic dynamics that support interareal communication. Understanding how stimulation of different brain areas impacts such activity is important for gaining basic insights into brain function and for further developing therapeutic neurmodulation. However, the complexity of brain structure and dynamics hinders predictions regarding the downstream effects of focal stimulation. More specifically, little is known about how the collective oscillatory regime of brain network activity—in concert with network structure—affects the outcomes of perturbations. Here, we combine human connectome data and biophysical modeling to begin filling these gaps. By tuning parameters that control collective system dynamics, we identify distinct states of simulated brain activity and investigate how the distributed effects of stimulation manifest at different dynamical working points. When baseline oscillations are weak, the stimulated area exhibits enhanced power and frequency, and due to network interactions, activity in this excited frequency band propagates to nearby regions. Notably, beyond these linear effects, we further find that focal stimulation causes more distributed modifications to interareal coherence in a band containing regions’ baseline oscillation frequencies. Importantly, depending on the dynamical state of the system, these broadband effects can be better predicted by functional rather than structural connectivity, emphasizing a complex interplay between anatomical organization, dynamics, and response to perturbation. In contrast, when the network operates in a regime of strong regional oscillations, stimulation causes only slight shifts in power and frequency, and structural connectivity becomes most predictive of stimulation-induced changes in network activity patterns. In sum, this work builds upon and extends previous computational studies investigating the impacts of stimulation, and underscores the fact that both the stimulation site, and, crucially, the regime of brain network dynamics, can influence the network-wide responses to local perturbations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uAVtzrkU2EE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Microbial dysbiosis in the upper digestive tract is linked to an increased risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Overabundance of &lt;i&gt;Porphyromonas gingivalis&lt;/i&gt; is associated with shorter survival of ESCC patients. We investigated the molecular mechanisms driving aggressive progression of ESCC by &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gingivalis&lt;/i&gt;. Intracellular invasion of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gingivalis&lt;/i&gt; potentiated proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis abilities of ESCC cells via transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ)-dependent &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; mothers against decapentaplegic homologs (Smads)/Yes-associated protein (YAP)/Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) activation. Smads/YAP/TAZ/TEA domain transcription factor1 (TEAD1) complex formation was essential to initiate downstream target gene expression, inducing an epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stemness features. Furthermore, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gingivalis&lt;/i&gt; augmented secretion and bioactivity of TGFβ through glycoprotein A repetitions predominant (GARP) up-regulation. Accordingly, disruption of either the GARP/TGFβ axis or its activated Smads/YAP/TAZ complex abrogated the tumor-promoting role of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gingivalis&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gingivalis&lt;/i&gt; signature genes based on its activated effector molecules can efficiently distinguish ESCC patients into low- and high-risk groups. Targeting &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gingivalis&lt;/i&gt; or its activated effectors may provide novel insights into clinical management of ESCC.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/D7-8ixyJAjk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

As a novel alternative to established surface display or combinatorial chemistry approaches for the discovery of therapeutic peptides, we present a method for the isolation of small, cysteine-rich domains from bovine antibody ultralong complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). We show for the first time that isolated bovine antibody knob domains can function as autonomous entities by binding antigen outside the confines of the antibody scaffold. This yields antibody fragments so small as to be considered peptides, each stabilised by an intricate, bespoke arrangement of disulphide bonds. For drug discovery, cow immunisations harness the immune system to generate knob domains with affinities in the picomolar to low nanomolar range, orders of magnitude higher than unoptimized peptides from naïve library screening. Using this approach, knob domain peptides that tightly bound Complement component C5 were obtained, at scale, using conventional antibody discovery and peptide purification techniques.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/SDm1YrOZ8ss&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Implantable Cardiac Monitoring in the Secondary Prevention of Cryptogenic Stroke</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25886?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we sought to evaluate the impact of implantable cardiac monitoring (ICM) in the prevention of stroke recurrence after a cryptogenic ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We evaluated consecutive patients with cryptogenic ischemic stroke or TIA admitted in a comprehensive stroke center during an 8‐year period. We compared the baseline characteristics and outcomes between patients receiving conventional cardiac monitoring with repeated 24‐hour Holter‐monitoring during the first 5 years in the outpatient setting and those receiving continuous cardiac monitoring with ICM during the last 3 years. Associations on the outcomes of interest were further assessed in multivariable regression models adjusting for potential confounders.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified a total of 373 patients receiving conventional cardiac monitoring and 123 patients receiving ICM. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) detection was higher in the ICM cohort compared to the conventional cardiac monitoring cohort (21.1% vs 7.5%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). ICM was independently associated with an increased likelihood of PAF detection during follow‐up (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.16–3.24) in multivariable analyses. Patients receiving ICM were also found to have significantly higher rates of anticoagulation initiation (18.7% vs 6.4%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and lower risk of stroke recurrence (4.1% vs 11.8%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.013). ICM was independently associated with a lower risk of stroke recurrence during follow‐up (HR = 0.32, 95% CI = 0.11–0.90) in multivariable analyses.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICM appears to be independently associated with a higher likelihood of PAF detection and anticoagulation initiation after a cryptogenic ischemic stroke or TIA. ICM was also independently related to lower risk of stroke recurrence in our cryptogenic stroke / TIA cohort. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Alertness Training Improves Spatial Bias and Functional Ability in Spatial Neglect</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25862?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conducted a multisite, randomized, double‐blinded, controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of a digital health intervention targeting the intrinsic regulation of goal‐directed alertness in patients with chronic hemispatial neglect.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forty‐nine participants with hemispatial neglect, who demonstrated significant spatially biased attention after acquired brain injury, were randomly assigned to the experimental attention remediation treatment or the active control group. The participants engaged with the remotely administered interventions for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was spatial bias on the Posner cueing task (response time difference: left minus right target trials). Secondary outcomes included functional abilities (measured via the Catherine Bergego scale and Barthel index), spatial cognition, executive function, quality of life, and sleep. Assessments were conducted before and immediately after participation in the experimental intervention or control condition, and again after a 3‐month no‐contact period.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with the active control group, the intervention group exhibited a significant improvement in the primary outcome, a reduction in spatially biased attention on the Posner cueing task (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.010, Cohen's &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; = 0.96), in addition to significant improvements in functional abilities as measured on the Catherine Bergego and Barthel indices (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.027, Cohen's &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; = 0.24).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results demonstrate that our attention training program was effective in improving the debilitating attention deficits common to hemispatial neglect. This benefit generalized to improvements in real‐world functional abilities. This safe, highly scalable, and self‐administered treatment for hemispatial neglect might serve as a useful addition to the existing standard of care. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;In rodents, the period of increased vulnerability to the developmental effects of general anesthetics coincides with the period of age-specific organizing (masculinizing) effects of the major female sex hormone 17β-estradiol (E2) in the male brain and excitatory GABA type A receptor (GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R) signaling. We studied whether E2 synthesis and excitatory GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R signaling are involved in the mediation of the developmental effects of sevoflurane in male rats.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Male Sprague-Dawley rats were pretreated with the inhibitors of E2 synthesis, formestane, or the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-2Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; (NKCC1) Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; importer, bumetanide, prior to sevoflurane exposure for 6 h on postnatal (P) day 4, P5, or P6. We tested whether a subsequent exposure of these rats to sevoflurane on P∼10 would cause electroencephalography (EEG)-detectable seizures. We also evaluated their behavior during the elevated plus maze (EPM) test on P∼60, prepulse inhibition (PPI) of acoustic startle responses on P∼70, and corticosterone secretion to physical restraint on P∼80.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The rats neonatally exposed to sevoflurane responded to repeated exposure to sevoflurane with increased EEG-detectable seizures (F&lt;sub&gt;(&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;)&lt;/sub&gt; = 7.445, P = 0.001) and exhibited deficiencies during the EPM (F&lt;sub&gt;(&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;sub&gt;55&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;)&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.397, P = 0.008) and PPI (F&lt;sub&gt;(&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;sub&gt;110&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;)&lt;/sub&gt; = 5.222, P = 0.003) tests. They also responded to physical restraint with heightened secretion of corticosterone (F&lt;sub&gt;(&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;)&lt;/sub&gt; = 11.906, P &amp;lt; 0.001). These parameters in the sevoflurane-exposed rats that were pretreated with formestane or bumetanide were not different from those in the control rats.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These results, along with previously published data, suggest that sevoflurane-enhanced E2 synthesis and excitatory GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R signaling at the time of sevoflurane anesthesia are involved in the mediation of the neurodevelopmental effects of the anesthetic in male rats.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Wnt Signaling Through Nitric Oxide Synthase Promotes the Formation of Multi-Innervated Spines</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.575863</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Structural plasticity of synapses correlates with changes in synaptic strength. Dynamic modifications in dendritic spine number and size are crucial for long-term potentiation (LTP), the cellular correlate of learning and memory. Recent studies have suggested the generation of multi-innervated spines (MIS), in the form of several excitatory presynaptic inputs onto one spine, are crucial for hippocampal memory storage. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying MIS formation and their contribution to LTP. Using 3D enhanced resolution confocal images, we examined the contribution of Wnt synaptic modulators in MIS formation in the context of LTP. We show that blockage of endogenous Wnts with specific Wnt antagonists supresses the formation of MIS upon chemical LTP induction in cultured hippocampal neurons. Gain- and loss-of-function studies demonstrate that Wnt7a signaling promotes MIS formation through the postsynaptic Wnt scaffold protein Disheveled 1 (Dvl1) by stimulating neuronal nitric oxide (NO) synthase (nNOS). Subsequently, NO activates soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) to increase MIS formation. Consistently, we observed an enhanced frequency and amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic currents. Collectively, our findings identify a unique role for Wnt secreted proteins through nNOS/NO/sGC signaling to modulate MIS formation during LTP.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Paternal Deprivation and Female Biparental Family Rearing Induce Dendritic and Synaptic Changes in Octodon degus: I. Medial Prefrontal Cortex</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00038</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In most mammalian species parent-offspring interactions during early life periods primarily comprise social contacts with the mother, whereas the role of males in parental care is one of the most overlooked and understudied topics. The present study addressed the hypothesis that the complete deprivation of paternal care delays or permanently retards synaptic connectivity in the brain, particularly in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of the offspring in a sex-specific manner. Another aim of this study was to address the question whether and in which way replacing the father with a female caregiver (in our experiments the “aunt”) can “buffer” the detrimental effects of paternal deprivation on neuronal development. The comparison of: (a) single mother rearing; (b) biparental rearing by father and mother; and (c) biparental rearing by two female caregivers revealed that: (i) paternal care represents a critical environmental factor for synaptic and dendritic development of pyramidal neurons in the vmPFC of their offspring; (ii) a second female caregiver (“aunt”) does not “buffer” the neuronal consequences of paternal deprivation; and that (iii) neuronal development in the vmPFC is differentially affected in male and female offspring in response to different family constellations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Interleukin 4 Affects Epilepsy by Regulating Glial Cells: Potential and Possible Mechanism</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.554547</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is a chronic brain dysfunction induced by an abnormal neuronal discharge that is caused by complicated psychopathologies. Recently, accumulating studies have revealed a close relationship between inflammation and epilepsy. Specifically, microglia and astrocytes are important inflammatory cells in the central nervous system (CNS) that have been proven to be related to the pathogenesis and development of epilepsy. Additionally, interleukin 4 (IL-4) is an anti-inflammatory factor that can regulate microglia and astrocytes in many aspects. This review article focuses on the regulatory role of IL-4 in the pathological changes of glial cells related to epilepsy. We additionally propose that IL-4 may play a protective role in epileptogenesis and suggest that IL-4 may be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Prenatal Stress Impairs Postnatal Learning and Memory Development via Disturbance of the cGMP–PKG Pathway and Oxidative Phosphorylation in the Hippocampus of Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00158</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Clinical and animal studies have found that prenatal stress can lead to pathological changes in embryos and fetuses. However, the mechanisms through which this occurs have not been made clear. In the present study, pregnant rats were subjected to chronic psychological stress during gestational days using an improved communication box system, and the changes in behavioral performance and proteins in the hippocampus of offspring were analyzed. It was found that prenatal stress caused postnatal growth retardation and impairment in spatial learning and memory. Furthermore, in isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation-based proteomics analyses, 158 significantly differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were found between the two groups. Further analyses showed that these DEPs are involved in different molecular function categories and participate in several biological processes, such as energy metabolism, learning or memory, and synaptic plasticity. Moreover, the enrichment of pathways showed that the learning and memory impairment was primarily connected with the cyclic guanosine monophosphate–protein kinase G (cGMP–PKG) pathway and oxidative phosphorylation. At the same time, the cGMP level and the expression of PKG protein were significantly decreased, and the neuronal mitochondria appeared to have a swollen and irregular shape in the hippocampus of offspring of stressed rats. These results suggest that the chronic psychological stress that pregnant rats were subjected to during gestational days may have impaired the spatial learning and memory of offspring. This affected the hippocampal oxidative phosphorylation and inhibited the cGMP–PKG pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Social Cognition in Autism Spectrum Disorder Across the Adult Lifespan: Influence of Age and Sex on Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task in a Cross-sectional Sample</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.571408</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Approximately 50,000 U.S. teens with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) become adults every year, however little is known regarding how age influences social cognition and if men and women with ASD are differentially impacted across the adult lifespan. Social cognition declines non-linearly with age in neurotypical (NT) adults. Moreover, sex differences have been observed on RME tasks in NT adults but not adults with ASD, although aging effects have been largely ignored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: This cross-sectional study examined the influence of age and sex on social cognition in adults with ASD compared to NT adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: The Reading the Mind in the Eyes (RME) task was administered to evaluate the theory of mind abilities in 95 adults with ASD and 82 NT adults ages 18–71 years. The main effects of diagnosis, age, and sex, as well as two-way and three-way interaction were modeled using linear and quadratic aging terms in a multiple regression analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A main effect of diagnosis was observed, indicating poorer performance in adults with ASD relative to NT adults. Age and sex interactions were nonsignificant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: We replicated previous findings of reduced theory of mind (ToM) abilities in adults with ASD, compared to NT adults. While interactions were nonsignificant, visual inspection of quadratic age curves indicated the possibility of unique ToM trajectories in men and women with and without ASD that should be investigated in larger longitudinal studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: The Role of Microglial CX3CR1 in Schizophrenia-Related Behaviors Induced by Social Isolation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.551676</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;According to the microglial hypothesis of schizophrenia, the hyperactivation of microglia and the release of proinflammatory cytokines lead to neuronal loss, which is highly related to the onset of schizophrenia. Recent studies have demonstrated that fractalkine (CX3CL1) and its receptor CX3CR1 modulate the function of microglia. Thus, the present study aimed to determine whether microglial CX3CR1 plays a role in schizophrenia-related behaviors. A classical animal model of schizophrenia, social isolation (from postnatal days 21–56), was used to induce schizophrenia-related behaviors in C57BL/6J and CX3CR1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice, and the expression of the microglial CX3CR1 protein was examined in several brain areas of the C57BL/6J mice by Western blot analysis. The results revealed that social isolation caused deficits in the prepulse inhibition (PPI) in the C57BL/6J mice but not in the CX3CR1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice and increased locomotor activity in both the C57BL/6J mice and the CX3CR1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Moreover, the CX3CR1 protein level was increased in the medial prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and hippocampus of the isolated C57BL/6J mice. These findings suggested that the function of microglia regulated by CX3CR1 might participate in schizophrenia-related behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Suppression of spastin Mutant Phenotypes by Pak3 Loss Implicates a Role for Reactive Glia in AD-HSP</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00912</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative mechanisms due to mutations in spastin currently center on neuronal defects, primarily in microtubule and endomembrane regulation. Spastin loss in Drosophila larvae compromises neuronal microtubule distribution, alters synaptic bouton morphology, and weakens synaptic transmission at glutamatergic neuromuscular junction (NMJ) synapses. Pak3, a p21-activated kinase that promotes actin polymerization and filopodial projections, is required for these spastin mutant defects; animals lacking both genes have normal NMJs. Here we show that Pak3 is expressed in central and peripheral glial populations, and reduction of Pak3 specifically in subperineurial glial cells is sufficient to suppress the phenotypes associated with spastin loss. Subperineurial glia in the periphery ensheathe motor neuron axons and have been shown to extend actin-based projections that regulate synaptic terminals during normal NMJ development. We find that these subperineurial glial projections are Pak3-dependent and nearly twice as frequent in spastin mutants, while in Pak3, spastin double mutants, neither glial projections nor synaptic defects are observed. Spastin deficiency thus increases Pak3-dependent subperineurial glia activity, which is in turn required for neuronal defects. Our results demonstrate a central role for Pak3-mediated, altered glial behavior in the neuronal defects due to spastin loss, and suggest that a similar reactive glia-mediated mechanism may underlie human AD-HSP pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a complex and serious disease as its multifaceted pathophysiological mechanisms remain vague. The molecular changes of hippocampal and cortical dysfunction in the process of TBI are poorly understood, especially their chronic effects on metabolic profiles. Here we utilize metabolomics-based liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry coupled with bioinformatics method to assess the perturbation of brain metabolism in rat hippocampus and cortex on day 7. The results revealed a signature panel which consisted of 13 identified metabolites to facilitate targeted interventions for subacute TBI discrimination. Purine metabolism change in cortical tissue and taurine and hypotaurine metabolism change in hippocampal tissue were detected. Furthermore, the associations between the metabolite markers and the perturbed pathways were analyzed based on databases: 64 enzyme and one pathway were evolved in TBI. The findings represented significant profiling changes and provided unique metabolite–protein information in a rat model of TBI following the subacute phase. This study may inspire scientists and doctors to further their studies and provide potential therapy targets for clinical interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.581652</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between motor imagery (MI) assessment (ability and quality) and neurophysiological assessment [transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-induced motor-evoked potentials (MEPs)] during combined MI and action observation (AO; MI + AO). Sixteen subjects completed an MI task playing the piano with both hands, and neurophysiological assessment was performed during the MI task. The Movement Imagery Questionnaire-Revised was adopted to evaluate MI ability, while the visual analogue scale (VAS) was adopted to evaluate MI quality. A TMS pulse was delivered during the MI task, and MEPs were subsequently recorded in the abductor pollicis brevis (APB). We found a significant positive correlation between the VAS score and the TMS-induced MEPs (ρ = 0.497, p &amp;lt; 0.001). These findings suggest that the VAS score could potentially reflect the corticospinal excitability during MI + AO, particularly in complex MI tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Feeling Is Mutual: Clarity of Haptics-Mediated Social Perception Is Not Associated With the Recognition of the Other, Only With Recognition of Each Other</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.560567</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The enactive theory of perception hypothesizes that perceptual access to objects depends on the mastery of sensorimotor contingencies, that is, on the know-how of the regular ways in which changes in sensations depend on changes in movements. This hypothesis can be extended into the social domain: perception of other minds is constituted by mastery of self-other contingencies, that is, by the know-how of the regular ways in which changes in others’ movements depend on changes in one’s movements. We investigated this proposal using the perceptual crossing paradigm, in which pairs of players are required to locate each other in an invisible one-dimensional virtual space by using a minimal haptic interface. We recorded and analyzed the real-time embodied social interaction of 10 pairs of adult participants. The results reveal a process of implicit perceptual learning: on average, clarity of perceiving the other’s presence increased over trials and then stabilized. However, a clearer perception of the other was not associated with correctness of recognition as such, but with both players correctly recognizing each other. Furthermore, the moments of correct mutual recognition tended to happen within seconds. The fact that changes in social experience can only be explained by the successful performance at the level of the dyad, and that this veridical mutual perception tends toward synchronization, lead us to hypothesize that integration of neural activity across both players played a role.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Suppression of Taboo Word Spoonerisms Is Associated With Altered Medial Frontal Negativity: An ERP Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00368</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The constant internal monitoring of speech is a crucial feature to ensure the fairly error-free process of speech production. It has been argued that internal speech monitoring takes place through detection of conflict between different response options or “speech plans.” Speech errors are thought to occur because two (or more) competing speech plans become activated, and the speaker is unable to inhibit the erroneous plan(s) prior to vocalization. A prime example for a speech plan that has to be suppressed is the involuntary utterance of a taboo word. The present study seeks to examine the suppression of involuntary taboo word utterances. We used the “Spoonerisms of Laboratory Induced Predisposition” (SLIP) paradigm to elicit two competing speech plans, one being correct and one embodying either a taboo word or a non-taboo word spoonerism. Behavioral data showed that inadequate speech plans generally were effectively suppressed, although more effectively in the taboo word spoonerism condition. Event-related potential (ERP) analysis revealed a broad medial frontal negativity (MFN) after the target word pair presentation, interpreted as reflecting conflict detection and resolution to suppress the inadequate speech plan. The MFN was found to be more pronounced in the taboo word spoonerism compared to the neutral word spoonerism condition, indicative of a higher level of conflict when subjects suppressed the involuntary utterance of taboo words.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Transient Amplitude Modulation of Alpha-Band Oscillations by Short-Time Intermittent Closed-Loop tACS</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00366</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques such as transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) have recently become extensively utilized due to their potential to modulate ongoing neuronal oscillatory activity and consequently to induce cortical plasticity relevant for various cognitive functions. However, the neurophysiological basis for stimulation effects as well as their inter-individual differences is not yet understood. In the present study, we used a closed-loop electroencephalography-tACS(EEG-tACS) protocol to examine the modulation of alpha oscillations generated in occipito-parietal areas. In particular, we investigated the effects of a repeated short-time intermittent stimulation protocol (1 s in every trial) applied over the visual cortex (Cz and Oz) and adjusted according to the phase and frequency of visual alpha oscillations on the amplitude of these oscillations. Based on previous findings, we expected higher increases in alpha amplitudes for tACS applied in-phase with ongoing oscillations as compared to an application in anti-phase and this modulation to be present in low-alpha amplitude states of the visual system (eyes opened, EO) but not high (eyes closed, EC). Contrary to our expectations, we found a transient suppression of alpha power in inter-individually derived spatially specific parieto-occipital components obtained via the estimation of spatial filters by using the common spatial patterns approach. The amplitude modulation was independent of the phase relationship between the tACS signal and alpha oscillations, and the state of the visual system manipulated via closed- and open-eye conditions. It was also absent in conventionally analyzed single-channel and multi-channel data from an average parieto-occipital region. The fact that the tACS modulation of oscillations was phase-independent suggests that mechanisms driving the effects of tACS may not be explained by entrainment alone, but rather require neuroplastic changes or transient disruption of neural oscillations. Our study also supports the notion that the response to tACS is subject-specific, where the modulatory effects are shaped by the interplay between the stimulation and different alpha generators. This favors stimulation protocols as well as analysis regimes exploiting inter-individual differences, such as spatial filters to reveal otherwise hidden stimulation effects and, thereby, comprehensively induce and study the effects and underlying mechanisms of tACS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Altered Topological Properties of Brain Structural Covariance Networks in Patients With Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00364</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Brain structural alterations play an important role in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM). However, while there have been studies on regional brain structural alterations, only few studies have focused on the topological organization of the brain structural covariance network. This work aimed to describe the structural covariance network architecture alterations that are possibly linked to cortex reorganization in patients with CSM.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;High-resolution anatomical images of 31 CSM patients and 31 healthy controls (HCs) were included in the study. The images were acquired using a sagittal three-dimensional T1-weighted BRAVO sequence. Firstly, the gray matter volume of 90 brain regions of automated anatomical labeling atlas were computed using a VBM toolbox based on the DARTEL algorithm. Then, the brain structural covariance network was constructed by thresholding the gray matter volume correlation matrices. Subsequently, the network measures and nodal property were calculated based on graph theory. Finally, the differences in the network metrics and nodal property between groups were compared using a non-parametric test.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Patients with CSM showed larger global efficiency and smaller local efficiency, clustering coefficient, characteristic path length, and sigma values than HCs. Patients with CSM had greater betweenness in the left superior parietal gyrus (SPG.L) and the left supplementary motor area (SMA.L) than HCs. Besides, patients with CSM had smaller betweenness in right middle occipital gyrus. The brain structural covariance networks of CSM patients exhibited equal resilience to random failure as those of HCs. However, the maximum relative size of giant connected components was approximately 10% larger in HCs than in CSM patients, upon removal of 44 nodes in targeted attack.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These observed alternations in global network measures in CSM patients reflect that the brain structural covariance network in CSM exhibits the less optimal small-world model compared to that in HCs. Increased betweenness in SPG.L and SMA.L seems to be related to cortex reorganization to recover multiple sensory functions after spinal cord injury in CSM patients. The network resilience of patients with CSM exhibiting a relative mild vulnerability, compared to HCs, is probably attributable to the balance and interplay between cortex reorganization and ongoing degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

For the present study, we used a large longitudinal dataset (four measurements over 4 years) comprising anatomical data from a sample of healthy older adults (N = 231 at baseline). This dataset enables us to gain new insights about volumetric cortical and subcortical changes and their associations in the context of healthy aging. Brain structure volumes were derived from T1-weighted MRI scans using FreeSurfer segmentation tools. Brain structure trajectories were fitted using mixed models and latent growth curve models to gain information about the mean extent and variability of decline trajectories for different brain structures as well as the associations between individual trajectories. On the group level, our analyses indicate similar linear changes for frontal and parietal brain regions, while medial temporal regions showed an accelerated decline with advancing age. Regarding subcortical regions, some structures showed strong declines (e.g., hippocampus), others showed little decline (e.g., pallidum). Our data provide little evidence for sex differences regarding the aforementioned trajectories. Between-person variability of the person-specific slopes (random slopes) was largest in subcortical and medial temporal brain structures. When looking at the associations between the random slopes from each brain structure, we found that the decline is largely homogenous across the majority of cortical brain structures. In subcortical and medial temporal brain structures, however, more heterogeneity of the decline was observed, meaning that the extent of the decline in one structure is less predictive of the decline in another structure. Taken together, our study contributes to enhancing our understanding of structural brain aging by demonstrating (1) that average volumetric change differs across the brain and (2) that there are regional differences with respect to between-person variability in the slopes. Moreover, our data suggest (3) that random slopes are highly correlated across large parts of the cerebral cortex but (4) that some brain regions (i.e., medial temporal regions) deviate from this homogeneity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: A Computational Model of the Cholinergic Modulation of CA1 Pyramidal Cell Activity</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00075</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dysfunction in cholinergic modulation has been linked to a variety of cognitive disorders including Alzheimer's disease. The important role of this neurotransmitter has been explored in a variety of experiments, yet many questions remain unanswered about the contribution of cholinergic modulation to healthy hippocampal function. To address this question, we have developed a model of CA1 pyramidal neuron that takes into consideration muscarinic receptor activation in response to changes in extracellular concentration of acetylcholine and its effects on cellular excitability and downstream intracellular calcium dynamics. This model incorporates a variety of molecular agents to accurately simulate several processes heretofore ignored in computational modeling of CA1 pyramidal neurons. These processes include the inhibition of ionic channels by phospholipid depletion along with the release of calcium from intracellular stores (i.e., the endoplasmic reticulum). This paper describes the model and the methods used to calibrate its behavior to match experimental results. The result of this work is a compartmental model with calibrated mechanisms for simulating the intracellular calcium dynamics of CA1 pyramidal cells with a focus on those related to release from calcium stores in the endoplasmic reticulum. From this model we also make various predictions for how the inhibitory and excitatory responses to cholinergic modulation vary with agonist concentration. This model expands the capabilities of CA1 pyramidal cell models through the explicit modeling of molecular interactions involved in healthy cognitive function and disease. Through this expanded model we come closer to simulating these diseases and gaining the knowledge required to develop novel treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.552213</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Willin/FRMD6 is part of a family of proteins with a 4.1 ezrin-radixin-moesin (FERM) domain. It has been identified as an upstream activator of the Hippo pathway and, when aberrant in its expression, is associated with human diseases and disorders. Even though Willin/FRMD6 was originally discovered in the rat sciatic nerve, most studies have focused on its functional roles in cells outside of the nervous system, where Willin/FRMD6 is involved in the formation of apical junctional cell-cell complexes and in regulating cell migration. Here, we investigate the biochemical and biophysical role of Willin/FRMD6 in neuronal cells, employing the commonly used SH-SY5Y neuronal model cell system and combining biochemical measurements with Elastic Resonator Interference Stress Micropscopy (ERISM). We present the first direct evidence that Willin/FRMD6 expression influences both the cell mechanical phenotype and neuronal differentiation. By investigating cells with increased and decreased Willin/FRMD6 expression levels, we show that Willin/FRMD6 not only affects proliferation and migration capacity of cells but also leads to changes in cell morphology and an enhanced formation of neurite-like membrane extensions. These changes were accompanied by alterations of biophysical parameters such as cell force, the organization of actin stress fibers and the formation of focal adhesions. At the biochemical level, changes in Willin/FRMD6 expression inversely affected the activity of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) pathway and downstream transcriptional factor NeuroD1, which seems to prime SH-SY5Y cells for retinoic acid (RA)-induced neuronal differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Notoginsenoside R1–Induced Neuronal Repair in Models of Alzheimer Disease Is Associated With an Alteration in Neuronal Hyperexcitability, Which Is Regulated by Nav</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00280</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer disease is characterized by a progressive cognitive deficit and may be associated with an aberrant hyperexcitability of the neuronal network. Notoginsenoside R1 (R1), a major activity ingredient from Panax notoginseng, has demonstrated favorable changes in neuronal plasticity and induced neuroprotective effects in brain injuries, resulting from various disorders, however, the underlying mechanisms are still not well understood. In the present study, we aimed to explore the possible neuroprotective effects induced by R1 in a mouse model of AD and the mechanisms underlying these effects. Treatment with R1 significantly improved learning and memory functions and redressed neuronal hyperexcitability in amyloid precursor protein/presenilin-1 mice by altering the numbers and/or distribution of the members of voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav). Moreover, we determined whether R1 contributed to the regulation of neuronal excitability in Aβ-42–injured cells. Results of our study demonstrated that treatment with R1 rescued Aβ1-42–induced injured neurons by increasing cell viability. R1-induced alleviation in neuronal hyperexcitability might be associated with reduced Navβ2 cleavage, which partially reversed the abnormal distribution of Nav1.1α. These results suggested that R1 played a vital role in the recovery of Aβ1-42–induced neuronal injury and hyperexcitability, which is regulated by Nav proteins. Therefore, R1 may be a promising candidate in the treatment of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: S100B Impairs Oligodendrogenesis and Myelin Repair Following Demyelination Through RAGE Engagement</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00279</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Increased expression of S100B and its specific receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) has been described in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), being associated with an active demyelinating process. We previously showed that a direct neutralization of S100B reduces lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)-induced demyelination and inflammation using an ex vivo demyelinating model. However, whether S100B actions occur through RAGE and how oligodendrogenesis and remyelination are affected are not clarified. To evaluate the role of the S100B–RAGE axis in the course of a demyelinating insult, organotypic cerebellar slice cultures (OCSC) were demyelinated with LPC in the presence or absence of RAGE antagonist FPS-ZM1. Then, we explored the effects of the S100B–RAGE axis inhibition on glia reactivity and inflammation, myelination and neuronal integrity, and on oligodendrogenesis and remyelination. In the present study, we confirmed that LPC-induced demyelination increased S100B and RAGE expression, while RAGE antagonist FPS-ZM1 markedly reduced their content and altered RAGE cellular localization. Furthermore, FPS-ZM1 prevented LPC-induced microgliosis and astrogliosis, as well as NF-κB activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression. In addition, RAGE antagonist reduced LPC-induced demyelination having a beneficial effect on axonal and synaptic protein preservation. We have also observed that RAGE engagement is needed for LPC-induced oligodendrocyte (OL) maturation arrest and loss of mature myelinating OL, with these phenomena being prevented by FPS-ZM1. Our data suggest that increased levels of mature OL in the presence of FPS-ZM1 are related to increased expression of microRNAs (miRs) associated with OL differentiation and remyelination, such as miR-23a, miR-219a, and miR-338, which are defective upon LPC incubation. Finally, our electron microscopy data show that inhibition of the S100B–RAGE axis prevents axonal damage and myelin loss, in parallel with enhanced functional remyelination, as observed by the presence of thinner myelin sheaths when compared with Control. Overall, our data implicate the S100B–RAGE axis in the extent of myelin and neuronal damage, as well as in the inflammatory response that follows a demyelinating insult. Thus, prevention of RAGE engagement may represent a novel strategy for promoting not only inflammatory reduction but also neuronal and myelin preservation and/or remyelination, improving recovery in a demyelinating condition as MS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Synaptic Plasticity in Cortical Inhibitory Neurons: What Mechanisms May Help to Balance Synaptic Weight Changes?</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00204</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Inhibitory neurons play a fundamental role in the normal operation of neuronal networks. Diverse types of inhibitory neurons serve vital functions in cortical networks, such as balancing excitation and taming excessive activity, organizing neuronal activity in spatial and temporal patterns, and shaping response selectivity. Serving these, and a multitude of other functions effectively requires fine-tuning of inhibition, mediated by synaptic plasticity. Plasticity of inhibitory systems can be mediated by changes at inhibitory synapses and/or by changes at excitatory synapses at inhibitory neurons. In this review, we consider that latter locus: plasticity at excitatory synapses to inhibitory neurons. Despite the fact that plasticity of excitatory synaptic transmission to interneurons has been studied in much less detail than in pyramids and other excitatory cells, an abundance of forms and mechanisms of plasticity have been observed in interneurons. Specific requirements and rules for induction, while exhibiting a broad diversity, could correlate with distinct sources of excitatory inputs and distinct types of inhibitory neurons. One common requirement for the induction of plasticity is the rise of intracellular calcium, which could be mediated by a variety of ligand-gated, voltage-dependent, and intrinsic mechanisms. The majority of the investigated forms of plasticity can be classified as Hebbian-type associative plasticity. Hebbian-type learning rules mediate adaptive changes of synaptic transmission. However, these rules also introduce intrinsic positive feedback on synaptic weight changes, making plastic synapses and learning networks prone to runaway dynamics. Because real inhibitory neurons do not express runaway dynamics, additional plasticity mechanisms that counteract imbalances introduced by Hebbian-type rules must exist. We argue that weight-dependent heterosynaptic plasticity has a number of characteristics that make it an ideal candidate mechanism to achieve homeostatic regulation of synaptic weight changes at excitatory synapses to inhibitory neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.572013</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Onuf’s nucleus is a small group of neurons located in the ventral horns of the sacral spinal cord. The motor neurons (MNs) of Onuf’s nucleus innervate striated voluntary muscles of the pelvic floor and are histologically and biochemically comparable to the other somatic spinal MNs. However, curiously, these neurons also show some autonomic-like features as, for instance, they receive a strong peptidergic innervation. The review provides an overview of the histological, biochemical, metabolic, and gene expression peculiarities of Onuf’s nucleus. Moreover, it describes the aging-related pathologies as well as several traumatic and neurodegenerative disorders in which its neurons are involved: indeed, Onuf’s nucleus is affected in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Shy-Drager Syndrome (SDS), whereas it is spared in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). We summarize here the milestone studies that have contributed to clarifying the nature of Onuf’s neurons and in understanding what makes them either vulnerable or resistant to damage. Altogether, these works can offer the possibility to develop new therapeutic strategies for counteracting neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00058</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The key driver of breathing rhythm is the preBötzinger Complex (preBötC) whose activity is modulated by various functional inputs, e.g., volitional, physiological, and emotional. While the preBötC is highly interconnected with other regions of the breathing central pattern generator (bCPG) in the brainstem, there is no data about the direct projections to either excitatory and inhibitory preBötC subpopulations from other elements of the bCPG or from suprapontine regions. Using modified rabies tracing, we identified neurons throughout the brain that send monosynaptic projections to identified excitatory and inhibitory preBötC neurons in mice. Within the brainstem, neurons from sites in the bCPG, including the contralateral preBötC, Bötzinger Complex, the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), parafacial region (pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;/pF&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;), and parabrachial nuclei (PB), send direct projections to both excitatory and inhibitory preBötC neurons. Suprapontine inputs to the excitatory and inhibitory preBötC neurons include the superior colliculus, red nucleus, amygdala, hypothalamus, and cortex; these projections represent potential direct pathways for volitional, emotional, and physiological control of breathing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: IL-17A Neutralization Improves the Neurological Outcome of Mice With Ischemic Stroke and Inhibits Caspase-12-Dependent Apoptosis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00274</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We previously reported that the levels of astrocyte-derived interleukin-17A (IL-17A) increased both in the peri-infarct region and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of mice with 1-h middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion/12-h reperfusion (1-h MCAO/R 12 h)-induced ischemic stroke. However, the effects of IL-17A neutralization on the neurological outcome of mice with ischemic stroke and its underlying molecular mechanism are unclear. In this study, we found that the intracerebroventricular injection of IL-17A-neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb; 2.0 μg) could reduce the infarct volume, alleviate neuron loss, and improve the neurological outcomes of mice with 1-h MCAO/R 24-h- or 3-day-induced ischemic-stroke mice. The IL-17A neutralization could also significantly inhibit the increase of pro-caspase-3 cleavage through caspase-12-dependent cell apoptosis, as well as preventing the decrease of antiapoptotic factor B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and the increase of proapoptotic Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) in the peri-infarct region of mice following ischemic stroke. In addition, we confirmed that the recombinant mouse (rm) IL-17A could significantly aggravate 1-h oxygen–glucose deprivation/24-h reoxygenation (1-h OGD/R 24 h)-induced ischemic injuries in cortical neurons in a dose-dependent manner, and the rmIL-17A could also exacerbate neuronal apoptosis through caspase-12 (not caspase-8 or caspase-9)-dependent pathway. These results suggest that IL-17A neutralization could improve the neurological outcome of mice with ischemic stroke through inhibiting caspase-12-dependent neuronal apoptosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00270</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the validity of brief cognitive screening (BCS) tools designed to diagnose mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia in Spanish-speaking individuals over the age of 50 years from Latin America (LA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A systematic search of titles and abstracts in Medline, Biomed Central, Embase, Scopus, Scirus, PsycINFO, LILACS, and SciELO was conducted. Inclusion criteria were papers written in English or Spanish involving samples from Spanish-speaking Latin American individuals published until 2018. Standard procedures were applied for reviewing the literature. The data related to the study sample, methodology, and procedures applied, as well as the performance obtained with the corresponding BCS, were collected and systematized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Thirteen of 211 articles met the inclusion criteria. The studies primarily involved memory clinic-based samples, with the exception of two studies from an adult day-care center, one from a primary care clinic, and one from a community-based sample. All the studies originated from five of the 20 countries of LA and all used standardized diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of dementia and MCI; however, the diagnostic protocols applied differed. Most studies reported samples with an average of 10 years of education and only one reported a sample with an average of &amp;lt;5 years of education. No publication to date has included an illiterate population. Although the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) is the most widely-used BCS tool in LA, it is significantly influenced by education level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Although evidence is still limited, the findings from studies on LA populations suggest that MoCA requires cultural adaptations and different cutoff points according to education level. Moreover, the diagnostic validity of the INECO frontal screening (IFS) test should be evaluated in populations with a low level of education. Given the heterogeneity that exists in the levels of education in LA, more studies involving illiterate and indigenous populations are required.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Identifying Early Mild Cognitive Impairment by Multi-Modality MRI-Based Deep Learning</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00206</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a clinical state with a high risk of conversion to Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Since there is no effective treatment for AD, it is extremely important to diagnose MCI as early as possible, as this makes it possible to delay its progression toward AD. However, it's challenging to identify early MCI (EMCI) because there are only mild changes in the brain structures of patients compared with a normal control (NC). To extract remarkable features for these mild changes, in this paper, a multi-modality diagnosis approach based on deep learning is presented. Firstly, we propose to use structure MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) images as the multi-modality data to identify EMCI. Then, a convolutional neural network based on transfer learning technique is developed to extract features of the multi-modality data, where an L1-norm is introduced to reduce the feature dimensionality and retrieve essential features for the identification. At last, the classifier produces 94.2% accuracy for EMCI vs. NC on an ADNI dataset. Experimental results show that multi-modality data can provide more useful information to distinguish EMCI from NC compared with single modality data, and the proposed method can improve classification performance, which is beneficial to early intervention of AD. In addition, it is found that DTI image can act as an important biomarker for EMCI from the point of view of a clinical diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Spread of HIV typically involves uneven transmission patterns where some individuals spread to a large number of individuals while others to only a few or none. Such transmission heterogeneity can impact how fast and how much an epidemic spreads. Further, more efficient interventions may be achieved by taking such transmission heterogeneity into account. To address these issues, we developed two phylogenetic methods based on virus sequence data: 1) to generally detect if significant transmission heterogeneity is present, and 2) to pinpoint where in a phylogeny high-level spread is occurring. We derive inference procedures to estimate model parameters, including the amount of transmission heterogeneity, in a sampled epidemic. We show that it is possible to detect transmission heterogeneity under a wide range of simulated situations, including incomplete sampling, varying levels of heterogeneity, and including within-host genetic diversity. When evaluating real HIV-1 data from different epidemic scenarios, we found a lower level of transmission heterogeneity in slowly spreading situations and a higher level of heterogeneity in data that included a rapid outbreak, while &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and Sackin’s index (overall tree shape statistic) were similar in the two scenarios, suggesting that our new method is able to detect transmission heterogeneity in real data. We then show by simulations that targeted prevention, where we pinpoint high-level spread using a coalescence measurement, is efficient when sequence data are collected in an ongoing surveillance system. Such phylogeny-guided prevention is efficient under both single-step contact tracing as well as iterative contact tracing as compared to random intervention.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MvwPaDppxpk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Research publications and data nowadays should be publicly available on the internet and, theoretically, usable for everyone to develop further research, products, or services. The long-term accessibility of research data is, therefore, fundamental in the economy of the research production process. However, the availability of data is not sufficient by itself, but also their quality must be verifiable. Measures to ensure reuse and reproducibility need to include the entire research life cycle, from the experimental design to the generation of data, quality control, statistical analysis, interpretation, and validation of the results. Hence, high-quality records, particularly for providing a string of documents for the verifiable origin of data, are essential elements that can act as a certificate for potential users (customers). These records also improve the traceability and transparency of data and processes, therefore, improving the reliability of results. Standards for data acquisition, analysis, and documentation have been fostered in the last decade driven by grassroot initiatives of researchers and organizations such as the Research Data Alliance (RDA). Nevertheless, what is still largely missing in the life science academic research are agreed procedures for complex routine research workflows. Here, well-crafted documentation like standard operating procedures (SOPs) offer clear direction and instructions specifically designed to avoid deviations as an absolute necessity for reproducibility.
Therefore, this paper provides a standardized workflow that explains step by step how to write an SOP to be used as a starting point for appropriate research documentation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rDZ-zr8Vi1Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Ten simple rules for an inclusive summer coding program for non-computer-science undergraduates</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/oFKImM6cTKk/article</link>

Since 2015, we have run a free 9-week summer program that provides non-computer science (CS) undergraduates at San Francisco State University (SFSU) with experience in coding and doing research. Undergraduate research experiences remain very limited at SFSU and elsewhere, so the summer program provides opportunities for many more students beyond the mentoring capacity of our university laboratories. In addition, we were concerned that many students from historically underrepresented (HU) groups may be unable to take advantage of traditional summer research programs because these programs require students to relocate or be available full time, which is not feasible for students who have family, work, or housing commitments. Our program, which is local and part-time, serves about 5 times as many students as a typical National Science Foundation (NSF) Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program, on a smaller budget. Based on our experiences, we present 10 simple rules for busy faculty who want to create similar programs to engage non-CS HU undergraduates in computational research. Note that while some of the strategies we implement are based on evidence-based publications in the social sciences or education research literature, the original suggestions we make here are based on our trial-and-error experiences, rather than formal hypothesis testing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oFKImM6cTKk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

With the ever-increasing quality and quantity of imaging data in biomedical research comes the demand for computational methodologies that enable efficient and reliable automated extraction of the quantitative information contained within these images. One of the challenges in providing such methodology is the need for tailoring algorithms to the specifics of the data, limiting their areas of application. Here we present a broadly applicable approach to quantification and classification of complex shapes and patterns in biological or other multi-component formations. This approach integrates the mapping of all shape boundaries within an image onto a global information-rich graph and machine learning on the multidimensional measures of the graph. We demonstrated the power of this method by (1) extracting subtle structural differences from visually indistinguishable images in our phenotype rescue experiments using the endothelial tube formations assay, (2) training the algorithm to identify biophysical parameters underlying the formation of different multicellular networks in our simulation model of collective cell behavior, and (3) analyzing the response of U2OS cell cultures to a broad array of small molecule perturbations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DBp9p8gQGGw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Basal leakage in oscillation: Coupled transcriptional and translational control using feed-forward loops</title>

The circadian clock is a complex system that plays many important roles in most organisms. Previously, many mathematical models have been used to sharpen our understanding of the &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt; clock, which brought to light the roles of each transcriptional and post-translational regulations. However, the presence of both regulations, instead of either transcription or post-translation, raised curiosity of whether the combination of these two regulations is important for the clock’s system. In this study, we built a series of simplified oscillators with different regulations to study the importance of post-translational regulation (specifically, 26S proteasome degradation) in the clock system. We found that a simple transcriptional-based oscillator can already generate sustained oscillation, but the oscillation can be easily destroyed in the presence of transcriptional leakage. Coupling post-translational control with transcriptional-based oscillator in a feed-forward loop will greatly improve the robustness of the oscillator in the presence of basal leakage. Using these general models, we were able to replicate the increased variability observed in the E3 ligase mutant for both plant and mammalian clocks. With this insight, we also predict a plausible regulator of several E3 ligase genes in the plant’s clock. Thus, our results provide insights into and the plausible importance in coupling transcription and post-translation controls in the clock system.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sU3VD0NWU0g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Histamine-induced biphasic activation of RhoA allows for persistent RhoA signaling</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/cebm1BYMr4k/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Jason Z. Zhang, Andy H. Nguyen, Shigeki Miyamoto, Joan Heller Brown, Andrew D. McCulloch, Jin Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

The small GTPase RhoA is a central signaling enzyme that is involved in various cellular processes such as cytoskeletal dynamics, transcription, and cell cycle progression. Many signal transduction pathways activate RhoA—for instance, Gα&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;-coupled Histamine 1 Receptor signaling via Gα&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;-dependent activation of RhoGEFs such as p63. Although multiple upstream regulators of RhoA have been identified, the temporal regulation of RhoA and the coordination of different upstream components in its regulation have not been well characterized. In this study, live-cell measurement of RhoA activation revealed a biphasic increase of RhoA activity upon histamine stimulation. We showed that the first and second phase of RhoA activity are dependent on p63 and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/PKC, respectively, and further identified phosphorylation of serine 240 on p115 RhoGEF by PKC to be the mechanistic link between PKC and RhoA. Combined approaches of computational modeling and quantitative measurement revealed that the second phase of RhoA activation is insensitive to rapid turning off of the receptor and is required for maintaining RhoA-mediated transcription after the termination of the receptor signaling. Thus, two divergent pathways enable both rapid activation and persistent signaling in receptor-mediated RhoA signaling via intricate temporal regulation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/cebm1BYMr4k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Acetylcholinesterase and Nissl‐staining in the Atlantic white‐sided dolphin Hippocampal Formation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cetacean hippocampal formation has been noted to be one of the smallest relative to brain size of all mammals studied. This region, comprised of the dentate gyrus, hippocampus proper, subiculum, presubiculum, parasubiculum and the entorhinal cortex, is important in learning, memory, and navigation. There have been a number of studies detailing the distribution of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the hippocampal formation of terrestrial mammals with the goal of gaining a greater understanding of some aspects of the cholinergic innervation to this region, as well as its parcellation. The present study was undertaken to describe the organization, cytoarchitecture, and distribution of AChE in the hippocampal formation of the Atlantic white‐sided dolphin (AWSD) with the view to understand similarities and differences between this aquatic mammal and terrestrial mammals. Nissl‐staining demonstrated cytoarchitecture of the hippocampal formation in the AWSD comparable to that reported in other cetaceans. In addition, the AWSD had a rich pattern of AChE staining that distinctly varied between regions and laminae. A number of differences in the distribution of AChE staining in areas comparable to those of terrestrial species reported suggested possible alterations in connectivity of this region. Overall, however, AChE‐staining suggested that cholinergic innervation, neural pathways and function of the hippocampal formation of the AWSD is conserved, similar to other mammals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Dopaminergic retinal cell loss and visual dysfunction in Parkinson's disease</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25897?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering the demonstrated implication of the retina in PD pathology and the importance of dopaminergic cells in this tissue, we aimed to analyze the state of the dopaminergic amacrine cells and some of their main post‐synaptic neurons in the retina of PD.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy, we evaluated morphology, number, and synaptic connections of dopaminergic cells and their post‐synaptic cells, AII amacrine and melanopsin‐containing retinal ganglion cells, in control and PD eyes from human donors.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In PD, dopaminergic amacrine cell number was reduced between 58% and 26% in different retinal regions, involving a decline in the number of synaptic contacts with AII amacrine cells (by 60%) and melanopsin cells (by 35%). Despite losing their main synaptic input, AII cells were not reduced in number, but they showed cellular alterations compromising their adequate function: i) a loss of mitochondria inside their lobular appendages, that may indicate an energetic failure and ii) a loss of connexin 36, suggesting alterations in the AII coupling and in visual signal transmission from the rod pathway.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dopaminergic system impairment and the affection of the rod pathway through the AII cells may explain and be partially responsible for the reduced contrast sensitivity or electroretinographic response described in PD. Also, dopamine reduction and the loss of synaptic contacts with melanopsin cells may contribute to the melanopsin retinal ganglion cell loss previously described and to the disturbances in circadian rhythm and sleep reported in PD patients. These data support the idea that the retina reproduces brain neurodegeneration and is highly involved in PD pathology.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Association of Plasma Neurofilament Light with Postoperative Delirium</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25889?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To examine the association of plasma neuroaxonal injury markers neurofilament light (NfL), total tau, glial fibrillary acid protein and ubiquitin carboxyl‐terminal esterase l1 and delirium, delirium severity, and cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delirium case‐no delirium control (n=108) pairs were matched by age, sex, surgery type, cognition, and vascular comorbidities. Biomarkers were measured in plasma collected preoperative(PREOP), 2 days(POD2) and 30 days postoperative(PO1MO) using Simoa technology (Quanterix). The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) and CAM‐S(severity) was used to measure delirium and delirium severity, respectively. Cognitive function was measured with General Cognitive Performance(GCP) scores.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delirium cases had higher NfL on POD2 and PO1MO (median matched pair difference 16.2pg/ml and 13.6pg/ml, respectively (P &amp;lt; .05)). Patients with PREOP and POD2 NfL in the highest quartile (Q4) had increased risk for incident delirium (adjusted OR= 3.7(95% CI,1.1‐12.6), and 4.6(1.2‐18.2), respectively) and experienced more severe delirium, with sum CAM‐S scores 7.8 points (95%CI,1.6, 14.0), and 9.3 points higher (95%CI, 3.2, 15.5). At PO1MO, delirium cases had continued high NFL (adjusted OR of 9.7; 95% CI,2.3,41.4), and those with Q4 NfL values showed ‐2.3 point decline on GCP score (‐2.3 points, 95% CI, ‐4.7, ‐0.9).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with highest PREOP or POD2 NfL levels were more likely to develop delirium. Elevated NfL at PO1MO was associated with delirium and greater cognitive decline. These findings suggest NfL may be useful as a predictive biomarker for delirium risk and long‐term cognitive decline, and once confirmed would provide pathophysiological evidence for neuroaxonal injury following delirium.&lt;/p&gt;
