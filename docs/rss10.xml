	<title>Cerebral Cortex Open Access: Intrinsic Functional Connectivity Resembles Cortical Architecture at Various Levels of Isoflurane Anesthesia</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy114/4999310?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Cortical single neuron activity and local field potential patterns change at different depths of general anesthesia. Here, we investigate the associated network level changes of functional connectivity. We recorded ongoing electrocorticographic (ECoG) activity from temporo-parieto-occipital cortex of 6 ferrets at various levels of isoflurane/nitrous oxide anesthesia and determined functional connectivity by computing amplitude envelope correlations. Through hierarchical clustering, we derived typical connectivity patterns corresponding to light, intermediate and deep anesthesia. Generally, amplitude correlation strength increased strongly with depth of anesthesia across all cortical areas and frequency bands. This was accompanied, at the deepest level, by the emergence of burst-suppression activity in the ECoG signal and a change of the spectrum of the amplitude envelope. Normalization of functional connectivity to the distribution of correlation coefficients showed that the topographical patterns remained similar across depths of anesthesia, reflecting the functional association of the underlying cortical areas. Thus, while strength and temporal properties of amplitude co-modulation vary depending on the activity of local neural circuits, their network-level interaction pattern is presumably most strongly determined by the underlying structural connectivity.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Open Access: Correct Laminar Positioning in the Neocortex Influences Proper Dendritic and Synaptic Development</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy113/4999309?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The neocortex is a 6-layered laminated structure with a precise anatomical and functional organization ensuring proper function. Laminar positioning of cortical neurons, as determined by termination of neuronal migration, is a key determinant of their ability to assemble into functional circuits. However, the exact contribution of laminar placement to dendrite morphogenesis and synapse formation remains unclear. Here we manipulated the laminar position of cortical neurons by knocking down doublecortin (Dcx), a crucial effector of migration, and show that misplaced neurons fail to properly form dendrites, spines, and functional glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses. We further show that knocking down Dcx in properly positioned neurons induces similar but milder defects, suggesting that the laminar misplacement is the primary cause of altered neuronal development. Thus, the specific laminar environment of their fated layers is crucial for the maturation of cortical neurons, and influences their functional integration into developing cortical circuits.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Prior Knowledge Guides Speech Segregation in Human Auditory Cortex</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy052/4999308?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Segregating concurrent sound streams is a computationally challenging task that requires integrating bottom-up acoustic cues (e.g. pitch) and top-down prior knowledge about sound streams. In a multi-talker environment, the brain can segregate different speakers in about 100 ms in auditory cortex. Here, we used magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings to investigate the temporal and spatial signature of how the brain utilizes prior knowledge to segregate 2 speech streams from the same speaker, which can hardly be separated based on bottom-up acoustic cues. In a primed condition, the participants know the target speech stream in advance while in an unprimed condition no such prior knowledge is available. Neural encoding of each speech stream is characterized by the MEG responses tracking the speech envelope. We demonstrate that an effect in bilateral superior temporal gyrus and superior temporal sulcus is much stronger in the primed condition than in the unprimed condition. Priming effects are observed at about 100 ms latency and last more than 600 ms. Interestingly, prior knowledge about the target stream facilitates speech segregation by mainly suppressing the neural tracking of the non-target speech stream. In sum, prior knowledge leads to reliable speech segregation in auditory cortex, even in the absence of reliable bottom-up speech segregation cue.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Nuclear polymorphism and non-proliferative adult neurogenesis in human neural crest-derived cells.</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/325613v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Self-renewal and lineage regulation of neural stem cells in the adult mammalian brain (aNSCs) are still far from been understood. Although previous studies have reported that some aNSCs in neurogenic niches showed irregular nuclei, their functional significance remains elusive. We used neural crest-derived human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs) as an in vitro cell-model of neurogenesis to investigate the functional significance of nuclear polymorphisms. We observed that hPDLSCs-derived neurons are not generated through cell division from stem cells, the cell shape is reset and they begin their neuronal differentiation as rounded spheres. Moreover, transient nuclear lobulation coincident with neurogenesis was also observed. Our results provide evidence that these dynamic structural events may also occur in neurogenic niches. Finally, we show that hPDLSCs-derived neurons and neuronal cultures derived from rodent brains present a similar pattern of polarity formation, demonstrating that is possible to reproduce neurogenic processes and obtain neurons from hPDLSCs.</content:encoded>

Cytoskeletal components, such as tubulins and actins, have the remarkable ability to organize themselves into filaments and networks to support specialized and compartmentalized functions. Alterations in cytoskeletal proteins have long been associated with a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders. This review focuses on recent findings, primarily from forward genetic screens in Caenorhabditis elegans that illustrate how different tubulin protein isotypes can play distinct roles in neuronal development and function. Additionally, we discuss studies revealing new regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, and highlight recent technological advances in in vivo imaging and functional dissection of the neuronal cytoskeleton. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

The entorhinal–hippocampal system is central to such representations, which are severely compromised in some neurological diseases. In spite of much progress, a comprehensive, integrated view of spatial, temporal and other aspects of episodic representation remains elusive. Here, we review recent data on the role of cell-type specific entorhinal inputs which excite deep and superficial CA1 pyramidal cells by direct and indirect pathways. We discuss how an entorhinal dialogue with deep-superficial CA1 cells can multiplex neuronal activity along theta phases and how their reactivation may be segregated during sharp-wave ripples. Thus, deep and superficial CA1 sublayers provide substrate for general hippocampal function. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;h3&quot;&gt;Graphical abstract&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; height=&quot;159&quot; src=&quot;http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438817302994-fx1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;301&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

However, recent studies have revealed that some non-primate animal species have higher levels of dexterity than previously supposed, and in higher primates, various indirect non-CM descending pathways have been shown to participate in the control of dexterous movements. More recently, the CM pathway was shown to exist in rodents during early development, suggesting that rodents and primates diverged in their reliance on the CM pathway at some point in evolution, thus challenging the traditional view of the sequential development of hand control from rodents to primates. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

How an animal efficiently switches between distinct behaviors is a fundamental question whose inquiry will provide insights into the mechanisms that are necessary for an organism's survival. Previous work aimed at identifying the neural systems responsible for defensive behaviors, such as freezing, has demonstrated critical interactions between the prefrontal cortex and amygdala. Indeed, this foundational research has provided an indispensable anatomical framework that investigators are now using to understand the physiological mechanisms of defined neural circuits within the prefrontal cortex that code for the rapid and flexible expression of defensive behaviors. Here we review recent findings demonstrating temporal and rate coding mechanisms of freezing behavior in the prefrontal cortex. We hypothesize that anatomical features, such as target structure and cortical layer, as well as the nature of the information to be coded, may be critical factors determining the coding scheme. Furthermore, detailed behavioral analyses may reveal subtypes of defensive behaviors that represent the principle factor governing coding selection. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Tau, while primarily localized in the axons of healthy neurons, accumulates in the soma and dendrites of neurons under pathogenic conditions. Tau is found in both presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments of neurons in Alzheimer's disease. New research supports that soluble forms of tau trigger pathophysiology in the brain by altering properties of synaptic and neuronal function at the early stages of disease progression, before neurons die. Here we review the current understanding of how tau-mediated synaptic and neuronal dysfunction contributes to cognitive decline. Delineating the mechanisms by which pathogenic tau alters synapses, dendrites and axons will help lay the foundation for new strategies that can restore neuronal function in tauopathy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

These limitations reflect what has been dichotomy between the structure and mechanical properties of living brain tissue and non-living neural probes. To bridge the gap between neural and electronic networks, we have introduced the new concept of mesh electronics probes designed with structural and mechanical properties such that the implant begins to ‘look and behave’ like neural tissue. Syringe-implanted mesh electronics have led to the realization of probes that are neuro-attractive and free of the chronic immune response, as well as capable of stable long-term mapping and modulation of brain activity at the single-neuron level. This review provides a historical overview of a 10-year development of mesh electronics by highlighting the tissue-like design, syringe-assisted delivery, seamless neural tissue integration, and single-neuron level chronic recording stability of mesh electronics. We also offer insights on unique near-term opportunities and future directions for neuroscience and neurology that now are available or expected for mesh electronics neurotechnologies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

This locomotor network generates the rhythmic output, coordinate left/right alternation, and permit communication across segments. Through evolution, more complex movement patterns have emerged, made possible by sub-specialization of neural populations within the spinal cord. Walking tetrapods use a similar basic circuitry, but have added layers of complexity for the coordination of intralimbic flexor and extensor muscles as well as interlimbic coordination between the body halves and fore/hindlimbs. Although the basics of these circuits are known there is a gap in our knowledge regarding how different speeds and gaits are coordinated. Analysing subpopulations among described neuronal populations may bring insight into how changes in locomotor output are orchestrated by a hard-wired network. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Although clinically different, they share similar molecular features: the accumulation of one or two proteins in abnormal conformations inside or outside neurons. Enhancing protein quality control systems could be a useful strategy to neutralize the abnormal proteins causing neurodegenerative diseases. This review emphasizes the subcellular location of protein deposits in neurodegenerative diseases and the need to tailor strategies aimed at boosting protein quality control systems to the affected subcellular compartment. Inhibition of a protein phosphatase terminating the unfolded protein response will be discussed as a strategy to protect from diseases associated with misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Moreover, several synapse subtype-specific molecules have been shown to control the targeting, formation or maturation of particular subtypes of excitatory synapses. Because inhibitory neurons are extremely diverse, a similar molecular diversity is likely to underlie the development of different inhibitory synapses making it a promising topic for future investigation in the field of the synapse development. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

In fact, both their shape and their conduction speed have been shown to be modulated by activity, leading to regulations of synaptic latency and synaptic strength. We report here newly identified mechanisms of (1) safe spike propagation along the axon, (2) compartmentalization of action potential shape in the axon, (3) analog modulation of spike-evoked synaptic transmission and (4) alteration in conduction time after persistent regulation of axon morphology in central neurons. We discuss the contribution of these regulations in information processing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Recent discoveries have revealed surprising and complex roles of the small area CA2 in hippocampal function. Lesion studies have revealed that this region is required for social memory formation. Area CA2 is targeted by extra-hippocampal paraventricular inputs that release vasopressin and can act to enhance social memory performance. In vivo recordings have revealed nonconventional activity by neurons in this region that act to both initiate hippocampal sharp-wave ripple events as well as encode spatial information during immobility. Silencing of CA2 pyramidal neurons has revealed that this area also acts to control hippocampal network excitability during encoding, and this balance of excitation and inhibition is disrupted in disease. This review summarizes recent findings and attempts to integrate these results into pre-existing models. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Autocrine signals have been discovered in many neuronal contexts, providing insights into their regulation and function. The growing realization of the importance of cell-autonomous signaling stems from advances in both conditional genetic approaches and in sophisticated analyses of growth factor dynamics, which combine to enable rigorous in vivo dissection of signaling pathways. Here we review recent studies defining autocrine roles for growth factors such as BDNF, and classical morphogens, including Wnts and BMPs, in regulating neuronal development and plasticity. Collectively, these studies highlight an intimate relationship between activity-dependent autocrine signaling and synaptic plasticity, and further suggest a common principle for coordinating paracrine and autocrine signaling in the nervous system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

When synaptic vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, these membranes and the attached proteins are endocytosed and either recycled or degraded. This turnover needs to be tightly regulated in a timely and spatially confined manner. Increasing evidence suggests that these mechanisms do not only serve for the removal of defective synaptic vesicles or structural proteins of the active zone but also contribute to pathways regulating synaptic strength. The corresponding presynaptic autophagy system thus appears also important for synaptic maintenance and plasticity. Exciting new studies provide evidence how the autophagy machinery recognizes and degrades synaptic components and lay the ground to understand how autophagy in the presynaptic compartment contributes to modulation and maintenance of synaptic function. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Firing-rate based network modeling of the dLGN circuit: Effects of cortical feedback on spatiotemporal response properties of relay cells</title>

Visually evoked signals in the retina pass through the dorsal geniculate nucleus (dLGN) on the way to the visual cortex. This is however not a simple feedforward flow of information: there is a significant feedback from cortical cells back to both relay cells and interneurons in the dLGN. Despite four decades of experimental and theoretical studies, the functional role of this feedback is still debated. Here we use a firing-rate model, the extended difference-of-Gaussians (eDOG) model, to explore cortical feedback effects on visual responses of dLGN relay cells. For this model the responses are found by direct evaluation of two- or three-dimensional integrals allowing for fast and comprehensive studies of putative effects of different candidate organizations of the cortical feedback. Our analysis identifies a special mixed configuration of excitatory and inhibitory cortical feedback which seems to best account for available experimental data. This configuration consists of (i) a slow (long-delay) and spatially widespread inhibitory feedback, combined with (ii) a fast (short-delayed) and spatially narrow excitatory feedback, where (iii) the excitatory/inhibitory ON-ON connections are accompanied respectively by inhibitory/excitatory OFF-ON connections, i.e. following a phase-reversed arrangement. The recent development of optogenetic and pharmacogenetic methods has provided new tools for more precise manipulation and investigation of the thalamocortical circuit, in particular for mice. Such data will expectedly allow the eDOG model to be better constrained by data from specific animal model systems than has been possible until now for cat. We have therefore made the Python tool pyLGN which allows for easy adaptation of the eDOG model to new situations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NEnghs1B4I8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/2a3YD9EnPsk/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Andreas Petrides, Glenn Vinnicombe&lt;/p&gt;

This paper is concerned with the potential multistability of protein concentrations in the cell. That is, situations where one, or a family of, proteins may sit at one of two or more different steady state concentrations in otherwise identical cells, and in spite of them being in the same environment. For models of multisite protein phosphorylation for example, in the presence of excess substrate, it has been shown that the achievable number of stable steady states can increase linearly with the number of phosphosites available. In this paper, we analyse the consequences of adding enzyme docking to these and similar models, with the resultant sequestration of phosphatase and kinase by the fully unphosphorylated and by the fully phosphorylated substrates respectively. In the large molecule numbers limit, where deterministic analysis is applicable, we prove that there are always values for these rates of sequestration which, when exceeded, limit the extent of multistability. For the models considered here, these numbers are much smaller than the affinity of the enzymes to the substrate when it is in a modifiable state. As substrate enzyme-sequestration is increased, we further prove that the number of steady states will inevitably be reduced to one. For smaller molecule numbers a stochastic analysis is more appropriate, where multistability in the large molecule numbers limit can manifest itself as multimodality of the probability distribution; the system spending periods of time in the vicinity of one mode before jumping to another. Here, we find that substrate enzyme sequestration can induce bimodality even in systems where only a single steady state can exist at large numbers. To facilitate this analysis, we develop a weakly chained diagonally dominant M-matrix formulation of the Chemical Master Equation, allowing greater insights in the way particular mechanisms, like enzyme sequestration, can shape probability distributions and therefore exhibit different behaviour across different regimes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2a3YD9EnPsk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Two studies using independently generated mice documented that this knockout results in a considerable &amp;gt;60-fold reduction in light-sensitivity of affected rods, but provided different interpretations of how the remaining α-subunit (Gα&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;) mediates phototransduction without its cognate Gβ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-subunit partner. One study found that the light-sensitivity reduction matched a corresponding reduction in Gα&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; content in the light-sensing rod outer segments and proposed that Gα&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; activation is supported by remaining Gβ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; associating with other G subunit(s) naturally expressed in photoreceptors. In contrast, the second study reported the same light-sensitivity loss but a much lesser, only ~6-fold reduction of Gα&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; and proposed that light responses of these rods do not require Gβ at all. To resolve this controversy and elucidate the mechanism driving visual signaling in G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; knockout rods, we analyzed both mouse lines side-by-side. We first determined that outer segments of both mice have identical Gα&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; content, which is reduced ~65-fold from the wild type level. We further demonstrated that the remaining Gβ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is present in a complex with endogenous G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and G&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; subunits and that these complexes exist in wild type rods as well. Together, these results argue against the idea that Gα&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; alone supports light responses of G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; knockout rods and suggest that Gβ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is not unique in its ability to mediate vertebrate phototransduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Phototransduction has been a valuable system for understanding the basic principles of G protein signaling. One question that has remained unanswered is whether the G protein α-subunit can support signaling without its cognate β partner complex. Previous studies investigating this question in photoreceptors of G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; knockout mice came to mutually exclusive conclusions. We now resolve this controversy by showing that phototransduction in this knockout is supported by alternative β complexes rather than α-subunit alone. Most importantly, this study highlights functional interchangeability of different -subunits in the context of an intact &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.06336</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This paper considers an electro-chemical based communication model for
intercellular communication in plants. Many plants, such as Mimosa pudica (the
&quot;sensitive plant&quot;), employ electrochemical signals known as action potentials
(APs) for communication purposes. In this paper we present a simple model for
action potential generation. We make use of the concepts from molecular
communication to explain the underlying process of information transfer in a
plant. Using the information-theoretic analysis, we compute the mutual
information between the input and output in this work. The key aim is to study
the variations in the information propagation speed for varying number of plant
cells for one simple case. Furthermore we study the impact of the AP signal on
the mutual information and information propagation speed. We aim to explore
further that how the growth rate in plants can impact the information transfer
rate and vice versa.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Reliable and automatic epilepsy classification with affordable, consumer-grade electroencephalography in rural sub-Saharan Africa</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/324954v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Epilepsy is largely under-diagnosed in low-income and middle-income countries, due to lack of medical specialists and expensive electroencephalography (EEG) hardware. In this study we investigate if low-cost consumer-grade EEG in combination with machine learning techniques can offer a reliable screening tool to improve diagnosis rates. We acquired brain signals in people with epilepsy (N=163) and healthy controls (N=138) in two difficult-to-reach areas in rural Guinea-Bissau and Nigeria. Five minutes of fourteen channel resting-state EEG data were acquired with a portable, low-cost consumer-grade EEG recording headset. EEG channel time-series were divided in four-second artifact-free epochs and transformed into delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma wavelet frequencies. Summary measures such as the mean, standard deviation, minimal value, maximal value of the epoch signal fluctuations were used to train a random forest classifier. Epilepsy diagnosis based on at least three months seizure calendar data was used as the gold standard diagnosis. To prevent too optimistic classification the trained model was evaluated with EEG data from subjects not used in the training. In addition, we tested a classification model trained on Nigeria data against data from people in Guinea-Bissau and vice versa. The most contributing data features in the EEG were found in the beta and theta frequencies in Guinea-Bissau and Nigeria, respectively. Within-country model performance was good with area under the receiver-operating curves of 0.85 and 0.78 ({+/-} 0.02 standard errors) in unseen data in Guinea-Bissau and Nigeria, respectively. Across-country performance was moderate (0.62 and 0.64 {+/-} 0.02). Our data suggests that a combination of low cost electroencephalography and machine learning techniques may facilitate diagnostic screening for epilepsy in the most remote areas of the world.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/324715v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Extracellular microRNAs (miRNAs) are essential for the cell to cell communication in the healthy and diseased brain. MicroRNAs released from the activated microglia upon neurotropic virus infection may exacerbate CNS damage. Here, we identified let-7a and let-7b (let-7a/b) as the overexpressed miRNAs in Japanese Encephalitis virus (JEV) infected microglia and assessed their role in JEV pathogenesis. We measured the let-7a/b expressions in JEV infected post-mortem human brains, mice brains and in mouse microglial N9 cells by the qRT-PCR and in situ hybridization assay. The interaction between let-7a/b and NOTCH signaling pathway further examined in Toll-like receptor 7 knockdown (TLR7 KD) mice to assess the functions. Exosomes released from JEV infected or let-7a/b mimic transfected N9, and HEK-293 cells were isolated and evaluated their function. We observed an upregulation of let-7a/b in the infected brains as well as in microglia. Knockdown of TLR7 or Inhibition of let-7a/b suppressed the JEV induced NOTCH activation possibly via NF-{kappa}B dependent manner and subsequently, attenuated JEV induced TNF production in microglial cells. Further, exosomes secreted from JEV-infected microglial cells specifically contained let-7a/b. Exosomes overexpressed with let-7a/b were injected into BALB/c mice as well as co-incubated with mouse neuronal (Neuro2a) cells, or primary cortical neuron resulted in caspase activation leading to neuronal damage in the brain. Thus, our results provide evidence for the multifaceted role of let-7a/b miRNAs and unravel the exosomes mediated mechanism for JEV induced pathogenesis.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/324699v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Strong hippocampal mossy fiber synapses are thought to function as detonators, imposing 'teaching' signals onto CA3 neurons during new memory formation. For an empirical test of this long-standing view, we examined effects of stimulating mossy fibers on spatial firing of CA3 neurons in freely-moving mice. We found that optogenetic stimulation of mossy fibers can alter CA3 spatial firing, but their effects are only transient. Spatially restricted mossy fiber stimulation, either congruent or incongruent with CA3 place fields, was more likely to suppress than enhance CA3 neuronal activity. Also, changes in spatial firing induced by optogenetic stimulation reverted immediately upon stimulation termination, leaving CA3 place fields unaltered. Our results do not support the traditional view that mossy fibers impose teaching signals onto CA3 network, and show robustness of established CA3 spatial representations.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/324665v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Adaptive acquisition of information is critical for goal-directed behavior. Popular theories posit that information acquisition is driven by intrinsic motives (curiosity or exploration bonus) and mediated by valuation system. However, they are insufficient when agents need to evaluate instrumental benefit of new information in a forward-looking manner. We tested whether human brain computes value of information (VOI) on a scale common with more basic rewards to acquire information. In an fMRI task, subjects purchased information for choices on monetary lotteries. Behaviorally, subjective VOI was largely driven by instrumental benefit, as normatively predicted, but additionally affected by non-instrumental motive, particularly the utility of anticipation. Neurally, VOI was represented in striatum, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Cross-categorical decoding revealed that these regions use a common scale for VOI and another type of value, expected utility of the lotteries. These provide new insight on neurocognitive mechanism of forward-looking, value-based information acquisition.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/323667v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Waking up during the night to collect dream reports is a commonly used method to study dreams. This method has also been applied in studies on the relationship between dreams and memory consolidation. However, it is unclear if these awakenings influence ongoing memory consolidation processes. Furthermore, only few studies have examined if task incorporation into dreams is related to enhanced performance in the task. Here we compare memory performance in a word-picture association learning task after a night with (up to six awakenings) and without awakenings in 22 young and healthy participants. We then examine if the task is successfully incorporated into the dreams and if this incorporation is related to the task performance the next morning. We show that while the awakenings impair both subjective and objective sleep quality, these awakenings did not impair ongoing memory consolidation during sleep. When dreams were collected during the night by awakenings, memories of the learning task were successfully incorporated into dreams. No incorporation occurred in dreams collected only in the morning. Task incorporation into NREM sleep dreams, but not REM sleep dreams showed a relationship with task performance the next morning. We conclude that the method of awakenings to collect dream reports is suitable for dream and memory studies, and is even crucial to uncover task incorporations. Furthermore, our study suggests that dreams in NREM rather than REM sleep might be related to processes of memory consolidation during sleep.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Near real-time forecasting for cholera decision making in Haiti after Hurricane Matthew</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/rXysUXWSU_g/article</link>

Computational models of cholera transmission can provide objective insights into the course of an ongoing epidemic and aid decision making on allocation of health care resources. However, models are typically designed, calibrated and interpreted &lt;i&gt;post-hoc&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we report the efforts of a team from academia, field research and humanitarian organizations to model in near real-time the Haitian cholera outbreak after Hurricane Matthew in October 2016, to assess risk and to quantitatively estimate the efficacy of a then ongoing vaccination campaign. A rainfall-driven, spatially-explicit meta-community model of cholera transmission was coupled to a data assimilation scheme for computing short-term projections of the epidemic in near real-time. The model was used to forecast cholera incidence for the months after the passage of the hurricane (October-December 2016) and to predict the impact of a planned oral cholera vaccination campaign. Our first projection, from October 29 to December 31, predicted the highest incidence in the departments of Grande Anse and Sud, accounting for about 45% of the total cases in Haiti. The projection included a second peak in cholera incidence in early December largely driven by heavy rainfall forecasts, confirming the urgency for rapid intervention. A second projection (from November 12 to December 31) used updated rainfall forecasts to estimate that 835 cases would be averted by vaccinations in Grande Anse (90% Prediction Interval [PI] 476-1284) and 995 in Sud (90% PI 508-2043). The experience gained by this modeling effort shows that state-of-the-art computational modeling and data-assimilation methods can produce informative near real-time projections of cholera incidence. Collaboration among modelers and field epidemiologists is indispensable to gain fast access to field data and to translate model results into operational recommendations for emergency management during an outbreak. Future efforts should thus draw together multi-disciplinary teams to ensure model outputs are appropriately based, interpreted and communicated.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rXysUXWSU_g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Altered Excitability and Local Connectivity of mPFC-PAG Neurons in a Mouse Model of Neuropathic Pain</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/20/4829?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays a major role in both sensory and affective aspects of pain. There is extensive evidence that chronic pain produces functional changes within the mPFC. However, our understanding of local circuit changes to defined subpopulations of mPFC neurons in chronic pain models remains unclear. A major subpopulation of mPFC neurons project to the periaqueductal gray (PAG), which is a key midbrain structure involved in endogenous pain suppression and facilitation. Here, we used laser scanning photostimulation of caged glutamate to map cortical circuits of retrogradely labeled cortico-PAG (CP) neurons in layer 5 (L5) of mPFC in brain slices prepared from male mice having undergone chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve. Whole-cell recordings revealed a significant reduction in excitability for L5 CP neurons contralateral to CCI in the prelimbic (PL), but not infralimbic (IL), region of mPFC. Circuit mapping showed that excitatory inputs to L5 CP neurons in both PL and IL arose primarily from layer 2/3 (L2/3) and were significantly reduced in CCI mice. Glutamate stimulation of L2/3 and L5 elicited inhibitory inputs to CP neurons in both PL and IL, but only L2/3 input was significantly reduced in CP neurons of CCI mice. We also observed significant reduction in excitability and L2/3 inhibitory input to CP neurons ipsilateral to CCI. These results demonstrating region and laminar specific changes to mPFC-PAG neurons suggest that a unilateral CCI bilaterally alters cortical circuits upstream of the endogenous analgesic network, which may contribute to persistence of chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Chronic pain is a significant unresolved medical problem that is refractory to traditional analgesics and can negatively affect emotional health. The role of central circuits in mediating the persistent nature of chronic pain remains unclear. Local circuits within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) process ascending pain inputs and can modulate endogenous analgesia via direct projections to the periaqueductal gray (PAG). However, the mechanisms by which chronic pain alters intracortical circuitry of mPFC-PAG neurons are unknown. Here, we report specific changes to local circuits of mPFC-PAG neurons in mice displaying chronic pain behavior after nerve injury. These findings provide evidence for a neural mechanism by which chronic pain disrupts the descending analgesic system via functional changes to cortical circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: mTORC1 Is Transiently Reactivated in Injured Nerves to Promote c-Jun Elevation and Schwann Cell Dedifferentiation</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/20/4811?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Schwann cells (SCs) are endowed with a remarkable plasticity. When peripheral nerves are injured, SCs dedifferentiate and acquire new functions to coordinate nerve repair as so-called repair SCs. Subsequently, SCs redifferentiate to remyelinate regenerated axons. Given the similarities between SC dedifferentiation/redifferentiation in injured nerves and in demyelinating neuropathies, elucidating the signals involved in SC plasticity after nerve injury has potentially wider implications. c-Jun has emerged as a key transcription factor regulating SC dedifferentiation and the acquisition of repair SC features. However, the upstream pathways that control c-Jun activity after nerve injury are largely unknown. We report that the mTORC1 pathway is transiently but robustly reactivated in dedifferentiating SCs. By inducible genetic deletion of the functionally crucial mTORC1-subunit Raptor in mouse SCs (including male and female animals), we found that mTORC1 reactivation is necessary for proper myelin clearance, SC dedifferentiation, and consequently remyelination, without major alterations in the inflammatory response. In the absence of mTORC1 signaling, c-Jun failed to be upregulated correctly. Accordingly, a c-Jun binding motif was found to be enriched in promoters of genes with reduced expression in injured mutants. Furthermore, using cultured SCs, we found that mTORC1 is involved in c-Jun regulation by promoting its translation, possibly via the eIF4F-subunit eIF4A. These results provide evidence that proper c-Jun elevation after nerve injury involves also mTORC1-dependent post-transcriptional regulation to ensure timely dedifferentiation of SCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; A crucial evolutionary acquisition of vertebrates is the envelopment of axons in myelin sheaths produced by oligodendrocytes in the CNS and Schwann cells (SCs) in the PNS. When myelin is damaged, conduction of action potentials along axons slows down or is blocked, leading to debilitating diseases. Unlike oligodendrocytes, SCs have a high regenerative potential, granted by their remarkable plasticity. Thus, understanding the mechanisms underlying SC plasticity may uncover new therapeutic targets in nerve regeneration and demyelinating diseases. Our work reveals that reactivation of the mTORC1 pathway in SCs is essential for efficient SC dedifferentiation after nerve injury. Accordingly, modulating this signaling pathway might be of therapeutic relevance in peripheral nerve injury and other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Canonical TGF-{beta} Signaling Negatively Regulates Neuronal Morphogenesis through TGIF/Smad Complex-Mediated CRMP2 Suppression</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/20/4791?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Functional neuronal connectivity requires proper neuronal morphogenesis and its dysregulation causes neurodevelopmental diseases. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family cytokines play pivotal roles in development, but little is known about their contribution to morphological development of neurons. Here we show that the Smad-dependent canonical signaling of TGF-β family cytokines negatively regulates neuronal morphogenesis during brain development. Mechanistically, activated Smads form a complex with transcriptional repressor TG-interacting factor (TGIF), and downregulate the expression of a neuronal polarity regulator, collapsin response mediator protein 2. We also demonstrate that TGF-β family signaling inhibits neurite elongation of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons. Furthermore, the expression of TGF-β receptor 1, Smad4, or TGIF, which have mutations found in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders, disrupted neuronal morphogenesis in both mouse (male and female) and human (female) neurons. Together, these findings suggest that the regulation of neuronal morphogenesis by an evolutionarily conserved function of TGF-β signaling is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Canonical transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling plays a crucial role in multiple organ development, including brain, and mutations in components of the signaling pathway associated with several human developmental disorders. In this study, we found that Smads/TG-interacting factor-dependent canonical TGF-β signaling regulates neuronal morphogenesis through the suppression of collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP2) expression during brain development, and that function of this signaling is evolutionarily conserved in the mammalian brain. Mutations in canonical TGF-β signaling factors identified in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders disrupt the morphological development of neurons. Thus, our results suggest that proper control of TGF-β/Smads/CRMP2 signaling pathways is critical for the precise execution of neuronal morphogenesis, whose impairment eventually results in neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Genetic Ablation of All Cerebellins Reveals Synapse Organizer Functions in Multiple Regions Throughout the Brain</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/20/4774?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cerebellins are synaptic organizer molecules that bind to presynaptic neurexins and postsynaptic receptors. They are well studied in the cerebellum, but three of the four cerebellins (Cbln1, Cbln2, and Cbln4) are also broadly expressed outside of the cerebellum, suggesting that they perform general functions throughout the brain. Here, we generated male and female constitutive single (KO), double KO (dKO), and triple KO (tKO) mice of Cbln1, Cbln2, and Cbln4. We found that all constitutive cerebellin-deficient mice were viable and fertile, suggesting that cerebellins are not essential for survival. Cbln1/2 dKO mice exhibited salience-induced seizures that were aggravated in Cbln1/2/4 tKO mice, suggesting that all cerebellins contribute to brain function. As described previously, Cbln1 KO mice displayed major motor impairments that were aggravated by additional KO of Cbln2. Strikingly, the Cbln1/2 dKO did not cause alterations in synapse density in the hippocampus of young adult (1- and 2-month-old) mice, but produced a selective ~50% decrease in hippocampal synapse density in the stratum lacunosum moleculare of the CA1 region and in the dentate gyrus of aging, 6-month-old mice. A similar decrease in excitatory synapse density was observed in the striatum and retrosplenial cortex. Behaviorally, the Cbln1 KO produced dramatic changes in motor behaviors that were partly aggravated by additional deletion of Cbln2 and/or Cbln4. Our results show that cerebellins are not essential for survival and do not contribute to initial synapse formation, but perform multiple functions throughout the brain; as a consequence, their ablation results in a delayed loss of synapses and in behavioral impairments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Cerebellins (Cbln1-4) are &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-synaptic cell adhesion molecules. In the cerebellum, Cbln1 functions as a bidirectional organizer of parallel fiber–Purkinje cell synapses by binding to presynaptic neurexins and postsynaptic GluR2. Little is known about the function of cerebellins outside of the cerebellum; therefore, the present study used single, double, and triple constitutive KO mice of Cbln1, Cbln2, and Cbln4 to analyze the overall function of cerebellins. We show that cerebellins act as important synaptic organizers in specific subsets of neurons and likely contribute to many different brain functions. We also show that cerebellins are not initially required for synapse formation, but rather for specification and long-term synapse maintenance and demonstrate that all cerebellins, not just Cbln1, contribute to brain function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: NMDA Receptor Signaling Is Important for Neural Tube Formation and for Preventing Antiepileptic Drug-Induced Neural Tube Defects</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/20/4762?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Failure of neural tube closure leads to neural tube defects (NTDs), which can have serious neurological consequences or be lethal. Use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) during pregnancy increases the incidence of NTDs in offspring by unknown mechanisms. Here we show that during &lt;i&gt;Xenopus laevis&lt;/i&gt; neural tube formation, neural plate cells exhibit spontaneous calcium dynamics that are partially mediated by glutamate signaling. We demonstrate that NMDA receptors are important for the formation of the neural tube and that the loss of their function induces an increase in neural plate cell proliferation and impairs neural cell migration, which result in NTDs. We present evidence that the AED valproic acid perturbs glutamate signaling, leading to NTDs that are rescued with varied efficacy by preventing DNA synthesis, activating NMDA receptors, or recruiting the NMDA receptor target ERK1/2. These findings may prompt mechanistic identification of AEDs that do not interfere with neural tube formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neural tube defects are one of the most common birth defects. Clinical investigations have determined that the use of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy increases the incidence of these defects in the offspring by unknown mechanisms. This study discovers that glutamate signaling regulates neural plate cell proliferation and oriented migration and is necessary for neural tube formation. We demonstrate that the widely used antiepileptic drug valproic acid interferes with glutamate signaling and consequently induces neural tube defects, challenging the current hypotheses arguing that they are side effects of this antiepileptic drug that cause the increased incidence of these defects. Understanding the mechanisms of neurotransmitter signaling during neural tube formation may contribute to the identification and development of antiepileptic drugs that are safer during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Rapid Disinhibition by Adjustment of PV Intrinsic Excitability during Whisker Map Plasticity in Mouse S1</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/20/4749?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Rapid plasticity of layer (L) 2/3 inhibitory circuits is an early step in sensory cortical map plasticity, but its cellular basis is unclear. We show that, in mice of either sex, 1 d whisker deprivation drives the rapid loss of L4-evoked feedforward inhibition and more modest loss of feedforward excitation in L2/3 pyramidal (PYR) cells, increasing the excitation-inhibition conductance ratio. Rapid disinhibition was due to reduced L4-evoked spiking by L2/3 parvalbumin (PV) interneurons, caused by reduced PV intrinsic excitability. This included elevated PV spike threshold, which is associated with an increase in low-threshold, voltage-activated delayed rectifier (presumed Kv1) and A-type potassium currents. Excitatory synaptic input and unitary inhibitory output of PV cells were unaffected. Functionally, the loss of feedforward inhibition and excitation was precisely coordinated in L2/3 PYR cells, so that peak feedforward synaptic depolarization remained stable. Thus, the rapid plasticity of PV intrinsic excitability offsets early weakening of excitatory circuits to homeostatically stabilize synaptic potentials in PYR cells of sensory cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Inhibitory circuits in cerebral cortex are highly plastic, but the cellular mechanisms and functional importance of this plasticity are incompletely understood. We show that brief (1 d) sensory deprivation rapidly weakens parvalbumin (PV) inhibitory circuits by reducing the intrinsic excitability of PV neurons. This involved a rapid increase in voltage-gated potassium conductances that control near-threshold spiking excitability. Functionally, the loss of PV-mediated feedforward inhibition in L2/3 pyramidal cells was precisely balanced with the separate loss of feedforward excitation, resulting in a net homeostatic stabilization of synaptic potentials. Thus, rapid plasticity of PV intrinsic excitability implements network-level homeostasis to stabilize synaptic potentials in sensory cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cortical Mechanisms of Prioritizing Selection for Rejection in Visual Search</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/20/4738?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In visual search, the more one knows about a target, the faster one can find it. Surprisingly, target identification is also faster with knowledge about distractor-features. The latter is paradoxical, as it implies that to avoid the selection of an item, the item must somehow be selected to some degree. This conundrum has been termed the &quot;ignoring paradox&quot;, and, to date, little is known about how the brain resolves it. Here, in data from four experiments using neuromagnetic brain recordings in male and female humans, we provide evidence that this paradox is resolved by giving distracting information priority in cortical processing. This attentional priority to distractors manifests as an enhanced early neuromagnetic index, which occurs before target-related processing, and regardless of distractor predictability. It is most pronounced on trials for which a response rapidly occurred, and is followed by a suppression of the distracting information. These observations together suggest that in visual search items cannot be ignored without first being selected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; How can we ignore distracting stimuli in our environment? To do this successfully, a logical hypothesis is that as few neural resources as possible should be devoted to distractor processing. Yet, to avoid devoting resources to a distractor, the brain must somehow mark what to avoid; this is a philosophical problem, which has been termed the &quot;ignoring paradox&quot; or &quot;white bear phenomenon&quot;. Here, we use MEG recordings to determine how the human brain resolves this paradox. Our data show that distractors are not only processed, they are given temporal priority, with the brain building a robust representation of the to-be-ignored items. Thus, successful suppression of distractors can only be achieved if distractors are first strongly neurally represented.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neural Representations of Sensorimotor Memory- and Digit Position-Based Load Force Adjustments Before the Onset of Dexterous Object Manipulation</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/20/4724?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Anticipatory load forces for dexterous object manipulation in humans are modulated based on visual object property cues, sensorimotor memories of previous experiences with the object, and, when digit positioning varies from trial to trial, the integrating of this sensed variability with force modulation. Studies of the neural representations encoding these anticipatory mechanisms have not considered these mechanisms separately from each other or from feedback mechanisms emerging after lift onset. Here, representational similarity analyses of fMRI data were used to identify neural representations of sensorimotor memories and the sensing and integration of digit position. Cortical activity and movement kinematics were measured as 20 human subjects (11 women) minimized tilt of a symmetrically shaped object with a concealed asymmetric center of mass (CoM, left and right sided). This task required generating compensatory torques in opposite directions, which, without helpful visual CoM cues, relied primarily on sensorimotor memories of the same object and CoM. Digit position was constrained or unconstrained, the latter of which required modulating forces beyond what can be recalled from sensorimotor memories to compensate for digit position variability. Ventral premotor (PMv), somatosensory, and cerebellar lobule regions (CrusII, VIIIa) were sensitive to anticipatory behaviors that reflect sensorimotor memory content, as shown by larger voxel pattern differences for unmatched than matched CoM conditions. Cerebellar lobule I–IV, Broca area 44, and PMv showed greater voxel pattern differences for unconstrained than constrained grasping, which suggests their sensitivity to monitor the online coincidence of planned and actual digit positions and correct for a mismatch by force modulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; To pick up a water glass without slipping, tipping, or spilling requires anticipatory planning of fingertip load forces before the lift commences. This anticipation relies on object visual properties (e.g., mass/mass distribution), sensorimotor memories built from previous experiences (especially when object properties cannot be inferred visually), and online sensing of where the digits are positioned. There is limited understanding of how the brain represents each of these anticipatory mechanisms. We used fMRI measures of regional brain patterns and digit position kinematics before lift onset of an object with nonsalient visual cues specifically to isolate sensorimotor memories and integration of sensed digit position with force modulation. In doing so, we localized neural representations encoding these anticipatory mechanisms for dexterous object manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Role of the Microglial Cx3cr1 Pathway in the Postnatal Maturation of Retinal Photoreceptors</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/20/4708?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microglia are the resident immune cells of the CNS, and their response to infection, injury and disease is well documented. More recently, microglia have been shown to play a role in normal CNS development, with the fractalkine-Cx3cr1 signaling pathway of particular importance. This work describes the interaction between the light-sensitive photoreceptors and microglia during eye opening, a time of postnatal photoreceptor maturation. Genetic removal of Cx3cr1 (&lt;i&gt;Cx3cr1&lt;sup&gt;GFP/GFP&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) led to an early retinal dysfunction soon after eye opening [postnatal day 17 (P17)] and cone photoreceptor loss (P30 onward) in mice of either sex. This dysfunction occurred at a time when fractalkine expression was predominantly outer retinal, when there was an increased microglial presence near the photoreceptor layer and increased microglial–cone photoreceptor contacts. Photoreceptor maturation and outer segment elongation was coincident with increased opsin photopigment expression in wild-type retina, while this was aberrant in the &lt;i&gt;Cx3cr1&lt;sup&gt;GFP/GFP&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; retina and outer segment length was reduced. A beadchip array highlighted Cx3cr1 regulation of genes involved in the photoreceptor cilium, a key structure that is important for outer segment elongation. This was confirmed with quantitative PCR with specific cilium-related genes, &lt;i&gt;Rpgr&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Rpgrip1&lt;/i&gt;, downregulated at eye opening (P14). While the overall cilium structure was unaffected, expression of Rpgr, Rpgrip1, and centrin were restricted to more proximal regions of the transitional zone. This study highlighted a novel role for microglia in postnatal neuronal development within the retina, with loss of fractalkine–Cx3cr1 signaling leading to an altered distribution of cilium proteins, failure of outer segment elongation and ultimately cone photoreceptor loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Microglia are involved in CNS development and disease. This work highlights the role of microglia in postnatal development of the light-detecting photoreceptor neurons within the mouse retina. Loss of the microglial Cx3cr1 signaling pathway resulted in specific alterations in the cilium, a key structure in photoreceptor outer segment elongation. The distribution of key components of the cilium transitional zone, Rpgr, Rpgrip1, and centrin, were altered in retinae lacking Cx3cr1 with reduced outer segment length and cone photoreceptor death observed at later postnatal ages. This work identifies a novel role for microglia in the postnatal maturation of retinal photoreceptors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Distribution of Spinal Neuronal Networks Controlling Forward and Backward Locomotion</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/20/4695?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Higher vertebrates, including humans, are capable not only of forward (FW) locomotion but also of walking in other directions relative to the body axis [backward (BW), sideways, etc.]. Although the neural mechanisms responsible for controlling FW locomotion have been studied in considerable detail, the mechanisms controlling steps in other directions are mostly unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate the distribution of spinal neuronal networks controlling FW and BW locomotion. First, we applied electrical epidural stimulation (ES) to different segments of the spinal cord from L2 to S2 to reveal zones triggering FW and BW locomotion in decerebrate cats of either sex. Second, to determine the location of spinal neurons activated during FW and BW locomotion, we used c-Fos immunostaining. We found that the neuronal networks responsible for FW locomotion were distributed broadly in the lumbosacral spinal cord and could be activated by ES of any segment from L3 to S2. By contrast, networks generating BW locomotion were activated by ES of a limited zone from the caudal part of L5 to the caudal part of L7. In the intermediate part of the gray matter within this zone, a significantly higher number of c-Fos-positive interneurons was revealed in BW-stepping cats compared with FW-stepping cats. We suggest that this region of the spinal cord contains the network that determines the BW direction of locomotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Sequential and single steps in various directions relative to the body axis [forward (FW), backward (BW), sideways, etc.] are used during locomotion and to correct for perturbations, respectively. The mechanisms controlling step direction are unknown. In the present study, for the first time we compared the distributions of spinal neuronal networks controlling FW and BW locomotion. Using a marker to visualize active neurons, we demonstrated that in the intermediate part of the gray matter within L6 and L7 spinal segments, significantly more neurons were activated during BW locomotion than during FW locomotion. We suggest that the network determining the BW direction of stepping is located in this area.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Striatal Direct and Indirect Pathway Output Structures Are Differentially Altered in Mouse Models of Huntington's Disease</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/20/4678?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The present study examined synaptic communication between direct and indirect output pathway striatal medium-sized spiny neurons (MSNs) and their target structures, the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) and the external globus pallidus (GPe) in two mouse models of Huntington's disease (HD). Cre recombination, optogenetics, and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were used to determine alterations in intrinsic and synaptic properties of SNr and GPe neurons from both male and female symptomatic R6/2 (&amp;gt;60 d) and presymptomatic (2 months) or symptomatic (10–12 months) YAC128 mice. Cell membrane capacitance was decreased, whereas input resistance was increased in SNr neurons from R6/2, but not YAC128 mice. The amplitude of GABAergic responses evoked by optogenetic stimulation of direct pathway terminals was reduced in SNr neurons of symptomatic mice of both models. A decrease in spontaneous GABA synaptic activity, in particular large-amplitude events, in SNr neurons also was observed. Passive membrane properties of GPe neurons were not different between R6/2 or YAC128 mice and their control littermates. Similarly, the amplitude of GABA responses evoked by activation of indirect pathway MSN terminals and the frequency of spontaneous GABA synaptic activity were similar in HD and control animals. In contrast, the decay time of the evoked GABA response was significantly longer in cells from HD mice. Interestingly, activation of indirect pathway MSNs within the striatum evoked larger-amplitude responses in direct pathway MSNs. Together, these results demonstrate differential alterations in responses evoked by direct and indirect pathway terminals in SNr and GPe leading to striatal output imbalance and motor dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Previous work on Huntington's disease (HD) focused on striatal medium-sized spiny neurons (MSNs) almost exclusively. Little is known about the effects that alterations in the striatum have on output structures of the direct and indirect pathways, the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) and the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe), respectively. We combined electrophysiological and optogenetic methods to examine responses evoked by selective activation of terminals of direct and indirect pathway MSNs in SNr and GPe neurons in two mouse models of HD. We show a differential disruption of synaptic communication between the direct and indirect output pathways of the striatum with their target regions leading to an imbalance of striatal output, which will contribute to motor dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: MCU Interacts with Miro1 to Modulate Mitochondrial Functions in Neurons</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/20/4666?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mitochondrial Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake is gated by the mitochondrial calcium uniplex, which is comprised of mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; pore-forming subunit of the complex, and its regulators. Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx through MCU affects both mitochondrial function and movement in neurons, but its direct role in mitochondrial movement has not been explored. In this report, we show a link between MCU and Miro1, a membrane protein known to regulate mitochondrial movement. We find that MCU interacts with Miro1 through MCU's N-terminal domain, previously thought to be the mitochondrial targeting sequence. Our results show that the N-terminus of MCU has a transmembrane domain that traverses the outer mitochondrial membrane, which is dispensable for MCU localization into mitochondria. However, this domain is required for Miro1 interaction and is critical for Miro1 directed movement. Together, our findings reveal Miro1 as a new component of the MCU complex, and that MCU is an important regulator of mitochondrial transport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Mitochondrial calcium level is critical for mitochondrial metabolic activity and mitochondrial transport in neurons. While it has been established that calcium influx into mitochondria is modulated by mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex, how MCU regulates mitochondrial movement still remains unclear. Here, we discover that the N-terminus of MCU plays a different role than previously thought; it is not required for mitochondrial targeting but is essential for interaction with Miro1, an outer mitochondrial membrane protein important for mitochondrial movement. Furthermore, we show that MCU–Miro1 interaction is required to maintain mitochondrial transport. Our data identify that Miro1 is a novel component of the mitochondrial calcium uniplex and demonstrate that coupling between MCU and Miro1 as a novel mechanism modulating both mitochondrial Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake and mitochondrial transport.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Mesocorticolimbic Connectivity and Volumetric Alterations in DCC Mutation Carriers</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/20/4655?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The axon guidance cue receptor DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer) plays a critical role in the organization of mesocorticolimbic pathways in rodents. To investigate whether this occurs in humans, we measured (1) anatomical connectivity between the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA) and forebrain targets, (2) striatal and cortical volumes, and (3) putatively associated traits and behaviors. To assess translatability, morphometric data were also collected in &lt;i&gt;Dcc&lt;/i&gt;-haploinsufficient mice. The human volunteers were 20 &lt;i&gt;DCC&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt; mutation carriers, 16 &lt;i&gt;DCC&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; relatives, and 20 &lt;i&gt;DCC&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; unrelated healthy volunteers (UHVs; 28 females). The mice were 11 &lt;i&gt;Dcc&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt; and 16 wild-type C57BL/6J animals assessed during adolescence and adulthood. Compared with both control groups, the human &lt;i&gt;DCC&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt; carriers exhibited the following: (1) reduced anatomical connectivity from the SN/VTA to the ventral striatum [&lt;i&gt;DCC&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt;: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0005, &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;effect size&lt;/i&gt;) = 0.60; UHV: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0029, &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.48] and ventral medial prefrontal cortex (&lt;i&gt;DCC&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt;: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0031, &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.53; UHV: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.034, &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.35); (2) lower novelty-seeking scores (&lt;i&gt;DCC&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt;: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.034, &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; = 0.82; UHV: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.019, &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; = 0.84); and (3) reduced striatal volume (&lt;i&gt;DCC&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt;: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0009, &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; = 1.37; UHV: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0054, &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; = 0.93). Striatal volumetric reductions were also present in &lt;i&gt;Dcc&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice, and these were seen during adolescence (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0058, &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; = 1.09) and adulthood (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003, &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; = 1.26). Together these findings provide the first evidence in humans that an axon guidance gene is involved in the formation of mesocorticolimbic circuitry and related behavioral traits, providing mechanisms through which &lt;i&gt;DCC&lt;/i&gt; mutations might affect susceptibility to diverse neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Opportunities to study the effects of axon guidance molecules on human brain development have been rare. Here, the identification of a large four-generational family that carries a mutation to the axon guidance molecule receptor gene, &lt;i&gt;DCC&lt;/i&gt;, enabled us to demonstrate effects on mesocorticolimbic anatomical connectivity, striatal volumes, and personality traits. Reductions in striatal volumes were replicated in &lt;i&gt;DCC&lt;/i&gt;-haploinsufficient mice. Together, these processes might influence mesocorticolimbic function and susceptibility to diverse neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: FLP-18 Functions through the G-Protein-Coupled Receptors NPR-1 and NPR-4 to Modulate Reversal Length in Caenorhabditis elegans</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/20/4641?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Animal behavior is critically dependent on the activity of neuropeptides. Reversals, one of the most conspicuous behaviors in &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;, plays an important role in determining the navigation strategy of the animal. Our experiments on hermaphrodite &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; show the involvement of a neuropeptide FLP-18 in modulating reversal length in these hermaphrodites. We show that FLP-18 controls the reversal length by regulating the activity of AVA interneurons through the G-protein-coupled neuropeptide receptors, NPR-4 and NPR-1. We go on to show that the site of action of these receptors is the AVA interneuron for NPR-4 and the ASE sensory neurons for NPR-1. We further show that mutants in the neuropeptide, &lt;i&gt;flp-18&lt;/i&gt;, and its receptors show increased reversal lengths. Consistent with the behavioral data, calcium levels in the AVA neuron of freely reversing &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; were significantly higher and persisted for longer durations in &lt;i&gt;flp-18&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;npr-1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;npr-4&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;npr-1 npr-4&lt;/i&gt; genetic backgrounds compared with wild-type control animals. Finally, we show that increasing FLP-18 levels through genetic and physiological manipulations causes shorter reversal lengths. Together, our analysis suggests that the FLP-18/NPR-1/NPR-4 signaling is a pivotal point in the regulation of reversal length under varied genetic and environmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In this study, we elucidate the circuit and molecular machinery required for normal reversal behavior in hermaphrodite &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;. We delineate the circuit and the neuropeptide receptors required for maintaining reversal length in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;. Our work sheds light on the importance of a single neuropeptide, FLP-18, and how change in levels in this one peptide could allow the animal to change the length of its reversal, thereby modulating how the &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; explores its environment. We also go on to show that FLP-18 functions to maintain reversal length through the neuropeptide receptors NPR-4 and NPR-1. Our study will allow for a better understanding of the complete repertoire of behaviors shown by freely moving animals as they explore their environment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Learning-Dependent and -Independent Enhancement of Mitral/Tufted Cell Glomerular Odor Responses Following Olfactory Fear Conditioning in Awake Mice</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/20/4623?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Associative fear learning produces fear toward the conditioned stimulus (CS) and often generalization, the expansion of fear from the CS to similar, unlearned stimuli. However, how fear learning affects early sensory processing of learned and unlearned stimuli in relation to behavioral fear responses to these stimuli remains unclear. We subjected male and female mice expressing the fluorescent calcium indicator GCaMP3 in olfactory bulb mitral and tufted cells to a classical olfactory fear conditioning paradigm. We then used awake, &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; calcium imaging to quantify learning-induced changes in glomerular odor responses, which constitute the first site of olfactory processing in the brain. The results demonstrate that odor-shock pairing nonspecifically enhances glomerular odor representations in a learning-dependent manner and increases representational similarity between the CS and nonconditioned odors, potentially priming the system toward generalization of learned fear. Additionally, CS-specific glomerular enhancements remain even when associative learning is blocked, suggesting two separate mechanisms lead to enhanced glomerular responses following odor-shock pairings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In the olfactory bulb (OB), odors are uniquely coded in a spatial map that represents odor identity, making the OB a unique model system for investigating how learned fear alters sensory processing. Classical fear conditioning causes fear of the conditioned stimulus (CS) and of neutral stimuli, known as generalization. Combining fear conditioning with fluorescent calcium imaging of OB glomeruli, we found enhanced glomerular responses of the CS as well as neutral stimuli in awake mice, which mirrors fear generalization. We report that CS and neutral stimuli enhancements are, respectively, learning-independent and learning-dependent. Together, these results reveal distinct mechanisms leading to enhanced OB processing of fear-inducing stimuli and provide important implications for altered sensory processing in fear generalization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Semaphorin3A Signaling Is Dispensable for Motor Axon Reinnervation of the Adult Neuromuscular Junction</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/3/ENEURO.0155-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a specialized synapse that is formed by motor axon innervation of skeletal muscle fibers. The maintenance of motor-muscle connectivity is critical for the preservation of muscle tone and generation of movement. Injury can induce a robust regenerative response in motor axons, but severe trauma or chronic denervation resulting from neurodegenerative disease typically leads to inefficient repair and poor functional recovery. The axon guidance molecule Semaphorin3A (Sema3A) has been implicated as a negative regulator of motor innervation. Upon binding to a plexinA-neuropilin1 (Npn1) receptor complex, Sema3A initiates a downstream signaling cascade that results in axonal repulsion. Here, we established a reproducible nerve crush model to quantify motor nerve regeneration. We then used that model to investigate the role of Sema3A signaling at the adult NMJ. In contrast to previous findings, we found that &lt;i&gt;Sema3A&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Npn1&lt;/i&gt; mRNA decrease in response to denervation, suggesting that Sema3A-Npn1 signaling may regulate NMJ reinnervation. To directly test that hypothesis, we used inducible knockout models to ubiquitously delete Sema3A or Npn1 from adult mice. Despite demonstrating that we could achieve highly efficient gene deletion, disruption of Sema3A-Npn1 signaling did not affect the normal maintenance of the NMJ or disrupt motor axon reinnervation after a denervating injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05696</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We present a circuit synthesis methodology to emulate in hardware the
electrical behavior of a single bursting neuron. The method is neuromorphic in
that the basic circuit elements mimic how ion channels shape the circuit
conductance in specific voltage and temporal windows. As an input-output
approach, I-V curve shaping proves effective in enabling robust and accurate
control of the circuit behavior, suggesting a close analogy to the biophysical
mechanisms of neuromodulation.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Task-dependent modulation of the visual sensory thalamus assists visual-speech recognition. (arXiv:1805.05682v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05682</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The cerebral cortex modulates early sensory processing via feed-back
connections to sensory pathway nuclei. The functions of this top-down
modulation for human behavior are poorly understood. Here, we show that
top-down modulation of the visual sensory thalamus (the lateral geniculate
body, LGN) is involved in visual-speech recognition. In two independent
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, LGN response increased
when participants processed fast-varying features of articulatory movements
required for visual-speech recognition, as compared to temporally more stable
features required for face identification with the same stimulus material. The
LGN response during the visual-speech task correlated positively with the
visual-speech recognition scores across participants. In addition, the
task-dependent modulation was present for speech movements and did not occur
for control conditions involving non-speech biological movements. In
face-to-face communication, visual speech recognition is used to enhance or
even enable understanding what is said. Speech recognition is commonly
explained in frameworks focusing on cerebral cortex areas. Our findings suggest
that task-dependent modulation at subcortical sensory stages has an important
role for communication: Together with similar findings in the auditory modality
the findings imply that task-dependent modulation of the sensory thalami is a
general mechanism to optimize speech recognition.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01531</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The ability to effectively control brain dynamics holds great promise for the
enhancement of cognitive function in humans, and the betterment of their
quality of life. Yet, successfully controlling dynamics in neural systems is
challenging, in part due to the immense complexity of the brain and the large
set of interactions that can drive any single change. While we have gained some
understanding of the control of single neurons, the control of large-scale
neural systems -- networks of multiply interacting components -- remains poorly
understood. Efforts to address this gap include the construction of tools for
the control of brain networks, mostly adapted from control and dynamical
systems theory. Informed by current opportunities for practical intervention,
these theoretical contributions provide models that draw from a wide array of
mathematical approaches. We present intriguing recent developments for
effective strategies of control in dynamic brain networks, and we also describe
potential mechanisms that underlie such processes. We review efforts in the
control of general neurophysiological processes with implications for brain
development and cognitive function, as well as the control of altered
neurophysiological processes in medical contexts such as anesthesia
administration, seizure suppression, and deep-brain stimulation for Parkinson's
disease. We conclude with a forward-looking discussion regarding how emerging
results from network control -- especially approaches that deal with nonlinear
dynamics or more realistic trajectories for control transitions -- could be
used to directly address pressing questions in neuroscience.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: CaMKII activation supports reward-based neural network optimization through Hamiltonian sampling. (arXiv:1606.00157v3 [cs.NE] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00157</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Synaptic plasticity is implemented and controlled through over thousand
different types of molecules in the postsynaptic density and presynaptic
boutons that assume a staggering array of different states through
phosporylation and other mechanisms. One of the most prominent molecule in the
postsynaptic density is CaMKII, that is described in molecular biology as a
&quot;memory molecule&quot; that can integrate through auto-phosporylation Ca-influx
signals on a relatively large time scale of dozens of seconds. The functional
impact of this memory mechanism is largely unknown. We show that the
experimental data on the specific role of CaMKII activation in dopamine-gated
spine consolidation suggest a general functional role in speeding up
reward-guided search for network configurations that maximize reward
expectation. Our theoretical analysis shows that stochastic search could in
principle even attain optimal network configurations by emulating one of the
most well-known nonlinear optimization methods, simulated annealing. But this
optimization is usually impeded by slowness of stochastic search at a given
temperature. We propose that CaMKII contributes a momentum term that
substantially speeds up this search. In particular, it allows the network to
overcome saddle points of the fitness function. The resulting improved
stochastic policy search can be understood on a more abstract level as
Hamiltonian sampling, which is known to be one of the most efficient stochastic
search methods.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Term or Preterm Cesarean Section Delivery Does Not Lead to Long-term Detrimental Consequences in Mice</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy112/4996561?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Epidemiological studies have provided contradictory data on the deleterious sequels of cesarean section (C-section) delivery and their links with developmental brain disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorders. To gain better insight on these issues, we have now compared physiological, morphological, and behavioral parameters in vaginal, term, and preterm C-section delivered mice. We report that C-section delivery does not lead to long-term behavioral alterations though preterm C-section delivery modifies communicative behaviors in pups. Moreover, C-section delivery neither alters the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) developmental excitatory to inhibitory shift nor the frequency or amplitude of glutamatergic and GABAergic postsynaptic currents in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. However, these neurons present an underdeveloped dendritic arbor at birth in pups born by C-section delivery, but this difference disappears 1 day later suggesting an accelerated growth after birth. Therefore, C-section delivery, with prematurity as an aggravating factor, induces transient developmental delays but neither impacts the GABA developmental sequence nor leads to long-term consequences in mice. The deleterious sequels of C-section delivery described in epidemiological studies might be due to a perinatal insult that could be aggravated by C-section delivery.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Local gyrification may reflect the distribution and timing of aberrant cortical expansion in ASDs. We examined MRI data from (Study 1) 64 individuals with ASD and 64 typically developing (TD) controls (7–19 years), and from (Study 2) an independent sample from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 31/group). Local Gyrification Index (lGI), cortical thickness (CT), and surface area (SA) were measured. In Study 1, differences in lGI (ASD &amp;gt; TD) were found in left parietal and temporal and right frontal and temporal regions. lGI decreased bilaterally with age, but more steeply in ASD in left precentral, right lateral occipital, and middle frontal clusters. CT differed between groups in right perisylvian cortex (TD &amp;gt; ASD), but no differences were found for SA. Partial correlations between lGI and CT were generally negative, but associations were weaker in ASD in several clusters. Study 2 results were consistent, though less extensive. Altered gyrification may reflect unique information about the trajectory of cortical development in ASDs. While early overgrowth tends to be undetectable in later childhood in ASDs, findings may indicate that a trace of this developmental abnormality could remain in a disorder-specific pattern of gyrification.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Multiple Regions of a Cortical Network Commonly Encode the Meaning of Words in Multiple Grammatical Positions of Read Sentences</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy110/4996559?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Deciphering how sentence meaning is represented in the brain remains a major challenge to science. Semantically related neural activity has recently been shown to arise concurrently in distributed brain regions as successive words in a sentence are read. However, what semantic content is represented by different regions, what is common across them, and how this relates to words in different grammatical positions of sentences is weakly understood. To address these questions, we apply a semantic model of word meaning to interpret brain activation patterns elicited in sentence reading. The model is based on human ratings of 65 sensory/motor/emotional and cognitive features of experience with words (and their referents). Through a process of mapping functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging activation back into model space we test: which brain regions semantically encode content words in different grammatical positions (e.g., subject/verb/object); and what semantic features are encoded by different regions. In left temporal, inferior parietal, and inferior/superior frontal regions we detect the semantic encoding of words in all grammatical positions tested and reveal multiple common components of semantic representation. This suggests that sentence comprehension involves a common core representation of multiple words’ meaning being encoded in a network of regions distributed across the brain.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

We report the largest single-sample study of structural and functional sex differences in the human brain (2750 female, 2466 male participants; mean age 61.7 years, range 44–77 years). Males had higher raw volumes, raw surface areas, and white matter fractional anisotropy; females had higher raw cortical thickness and higher white matter tract complexity. There was considerable distributional overlap between the sexes. Subregional differences were not fully attributable to differences in total volume, total surface area, mean cortical thickness, or height. There was generally greater male variance across the raw structural measures. Functional connectome organization showed stronger connectivity for males in unimodal sensorimotor cortices, and stronger connectivity for females in the default mode network. This large-scale study provides a foundation for attempts to understand the causes and consequences of sex differences in adult brain structure and function.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Cortical OTX2 infusion in juvenile mice induced &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Gadd45b/g&lt;/span&gt; expression through direct regulation of transcription. Intriguingly, a reverse effect was found in the adult, where reducing cortical OTX2 resulted in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Gadd45b/g&lt;/span&gt; upregulation. Viral expression of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Gadd45b&lt;/span&gt; in adult visual cortex directly induced ocular dominance plasticity with concomitant changes in MeCP2 foci within parvalbumin interneurons and in methylation states of several plasticity gene promoters, suggesting epigenetic regulation. This interaction provides a molecular mechanism for OTX2 to trigger critical period plasticity yet suppress adult plasticity.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Hierarchical modulation of auditory prediction error signaling is independent of attention</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/324467v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The auditory system is tuned to detect rhythmic regularities or irregularities in the environment which can occur on different timescales, i.e. regularities in short (local) and long (global) timescale which could conflict or converge. While MMN and P3b are thought to index local and global deviance, respectively, it is not clear how these hierarchical levels interact and to what extent attention modulates this interaction. We used a hierarchical oddball paradigm with local (sequence-level) and global (block-level) violations of regularities in 5-tone sequences, in attended and unattended conditions. Amplitude of negativity in the N2 timeframe and positivity in the P3b timeframe elicited by the final tone in the sequence were analyzed in a 2*2*2 factorial model (local status, global status, attention condition). We found a significant interaction between the local and global status of the final tone on the N2 amplitude (p&amp;lt;.001, {eta}p2= .55), while there was no significant three-way interaction with attention (p &amp;gt; .05), together demonstrating that lower-level prediction error is modulated by detection of higher-order regularity but expressed independently of attention. Regarding P3b amplitude, we found significant main effect of global status (p&amp;lt;.001, {eta}p2= .42), and an interaction between global status and attention (p &amp;lt; .001, {eta}p2= .70). Thus, higher-level prediction error, indexed by P3b, is sensitive to global regularity violations if the auditory stream is attended. The results demonstrate the capacity of our auditory perception to rapidly resolve conflicts between different levels of predictive hierarchy as indexed by MMN modulation, while P3b represents a different, attention-dependent system.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Decoding Selective Attention to Context Memory: An Aging Study</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/324384v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Emerging evidence has suggested that the tendency for older adults to bind too much contextual information during encoding (i.e., hyper-binding) may contribute to poorer memory for relevant contextual information during retrieval. While these findings are consistent with theories of age-related declines in selective attention and inhibitory control, the degree to which older adults are able to selectively attend to relevant contextual information during encoding is unknown. To better understand the neural dynamics associated with selective attention during encoding, the current study applied multivariate pattern analyses (MVPA) to oscillatory EEG in order to track moment-to-moment shifts of attention between relevant and irrelevant contextual information during encoding. Young and older adults studied pictures of objects in the presence of two contextual features: a color and a scene, and their attention was directed to the object's relationship with one of those contexts (i.e., target context). Results showed that patterns of oscillatory power successfully predicted whether selective attention was directed to a scene or color, across age groups. Individual differences in overall classification performance were associated with individual differences in target context memory accuracy during retrieval. However, changes in classification performance within a trial, suggestive of fluctuations in selective attention, predicted individual differences in hyper-binding. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use MPVA techniques to decode attention during episodic encoding and the impact of attentional shifts toward distracting information on age-related context memory impairments and hyper-binding. These results are consistent with the as-of-yet unsubstantiated theory that age-related declines in context memory may be attributable to poorer selective attention and/or greater inhibitory deficits in older adults.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Cell type specific profiling of alternative translation identifies novel protein isoforms in the mouse brain</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/324236v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Translation canonically begins at a single AUG and terminates at the stop codon, generating one protein species per transcript. However, some transcripts may use alternative initiation sites or sustain translation past their stop codon, generating multiple protein isoforms. Through other mechanisms such as alternative splicing, both neurons and glia exhibit remarkable transcriptional diversity, and these other forms of post-transcriptional regulation are impacted by neural activity and disease. Here, using ribosome footprinting, we demonstrate that alternative translation is likewise abundant in the central nervous system and modulated by stimulation and disease. First, in neuron/glia mixed cultures we identify hundreds of transcripts with alternative initiation sites and confirm the protein isoforms corresponding to a subset of these sites by mass spectrometry. Many of them modulate their alternative initiation in response to KCl stimulation, indicating activity-dependent regulation of this phenomenon. Next, we detect several transcripts undergoing stop codon readthrough thus generating novel C-terminally-extended protein isoforms in vitro. Further, by coupling Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification to ribosome footprinting to enable cell-type specific analysis in vivo, we find that several of both neuronal and astrocytic transcripts undergo readthrough in the mouse brain. Functional analyses of one of these transcripts, Aqp4, reveals readthrough confers perivascular localization, indicating readthrough can be a conserved mechanism to modulate protein function. Finally, we show that AQP4 readthrough is disrupted in multiple gliotic disease models. Our study demonstrates the extensive and regulated use of alternative translational events in the brain and indicates that some of these events alter key protein properties.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The mammalian PIM family of serine/threonine kinases regulate several cellular functions, such as cell survival and motility. Since we have observed PIM expression in the olfactory epithelium and other sensory organs of mice, this has raised the question of whether PIM kinases regulate also sensory cell functions. As our model organism to investigate this question, we used the Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes, which express two PIM-related kinases, PRK-1 and PRK-2. We demonstrated them to be true PIM orthologs with similar substrate specificity as well as sensitivity to PIM-inhibitory compounds. Furthermore, we obtained evidence to indicate that PRKs are selectively involved in regulation of olfactory sensations via AWB or AWCON neurons to volatile attractants or repellants, but do not affect gustatory sensations.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Data-driven modeling of cholinergic modulation of neural microcircuits: bridging neurons, synapses, and network states</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/323865v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Neuromodulators, such as acetylcholine (ACh), control information processing in neural microcircuits by regulating neuronal and synaptic physiology. Computational models and simulations enable predictions on the potential role of ACh in reconfiguring network states. As a prelude into investigating how the cellular and synaptic effects of ACh collectively influence emergent network dynamics, we developed a data-driven framework incorporating phenomenological models of the anatomy and physiology of cholinergic modulation of the neocortex. The first-draft models were integrated into a biologically detailed tissue model of neocortical microcircuitry to predict how ACh affects different types of neurons and synapses, and consequently alters global network states. Preliminary simulations not only corroborate the long-standing notion that ACh desynchronizes network activity, but also reveal a potentially fine-grained control over a spectrum of neocortical states. We show that low levels of ACh, such as those during sleep, drive microcircuit activity into slow oscillations and network synchrony, whereas high ACh concentrations, such as those during wakefulness, govern fast oscillations and network asynchrony. In addition, network states modulated by ACh levels shape spike-time cross-correlations across distinct neuronal populations in strikingly different ways. These effects are likely due to the differential regulation of neurons and synapses caused by increasing levels of ACh that enhances cellular excitability by increasing neuronal activity and decreases the efficacy of local synaptic transmission by altering neurotransmitter release probability. We conclude by discussing future directions to refine the biological accuracy of the framework, which will extend its utility and foster the development of hypotheses to investigate the role of neuromodulation in neural information processing.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Serotonin and neuropeptides are both released by the HSN command neuron to initiate C. elegans egg laying</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/323857v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Neurons typically release both a small molecule neurotransmitter and one or more neuropeptides, but how these two types of signal from the same neuron might act together remains largely obscure. For example, serotonergic neurons in mammalian brain express the neuropeptide Substance P, but it is unclear how serotonin signaling might be modulated by a coreleased neuropeptide. We studied this issue in C. elegans, in which all serotonergic neurons express the neuropeptide NLP-3. The serotonergic Hermaphrodite Specific Neurons (HSNs) are command motor neurons within the egg-laying circuit that have previously been shown to release serotonin to initiate egg-laying behavior. We found that egg-laying defects in animals lacking serotonin were far milder than in animals lacking HSNs, suggesting that HSNs must release other signal(s) in addition to serotonin to stimulate egg laying. While null mutants for nlp-3 had only mild egg-laying defects, animals lacking both serotonin and NLP-3 had severe defects, like those of animals lacking HSNs. Optogenetic activation of HSNs induced egg laying in wild-type animals, or in mutant animals lacking either serotonin or NLP-3, but failed to induce egg laying in animals lacking both. We recorded calcium activity in the egg-laying muscles of animals lacking either serotonin, NLP-3, or both. The single mutants, and to a greater extent the double mutant, showed muscle activity that was uncoordinated and unable to expel eggs, such that the vm2 muscles cells that are direct postsynaptic targets of the HSN failed to contract simultaneously with other egg-laying muscle cells. Our results show that the HSN neurons use serotonin and the neuropeptide NLP-3 as partially redundant cotransmitters that together stimulate and coordinate activity of the target cells onto which they are released.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/323774v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Remembering information from continuous past episodes is a complex task. On the one hand, we must be able to recall events in a highly accurate way that often includes exact timing; on the other hand, we can ignore irrelevant details and skip to events of interest. We here track continuous episodes, consisting of different sub-events, as they are recalled from memory. In behavioral and MEG data, we show that memory replay is temporally compressed and proceeds in a forward direction. Neural replay is characterized by the reinstatement of temporal patterns from encoding. These fragments of activity reappear on a compressed timescale. Herein, the replay of sub-events takes longer than the transition from one sub-event to another. This identifies episodic memory replay as a dynamic process in which participants replay fragments of fine-grained temporal patterns and are able to skip flexibly across sub-events.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/323741v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Primary visual cortex is considered to be resilient to plastic changes in adults - particularly ocular dominance, which appears to be hard-wired after the end of the critical period. We show that short-term (2h) monocular deprivation unexpectedly shifts ocular dominance in favor of the deprived eye: contrary to common belief. The plastic response of V1 (measured with 7T fMRI) consists of a homeostatic increase of the deprived-eye BOLD response, a shift of V1 ocular dominance and a decrease of spatial frequency selectivity for the deprived eye. These effects reliably predict the robust perceptual changes induced by deprivation at the individual participant level. Our results indicate that primary visual cortex retains a high potential for homeostatic plasticity in the human adult.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Specifying a causal role for angular gyrus in autobiographical memory</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/323733v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Considerable recent evidence indicates that angular gyrus dysfunction does not result in amnesia, but does impair a number of aspects of episodic memory. Patients with parietal lobe lesions have been reported to exhibit a deficit when freely recalling autobiographical events from their pasts, but can remember details of the events when recall is cued by specific questions. In apparent contradiction, inhibitory brain stimulation targeting angular gyrus in healthy volunteers has been found to have no effect on free recall or cued recall of word pairs. The present study sought to resolve this inconsistency by testing free and cued recall of both autobiographical memories and word pair memories in the same healthy participants following continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) of angular gyrus and a vertex control location. Angular gyrus cTBS resulted in a selective reduction in the free recall but not cued recall of autobiographical memories, whereas free and cued recall of word pair memories were unaffected. Additionally, participants reported fewer autobiographical episodes as being experienced from a first-person perspective following angular gyrus cTBS. The findings add to a growing body of evidence that a function of angular gyrus within the network of brain regions responsible for episodic recollection is to integrate memory features within an egocentric framework into the kind of first-person perspective representation that enables the subjective experience of remembering events from our personal pasts.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/323550v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In this work, we address the neuronal encoding problem from a Bayesian perspective. Specifically, we ask whether neuronal responses in an in vitro neuronal network are consistent with ideal Bayesian observer responses under the free energy principle. In brief, we stimulated an in vitro cortical cell culture with stimulus trains that had a known statistical structure. We then asked whether recorded neuronal responses were consistent with variational message passing (i.e., belief propagation) based upon free energy minimisation (i.e., evidence maximisation). Effectively, this required us to solve two problems: first, we had to formulate the Bayes-optimal encoding of the causes or sources of sensory stimulation, and then show that these idealised responses could account for observed electrophysiological responses. We describe a simulation of an optimal neural network (i.e., the ideal Bayesian neural code) and then consider the mapping from idealised in silico responses to recorded in vitro responses. Our objective was to find evidence for functional specialisation and segregation in the in vitro neural network that reproduced in silico learning via free energy minimisation. Finally, we combined the in vitro and in silico results to characterise learning in terms of trajectories in a variational information plane of accuracy and complexity.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Prefrontal co-expression of schizophrenia risk genes is associated with treatment response in patients</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/323428v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Gene co-expression networks are relevant to functional and clinical translation of schizophrenia (SCZ) risk genes. We hypothesized that SCZ risk genes may converge into co-expression pathways which may be associated with gene regulation mechanisms and with response to treatment in patients with SCZ. We identified gene co-expression networks in two prefrontal cortex post-mortem RNA sequencing datasets (total N=688) and replicated them in four more datasets (total N=227). We identified and replicated (all p-values&amp;lt;.001) a single module enriched for SCZ risk loci (13 risk genes in 10 loci). In silico screening of potential regulators of the SCZ risk module via bioinformatic analyses identified two transcription factors and three miRNAs associated with the risk module. To translate post-mortem information into clinical phenotypes, we identified polymorphisms predicting co-expression and combined them to obtain an index approximating module co-expression (Polygenic Co-expression Index: PCI). The PCI-co-expression association was successfully replicated in two independent brain transcriptome datasets (total N=131; all p-values&amp;lt;.05). Finally, we tested the association between the PCI and short-term treatment response in two independent samples of patients with SCZ treated with olanzapine (total N=167). The PCI was associated with treatment response in the positive symptom domain in both clinical cohorts (all p-values&amp;lt;.05). In summary, our findings in a large sample of human post-mortem prefrontal cortex show that co-expression of a set of genes enriched for schizophrenia risk genes is relevant to treatment response. This co-expression pathway may be co-regulated by transcription factors and miRNA associated with it.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/323345v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Reward-related stimuli can potently influence behaviour; for example, exposure to drug-paired cues can trigger drug use and relapse in people with addictions. Psychological mechanisms that generate such outcomes likely include cue-induced cravings and attentional biases. Recent animal data suggest another candidate mechanism: reward-paired cues can enhance risky decision making, yet whether this translates to humans is unknown. Here, we examined whether sensory reward-paired cues alter decision making under uncertainty and risk, as measured respectively by the Iowa Gambling Task and a two-choice lottery task we refer to as the Vancouver Gambling Task. In the cued version of both tasks, gain feedback was augmented with reward-concurrent audiovisual stimuli. Healthy community volunteers (53 males, 78 females) performed each task once, one with and the other without cues (cued IGT/uncued VGT: n = 63; uncued IGT/cued VGT: n = 68), with concurrent eye-tracking. Reward-paired cues did not affect choice on the Iowa Gambling Task. On the Vancouver Gambling Task, the cued group displayed riskier choice and reduced sensitivity to probability information. The cued condition was associated with reduced eye fixations on probability information shown on the screen and greater pupil dilation related to decision and reward anticipation. This putatively noradrenergic pupil effect was unrelated to the risk-promoting effects of cues: the degree of pupil dilation for risky versus risk-averse choices did not differ as a function of cues. Taken together, our data show that sensory reward cues promote riskier decisions and have additional and distinct effects on noradrenaline-mediated arousal and/ or control states.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Quasi-periodic patterns contribute to functional connectivity in the brain</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/323162v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Functional connectivity is widely used to study the coordination of activity between brain regions over time. Functional connectivity in the default mode and task positive networks is particularly important for normal brain function. However, the processes that give rise to functional connectivity in the brain are not fully understood. It has been postulated that low-frequency neural activity plays a key role in establishing the functional architecture of the brain. Quasi-periodic patterns (QPPs) are a reliably observable form of low-frequency neural activity that involve the default mode and task positive networks. Here, QPPs from resting-state and working memory task-performing individuals were acquired. The spatial pattern and the temporal frequency of the QPPs between the two groups was compared and their contribution to functional connectivity in the brain was measured. In task-performing individuals, the spatial pattern of the QPP changes, particularly in task-relevant regions; and the QPP tends to occur with greater strength and frequency. Differences in the QPPs between the two groups could partially account for the variance in functional connectivity between resting-state and task-performing individuals. The QPPs contribute strongly to connectivity in the default mode and task positive networks and to the degree of anti-correlation seen between the two networks. Many of the connections affected by QPPs are also disrupted during several neurological disorders. These findings help towards understanding the dynamic neural processes that give rise to functional connectivity in the brain and how they may be disrupted during disease.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Accurate autocorrelation modeling substantially improves fMRI reliability</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/323154v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Given the recent controversies in some neuroimaging statistical methods, we compared the most frequently used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) analysis packages: AFNI, FSL and SPM, with regard to temporal autocorrelation modeling. This process, sometimes known as pre-whitening, is conducted in virtually all task fMRI studies. We employed eleven datasets containing 980 scans corresponding to different fMRI protocols and subject populations. Though autocorrelation modeling in AFNI was not perfect, its performance was much higher than the performance of autocorrelation modeling in FSL and SPM. The residual autocorrelated noise in FSL and SPM led to heavily confounded first level results, particularly for low-frequency experimental designs. Also, we observed very severe problems for scans with short repetition times. The resulting false positives and false negatives can be expected to propagate to the group level, especially if the group analysis is performed with a mixed effects model. Our results show superior performance of SPM's alternative pre-whitening: FAST, over the default SPM's method. The reliability of task fMRI studies would increase with more accurate autocorrelation modeling. Furthermore, reliability could increase if the analysis packages provided diagnostic plots. This way the investigator would be aware of residual autocorrelated noise in the GLM residuals. We provide a MATLAB script for the fMRI researchers to check if their analyses might be affected by imperfect pre-whitening.</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: PICK1-Deficient Mice Exhibit Impaired Response to Cocaine and Dysregulated Dopamine Homeostasis</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0422-17.2018v2?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Protein Interacting with C-Kinase 1 (PICK1) is a widely expressed scaffold protein known to interact via its PDZ domain with several membrane proteins including the dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT), the primary target for cocaine’s reinforcing actions. Here, we establish the importance of PICK1 for behavioral effects observed after both acute and repeated administration of cocaine. In PICK1 knockout (KO) mice, the acute locomotor response to a single injection of cocaine was markedly attenuated. Moreover, in support of a role for PICK1 in neuroadaptive changes induced by cocaine, we observed diminished cocaine intake in a self-administration paradigm. Reduced behavioral effects of cocaine were not associated with decreased striatal DAT distribution and most likely not caused by the ~30% reduction in synaptosomal DA uptake observed in PICK1 KO mice. The PICK1 KO mice demonstrated preserved behavioral responses to DA receptor agonists supporting intact downstream DA receptor signaling. Unexpectedly, we found a prominent increase in striatal DA content and levels of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in PICK1 KO mice. Chronoamperometric recordings showed enhanced DA release in PICK1 KO mice, consistent with increased striatal DA pools. Viral-mediated knockdown of PICK1 in cultured dopaminergic neurons increased TH expression, supporting a direct cellular effect of PICK1. In summary, in addition to demonstrating a key role of PICK1 in mediating behavioral effects of cocaine, our data reveal a so far unappreciated role of PICK1 in DA homeostasis that possibly involves negative regulation of striatal TH levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Cocaine addiction is a major societal problem and better treatments are needed. We demonstrate here the importance of the PDZ-domain scaffold protein PICK1 for both the acute reinforcing effects of cocaine and the long-term behavioral changes seen on repeated cocaine exposure. Interestingly, our data suggest that these alterations are independent of PICK1 binding to the primary target of cocaine, DAT. Moreover, our study reveals a novel role of PICK1 in maintenance of DA homeostasis that involves negative regulation of the levels of striatal TH, the rate-limiting enzyme in DA synthesis. Summarized, these data provide an important framework for further exploring the role of PICK1 in addiction and as putative target for treatment of psychostimulant abuse.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05303</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurofeedback is a form of brain training in which subjects are fed back
information about some measure of their brain activity which they are
instructed to modify in a way thought to be functionally advantageous. Over the
last twenty years, NF has been used to treat various neurological and
psychiatric conditions, and to improve cognitive function in various contexts.
However, despite its growing popularity, each of the main steps in NF comes
with its own set of often covert assumptions. Here we critically examine some
conceptual and methodological issues associated with the way general objectives
and neural targets of NF are defined, and review the neural mechanisms through
which NF may act, and the way its efficacy is gauged. The NF process is
characterised in terms of functional dynamics, and possible ways in which it
may be controlled are discussed. Finally, it is proposed that improving NF will
require better understanding of various fundamental aspects of brain dynamics
and a more precise definition of functional brain activity and brain-behaviour
relationships.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A Deep Learning Approach with an Attention Mechanism for Automatic Sleep Stage Classification. (arXiv:1805.05036v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05036</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Automatic sleep staging is a challenging problem and state-of-the-art
algorithms have not yet reached satisfactory performance to be used instead of
manual scoring by a sleep technician. Much research has been done to find good
feature representations that extract the useful information to correctly
classify each epoch into the correct sleep stage. While many useful features
have been discovered, the amount of features have grown to an extent that a
feature reduction step is necessary in order to avoid the curse of
dimensionality. One reason for the need of such a large feature set is that
many features are good for discriminating only one of the sleep stages and are
less informative during other stages. This paper explores how a second feature
representation over a large set of pre-defined features can be learned using an
auto-encoder with a selective attention for the current sleep stage in the
training batch. This selective attention allows the model to learn feature
representations that focuses on the more relevant inputs without having to
perform any dimensionality reduction of the input data. The performance of the
proposed algorithm is evaluated on a large data set of polysomnography (PSG)
night recordings of patients with sleep-disordered breathing. The performance
of the auto-encoder with selective attention is compared with a regular
auto-encoder and previous works using a deep belief network (DBN).

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04975</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Development of a mesoscale neural circuitry map of the common marmoset is an
essential task due to the ideal characteristics of the marmoset as a model
organism for neuroscience research. To facilitate this development there is a
need for new computational tools to cross-register multi-modal data sets
containing MRI volumes as well as multiple histological series, and to register
the combined data set to a common reference atlas. We present a fully automatic
pipeline for same-subject-MRI guided reconstruction of image volumes from a
series of histological sections of different modalities, followed by
diffeomorphic mapping to a reference atlas. We show registration results for
Nissl, myelin, CTB, and fluorescent tracer images using a same-subject ex-vivo
MRI as our reference and show that our method achieves accurate registration
and eliminates artifactual warping that may be result from the absence of a
reference MRI data set. Examination of the determinant of the local metric
tensor of the diffeomorphic mapping between each subject's ex-vivo MRI and
resultant Nissl reconstruction allows an unprecedented local quantification of
geometrical distortions resulting from the histological processing, showing a
slight shrinkage, a median linear scale change of ~-1% in going from the
ex-vivo MRI to the tape-transfer generated histological image data.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Category learning can alter perception and its neural correlates. (arXiv:1805.04619v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04619</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Learned Categorical Perception (CP) occurs when the members of different
categories come to look more dissimilar (between-category separation) and/or
members of the same category come to look more similar (within-category
compression) after a new category has been learned. To measure learned CP and
its physiological correlates we compared dissimilarity judgments and Event
Related Potentials (ERPs) before and after learning to sort multi-featured
visual textures into two categories by trial and error with corrective
feedback. With the same frequency of trials and feedback, about half the
participants succeeded in learning the categories (learners: criterion 80%
accuracy) and the rest did not (non-learners). The lower the proportion of
features distinguishing category members from non-members (i.e., greater
difficulty), the fewer the learners and the more trials it took them to learn.
At both lower and higher levels of difficulty, successful learners showed
significant between-category separation in pairwise dissimilarity judgments
after learning compared to before; their late parietal ERP positivity (LPC,
usually interpreted as decisional) also increased and their occipital
negativity (N1) (usually interpreted as perceptual) decreased. The LPC of
learners increased with response accuracy whereas their N1 amplitude after
learning increased with between-category separation. Non-learners showed no
significant changes in dissimilarity judgments, LPC or N1, within or between
categories. This is behavioral and physiological evidence that category
learning can alter perception. We sketch a neural net model for this effect.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Goal: Limited-channel EEG research in neonates is hindered by lack of open,
accessible analytic tools. To overcome this limitation, we have created the
Washington University- Neonatal EEG Analysis Toolbox (WU-NEAT), containing two
of the most commonly used tools, provided in an open-source,
clinically-validated package running within MATLAB. Methods: The first
algorithm is the amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG), which is generated by
filtering, rectifying and time-compressing the original EEG recording, with
subsequent semi-logarithmic display. The second algorithm is the spectral edge
frequency (SEF), calculated as the critical frequency below which a user-
defined proportion of the EEG spectral power is located. The aEEG algorithm was
validated by three experienced reviewers. Reviewers evaluated aEEG recordings
of fourteen preterm/term infants, displayed twice in random order, once using a
reference algorithm and again using the WU-NEAT aEEG algorithm. Using standard
methodology, reviewers assigned a background pattern classification.
Inter/intra-rater reliability was assessed. For the SEF, calculations were made
using the same fourteen recordings, first with the reference and then with the
WU-NEAT algorithm. Results were compared using Pearson's correlation
coefficient. Results: For the aEEG algorithm, intra- and inter-rater
reliability was 100% and 98%, respectively. For the SEF, the mean (SD) Pearson
correlation coefficient between algorithms was 0.96 (0.04). Conclusion: We have
demonstrated a clinically-validated toolbox for generating the aEEG as well as
calculating the SEF from EEG data. Open-source access will enable widespread
use of common analytic algorithms which are device-independent and not subject
to obsolescence, thereby facilitating future collaborative research in neonatal
EEG.

A common goal in data-analysis is to sift through a large data-matrix and detect any significant submatrices (i.e., biclusters) that have a low numerical rank. We present a simple algorithm for tackling this biclustering problem. Our algorithm accumulates information about 2-by-2 submatrices (i.e., ‘loops’) within the data-matrix, and focuses on rows and columns of the data-matrix that participate in an abundance of low-rank loops. We demonstrate, through analysis and numerical-experiments, that this loop-counting method performs well in a variety of scenarios, outperforming simple spectral methods in many situations of interest. Another important feature of our method is that it can easily be modified to account for aspects of experimental design which commonly arise in practice. For example, our algorithm can be modified to correct for controls, categorical- and continuous-covariates, as well as sparsity within the data. We demonstrate these practical features with two examples; the first drawn from gene-expression analysis and the second drawn from a much larger genome-wide-association-study (GWAS).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MbY469xyEU0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: RNA from Trained Aplysia Can Induce an Epigenetic Engram for Long-Term Sensitization in Untrained Aplysia</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0038-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The precise nature of the engram, the physical substrate of memory, remains uncertain. Here, it is reported that RNA extracted from the central nervous system of &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt; given long-term sensitization training induced sensitization when injected into untrained animals; furthermore, the RNA-induced sensitization, like training-induced sensitization, required DNA methylation. In cellular experiments, treatment with RNA extracted from trained animals was found to increase excitability in sensory neurons, but not in motor neurons, dissociated from naïve animals. Thus, the behavioral, and a subset of the cellular, modifications characteristic of a form of nonassociative long-term memory in &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt; can be transferred by RNA. These results indicate that RNA is sufficient to generate an engram for long-term sensitization in &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt; and are consistent with the hypothesis that RNA-induced epigenetic changes underlie memory storage in &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; It is generally accepted that long-term memory (LTM) is encoded as alterations in synaptic strength. An alternative model, however, proposes that LTM is encoded by epigenetic changes. Non-coding RNAs can mediate epigenetic modifications. Therefore, RNA from a trained animal might be capable of producing learning-like behavioral change in an untrained animal. Here, it is demonstrated that the memory for long-term sensitization in the marine mollusk &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt; can be successfully transferred by injecting RNA from sensitized into naïve animals. Moreover, a specific cellular alteration that underlies sensitization in &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt;, sensory neuron hyperexcitability, can be reproduced by exposing sensory neurons &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; to RNA from trained animals. The results provide support for a nonsynaptic, epigenetic model of memory storage in &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: PICK1-Deficient Mice Exhibit Impaired Response to Cocaine and Dysregulated Dopamine Homeostasis</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0422-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Protein Interacting with C-Kinase 1 (PICK1) is a widely expressed scaffold protein known to interact via its PDZ domain with several membrane proteins including the dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT), the primary target for cocaine’s reinforcing actions. Here, we establish the importance of PICK1 for behavioral effects observed after both acute and repeated administration of cocaine. In PICK1 knockout (KO) mice, the acute locomotor response to a single injection of cocaine was markedly attenuated. Moreover, in support of a role for PICK1 in neuroadaptive changes induced by cocaine, we observed diminished cocaine intake in a self-administration paradigm. Reduced behavioral effects of cocaine were not associated with decreased striatal DAT distribution and most likely not caused by the ~30% reduction in synaptosomal DA uptake observed in PICK1 KO mice. The PICK1 KO mice demonstrated preserved behavioral responses to DA receptor agonists supporting intact downstream DA receptor signaling. Unexpectedly, we found a prominent increase in striatal DA content and levels of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in PICK1 KO mice. Chronoamperometric recordings showed enhanced DA release in PICK1 KO mice, consistent with increased striatal DA pools. Viral-mediated knockdown of PICK1 in cultured dopaminergic neurons increased TH expression, supporting a direct cellular effect of PICK1. In summary, in addition to demonstrating a key role of PICK1 in mediating behavioral effects of cocaine, our data reveal a so far unappreciated role of PICK1 in DA homeostasis that possibly involves negative regulation of striatal TH levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Cocaine addiction is a major societal problem and better treatments are needed. We demonstrate here the importance of the PDZ-domain scaffold protein PICK1 for both the acute reinforcing effects of cocaine and the long-term behavioral changes seen on repeated cocaine exposure. Interestingly, our data suggest that these alterations are independent of PICK1 binding to the primary target of cocaine, DAT. Moreover, our study reveals a novel role of PICK1 in maintenance of DA homeostasis that involves negative regulation of the levels of striatal TH, the rate-limiting enzyme in DA synthesis. Summarized, these data provide an important framework for further exploring the role of PICK1 in addiction and as putative target for treatment of psychostimulant abuse.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04455</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;One of the main challenges in Biophysics teaching consists on how to motivate
students to appreciate the beauty of theoretical formulations. This is crucial
when the system modeling requires numerical calculations to achieve realistic
results. In this sense, due to the massive use of software, students often
become a mere users of computational tools without capturing the essence of
formulation and further problem solution. It is, therefore, necessary for
instructors to find innovating ways, allowing students developing of their
ability to deal with mathematical modelling. To address this issue one can
highlight the use of Benford's law, thanks to its simple formulation, easy
computational implementation and wide possibility for applications. Indeed,
this law enables students to carry out their own data analysis with use of free
software packages. This law is among the several power or scaling laws found in
biological systems. However, to the best of our knowledge, this law has not
been contemplated in Cell Biophysics yet. Beyond its vast applications in many
fields, neuromuscular junction represents a remarkable substrate for learning
and teaching of complex system. Thus, in this work, we applied both classical
and a generalized form of Benford's Law, to examine if electrophysiological
data recorded from neuromuscular junction conforms the anomalous number law.
The results indicated that nerve-muscle communications conform the generalized
Benford's law better than the seminal formulation. From our
electrophysiological measurements a biological scenario is used to interpret
the theoretical analysis.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04329</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Modularity plays an important role in brain networks' architecture and
influences its dynamics and the ability to integrate and segregate different
modules of cerebral regions. Alterations in community structure are associated
with several clinical disorders, specially schizophrenia, although its time
evolution is not clear yet. In the present work, we analyze fMRI functional
networks of $65$ healthy subjects (HC) and $44$ patients of schizophrenia (SZ),
$28$ of them in a chronic state (CR) of illness, and $16$ at early stage (ES).
We find clear differences in edges' weights distribution, networks density,
community structure consistency and robustness against edge removal. In
comparison to healthy subjects, we found that networks from SZ patients
exhibits wider weight distribution, larger overall connectivity, and are more
consistent in the community structure across subjects. We also showed that the
networks of SZ patients tend to be more robust to edge removal than healthy
subjects, while having lower network density. In the case of early stages
patients, we found that their networks exhibit topological features
consistently in between the ones obtained from the other two groups, resulting
in a tendency towards the chronic group state.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: On the Classification of SSVEP-Based Dry-EEG Signals via Convolutional Neural Networks. (arXiv:1805.04157v1 [cs.HC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04157</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we propose a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach
for the classification of raw dry-EEG signals without any data pre-processing.
To illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, we utilise the Steady State
Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) paradigm as our use case. SSVEP can be utilised
to allow people with severe physical disabilities such as Complete Locked-In
Syndrome or Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis to be aided via BCI applications, as
it requires only the subject to fixate upon the sensory stimuli of interest.
Here we utilise SSVEP flicker frequencies between 10 to 30 Hz, which we record
as subject cortical waveforms via the dry-EEG headset. Our proposed end-to-end
CNN allows us to automatically and accurately classify SSVEP stimulation
directly from the dry-EEG waveforms. Our CNN architecture utilises a common
SSVEP Convolutional Unit (SCU), comprising of a 1D convolutional layer, batch
normalization and max pooling. Furthermore, we compare several deep learning
neural network variants with our primary CNN architecture, in addition to
traditional machine learning classification approaches. Experimental evaluation
shows our CNN architecture to be significantly better than competing
approaches, achieving a classification accuracy of 96% whilst demonstrating
superior cross-subject performance and even being able to generalise well to
unseen subjects whose data is entirely absent from the training process.

	<title>RSS PAP: Dbx1 Pre-Bötzinger Complex Interneurons Comprise the Core Inspiratory Oscillator for Breathing in Unanesthetized Adult Mice</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0130-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The brainstem pre-Bötzinger complex (preBötC) generates inspiratory breathing rhythms, but which neurons comprise its rhythmogenic core? Dbx1-derived neurons may play the preeminent role in rhythm generation, an idea well founded at perinatal stages of development but incompletely evaluated in adulthood. We expressed archaerhodopsin or channelrhodopsin in Dbx1 preBötC neurons in intact adult mice to interrogate their function. Prolonged photoinhibition slowed down or stopped breathing, whereas prolonged photostimulation sped up breathing. Brief inspiratory-phase photoinhibition evoked the next breath earlier than expected, whereas brief expiratory-phase photoinhibition delayed the subsequent breath. Conversely, brief inspiratory-phase photostimulation increased inspiratory duration and delayed the subsequent breath, whereas brief expiratory-phase photostimulation evoked the next breath earlier than expected. Because they govern the frequency and precise timing of breaths in awake adult mice with sensorimotor feedback intact, Dbx1 preBötC neurons constitute an essential core component of the inspiratory oscillator, knowledge directly relevant to human health and physiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Breathing behavior depends on rhythmic movements. The underlying neural rhythm for inspiration may originate due to brainstem interneurons defined genetically by expression of the embryonic transcription factor Dbx1. Dbx1-derived neurons comprise the core oscillator microcircuit in perinatal mice, but they serve other functions too, and their inspiratory rhythmogenic role has not been conclusively tested in adults. Optogenetic photostimulation and photoinhibition of Dbx1-derived brainstem neurons in intact adult mice modulated breathing, either speeding it up, slowing it down to the point of apnea (no breathing), or perturbing its phase, which are functions consistent with the rhythm generator. These results establish the cellular point of origin for breathing rhythm, a key physiologic brain function in humans and all mammals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0098-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Inverted encoding models (IEMs) are a powerful tool for reconstructing population-level stimulus representations from aggregate measurements of neural activity (e.g., fMRI or EEG). In a recent report, Liu et al., (2018) tested whether IEMs can provide information about the underlying tuning of &lt;i&gt;single units&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we argue that using stimulus reconstructions to infer properties of single neurons, such as neural tuning bandwidth, is an ill-posed problem with no unambiguous solution. Instead of interpreting results from these methods as evidence about single-unit tuning, we emphasize the utility of these methods for assaying &lt;i&gt;population-level&lt;/i&gt; stimulus representations. These can be compared across task conditions to better constrain theories of large-scale neural information processing across experimental manipulations, such as changing sensory input or attention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03933</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Symbolic methods of analysis are valuable tools for investigating complex
time-dependent signals. In particular, the ordinal method defines sequences of
symbols according to the ordering in which values appear in a time series. This
method has been shown to yield useful information, even when applied to signals
with large noise contamination. Here we use ordinal analysis to investigate the
transition between eyes closed (EC) and eyes open (EO) resting states. We
analyze two {EEG} datasets (with 71 and 109 healthy subjects) with different
recording conditions (sampling rates and the number of electrodes in the
scalp). Using as diagnostic tools the permutation entropy, the entropy computed
from symbolic transition probabilities, and an asymmetry coefficient (that
measures the asymmetry of the likelihood of the transitions between symbols) we
show that ordinal analysis applied to the raw data distinguishes the two brain
states. In both datasets, we find that the EO state is characterized by higher
entropies and lower asymmetry coefficient, as compared to the EC state. Our
results thus show that these diagnostic tools have the potential for detecting
and characterizing changes in time-evolving brain states.

binary neurons as a function of a network's level of dilution and asymmetry.
The network dilution measures the fraction of neuron couples that are
connected, and the network asymmetry measures to what extent the underlying
connectivity matrix is asymmetric. For each given neural network, we study the
dynamical evolution of all the different initial conditions, thus
characterizing the full dynamical landscape without imposing any learning rule.
Because of the deterministic dynamics, each trajectory converges to an
attractor, that can be either a fixed point or a limit cycle. These attractors
form the set of all the possible limit behaviors of the neural network. For
each network, we then determine the convergence times, the limit cycles'
length, the number of attractors, and the sizes of the attractors' basin. We
show that there are two network structures that maximize the number of possible
limit behaviors. The first optimal network structure is fully-connected and
symmetric. On the contrary, the second optimal network structure is highly
sparse and asymmetric. The latter optimal is similar to what observed in
different biological neuronal circuits. These observations lead us to
hypothesize that independently from any given learning model, an efficient and
effective biologic network that stores a number of limit behaviors close to its
maximum capacity tends to develop a connectivity structure similar to one of
the optimal networks we found.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Impact of axonal delay on structure development in a Linsker type network. (arXiv:1805.03792v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03792</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In his seminal, three paper series, Linsker provided a mechanism for how
random activity in the visual pathway could give rise to many of the features
observed experimentally in the early stages of visual processing. Owing to the
complexity of multilayer models, an implicit assumption in Linsker's and
subsequent papers has been that propagation delay is homogeneous and,
consequently, plays little functional role in neural behaviour. In this paper,
we relax this assumption to examine the impact of axonal distance dependent
propagation delay on neural learning. We show that propagation delay induces
lowpass filtering by dispersing the arrival times of spikes from presynaptic
neurons, providing a natural correlation cancellation mechanism for distal
connections. The cutoff frequency decreases as the radial propagation delay
within a layer, relative to propagation delay between the layers, increases,
introducing an upper limit on temporal resolution. Given that the postsynaptic
potential also acts as a lowpass filter, we show that the effective time
constant of each should enable the processing of similar scales of temporal
information. This result has implications for the visual system, in which
receptive field size and, thus, radial propagation delay, increases with
eccentricity. Furthermore, the network response is frequency dependent since
higher frequencies require increased input amplitude to compensate for
attenuation. This concords with frequency dependent contrast sensitivity in the
visual system, which changes with eccentricity and receptive field size.
Finally, we determine the eigenfunctions of both Linsker's network, and the
network with propagation delay. We show that the addition of propagation delay
stabilizes the leading eigenfunction to changes in homeostatic parameters, and
hence stabilizes the resulting receptive field structure.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Previous work by Linsker revealed how simple cells can emerge in the absence
of structured environmental input, via a selforganisation learning process. He
empirically showed the development of spatial-opponent cells driven only by
input noise, emerging as a result of structure in the initial synaptic
connectivity distribution. To date, a complete set of radial eigenfunctions
have not been provided for this multi-layer network. In this paper, the
complete set of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues for a three-layered network is
for the first time analytically derived. Initially a simplified learning
equation is considered for which the homeostatic parameters are set to zero. To
extend the eigenfunction analysis to the full learning equation, including
non-zero homeostatic parameters, a perturbation analysis is used.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: How stimulation frequency and intensity impact on the long-lasting effects of coordinated reset stimulation</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/rx9Yjw7JXhk/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Thanos Manos, Magteld Zeitler, Peter A. Tass&lt;/p&gt;

Several brain diseases are characterized by abnormally strong neuronal synchrony. Coordinated Reset (CR) stimulation was computationally designed to specifically counteract abnormal neuronal synchronization processes by desynchronization. In the presence of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) this may lead to a decrease of synaptic excitatory weights and ultimately to an anti-kindling, i.e. unlearning of abnormal synaptic connectivity and abnormal neuronal synchrony. The long-lasting desynchronizing impact of CR stimulation has been verified in pre-clinical and clinical proof of concept studies. However, as yet it is unclear how to optimally choose the CR stimulation frequency, i.e. the repetition rate at which the CR stimuli are delivered. This work presents the first computational study on the dependence of the acute and long-term outcome on the CR stimulation frequency in neuronal networks with STDP. For this purpose, CR stimulation was applied with Rapidly Varying Sequences (RVS) as well as with Slowly Varying Sequences (SVS) in a wide range of stimulation frequencies and intensities. Our findings demonstrate that acute desynchronization, achieved during stimulation, does not necessarily lead to long-term desynchronization after cessation of stimulation. By comparing the long-term effects of the two different CR protocols, the RVS CR stimulation turned out to be more robust against variations of the stimulation frequency. However, SVS CR stimulation can obtain stronger anti-kindling effects. We revealed specific parameter ranges that are favorable for long-term desynchronization. For instance, RVS CR stimulation at weak intensities and with stimulation frequencies in the range of the neuronal firing rates turned out to be effective and robust, in particular, if no closed loop adaptation of stimulation parameters is (technically) available. From a clinical standpoint, this may be relevant in the context of both invasive as well as non-invasive CR stimulation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rx9Yjw7JXhk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

To cooperatively carry large food items to the nest, individual ants conform their efforts and coordinate their motion. Throughout this expedition, collective motion is driven both by internal interactions between the carrying ants and a response to newly arrived informed ants that orient the cargo towards the nest. During the transport process, the carrying group must overcome obstacles that block their path to the nest. Here, we investigate the dynamics of cooperative transport, when the motion of the ants is frustrated by a linear obstacle that obstructs the motion of the cargo. The obstacle contains a narrow opening that serves as the only available passage to the nest, and through which single ants can pass but not with the cargo. We provide an analytical model for the ant-cargo system in the constrained environment that predicts a bi-stable dynamic behavior between an oscillatory mode of motion along the obstacle and a convergent mode of motion near the opening. Using both experiments and simulations, we show how for small cargo sizes, the system exhibits spontaneous transitions between these two modes of motion due to fluctuations in the applied force on the cargo. The bi-stability provides two possible problem solving strategies for overcoming the obstacle, either by attempting to pass through the opening, or take large excursions to circumvent the obstacle.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jPqnVrYLq7g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The field of neuroimaging is rapidly adopting a more reproducible approach to data acquisition and analysis. Data structures and formats are being standardised and data analyses are getting more automated. However, as data analysis becomes more complicated, researchers often have to write longer analysis scripts, spanning different tools across multiple programming languages. This makes it more difficult to share or recreate code, reducing the reproducibility of the analysis. We present a tool, Porcupine, that constructs one’s analysis visually and automatically produces analysis code. The graphical representation improves understanding of the performed analysis, while retaining the flexibility of modifying the produced code manually to custom needs. Not only does Porcupine produce the analysis code, it also creates a shareable environment for running the code in the form of a Docker image. Together, this forms a reproducible way of constructing, visualising and sharing one’s analysis. Currently, Porcupine links to Nipype functionalities, which in turn accesses most standard neuroimaging analysis tools. Our goal is to release researchers from the constraints of specific implementation details, thereby freeing them to think about novel and creative ways to solve a given problem. Porcupine improves the overview researchers have of their processing pipelines, and facilitates both the development and communication of their work. This will reduce the threshold at which less expert users can generate reusable pipelines. With Porcupine, we bridge the gap between a conceptual and an implementational level of analysis and make it easier for researchers to create reproducible and shareable science. We provide a wide range of examples and documentation, as well as installer files for all platforms on our website: https://timvanmourik.github.io/Porcupine. Porcupine is free, open source, and released under the GNU General Public License v3.0.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OPful2fUMb8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Retina is a paradigmatic system for studying sensory encoding: the transformation of light into spiking activity of ganglion cells. The inverse problem, where stimulus is reconstructed from spikes, has received less attention, especially for complex stimuli that should be reconstructed “pixel-by-pixel”. We recorded around a hundred neurons from a dense patch in a rat retina and decoded movies of multiple small randomly-moving discs. We constructed nonlinear (kernelized and neural network) decoders that improved significantly over linear results. An important contribution to this was the ability of nonlinear decoders to reliably separate between neural responses driven by locally fluctuating light signals, and responses at locally constant light driven by spontaneous-like activity. This improvement crucially depended on the precise, non-Poisson temporal structure of individual spike trains, which originated in the spike-history dependence of neural responses. We propose a general principle by which downstream circuitry could discriminate between spontaneous and stimulus-driven activity based solely on higher-order statistical structure in the incoming spike trains.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0tROk9h9FSA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

BK virus (BKV) associated nephropathy affects 1–10% of kidney transplant recipients, leading to graft failure in about 50% of cases. Immune responses against different BKV antigens have been shown to have a prognostic value for disease development. Data currently suggest that the structural antigens and regulatory antigens of BKV might each trigger a different mode of action of the immune response. To study the influence of different modes of action of the cellular immune response on BKV clearance dynamics, we have analysed the kinetics of BKV plasma load and anti-BKV T cell response (Elispot) in six patients with BKV associated nephropathy using ODE modelling. The results show that only a small number of hypotheses on the mode of action are compatible with the empirical data. The hypothesis with the highest empirical support is that structural antigens trigger blocking of virus production from infected cells, whereas regulatory antigens trigger an acceleration of death of infected cells. These differential modes of action could be important for our understanding of BKV resolution, as according to the hypothesis, only regulatory antigens would trigger a fast and continuous clearance of the viral load. Other hypotheses showed a lower degree of empirical support, but could potentially explain the clearing mechanisms of individual patients. Our results highlight the heterogeneity of the dynamics, including the delay between immune response against structural versus regulatory antigens, and its relevance for BKV clearance. Our modelling approach is the first that studies the process of BKV clearance by bringing together viral and immune kinetics and can provide a framework for personalised hypotheses generation on the interrelations between cellular immunity and viral dynamics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8poCgXZvMAQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The robustness of the visual system lies in its ability to perceive degraded images. This is achieved through interacting bottom-up, recurrent, and top-down pathways that process the visual input in concordance with stored prior information. The interaction mechanism by which they integrate visual input and prior information is still enigmatic. We present a new approach using deep neural network (DNN) representation to reveal the effects of such integration on degraded visual inputs. We transformed measured human brain activity resulting from viewing blurred images to the hierarchical representation space derived from a feedforward DNN. Transformed representations were found to veer toward the original nonblurred image and away from the blurred stimulus image. This indicated deblurring or sharpening in the neural representation, and possibly in our perception. We anticipate these results will help unravel the interplay mechanism between bottom-up, recurrent, and top-down pathways, leading to more comprehensive models of vision.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Circadian Behavioral Responses to Light and Optic Chiasm-Evoked Glutamatergic EPSCs in the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus of ipRGC Conditional vGlut2 Knock-Out Mice</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/3/ENEURO.0411-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) innervate the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a circadian oscillator that functions as a biological clock. ipRGCs use vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (vGlut2) to package glutamate into synaptic vesicles and light-evoked resetting of the SCN circadian clock is widely attributed to ipRGC glutamatergic neurotransmission. Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is also packaged into vesicles in ipRGCs and PACAP may be coreleased with glutamate in the SCN. vGlut2 has been conditionally deleted in ipRGCs in mice [conditional knock-outs (cKOs)] and their aberrant photoentrainment and residual attenuated light responses have been ascribed to ipRGC PACAP release. However, there is no direct evidence that all ipRGC glutamatergic neurotransmission is eliminated in vGlut2 cKOs. Here, we examined two lines of ipRGC vGlut2 cKO mice for SCN-mediated behavioral responses under several lighting conditions and for ipRGC glutamatergic neurotransmission in the SCN. Circadian behavioral responses varied from a very limited response to light to near normal photoentrainment. After collecting behavioral data, hypothalamic slices were prepared and evoked EPSCs (eEPSCs) were recorded from SCN neurons by stimulating the optic chiasm. In cKOs, glutamatergic eEPSCs were recorded and all eEPSC parameters examined (stimulus threshold, amplitude, rise time or time-to-peak and stimulus strength to evoke a maximal response) were similar to controls. We conclude that a variable number but functionally significant percentage of ipRGCs in two vGlut2 cKO mouse lines continue to release glutamate.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Finite size effects for spiking neural networks with spatially dependent coupling. (arXiv:1805.03601v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03601</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We study finite-size fluctuations in a network of spiking deterministic
neurons coupled with non-uniform synaptic coupling. We generalize a previously
developed theory of finite size effects for uniform globally coupled neurons.
In the uniform case, mean field theory is well defined by averaging over the
network as the number of neurons in the network goes to infinity. However, for
nonuniform coupling it is no longer possible to average over the entire network
if we are interested in fluctuations at a particular location within the
network. We show that if the coupling function approaches a continuous function
in the infinite system size limit then an average over a local neighborhood can
be defined such that mean field theory is well defined for a spatially
dependent field. We then derive a perturbation expansion in the inverse system
size around the mean field limit for the covariance of the input to a neuron
(synaptic drive) and firing rate fluctuations due to dynamical deterministic
finite-size effects.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: From synaptic interactions to collective dynamics in random neuronal networks models: critical role of eigenvectors and transient behavior. (arXiv:1805.03592v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03592</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The study of neuronal interactions is currently at the center of several
neuroscience big collaborative projects (including the Human Connectome, the
Blue Brain, the Brainome, etc.) which attempt to obtain a detailed map of the
entire brain matrix. Under certain constraints, mathematical theory can advance
predictions of the expected neural dynamics based solely on the statistical
properties of such synaptic interaction matrix. This work explores the
application of free random variables (FRV) to the study of large synaptic
interaction matrices. Besides recovering in a straightforward way known results
on eigenspectra of neural networks, we extend them to heavy-tailed
distributions of interactions. More importantly, we derive analytically the
behavior of eigenvector overlaps, which determine stability of the spectra. We
observe that upon imposing the neuronal excitation/inhibition balance, although
the eigenvalues remain unchanged, their stability dramatically decreases due to
strong non-orthogonality of associated eigenvectors. It leads us to the
conclusion that the understanding of the temporal evolution of asymmetric
neural networks requires considering the entangled dynamics of both
eigenvectors and eigenvalues, which might bear consequences for learning and
memory processes in these models. Considering the success of FRV analysis in a
wide variety of branches disciplines, we hope that the results presented here
foster additional application of these ideas in the area of brain sciences.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Multi-scale metrics and self-organizing maps: a computational approach to the structure of sensory maps. (arXiv:1805.03337v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03337</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This paper introduces the concept of a bi-scale metric for use in the
cooperative phase of the self-organizing map (SOM) algorithm. Use of a bi-scale
metric allows segmentation of the map into a number of regions, corresponding
to anticipated cluster structure in the data. Such a situation occurs, for
example, in the somatotopic maps which inspired the SOM algo- rithm, where
clusters of data may correspond to body surface regions whose general structure
is known. When a bi-scale metric is appropriately applied, issues with map
neurons that are not activated by any point in the training data are reduced or
eliminated. The paper also presents results of simulation studies on the
plasticity of bi-scale metric maps when they are retrained af- ter loss of
groups of map neurons or after changes in training data (such as would occur in
a somatotopic map when a body surface region like a finger is lost/removed).
The paper further considers situations where tri-scale met- rics may be useful,
and an alternative approach suggested by neurobiology, where some map regions
adapt more slowly to stimuli because they have a lower learning rate parameter.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Differential Deployment of Visual Attention During Interactive Approach and Avoidance Behavior</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy105/4994603?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The ability to coordinate approach and avoidance actions in dynamic environments represents the boundary between extinction and the continued survival of many animal species. It is therefore crucial that sensory systems allocate limited attentional resources to the most relevant information to facilitate planning and execution of appropriate actions. Prominent theories of how attention regulates visual processing focus on the distinction between behaviorally relevant and irrelevant visual inputs. To date, however, no study has directly compared the deployment of attention to visual inputs relevant for approach and avoidance behaviors, which naturally occur in dynamic, interactive environments. In two experiments, we combined electroencephalography, frequency tagging, and eye gaze measures to investigate whether the deployment of visual selective attention differs for items relevant for approach and avoidance actions. Participants maneuvered a cursor to approach and avoid contact with moving items in a continuous interactive task. The results indicated that while the approach and avoidance tasks recruited equivalent attentional resources overall, attentional biases were directed toward task-relevant items during approach, and away from task-relevant items during avoidance. We conclude that the deployment of visual attention is guided not only by relevance to a behavioral goal, but also by the nature of that goal.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy104/4994602?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Somatosensory inputs to the cortex undergo an early and a later stage of processing which are characterized by an early and a late somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP). The early response is highly representative of the stimulus characteristics whereas the late response reflects a more integrative, task specific, stage of sensory processing. We hypothesized that the later processing stage is independent of the early processing stage. We tested the prediction that a reduction of the first volley of input to the cortex should not prevent the increase of the late SEP. Using the sensory interference phenomenon, we halved the amplitude of the early response to somatosensory input of the ankle joints (evoked by vibration) when participants either planned a step forward or remained still. Despite the initial cortical response to the vibration being massively decreased in both tasks, the late response was still enhanced during step planning. Source localization indicated the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) as the likely origin of the late response modulation. Overall these results support the dissociation between the processes underlying the early and late SEP. The later processing stage could involve both direct and indirect thalamic connections to PPC which bypass the postcentral somatosensory cortex.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/HxEjp5eCvBA/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Gonçalo M. Marques, Starrlight Augustine, Konstadia Lika, Laure Pecquerie, Tiago Domingos, Sebastiaan A. L. M. Kooijman&lt;/p&gt;

We developed new methods for parameter estimation-in-context and, with the help of 125 authors, built the AmP (Add-my-Pet) database of Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) models, parameters and referenced underlying data for animals, where each species constitutes one database entry. The combination of DEB parameters covers all aspects of energetics throughout the full organism’s life cycle, from the start of embryo development to death by aging. The species-specific parameter values capture biodiversity and can now, for the first time, be compared between animals species. An important insight brought by the AmP project is the classification of animal energetics according to a family of related DEB models that is structured on the basis of the mode of metabolic acceleration, which links up with the development of larval stages. We discuss the evolution of metabolism in this context, among animals in general, and ray-finned fish, mollusks and crustaceans in particular. New DEBtool code for estimating DEB parameters from data has been written. AmPtool code for analyzing patterns in parameter values has also been created. A new web-interface supports multiple ways to visualize data, parameters, and implied properties from the entire collection as well as on an entry by entry basis. The DEB models proved to fit data well, the median relative error is only 0.07, for the 1035 animal species at 2018/03/12, including some extinct ones, from all large phyla and all chordate orders, spanning a range of body masses of 16 orders of magnitude. This study is a first step to include evolutionary aspects into parameter estimation, allowing to infer properties of species for which very little is known.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HxEjp5eCvBA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/19/4610?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aging is known as a major risk factor for the structure and function of the nervous system. There is urgent need to overcome such deleterious effects of age-related neurodegeneration. Here we show that peripheral nerves of 24-month-old aging C57BL/6 mice of either sex show similar pathological alterations as nerves from aging human individuals, whereas 12-month-old adult mice lack such alterations. Specifically, nerve fibers showed demyelination, remyelination and axonal lesion. Moreover, in the aging mice, neuromuscular junctions showed features typical for dying-back neuropathies, as revealed by a decline of presynaptic markers, associated with α-bungarotoxin-positive postsynapses. In line with these observations were reduced muscle strengths. These alterations were accompanied by elevated numbers of endoneurial macrophages, partially comprising the features of phagocytosing macrophages. Comparable profiles of macrophages could be identified in peripheral nerve biopsies of aging persons. To determine the pathological impact of macrophages in aging mice, we selectively targeted the cells by applying an orally administered CSF-1R specific kinase (c-FMS) inhibitor. The 6-month-lasting treatment started before development of degenerative changes at 18 months and reduced macrophage numbers in mice by ~70%, without side effects. Strikingly, nerve structure was ameliorated and muscle strength preserved. We show, for the first time, that age-related degenerative changes in peripheral nerves are driven by macrophages. These findings may pave the way for treating degeneration in the aging peripheral nervous system by targeting macrophages, leading to reduced weakness, improved mobility, and eventually increased quality of life in the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Aging is a major risk factor for the structure and function of the nervous system. Here we show that peripheral nerves of 24-month-old aging mice show similar degenerative alterations as nerves from aging human individuals. Both in mice and humans, these alterations were accompanied by endoneurial macrophages. To determine the pathological impact of macrophages in aging mice, we selectively targeted the cells by blocking a cytokine receptor, essential for macrophage survival. The treatment strongly reduced macrophage numbers and substantially improved nerve structure and muscle strength. We show, for the first time, that age-related degenerative changes in peripheral nerves are driven by macrophages. These findings may be helpful for treatment weakness and reduced mobility in the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: RIPK3/MLKL-Mediated Neuronal Necroptosis Modulates the M1/M2 Polarization of Microglia/Macrophages in the Ischemic Cortex</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Cell death and subsequent inflammation are 2 key pathological changes occurring in cerebral ischemia. Active microglia/macrophages play a double-edged role depending on the balance of their M1/M2 phenotypes. Necrosis is the predominant type of cell death following ischemia. However, how necrotic cells modulate the M1/M2 polarization of microglia/macrophages remains poorly investigated. Here, we reported that ischemia induces a rapid RIPK3/MLKL-mediated neuron-dominated necroptosis, a type of programmed necrosis. Ablating RIPK3 or MLKL could switch the activation of microglia/macrophages from M1 to the M2 type in the ischemic cortex. Conditioned medium of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-treated wild-type (WT) neurons induced M1 polarization, while that of RIPK3&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; neurons favored M2 polarization. OGD treatment induces proinflammatory IL-18 and TNFα in WT but not in RIPK3&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; neurons, which in turn upregulate anti-inflammatory IL-4 and IL-10. Furthermore, the expression of Myd88—a common downstream adaptor of toll-like receptors—is significantly upregulated in the microglia/macrophages of ischemic WT but not of RIPK3&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; or MLKL&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; cortices. Antagonizing the function of Myd88 could phenocopy the effects of RIPK3/MLKL-knockout on the polarization of microglia/macrophages and was neuroprotective. Our data revealed a novel role of necroptotic neurons in modulating the M1/M2 balance of microglia/macrophages in the ischemic cortex, possibly through Myd88 signaling.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Cells respond to stressful conditions by coordinating a complex, multi-faceted response that spans many levels of physiology. Much of the response is coordinated by changes in protein phosphorylation. Although the regulators of transcriptome changes during stress are well characterized in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, the upstream regulatory network controlling protein phosphorylation is less well dissected. Here, we developed a computational approach to infer the signaling network that regulates phosphorylation changes in response to salt stress. We developed an approach to link predicted regulators to groups of likely co-regulated phospho-peptides responding to stress, thereby creating new edges in a background protein interaction network. We then use integer linear programming (ILP) to integrate wild type and mutant phospho-proteomic data and predict the network controlling stress-activated phospho-proteomic changes. The network we inferred predicted new regulatory connections between stress-activated and growth-regulating pathways and suggested mechanisms coordinating metabolism, cell-cycle progression, and growth during stress. We confirmed several network predictions with co-immunoprecipitations coupled with mass-spectrometry protein identification and mutant phospho-proteomic analysis. Results show that the cAMP-phosphodiesterase Pde2 physically interacts with many stress-regulated transcription factors targeted by PKA, and that reduced phosphorylation of those factors during stress requires the Rck2 kinase that we show physically interacts with Pde2. Together, our work shows how a high-quality computational network model can facilitate discovery of new pathway interactions during osmotic stress.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sNFhadDEsvQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Neuregulin 1 Type I Overexpression Is Associated with Reduced NMDA Receptor-Mediated Synaptic Signaling in Hippocampal Interneurons Expressing PV or CCK</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/2/ENEURO.0418-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Hypofunction of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in inhibitory GABAergic interneurons is implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (SZ), a heritable disorder with many susceptibility genes. However, it is still unclear how SZ risk genes interfere with NMDAR-mediated synaptic transmission in diverse inhibitory interneuron populations. One putative risk gene is neuregulin 1 (&lt;i&gt;NRG1&lt;/i&gt;), which signals via the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB4, itself a schizophrenia risk gene. The type I isoform of &lt;i&gt;NRG1&lt;/i&gt; shows increased expression in the brain of SZ patients, and ErbB4 is enriched in GABAergic interneurons expressing parvalbumin (PV) or cholecystokinin (CCK). Here, we investigated ErbB4 expression and synaptic transmission in interneuronal populations of the hippocampus of transgenic mice overexpressing NRG1 type I (NRG1&lt;sup&gt;tg-type-I&lt;/sup&gt; mice). Immunohistochemical analyses confirmed that ErbB4 was coexpressed with either PV or CCK in hippocampal interneurons, but we observed a reduced number of ErbB4-immunopositive interneurons in the NRG1&lt;sup&gt;tg-type-I&lt;/sup&gt; mice. NMDAR-mediated currents in interneurons expressing PV (including PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; basket cells) or CCK were reduced in NRG1&lt;sup&gt;tg-type-I&lt;/sup&gt; mice compared to their littermate controls. We found no difference in AMPA receptor–mediated currents. Optogenetic activation (5 pulses at 20 Hz) of local glutamatergic fibers revealed a decreased NMDAR-mediated contribution to disynaptic GABAergic inhibition of pyramidal cells in the NRG1&lt;sup&gt;tg-type-I&lt;/sup&gt; mice. GABAergic synaptic transmission from either PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or CCK&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons, and glutamatergic transmission onto pyramidal cells, did not significantly differ between genotypes. The results indicate that synaptic NMDAR-mediated signaling in hippocampal interneurons is sensitive to chronically elevated NGR1 type I levels. This may contribute to the pathophysiological consequences of increased &lt;i&gt;NRG1&lt;/i&gt; expression in SZ.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Dynamic Encoding of Incentive Salience in the Ventral Pallidum: Dependence on the Form of the Reward Cue</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/2/ENEURO.0328-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Some rats are especially prone to attribute incentive salience to a cue (conditioned stimulus, CS) paired with food reward (sign-trackers, STs), but the extent they do so varies as a function of the form of the CS. Other rats respond primarily to the predictive value of a cue (goal-trackers, GTs), regardless of its form. Sign-tracking is associated with greater cue-induced activation of mesolimbic structures than goal-tracking; however, it is unclear how the form of the CS itself influences activity in neural systems involved in incentive salience attribution. Thus, our goal was to determine how different cue modalities affect neural activity in the ventral pallidum (VP), which is known to encode incentive salience attribution, as rats performed a two-CS Pavlovian conditioned approach task in which both a lever-CS and a tone-CS predicted identical food reward. The lever-CS elicited sign-tracking in some rats (STs) and goal-tracking in others (GTs), whereas the tone-CS elicited only goal-tracking in all rats. The lever-CS elicited robust changes in neural activity (sustained tonic increases or decreases in firing) throughout the VP in STs, relative to GTs. These changes were not seen when STs were exposed to the tone-CS, and in GTs there were no differences in firing between the lever-CS and tone-CS. We conclude that neural activity throughout the VP encodes incentive signals and is especially responsive when a cue is of a form that promotes the attribution of incentive salience to it, especially in predisposed individuals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Tracking Temporal Hazard in the Human Electroencephalogram Using a Forward Encoding Model</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/2/ENEURO.0017-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Human observers automatically extract temporal contingencies from the environment and predict the onset of future events. Temporal predictions are modeled by the hazard function, which describes the instantaneous probability for an event to occur given it has not occurred yet. Here, we tackle the question of whether and how the human brain tracks continuous temporal hazard on a moment-to-moment basis, and how flexibly it adjusts to strictly implicit variations in the hazard function. We applied an encoding-model approach to human electroencephalographic data recorded during a pitch-discrimination task, in which we implicitly manipulated temporal predictability of the target tones by varying the interval between cue and target tone (i.e. the foreperiod). Critically, temporal predictability either was driven solely by the passage of time (resulting in a monotonic hazard function) or was modulated to increase at intermediate foreperiods (resulting in a modulated hazard function with a peak at the intermediate foreperiod). Forward-encoding models trained to predict the recorded EEG signal from different temporal hazard functions were able to distinguish between experimental conditions, showing that implicit variations of temporal hazard bear tractable signatures in the human electroencephalogram. Notably, this tracking signal was reconstructed best from the supplementary motor area, underlining this area’s link to cognitive processing of time. Our results underline the relevance of temporal hazard to cognitive processing and show that the predictive accuracy of the encoding-model approach can be utilized to track abstract time-resolved stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Uncovering Neuronal Networks Defined by Consistent between-Neuron Spike Timing from Neuronal Spike Recordings</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0379-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;It is widely assumed that distributed neuronal networks are fundamental to the functioning of the brain. Consistent spike timing between neurons is thought to be one of the key principles for the formation of these networks. This can involve synchronous spiking or spiking with time delays, forming spike sequences when the order of spiking is consistent. Finding networks defined by their sequence of time-shifted spikes, denoted here as spike timing networks, is a tremendous challenge. As neurons can participate in multiple spike sequences at multiple between-spike time delays, the possible complexity of networks is prohibitively large. We present a novel approach that is capable of (1) extracting spike timing networks regardless of their sequence complexity, and (2) that describes their spiking sequences with high temporal precision. We achieve this by decomposing frequency-transformed neuronal spiking into separate networks, characterizing each network’s spike sequence by a time delay per neuron, forming a spike sequence timeline. These networks provide a detailed template for an investigation of the experimental relevance of their spike sequences. Using simulated spike timing networks, we show network extraction is robust to spiking noise, spike timing jitter, and partial occurrences of the involved spike sequences. Using rat multi-neuron recordings, we demonstrate the approach is capable of revealing real spike timing networks with sub-millisecond temporal precision. By uncovering spike timing networks, the prevalence, structure, and function of complex spike sequences can be investigated in greater detail, allowing us to gain a better understanding of their role in neuronal functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Spike timing consistencies in neuronal networks are widely thought to be one of several key principles behind neuronal functioning. They are challenging to investigate, however, because there is effectively an infinite number of combinations of neurons and their between-neuron time delays for any given recording. Many techniques have been developed for their analysis, but they are still limited by the complexity of spike timing patterns they can reveal. Here we present a novel approach that can reveal spike timing patterns with arbitrary combinatorial complexity. This provides a new opportunity for investigating spike timing networks, which is crucial to gain a better understanding of the role they play in neuronal functioning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Blood-Brain Barrier Leakage during Early Epileptogenesis Is Associated with Rapid Remodeling of the Neurovascular Unit</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0123-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) following cerebral injury results in regional extravasation of plasma proteins and can critically contribute to the pathogenesis of epilepsy. Here, we comprehensively explored the spatiotemporal evolution of a main extravasation component, albumin, and illuminate associated responses of the neurovascular unit (NVU) contributing to early epileptogenic neuropathology. We applied translational &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; MR imaging and complementary immunohistochemical analyses in the widely used rat pilocarpine-post status epilepticus (SE) model. The observed rapid BBB leakage affected major epileptogenesis-associated brain regions, peaked between 1 and 2 days post SE, and rapidly declined thereafter, accompanied by cerebral edema generally following the same time course. At peak of BBB leakage,serum albumin colocalized with NVU constituents, like vascular components, neurons and brain immune cells. Surprisingly, astroglial markers did not colocalize with albumin and aquaporin-4 (AQP4) was clearly reduced in areas of leaky BBB, indicating a severe disturbance of astrocyte-mediated endothelial-neuronal coupling. In addition, a distinct adaptive reorganization process of the NVU vasculature apparently takes place at sites of albumin presence, substantiated by reduced immunoreactivity of endothelial and changes in vascular basement membrane markers. Taken together, degenerative events at the level of the NVU, affecting vessels, astrocytes and neurons, seem to outweigh reconstructive processes. Considering the rapidly occurring BBB leakage and subsequent impairment of the NVU, our data support the necessity of a prompt BBB-restoring treatment as one component of rational therapeutic intervention to prevent epileptogenesis and the development of other detrimental sequelae of SE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage is critically involved in brain insult-mediated epilepsy development. Here, we demonstrate rapid but transient BBB damage within hours after experimental status epilepticus (SE), an epileptogenic insult, and subsequent degenerative events at the level of the so called neurovascular unit (NVU), which reflects the anatomic and functional interplay between brain vasculature, glial cells and neurons. Analyses at cellular level revealed degeneration of various NVU components, which seem to outweigh reconstructive processes, thus providing potential targets for protective pharmacotherapy. The findings emphasize the requirement and expedience of rapid BBB-stabilizing treatment as a primary element of epilepsy-preventive therapeutic interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Semaphorin3A Signaling Is Dispensable for Motor Axon Reinnervation of the Adult Neuromuscular Junction</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0155-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a specialized synapse that is formed by motor axon innervation of skeletal muscle fibers. The maintenance of motor-muscle connectivity is critical for the preservation of muscle tone and generation of movement. Injury can induce a robust regenerative response in motor axons, but severe trauma or chronic denervation resulting from neurodegenerative disease typically leads to inefficient repair and poor functional recovery. The axon guidance molecule Semaphorin3A (Sema3A) has been implicated as a negative regulator of motor innervation. Upon binding to a plexinA-neuropilin1 (Npn1) receptor complex, Sema3A initiates a downstream signaling cascade that results in axonal repulsion. Here, we established a reproducible nerve crush model to quantify motor nerve regeneration. We then used that model to investigate the role of Sema3A signaling at the adult NMJ. In contrast to previous findings, we found that &lt;i&gt;Sema3A&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Npn1&lt;/i&gt; mRNA decrease in response to denervation, suggesting that Sema3A-Npn1 signaling may regulate NMJ reinnervation. To directly test that hypothesis, we used inducible knockout models to ubiquitously delete Sema3A or Npn1 from adult mice. Despite demonstrating that we could achieve highly efficient gene deletion, disruption of Sema3A-Npn1 signaling did not affect the normal maintenance of the NMJ or disrupt motor axon reinnervation after a denervating injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Increased axonal growth and sprouting after a peripheral nerve injury are thought to signify the activation of a robust regenerative response that results in more efficient recovery. The axon guidance factor Sema3A has been proposed to generate a growth inhibitory environment that reduces the regenerative capability of motor nerves. We sought to directly test how the inducible deletion of Sema3A or its receptor Npn1 alters muscle reinnervation after injury. Surprisingly, our work demonstrates that disruption of Npn1-Sema3A signaling does not alter reinnervation of the NMJ. Thus, the utility of targeting this pathway to improve recovery from denervating injuries may be more limited than suggested by earlier studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Sound Frequency Representation in the Auditory Cortex of the Common Marmoset Visualized Using Optical Intrinsic Signal Imaging</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/2/ENEURO.0078-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Natural sound is composed of various frequencies. Although the core region of the primate auditory cortex has functionally defined sound frequency preference maps, how the map is organized in the auditory areas of the belt and parabelt regions is not well known. In this study, we investigated the functional organizations of the core, belt, and parabelt regions encompassed by the lateral sulcus and the superior temporal sulcus in the common marmoset (&lt;i&gt;Callithrix jacchus&lt;/i&gt;). Using optical intrinsic signal imaging, we obtained evoked responses to band-pass noise stimuli in a range of sound frequencies (0.5–16 kHz) in anesthetized adult animals and visualized the preferred sound frequency map on the cortical surface. We characterized the functionally defined organization using histologically defined brain areas in the same animals. We found tonotopic representation of a set of sound frequencies (low to high) within the primary (A1), rostral (R), and rostrotemporal (RT) areas of the core region. In the belt region, the tonotopic representation existed only in the mediolateral (ML) area. This representation was symmetric with that found in A1 along the border between areas A1 and ML. The functional structure was not very clear in the anterolateral (AL) area. Low frequencies were mainly preferred in the rostrotemplatal (RTL) area, while high frequencies were preferred in the caudolateral (CL) area. There was a portion of the parabelt region that strongly responded to higher sound frequencies (&amp;gt;5.8 kHz) along the border between the rostral parabelt (RPB) and caudal parabelt (CPB) regions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Sharpening of Hierarchical Visual Feature Representations of Blurred Images</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0443-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The robustness of the visual system lies in its ability to perceive degraded images. This is achieved through interacting bottom-up, recurrent, and top-down pathways that process the visual input in concordance with stored prior information. The interaction mechanism by which they integrate visual input and prior information is still enigmatic. We present a new approach using deep neural network (DNN) representation to reveal the effects of such integration on degraded visual inputs. We transformed measured human brain activity resulting from viewing blurred images to the hierarchical representation space derived from a feedforward DNN. Transformed representations were found to veer towards the original non-blurred image and away from the blurred stimulus image. This indicated deblurring or sharpening in the neural representation, and possibly in our perception. We anticipate these results will help unravel the interplay mechanism between bottom-up, recurrent, and top-down pathways, leading to more comprehensive models of vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; One powerful characteristic of the visual system is its ability to complement visual information for incomplete visual images. It operates by projecting information from higher visual and semantic areas of the brain into the lower and mid-level representations of the visual stimulus. We investigate the mechanism by which the human brain represents blurred visual stimuli. By decoding fMRI activity into a feedforward-only deep neural network reference space, we found that neural representations of blurred images are biased toward their corresponding deblurred images. This indicates a sharpening mechanism occurring in the visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;It has been recently found that the human dorso-central insular cortex contributes to the execution and recognition of the affective component of hand actions, most likely through modulation of the activity of the parieto-frontal circuits. While the anatomical connections between the hand representation of the insula and, the parietal and frontal regions controlling reaching/grasping actions is well assessed in the monkey, it is unknown the existence of a homolog circuit in humans. In the present study, we performed a multifiber tractography investigation to trace the tracts possibly connecting the insula to the parieto-frontal circuits by locating seeds in the parietal, premotor, and prefrontal nodes of the reaching/grasping network, in both humans and monkeys. Results showed that, in both species, the insula is connected with the cortical action execution/recognition circuit by similar white matter tracts, running in parallel to the third branch of the superior longitudinal fasciculus and the anterior segment of the arcuate fasciculus.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Many neuronal circuits contain, or are influenced by, colocalized neurotransmitters, which are suggested to fine-tune circuit function. Much of our knowledge about cotransmission derives from studies in non-mammalian model systems, although a growing number of studies have provided insights into the physiological role of cotransmission in more complex mammalian circuits, including the spinal cord. Here we discuss the current picture of colocalized neurotransmitters in spinal circuits of non-mammalian and mammalian systems, as well as the progression towards understanding of their functional roles.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>People with Parkinson’s disease (PD) show impaired decision-making when sensory and memory information must be combined. This recently identified impairment results from an inability to accumulate the proper amount of information needed to make a decision and appears to be independent of dopamine tone and reinforcement learning mechanisms. Although considerable work focuses on PD and decisions involving risk and reward, in this Opinion article we propose that the emerging findings in perceptual decision-making highlight the multisystem nature of PD, and that unraveling the neuronal circuits underlying perceptual decision-making impairment may help in understanding other cognitive impairments in people with PD.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Functional triplet motifs underlie accurate predictions of single-trial responses in populations of tuned and untuned V1 neurons</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Joseph B. Dechery, Jason N. MacLean&lt;/p&gt;

Visual stimuli evoke activity in visual cortical neuronal populations. Neuronal activity can be selectively modulated by particular visual stimulus parameters, such as the direction of a moving bar of light, resulting in well-defined trial averaged tuning properties. However, given any single stimulus parameter, a large number of neurons in visual cortex remain unmodulated, and the role of this untuned population is not well understood. Here, we use two-photon calcium imaging to record, in an unbiased manner, from large populations of layer 2/3 excitatory neurons in mouse primary visual cortex to describe co-varying activity on single trials in neuronal populations consisting of both tuned and untuned neurons. Specifically, we summarize pairwise covariability with an asymmetric partial correlation coefficient, allowing us to analyze the resultant population correlation structure, or functional network, with graph theory. Using the graph neighbors of a neuron, we find that the local population, including both tuned and untuned neurons, are able to predict individual neuron activity on a moment to moment basis, while also recapitulating tuning properties of tuned neurons. Variance explained in total population activity scales with the number of neurons imaged, demonstrating larger sample sizes are required to fully capture local network interactions. We also find that a specific functional triplet motif in the graph results in the best predictions, suggesting a signature of informative correlations in these populations. In summary, we show that unbiased sampling of the local population can explain single trial response variability as well as trial-averaged tuning properties in V1, and the ability to predict responses is tied to the occurrence of a functional triplet motif.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ovpobr3CnkQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The rise of transcranial current stimulation (tCS) techniques have sparked an increasing interest in the effects of weak extracellular electric fields on neural activity. These fields modulate ongoing neural activity through polarization of the neuronal membrane. While the somatic polarization has been investigated experimentally, the frequency-dependent polarization of the dendritic trees in the presence of alternating (AC) fields has received little attention yet. Using a biophysically detailed model with experimentally constrained active conductances, we analyze the subthreshold response of cortical pyramidal cells to weak AC fields, as induced during tCS. We observe a strong frequency resonance around 10-20 Hz in the apical dendrites sensitivity to polarize in response to electric fields but not in the basal dendrites nor the soma. To disentangle the relative roles of the cell morphology and active and passive membrane properties in this resonance, we perform a thorough analysis using simplified models, e.g. a passive pyramidal neuron model, simple passive cables and reconstructed cell model with simplified ion channels. We attribute the origin of the resonance in the apical dendrites to (i) a locally increased sensitivity due to the morphology and to (ii) the high density of h-type channels. Our systematic study provides an improved understanding of the subthreshold response of cortical cells to weak electric fields and, importantly, allows for an improved design of tCS stimuli.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/J_BWXr6Snsg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Disease tolerance is a defense strategy against infections that aims at maintaining host health even at high pathogen replication or load. Tolerance mechanisms are currently intensively studied with the long-term goal of exploiting them therapeutically. Because tolerance-based treatment imposes less selective pressure on the pathogen it has been hypothesised to be “evolution-proof”. However, the primary public health goal is to reduce the incidence and mortality associated with a disease. From this perspective, tolerance-based treatment bears the risk of increasing the prevalence of the disease, which may lead to increased mortality. We assessed the promise of tolerance-based treatment strategies using mathematical models. Conventional treatment was implemented as an increased recovery rate, while tolerance-based treatment was assumed to reduce the disease-related mortality of infected hosts without affecting recovery. We investigated the endemic phase of two types of infections: acute and chronic. Additionally, we considered the effect of pathogen resistance against conventional treatment. We show that, for low coverage of tolerance-based treatment, chronic infections can cause even more deaths than without treatment. Overall, we found that conventional treatment always outperforms tolerance-based treatment, even when we allow the emergence of pathogen resistance. Our results cast doubt on the potential benefit of tolerance-based over conventional treatment. Any clinical application of tolerance-based treatment of infectious diseases has to consider the associated detrimental epidemiological feedback.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/C5jRnX8QuMo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Deletion of Tsc2 in Nociceptors Reduces Target Innervation, Ion Channel Expression, and Sensitivity to Heat</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/2/ENEURO.0436-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is known to regulate cellular growth pathways, and its genetic activation is sufficient to enhance regenerative axon growth following injury to the central or peripheral nervous systems. However, excess mTORC1 activation may promote innervation defects, and mTORC1 activity mediates injury-induced hypersensitivity, reducing enthusiasm for the pathway as a therapeutic target. While mTORC1 activity is required for full expression of some pain modalities, the effects of pathway activation on nociceptor phenotypes and sensory behaviors are currently unknown. To address this, we genetically activated mTORC1 in mouse peripheral sensory neurons by conditional deletion of its negative regulator Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2 (Tsc2). Consistent with the well-known role of mTORC1 in regulating cell size, soma size and axon diameter of C-nociceptors were increased in Tsc2-deleted mice. Glabrous skin and spinal cord innervation by C-fiber neurons were also disrupted. Transcriptional profiling of nociceptors enriched by fluorescence-associated cell sorting (FACS) revealed downregulation of multiple classes of ion channels as well as reduced expression of markers for peptidergic nociceptors in Tsc2-deleted mice. In addition to these changes in innervation and gene expression, Tsc2-deleted mice exhibited reduced noxious heat sensitivity and decreased injury-induced cold hypersensitivity, but normal baseline sensitivity to cold and mechanical stimuli. Together, these data show that excess mTORC1 activity in sensory neurons produces changes in gene expression, neuron morphology and sensory behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Circadian Behavioral Responses to Light and Optic Chiasm-Evoked Glutamatergic EPSCs in the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus of ipRGC Conditional vGlut2 Knockout Mice</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0411-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) innervate the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a circadian oscillator that functions as a biological clock. ipRGCs use vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (vGlut2) to package glutamate into synaptic vesicles and light-evoked resetting of the SCN circadian clock is widely attributed to ipRGC glutamatergic neurotransmission. Pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) is also packaged into vesicles in ipRGCs and PACAP may be co-released with glutamate in the SCN. vGlut2 has been conditionally deleted in ipRGCs in mice (cKOs) and their aberrant photoentrainment and residual attenuated light responses have been ascribed to ipRGC PACAP release. However, there is no direct evidence that all ipRGC glutamatergic neurotransmission is eliminated in vGlut2 cKOs. Here we examined two lines of ipRGC vGlut2 cKO mice for SCN-mediated behavioral responses under several lighting conditions and for ipRGC glutamatergic neurotransmission in the SCN. Circadian behavioral responses varied from a very limited response to light to near normal photoentrainment. After collecting behavioral data, hypothalamic slices were prepared and evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSCs) were recorded from SCN neurons by stimulating the optic chiasm. In cKOs, glutamatergic eEPSCs were recorded and all eEPSC parameters examined (stimulus threshold, amplitude, rise time or time-to-peak and stimulus strength to evoke a maximal response) were similar to controls. We conclude that a variable number but functionally significant percentage of ipRGCs in two vGlut2 cKO mouse lines continue to release glutamate. Thus, the residual SCN-mediated light responses in these cKO mouse lines cannot be attributed solely to ipRGC PACAP release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; This study examined glutamatergic signaling by intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) of mice in which vesicular glutamate transporter 2 was knocked out using Cre recombination. The results indicate that significant glutamatergic neurotransmission remains in ipRGCs of Opn4&lt;sup&gt;Cre/+&lt;/sup&gt;;vGlut2&lt;sup&gt;loxP/loxP&lt;/sup&gt; mice and that the ipRGC vGlut2 conditional knockout model resulted in only subtle changes in the rate of vesicular glutamate replenishment even at high stimulation frequencies. These findings are consistent with the behavioral data observed in this and previous studies. Unfortunately, the residual ipRGC glutamatergic transmission in the Opn4&lt;sup&gt;Cre/+&lt;/sup&gt;;vGlut2&lt;sup&gt;loxP/loxP&lt;/sup&gt; mouse model limits the usefulness of this model to examine the role of retinal peptidergic afferents to the suprachiasmatic nucleus and also suggest caution when using Opn4&lt;sup&gt;Cre/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice in other Cre recombination models.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Biological experiments involving genomics or other high-throughput assays typically yield a data matrix that can be explored and analyzed using the R programming language with packages from the Bioconductor project. Improvements in the throughput of these assays have resulted in an explosion of data even from routine experiments, which poses a challenge to the existing computational infrastructure for statistical data analysis. For example, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments frequently generate large matrices containing expression values for each gene in each cell, requiring sparse or file-backed representations for memory-efficient manipulation in R. These alternative representations are not easily compatible with high-performance C++ code used for computationally intensive tasks in existing R/Bioconductor packages. Here, we describe a C++ interface named &lt;i&gt;beachmat&lt;/i&gt;, which enables agnostic data access from various matrix representations. This allows package developers to write efficient C++ code that is interoperable with dense, sparse and file-backed matrices, amongst others. We evaluated the performance of &lt;i&gt;beachmat&lt;/i&gt; for accessing data from each matrix representation using both simulated and real scRNA-seq data, and defined a clear memory/speed trade-off to motivate the choice of an appropriate representation. We also demonstrate how beachmat can be incorporated into the code of other packages to drive analyses of a very large scRNA-seq data set.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MHxJ8eSA7PU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Predictive modelling of a novel anti-adhesion therapy to combat bacterial colonisation of burn wounds</title>

As the development of new classes of antibiotics slows, bacterial resistance to existing antibiotics is becoming an increasing problem. A potential solution is to develop treatment strategies with an alternative mode of action. We consider one such strategy: anti-adhesion therapy. Whereas antibiotics act directly upon bacteria, either killing them or inhibiting their growth, anti-adhesion therapy impedes the binding of bacteria to host cells. This prevents bacteria from deploying their arsenal of virulence mechanisms, while simultaneously rendering them more susceptible to natural and artificial clearance. In this paper, we consider a particular form of anti-adhesion therapy, involving biomimetic multivalent adhesion molecule 7 coupled polystyrene microbeads, which competitively inhibit the binding of bacteria to host cells. We develop a mathematical model, formulated as a system of ordinary differential equations, to describe inhibitor treatment of a &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; burn wound infection in the rat. Benchmarking our model against &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; data from an ongoing experimental programme, we use the model to explain bacteria population dynamics and to predict the efficacy of a range of treatment strategies, with the aim of improving treatment outcome. The model consists of two physical compartments: the host cells and the exudate. It is found that, when effective in reducing the bacterial burden, inhibitor treatment operates both by preventing bacteria from binding to the host cells and by reducing the flux of daughter cells from the host cells into the exudate. Our model predicts that inhibitor treatment cannot eliminate the bacterial burden when used in isolation; however, when combined with regular or continuous debridement of the exudate, elimination is theoretically possible. Lastly, we present ways to improve therapeutic efficacy, as predicted by our mathematical model.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MQif6tb7BiM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Identification of animal behavioral strategies by inverse reinforcement learning</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/kL4dFBBuUp4/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Shoichiro Yamaguchi, Honda Naoki, Muneki Ikeda, Yuki Tsukada, Shunji Nakano, Ikue Mori, Shin Ishii&lt;/p&gt;

Animals are able to reach a desired state in an environment by controlling various behavioral patterns. Identification of the behavioral strategy used for this control is important for understanding animals’ decision-making and is fundamental to dissect information processing done by the nervous system. However, methods for quantifying such behavioral strategies have not been fully established. In this study, we developed an inverse reinforcement-learning (IRL) framework to identify an animal’s behavioral strategy from behavioral time-series data. We applied this framework to &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; thermotactic behavior; after cultivation at a constant temperature with or without food, fed worms prefer, while starved worms avoid the cultivation temperature on a thermal gradient. Our IRL approach revealed that the fed worms used both the absolute temperature and its temporal derivative and that their behavior involved two strategies: directed migration (DM) and isothermal migration (IM). With DM, worms efficiently reached specific temperatures, which explains their thermotactic behavior when fed. With IM, worms moved along a constant temperature, which reflects isothermal tracking, well-observed in previous studies. In contrast to fed animals, starved worms escaped the cultivation temperature using only the absolute, but not the temporal derivative of temperature. We also investigated the neural basis underlying these strategies, by applying our method to thermosensory neuron-deficient worms. Thus, our IRL-based approach is useful in identifying animal strategies from behavioral time-series data and could be applied to a wide range of behavioral studies, including decision-making, in other organisms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kL4dFBBuUp4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Preferential Representation of Past Outcome Information and Future Choice Behavior by Putative Inhibitory Interneurons Rather Than Putative Pyramidal Neurons in the Primate Dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy103/4990942?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) plays crucial roles in monitoring the outcome of a choice and adjusting a subsequent choice behavior based on the outcome information. In the present study, we investigated how different types of dACC neurons, that is, putative pyramidal neurons and putative inhibitory interneurons, contribute to these processes. We analyzed single-unit database obtained from the dACC in monkeys performing a reversal learning task. The monkey was required to adjust choice behavior from past outcome experiences. Depending on their action potential waveforms, the recorded neurons were classified into putative pyramidal neurons and putative inhibitory interneurons. We found that these neurons do not equally contribute to outcome monitoring and behavioral adjustment. Although both neuron types evenly responded to the current outcome, a larger proportion of putative inhibitory interneurons than putative pyramidal neurons stored the information about the past outcome. The putative inhibitory interneurons further represented choice-related signals more frequently, such as whether the monkey would shift the last choice to an alternative at the next choice opportunity. Our findings suggest that putative inhibitory interneurons, which are thought not to project to brain areas outside the dACC, preferentially transmit signals that would adjust choice behavior based on past outcome experiences.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Network-Based Asymmetry of the Human Auditory System</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy101/4990941?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Converging evidence from activation, connectivity, and stimulation studies suggests that auditory brain networks are lateralized. Here we show that these findings can be at least partly explained by the asymmetric network embedding of the primary auditory cortices. Using diffusion-weighted imaging in 3 independent datasets, we investigate the propensity for left and right auditory cortex to communicate with other brain areas by quantifying the centrality of the auditory network across a spectrum of communication mechanisms, from shortest path communication to diffusive spreading. Across all datasets, we find that the right auditory cortex is better integrated in the connectome, facilitating more efficient communication with other areas, with much of the asymmetry driven by differences in communication pathways to the opposite hemisphere. Critically, the primacy of the right auditory cortex emerges only when communication is conceptualized as a diffusive process, taking advantage of more than just the topologically shortest paths in the network. Altogether, these results highlight how the network configuration and embedding of a particular region may contribute to its functional lateralization.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Action Observation Areas Represent Intentions From Subtle Kinematic Features</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy098/4990940?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Mirror neurons have been proposed to underlie humans’ ability to understand others’ actions and intentions. Despite 2 decades of research, however, the exact computational and neuronal mechanisms implied in this ability remain unclear. In the current study, we investigated whether, in the absence of contextual cues, regions considered to be part of the human mirror neuron system represent intention from movement kinematics. A total of 21 participants observed reach-to-grasp movements, performed with either the intention to drink or to pour while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. Multivoxel pattern analysis revealed successful decoding of intentions from distributed patterns of activity in a network of structures comprising the inferior parietal lobule, the superior parietal lobule, the inferior frontal gyrus, and the middle frontal gyrus. Consistent with the proposal that parietal regions play a key role in intention understanding, classifier weights were higher in the inferior parietal region. These results provide the first demonstration that putative mirror neuron regions represent subtle differences in movement kinematics to read the intention of an observed motor act.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Neuropathological conditions might affect adult granulogenesis in the adult human dentate gyrus. However, radial glial cells (RGCs) have not been well characterized during human development and aging. We have previously described progenitor and neuronal layer establishment in the hippocampal pyramidal layer and dentate gyrus from embryonic life until mid-gestation. Here, we describe RGC subtypes in the hippocampus from 13 gestational weeks (GW) to mid-gestation and characterize their evolution and the dynamics of neurogenesis from mid-gestation to adulthood in normal and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) subjects. In the pyramidal ventricular zone (VZ), RGC density declined with neurogenesis from mid-gestation until the perinatal period. In the dentate area, morphologic and antigenic differences among RGCs were observed from early ages of development to adulthood. Density and proliferative capacity of dentate RGCs as well as neurogenesis were strongly reduced during childhood until 5 years, few DCX&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells are seen in adults. The dentate gyrus of both control and AD individuals showed Nestin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and/or GFAPδ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells displaying different morphologies. In conclusion, pools of morphologically, antigenically, and topographically diverse neural progenitor cells are present in the human hippocampus from early developmental stages until adulthood, including in AD patients, while their neurogenic potential seems negligible in the adult.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>GGGGCC (G4C2) repeat expansion in C9ORF72 is the most common genetic cause of ALS and FTD. An important issue is how repeat RNAs and their translation products, various dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins, cause neurodegeneration. Drosophila has been widely used to model G4C2 repeat RNA and DPR protein toxicity. Overexpression of disease molecules in flies has revealed important molecular insights. These have been validated and further explored in human neurons differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), a disease-relevant model in which expanded G4C2 repeats are expressed in their native molecular context.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>In 2011, an intronic (G4C2)•(G2C4) expansion was shown to cause the most common forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). This discovery linked ALS with a clinically distinct form of dementia and a larger group of microsatellite repeat diseases, and catalyzed basic and translational research.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(18)30068-7?rss=yes</link>
	<content:encoded>The parabrachial nucleus (PBN), which is located in the pons and is dissected by one of the major cerebellar output tracks, is known to relay sensory information (visceral malaise, taste, temperature, pain, itch) to forebrain structures including the thalamus, hypothalamus, and extended amygdala. The availability of mouse lines expressing Cre recombinase selectively in subsets of PBN neurons and viruses for Cre-dependent gene expression is beginning to reveal the connectivity and functions of PBN component neurons.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(18)30066-3?rss=yes</link>
	<content:encoded>Efforts to parcellate the cortex into areas based on fine-scale anatomical signatures (e.g., cytoarchitectonics) date back to the early years of the last century. In the ensuing decades, rapidly growing knowledge of cortical connections encouraged neurobiologists to search for connectivity-based principles underlying the organization of the cerebral cortex. Using such an approach, Felleman and Van Essen presented, in their 1991 paper, a connectivity-based hierarchical principle dictating the relationship between cortical areas.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>In 2001 Raichle and colleagues showed that, at rest, brain activity fluctuates near a metabolically active equilibrium: a ‘default mode’ of brain function. This finding broke ranks with the prevailing ‘task–rest’ dichotomy to position the brain as continuously active, balancing the deployment of resources according to current and anticipated needs.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(18)30061-4?rss=yes</link>
	<content:encoded>Spinal cord repair research appeared to have run out of new ideas in the 1970s. In a 1981 paper, the Aguayo Laboratory revisited an experiment by Tello and Cajal that suggested that central nervous system (CNS) axons could regenerate into peripheral nerve grafts. Using modern axon tracing methods, David and Aguayo showed that axons from neurons in the spinal cord could regenerate for long distances within peripheral nervous system (PNS) grafts, but not back into the CNS. This proved that damaged CNS tissue is inhibitory to axon regeneration while PNS tissue is permissive.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Complex formation between the vasopressin 1b receptor, β-arrestin-2, and the μ-opioid receptor underlies morphine tolerance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complex formation between the vasopressin 1b receptor, β-arrestin-2, and the μ-opioid receptor underlies morphine tolerance, Published online: 30 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0144-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-018-0144-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Chronic morphine use can lead to tolerance and AC superactivation. This paper identifies a molecular mechanism by which V1bR signaling promotes this process, providing a potential approach to enhance morphine analgesia without increasing tolerance.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/8vWwzITXU_Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>
