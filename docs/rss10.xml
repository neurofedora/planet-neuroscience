	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Deeper Image Quality Transfer: Training Low-Memory Neural Networks for 3D Images. (arXiv:1808.05577v1 [cs.CV])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05577</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this paper we address the memory demands that come with the processing of
3-dimensional, high-resolution, multi-channeled medical images in deep
learning. We exploit memory-efficient backpropagation techniques, to reduce the
memory complexity of network training from being linear in the network's depth,
to being roughly constant $ - $ permitting us to elongate deep architectures
with negligible memory increase. We evaluate our methodology in the paradigm of
Image Quality Transfer, whilst noting its potential application to various
tasks that use deep learning. We study the impact of depth on accuracy and show
that deeper models have more predictive power, which may exploit larger
training sets. We obtain substantially better results than the previous
state-of-the-art model with a slight memory increase, reducing the
root-mean-squared-error by $ 13\% $. Our code is publicly available.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Transfer Learning for Brain-Computer Interfaces: An Euclidean Space Data Alignment Approach. (arXiv:1808.05464v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05464</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Almost all EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) need some labeled
subject-specific data to calibrate a new subject, as neural responses are
different across subjects to even the same stimulus. So, a major challenge in
developing high-performance and user-friendly BCIs is to cope with such
individual differences so that the calibration can be reduced or even
completely eliminated. This paper focuses on the latter. More specifically, we
consider an offline application scenario, in which we have unlabeled EEG trials
from a new subject, and would like to accurately label them by leveraging
auxiliary labeled EEG trials from other subjects in the same task. To
accommodate the individual differences, we propose a novel unsupervised
approach to align the EEG trials from different subjects in the Euclidean space
to make them more consistent. It has three desirable properties: 1) the aligned
trial lie in the Euclidean space, which can be used by any Euclidean space
signal processing and machine learning approach; 2) it can be computed very
efficiently; and, 3) it does not need any labeled trials from the new subject.
Experiments on motor imagery and event-related potentials demonstrated the
effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Robustness of functional networks at criticality against structural defects. (arXiv:1808.05284v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05284</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The robustness of dynamical properties of neuronal networks against
structural damages is a central problem in computational and experimental
neuroscience. Research has shown that the cortical network of a healthy brain
works near a critical state, and moreover, that functional neuronal networks
often have scale-free and small-world properties. In this work, we study how
the robustness of simple functional networks at criticality is affected by
structural defects. In particular, we consider a 2D Ising model at the critical
temperature and investigate how its functional network changes with the
increasing degree of structural defects. We show that the scale-free and
small-world properties of the functional network at criticality are robust
against large degrees of structural lesions while the system remains below the
percolation limit. Although the Ising model is only a conceptual description of
a two-state neuron, our research reveals fundamental robustness properties of
functional networks derived from classical statistical mechanics models.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: MimicrEE2: Genome-wide forward simulations of Evolve and Resequencing studies</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/JapZUmLAva0/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Christos Vlachos, Robert Kofler&lt;/p&gt;

Evolve and Resequencing (E&amp;amp;R) studies allow us to monitor adaptation at the genomic level. By sequencing evolving populations at regular time intervals, E&amp;amp;R studies promise to shed light on some of the major open questions in evolutionary biology such as the repeatability of evolution and the molecular basis of adaptation. However, data interpretation, statistical analysis and the experimental design of E&amp;amp;R studies increasingly require simulations of evolving populations, a task that is difficult to accomplish with existing tools, which may i) be too slow, ii) require substantial reformatting of data, iii) not support an adaptive scenario of interest or iv) not sufficiently capture the biology of the used model organism. Therefore we developed MimicrEE2, a multi-threaded Java program for genome-wide forward simulations of evolving populations. MimicrEE2 enables the convenient usage of available genomic resources, supports biological particulars of model organism frequently used in E&amp;amp;R studies and offers a wide range of different adaptive models (selective sweeps, polygenic adaptation, epistasis). Due to its user-friendly and efficient design MimicrEE2 will facilitate simulations of E&amp;amp;R studies even for small labs with limited bioinformatics expertise or computational resources. Additionally, the scripts provided for executing MimicrEE2 on a computer cluster permit the coverage even of a large parameter space. MimicrEE2 runs on any computer with Java installed.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Characterising seasonal influenza epidemiology using primary care surveillance data</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/raQHBoUzdMM/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Robert C. Cope, Joshua V. Ross, Monique Chilver, Nigel P. Stocks, Lewis Mitchell&lt;/p&gt;

Understanding the epidemiology of seasonal influenza is critical for healthcare resource allocation and early detection of anomalous seasons. It can be challenging to obtain high-quality data of influenza cases specifically, as clinical presentations with influenza-like symptoms may instead be cases of one of a number of alternate respiratory viruses. We use a new dataset of confirmed influenza virological data from 2011-2016, along with high-quality denominators informing a hierarchical observation process, to model seasonal influenza dynamics in New South Wales, Australia. We use approximate Bayesian computation to estimate parameters in a climate-driven stochastic epidemic model, including the basic reproduction number &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the proportion of the population susceptible to the circulating strain at the beginning of the season, and the probability an infected individual seeks treatment. We conclude that &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and initial population susceptibility were strongly related, emphasising the challenges of identifying these parameters. Relatively high &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; values alongside low initial population susceptibility were among the results most consistent with these data. Our results reinforce the importance of distinguishing between &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and the effective reproduction number (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;) in modelling studies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/raQHBoUzdMM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0217-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Phosphorylation of MARCKS (myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate) reflects neurite degeneration at the early stage of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), before extracellular Aβ aggregates are histologically detectable. Here, we demonstrate that similar changes in MARCKS occur in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy body (DLB) pathologies in both mouse models and human patients. The increase in the level of pSer46-MARCKS began before α-synuclein aggregate formation, at a time when human α-Syn-BAC-Tg/GBA-hetero-KO mice exhibited no symptoms, and was sustained during aging, consistent with the pattern in human postmortem brains. The results strongly imply a common mechanism of pre-aggregation neurite degeneration in AD and PD/DLB pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement:&lt;/b&gt; At early stage of Alzheimer’s disease before the aggregation of extracellular Aβ, phosphorylation of MARCKS at Ser46 reflects neurite degeneration. In this study, we confirmed the similar changes both in mouse models and human patients of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). Phosphorylation of MARCKS at Ser46 was increased before α-synuclein aggregation was detected, and the increase of pSer46-MARCKS was sustained during aging. These results suggest that neurite degeneration detected by pSer46-MARCKS is a common pre-aggregation mechanism shared by AD and PD/DLB pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0206-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Excessive noise exposure damages sensory hair cells, leading to permanent hearing loss. Zebrafish are a highly tractable model that have advanced our understanding of drug-induced hair cell death, yet no comparable model exists for noise exposure research. We demonstrate the utility of zebrafish as model to increase understanding of hair cell damage from acoustic trauma and develop protective therapies. We created an acoustic trauma system using underwater cavitation to stimulate lateral line hair cells. We found that acoustic stimulation resulted in exposure time- and intensity-dependent lateral line and saccular hair cell damage that is maximal at 48-72h post-trauma. The number of TUNEL positive lateral line hair cells increased 72h post-exposure whereas no increase was observed in TUNEL positive supporting cells, demonstrating that acoustic stimulation causes hair cell-specific damage. Lateral line hair cells damaged by acoustic stimulation regenerate within three days, consistent with prior regeneration studies utilizing ototoxic drugs. Acoustic stimulation-induced hair cell damage is attenuated by pharmacological inhibition of protein synthesis or caspase activation, suggesting a requirement for translation and activation of apoptotic signaling cascades. Surviving hair cells exposed to acoustic stimulation showed signs of synaptopathy, consistent with mammalian studies. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of this platform to identify compounds that prevent acoustic trauma by screening a small redox library for protective compounds. Our data suggest that acoustic stimulation results in lateral line hair cell damage consistent with acoustic trauma research in mammals, providing a highly tractable model for high-throughput genetic and drug discovery studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Noise overexposure damages hair cells, leading to permanent hearing loss. A critical step in understanding and preventing noise-induced hearing loss is establishing an accessible &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; model to test for genetic and chemical modulators of noise damage. We developed a novel acoustic trauma system, using cavitation, to stimulate and damage zebrafish lateral line hair cells. We demonstrate that acoustic stimulation damages zebrafish lateral line hair cells in an exposure time- and intensity-dependent manner, consistent with acoustic trauma research in mammals. This novel system provides a model for &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, real-time studies of noise exposure, and for rapid discovery of chemical and genetic modulators of acoustic trauma-induced hair cell damage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05148</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A rigorous bridge between spiking-level and macroscopic quantities is an
on-going and well-developed story for asynchronously firing neurons, but focus
has shifted to include neural populations exhibiting varying synchronous
dynamics. Recent literature has used the Ott--Antonsen ansatz (2008) to great
effect, allowing a rigorous derivation of an order parameter for large
oscillator populations. The ansatz has been successfully applied using several
models including networks of Kuramoto oscillators, theta models, and
integrate-and-fire neurons, along with many types of network topologies. In the
present study, we take a converse approach: given the mean field dynamics of
slow synapses, predict the synchronization properties of finite neural
populations. The slow synapse assumption is amenable to averaging theory and
the method of multiple timescales. Our proposed theory applies to two
heterogeneous populations of N excitatory n-dimensional and N inhibitory
m-dimensional oscillators with homogeneous synaptic weights. We then
demonstrate our theory using two examples. In the first example we take a
network of excitatory and inhibitory theta neurons and consider the case with
and without heterogeneous inputs. In the second example we use Traub models
with calcium for the excitatory neurons and Wang-Buzs{\'a}ki models for the
inhibitory neurons. We accurately predict phase drift and phase locking in each
example even when the slow synapses exhibit non-trivial mean-field dynamics.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05143</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Humans can fluidly adapt their interest in complex environments in ways that
machines cannot. Here, we lay the groundwork for a real-world system that
passively monitors and merges neural correlates of visual interest across team
members via Collaborative Brain Computer Interface (cBCI). When group interest
is detected and co-registered in time and space, it can be used to model the
task relevance of items in a dynamic, natural environment. Previous work in
cBCIs focuses on static stimuli, stimulus- or response- locked analyses, and
often within-subject and experiment model training. The contributions of this
work are twofold. First, we test the utility of cBCI on a scenario that more
closely resembles natural conditions, where subjects visually scanned a video
for target items in a virtual environment. Second, we use an
experiment-agnostic deep learning model to account for the real-world use case
where no training set exists that exactly matches the end-users task and
circumstances. With our approach we show improved performance as the number of
subjects in the cBCI ensemble grows, and the potential to reconstruct
ground-truth target occurrence in an otherwise noisy and complex environment.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Computational ghost imaging relies on the decomposition of an image into
patterns that are summed together with weights that measure the overlap of each
pattern with the scene being imaged. These tasks rely on a computer. Here we
demonstrate that the computational integration can be performed directly with
the human eye. We use this human ghost imaging technique to evaluate the
temporal response of the eye and establish the image persistence time to be
around 20 ms followed by a further 20 ms exponential decay. These persistence
times are in agreement with previous studies but can now potentially be
extended to include a more precise characterisation of visual stimuli and
provide a new experimental tool for the study of visual perception.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Complexity of human response delay in intermittent control: The case of virtual stick balancing. (arXiv:1808.05002v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05002</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Response delay is an inherent and essential part of human actions. In the
context of human balance control, the response delay is traditionally modeled
using the formalism of delay-differential equations, which adopts the
approximation of fixed delay. However, experimental studies revealing
substantial variability, adaptive anticipation, and non-stationary dynamics of
response delay provide evidence against this approximation. In this paper, we
call for development of principally new mathematical formalism describing human
response delay. To support this, we present the experimental data from a simple
virtual stick balancing task. Our results demonstrate that human response delay
is a widely distributed random variable with complex properties, which can
exhibit oscillatory and adaptive dynamics characterized by long-range
correlations. Given this, we argue that the fixed-delay approximation ignores
essential properties of human response, and conclude with possible directions
for future developments of new mathematical notions describing human control.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/39497</link>
	<content:encoded>Cognitive control proactively configures information processing to suit expected task demands. Predictions of forthcoming demand can be driven by explicit external cues or be generated internally, based on past experience (cognitive history). However, it is not known whether and how the brain reconciles these two sources of information to guide control. Pairing a probabilistic task-switching paradigm with computational modeling, we found that external and internally generated predictions jointly guide task preparation, with a bias for internal predictions. Using model-based neuroimaging, we then show that the two sources of task prediction are integrated in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and jointly inform a representation of the likelihood of a change in task demand, encoded in frontoparietal cortex. Upon task-stimulus onset, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex encoded the need for reactive task-set adjustment. These data reveal how the human brain integrates external cues and cognitive history to prepare for an upcoming task.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36316</link>
	<content:encoded>Here, we demonstrate that &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana &lt;/i&gt;Formin 2 (AtFH2) localizes to PD through its transmembrane domain and is required for normal intercellular trafficking. Although loss-of-function &lt;i&gt;atfh2 &lt;/i&gt;mutants have no overt developmental defect, PD's permeability and sensitivity to virus infection are increased in &lt;i&gt;atfh2 &lt;/i&gt;plants. Interestingly, AtFH2 functions in a partially redundant manner with its closest homolog AtFH1, which also contains a PD localization signal. Strikingly, targeting of Class I formins to PD was also confirmed in rice, suggesting that the involvement of Class I formins in regulating actin dynamics at PD may be evolutionarily conserved in plants. &lt;i&gt;In vitro &lt;/i&gt;biochemical analysis showed that AtFH2 fails to nucleate actin assembly but caps and stabilizes actin filaments. We also demonstrate that the interaction between AtFH2 and actin filaments is crucial for its function &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. These data allow us to propose that AtFH2 regulates PD's permeability by anchoring actin filaments to PD.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34625</link>
	<content:encoded>The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a synapse between motoneurons and skeletal muscles to control motor behavior. Unlike extensively investigated postsynaptic differentiation, less is known about mechanisms of presynaptic assembly. Genetic evidence of Wnt in mammalian NMJ development was missing due to the existence of multiple Wnts and their receptors. We show when Wnt secretion is abolished from motoneurons by mutating the Wnt ligand secretion mediator (Wls) gene, mutant mice showed muscle weakness and neurotransmission impairment. NMJs were unstable with reduced synaptic junctional folds and fragmented AChR clusters. Nerve terminals were swollen; synaptic vesicles were fewer and mislocated. The presynaptic deficits occurred earlier than postsynaptic deficits. Intriguingly, these phenotypes were not observed when deleting Wls in muscles or Schwann cells. We identified Wnt7A and Wnt7B as major Wnts for nerve terminal development in rescue experiments. These observations demonstrate a necessary role of motoneuron Wnts in NMJ development, in particular presynaptic differentiation.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Proprioceptive Deficits in Inactive Older Adults are not Reflected in Discrete Reaching Performance</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/393785v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>During normal healthy ageing there is a decline in the ability to control simple movements, characterised by increased reaction times, movement durations and variability. There is also growing evidence of age-related proprioceptive loss which may contribute to these impairments. However this relationship has not been studied in detail for the upper limb. We recruited 20 younger adults (YAs) and 31 older adults (OAs) who each performed 2 tasks on a 2D robotic manipulandum. The first assessed dynamic proprioceptive acuity using active, multi-joint movements towards visually presented targets, with movement constrained by the robot to a predefined path. Participants made perceptual judgements of the lateral position of the unseen arm. The second was a rapid motor task which required fast, accurate movements to the same targets in the absence of hand position visual feedback, and without constraint by the robot. We predicted that the variable proprioceptive error (uncertainty range) from Task 1 would be increased in physically inactive OAs and would predict increased movement variability in Task 2. Instead we found that physically inactive OAs had larger systematic proprioceptive errors (bias). Neither proprioceptive acuity nor bias was related to motor performance in either age group. We suggest that previously reported estimates of proprioceptive decline with ageing may be exaggerated by task demands and that the extent of these deficits is unrelated to discrete, ballistic movement control. The relationship of dynamic proprioceptive acuity with movement control in tasks which emphasise online proprioceptive feedback for performance is still unclear and warrants further investigation.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Hierarchical Bayesian inference for concurrent model fitting and comparison for group studies</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/393561v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Computational modeling plays an important role in modern neuroscience research. Much previous research has relied on statistical methods, separately, to address two problems that are actually interdependent. First, given a particular computational model, Bayesian hierarchical techniques have been used to estimate individual variation in parameters over a population of subjects, leveraging their population-level distributions. Second, candidate models are themselves compared, and individual variation in the expressed model estimated, according to the fits of the models to each subject. The interdependence between these two problems arises because the relevant population for estimating parameters of a model depends on which other subjects express the model. Here, we propose a hierarchical Bayesian inference (HBI) framework for concurrent model comparison, parameter estimation and inference at the population level, combining previous approaches. We show that this framework has important advantages for both parameter estimation and model comparison theoretically and experimentally. The parameters estimated by the HBI show smaller errors compared to other methods. Model comparison by HBI is robust against outliers and is not biased towards overly simplistic models. Furthermore, the fully Bayesian approach of HBI enables researchers to quantify uncertainty in group parameter estimates, for each candidate model separately, and to perform statistical tests on parameters of a population.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/393553v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Much evidence suggests that the angular gyrus (AnG) is involved in episodic memory, but its precise role is yet to be determined. We examined two possible accounts, within the same experimental paradigm: the CoBRA account (Shimamura, 2011), which suggests that the AnG acts as a convergence zone that binds multimodal episodic features; and the Subjectivity account (Yazar et al., 2012), which implicates AnG involvement in subjective mnemonic experience (such as vividness or confidence). fMRI was employed during both encoding and retrieval of paired-associates. During study, participants memorised picture-pairs of common objects (in the unimodal task) or of an object-picture and an environmental sound (in the crossmodal task). At test, they performed a cued-recall task, and further indicated the vividness of their memory. During retrieval, BOLD activation in the AnG was greatest for vividly remembered associates, consistent with the Subjectivity account. During encoding, the same effect of vividness was found, but this was further modulated by task: Greater activations were associated with subsequent recall in the crossmodal than the unimodal task. Thus, encoding data suggests an additional role to the AnG in cross-modal integration, consistent with its role at retrieval proposed by CoBRA. These results resolve some of the puzzles in the literature and indicate that the AnG can play different roles during encoding and retrieval, determined by the cognitive demands posed by different mnemonic tasks.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Information about color, material, texture and shape guide how we interact with objects. We developed a paradigm that quantifies how two object properties (color and material) combine in object selection. On each experimental trial, observers viewed three blob-shaped objects - the target and two tests - and selected the test that was more similar to the target. Across trials the target was fixed while the tests varied in color and material. We present a novel observer model that allows us to describe observers selection data in terms of (1) the underlying perceptual stimulus representation and (2) a color-material weight, which quantifies the relative importance of color vs. material in selection. We document large individual differences in the color-material weight. Furthermore, our analyses reveal limits on how precisely selection data simultaneously constrain perceptual representations and the color-material weight. These limits should guide future efforts towards understanding the multidimensional nature of object perception.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/393405v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>One of the key knowledge gaps blocking development of effective therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the lack of understanding of how amyloid beta (A{beta}) and tau cooperate in causing disease phenotypes. Within a mouse tau deficient background, we probed the molecular, cellular and behavioural disruption triggered by wild-type human tau's influence on human A{beta}-induced pathology. We find that A{beta} and tau work cooperatively to cause a hyperactivity phenotype and to cause downregulation of gene transcription including many involved in synaptic function. In both our mouse model and in human post-mortem tissue, we observe accumulation of pathological tau in synapses, supporting the potential importance of synaptic tau. Importantly, tau depletion in the mice, initiated after behavioural deficits emerge, was found to correct behavioural deficits, reduce synaptic tau levels, and substantially reverse transcriptional perturbations, suggesting that lowering tau levels, particularly at the synapse, may be beneficial in AD.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Mutations in transmembrane inner ear (TMIE) cause deafness in humans; previous studies suggest involvement in the mechano-electrical transduction (MET) complex in sensory hair cells, but TMIEs precise role is unclear. In tmie zebrafish mutants, we observed that GFP-tagged Tmc1 and Tmc2b, which are putative subunits of the MET channel, fail to target to the hair bundle. In contrast, overexpression of Tmie strongly enhances the targeting of Tmc2b-GFP to stereocilia. To identify the motifs of Tmie underlying the regulation of the Tmcs, we systematically deleted or replaced peptide segments. We then assessed localization and functional rescue of each mutated/chimeric form of Tmie in tmie mutants. We determined that the first putative helix was dispensable and identified a novel critical region of Tmie, the extracellular region and transmembrane domain, which mediates both mechanosensitivity and Tmc2b-GFP expression in bundles. Collectively, our results suggest that Tmies role in sensory hair cells is to target and stabilize Tmc subunits to the site of MET.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/393215v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The primate cerebral cortex displays a hierarchical organization that extends from primary sensorimotor to association areas, supporting increasingly integrated function that is underpinned by a gradient of heterogeneity in the brain's microcircuits. The extent to which these properties of brain organization are unique to primate or may be conserved across mammals remains unknown. Here we report the topographic similarity of large-scale gradients in cytoarchitecture, brain-related gene expression, interneuron cell densities, and long-range axonal connectivity, which vary from primary sensory through to prefrontal areas of mouse cortex, highlighting an underappreciated spatial dimension of mouse cortical specialization. Using the T1w:T2w magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) map as a common spatial reference for comparison across species, we report interspecies agreement in a range of cortical gradients, including a significant correspondence between gene transcriptional maps in mouse cortex with their human orthologs in human cortex. The interspecies correspondence of large-scale cortical gradients suggests that a conserved anatomical organization may underlie hierarchical specialization in mammalian brains.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A new schizophrenia model: immune activation is associated with induction of thetryptophan catabolite pathway and increased eotaxin levels which together determinememory impairments and schizophrenia symptom dimensions.</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/393173v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective: Recently, we reported that stable-phase schizophrenia is characterized by two interrelated symptom dimensions: PHEMN (psychotic, hostility, excitation, mannerism and negative symptoms); and DAPS (depressive, anxiety and physio-somatic symptoms) and that Major Neuro-Cognitive psychosis (MNP) is the full blown phenotype of schizophrenia (largely overlapping with deficit schizophrenia). Herein we examined the effects of immune activation in association with tryptophan catabolite (TRYCAT) patterning and memory disorders on PHEMN/DAPS dimensions and MNP. Method: Serum levels of macrophage inflammatory protein-1 (MIP-1), soluble interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist (sIL-1RA), IL-10, eotaxin, IgA/IgM responses to TRYCATs, and Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's disease (CERAD) tests were assessed in 40 controls and 80 schizophrenia patients. Results: Schizophrenia and MNP were predicted by significantly increased levels of IL-10, eotaxin and TRYCATs. A large part of the variance in both PHEMN/DAPS symptom dimensions (42.8%) was explained by cytokine levels and TRYCATs combined. The MIP+sIL-1RA+IL-10 composite score and eotaxin explained each around 19% of the variance in symptom dimensions, and approximately 18% of memory deficits. Moreover, MIP+sIL-1RA+IL-10 was significantly associated with elevations in picolinic acid, xanthurenic acid and 3-OH-kynurenine. Partial Least Squares path modeling shows that the highly significant effects of MIP+sIL-1RA+IL-10 on symptomatology are mediated by the effects of noxious TRYCATs on memory deficits. Conclusions: Current findings indicate that in schizophrenia, immune activation may underpin activation of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase and kynurenine monooxygenase, while impairments in episodic and semantic memory may be caused by the neurotoxic effects of TRYCATs and eotaxin. The combined effects of immune activation, eotaxin and memory defects determine to a large extent PHEMN/DAPS symptoms and the MNP phenotype. These findings indicate that schizophrenia phenomenology is largely mediated by multiple neuro-immune pathways and that immune activation, increased production of eotaxin and neurotoxic TRYCATs (picolinic acid, xanthurenic acid and 3-HO-kynurenine) are new drug targets in schizophrenia and MNP.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/393066v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The outstanding speed of language comprehension necessitates a highly efficient implementation of cognitive-linguistic processes. The domain-general theory of Predictive Coding suggests that our brain solves this problem by continuously forming linguistic predictions about expected upcoming input. The neurophysiological implementation of these predictive linguistic processes, however, is not yet understood. Here, we use EEG (human participants, both sexes) to investigate the existence and nature of online-generated, category-level semantic representations during sentence processing. We conducted two experiments in which some nouns - embedded in a predictive spoken sentence context - were unexpectedly delayed by 1 second. Target nouns were either abstract/concrete (Experiment 1) or animate/inanimate (Experiment 2). We hypothesized that if neural prediction error signals following (temporary) omissions carry specific information about the stimulus, the semantic category of the upcoming target word is encoded in brain activity prior to its presentation. Using time-generalized multivariate pattern analysis, we demonstrate significant decoding of word category from silent periods directly preceding the target word, in both experiments. This provides direct evidence for predictive coding during sentence processing, i.e., that information about a word can be encoded in brain activity before it is perceived. While the same semantic contrast could also be decoded from EEG activity elicited by isolated words (Experiment 1), the identified neural patterns did not generalize to pre-stimulus delay period activity in sentences. Our results not only indicate that the brain processes language predictively, but also demonstrate the nature and sentence-specificity of category-level semantic predictions pre-activated during sentence comprehension.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Intact mast cell content during mild head injury is required for the development of latent pain sensitization - implications for mechanisms underlying posttraumatic headache</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/392928v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Posttraumatic headache (PTH) is one of the most common, debilitating and difficult symptoms to manage after a mild traumatic brain injury, or concussion. While the mechanisms underlying PTH remain elusive, recent studies suggest the potential involvement of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a mediator of neurogenic inflammation, and the ensuing activation of meningeal mast cells (MCs), key pro-algesic resident immune cells that can lead to the activation of the headache pain pathway. The following study investigated the relative contribution of MCs to the development of PTH-like pain behaviors using a recently developed rat model of mild closed head injury (mCHI). We initially employed histological methods and a monoclonal antibody against CGRP to test the relative contribution of peripheral CGRP signaling to the activation of meningeal MCs following mCHI. We then used a prophylactic, pharmacological MC granule depletion protocol, combined with behavioral nociceptive testing, to address the hypotheses that intact meningeal MC granule content is necessary for the development of PTH-related acute and persistent headache and pain-like behaviors following mCHI. The data suggest that following mCHI, ongoing meningeal MC degranulation does not involve peripheral CGRP signaling, and that the cephalic mechanical pain hypersensitivity that develops following mCHI does not depend upon acute meningeal MC degranulation. Our data, however, also reveals that the development of latent sensitization, a key chronic pain-like phenomenon, manifested as persistent hypersensitivity upon the recovery from mCHI-evoked acute cranial hyperalgesia to the headache trigger glyceryl trinitate (GTN) requires intact MC content during and immediately after mCHI. Collectively, our data implicate the acute activation of meningeal MCs as mediator of chronic pain hypersensitivity following a concussion or mCHI. Targeting MCs may be explored for early prophylactic treatment of PTH.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/392886v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Many functional connectivity studies based on electrophysiological measurements, such as electro- and magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG), start their investigations by extracting a narrowband representation of brain activity time series, and then computing their envelope amplitudes and instantaneous phases, which serve as inputs to subsequent data processing. The two most popular approaches for obtaining these narrowband amplitudes and phases are: bandpass filtering followed by Hilbert transform (we call this the Hilbert approach); and convolution with wavelet kernels (the wavelet approach). In this work, we investigate how these two approaches perform in detecting the phenomenon of phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), whereby the amplitude of a high-frequency signal is driven by the phase of a low-frequency signal. The comparison of both approaches is carried out by means of simulated brain activity, from which we run receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, and of experimental MEG data from a visuomotor coordination study. The ROC analyses show that the classification accuracy of the Hilbert approach is markedly better than that of the wavelet approach in most scenarios tested. As for the visuomotor data, the use of the Hilbert approach allows the identification of effects to which the wavelet approach is insensitive, such as widespread areas in the brain with significant task-based changes in PAC between the delta (2-5 Hz) and the gamma (30-90 Hz) frequency bands. These results provide strong evidence that the Hilbert approach yields better performance, at least in the context of PAC estimates, and should be preferred over the wavelet approach.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Modern neuroscience research often requires the coordination of multiple processes such as stimulus generation, real-time experimental control, as well as behavioral and neural measurements. The technical demands required to simultaneously manage these processes with high temporal fidelity limits the number of labs capable of performing such work. Here we present an open-source network-based parallel processing framework that eliminates these barriers. The Real-Time Experimental Control with Graphical User Interface (REC-GUI) framework offers multiple advantages: (i) a modular design agnostic to coding language(s) and operating system(s) that maximizes experimental flexibility and minimizes researcher effort, (ii) simple interfacing to connect measurement and recording devices, (iii) high temporal fidelity by dividing task demands across CPUs, and (iv) real-time control using a fully customizable and intuitive GUI. Testing results demonstrate that the REC-GUI framework facilitates technically demanding, behavior-contingent neuroscience research. Sample code and hardware configurations are downloadable, and future developments will be regularly released.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/392571v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Diffusion MRI fiber tractography is widely used to probe the structural connectivity of the brain, with a range of applications in both clinical and basic neuroscience. Despite widespread use, tractography has well-known pitfalls that limits the anatomical accuracy of this technique. Numerous modern methods have been developed to address these shortcomings through advances in acquisition, modeling, and computation. To test whether these advances improve tractography accuracy, we organized the ISBI 2018 3D Validation of Tractography with Experimental MRI (3D VoTEM) challenge. We made available three unique independent tractography validation datasets, a physical phantom and two ex vivo brain specimens, resulting in 176 distinct submissions from 9 research groups. By comparing results over a wide range of fiber complexities and algorithmic strategies, this challenge provides a more comprehensive assessment of tractographys inherent limitations than has been reported previously. The central results were consistent across all sub-challenges in that, despite advances in tractography methods, the anatomical accuracy of tractography has not dramatically improved in recent years. Taken together, our results independently confirm findings from decades of tractography validation studies, demonstrate inherent limitations in reconstructing white matter pathways using diffusion MRI data alone, and highlight the need for alternative or combinatorial strategies to accurately map the fiber pathways of the brain.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The coordinated activity between remote brain regions underlies cognition and memory function. Although neuronal oscillations have been proposed as a mechanistic substrate for the coordination of information transfer and memory consolidation during sleep, little is known about the mechanisms that support the widespread synchronization of brain regions and the relationship of neuronal dynamics with other bodily rhythms, such as breathing. Here we address this question using large-scale recordings from a number of structures, including the medial prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, amygdala and nucleus accumbens in mice. We identify a dual mechanism of respiratory entrainment, in the form of an intracerebral corollary discharge that acts jointly with an olfactory reafference to coordinate limbic network dynamics, such as hippocampal ripples and cortical UP and DOWN states, involved in memory consolidation. These results highlight breathing, a perennial rhythmic input to the brain, as an oscillatory scaffold for the functional coordination of the limbic circuit, enabling the segregation and integration of information flow across neuronal networks.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/392290v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Alongside positive BOLD responses (PBR), a variety of negative BOLD responses (NBR) with distinct underlying mechanisms also occur. We identify five mechanisms of NBR: i) local/lateral/contralateral inhibition (LCI), ii) neuronal disruption of network activity (NDA), iii) altered balance of neuro-metabolic/vascular couplings (ANC), iv) arterial blood stealing (ABS), and v) venous blood backpressure (VBB). Detecting and classifying these mechanisms from BOLD signals is pivotal in understanding normal/pathological brain functions. This requires models and parameters with anatomical/functional interpretation that furnish the understanding of how these mechanisms are fingerprinted by their BOLD responses. Here, we used a windkessel model with viscoelastic compliance as well as dynamics of both neuronal and tissue/blood O2 to investigate the generation, detection, classification and interpretation of the BOLD hemodynamic response functions (HRF) of above mechanisms. Firstly, we evaluated the use of the general linear model to detect simulated NBRs. Secondly, we tested the ability of a machine learning classifier, built from a simulated ensemble of HRFs, to predict the mechanism underlying a new HRF. Crossvalidation indicates NDA and ANC can accurately be classified solely from fMRI BOLD signals; while LCI, ABS and VBB might require additional imaging modalities. Thirdly, we demonstrated that estimators of the model parameters determinant in the NBRs formation are accurate, and precise to certain resolutions. Finally, we successfully applied our detection/classification/estimation methodology to EEG-fMRI data in a clinical situation where several of these mechanisms could coexist. We believe that the proper identification and interpretation of NBR mechanisms have important clinical and cognitive implications in fMRI studies.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Excessive, synaptically-driven synchronization of subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons is widely thought to contribute to akinesia, bradykinesia, and rigidity in Parkinson's disease (PD). Electrophysiological, optogenetic, chemogenetic, genetic, 2-photon imaging, and pharmacological approaches revealed that the autonomous activity of STN neurons, which opposes synaptic synchronization, was downregulated in both toxin and genetic mouse models of PD. Loss of autonomous spiking was due to increased transmission of D2-striatal projection neurons, leading in the STN to elevated activation of NMDA receptors and generation of reactive oxygen species that promoted KATP channel opening. Chemogenetic restoration of autonomous firing in STN neurons reduced synaptic patterning and ameliorated Parkinsonian motor dysfunction, arguing that increasing autonomous STN activity is an effective therapeutic intervention in PD.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Unbiased Age-Appropriate Structural Brain Atlases for Chinese Pediatrics</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/385211v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of children brain development, structural brain atlases usually serve as important references of pediatric population in which individual images are spatially normalized into a common or standard stereotactic space. However, the existing popular children brain atlases (e.g., National Institutes of Health pediatric atlases, NIH-PD atlases) are made mostly based on MR images from Western populations, and are thus insufficient to characterize the brains of Chinese children due to the neuroanatomical differences that are relevant to genetic and environmental factors. By collecting high-quality T1- and T2-weighted MR images from 328 typically developing Chinese children aged from 6 to 12 years old, we created a set of age-appropriate Chinese pediatric (CHN-PD) atlases using an unbiased iterative template construction algorithm. The CHN-PD atlases included the head/brain templates, the symmetric brain template, the gender-specific brain templates and the corresponding tissue probability atlases. Moreover, the atlases contained multiple age-specific templates with a one-year interval. A direct comparison of the CHN-PD and the NIH-PD atlases revealed remarkable anatomical differences bilaterally in the lateral frontal and parietal regions and somatosensory cortex. While applying the CHN-PD atlases to two independent Chinese pediatric datasets (N = 114 and N = 71, respectively), machine-learning regression approaches revealed higher prediction accuracy on brain ages than the usage of NIH-PD atlases. These results suggest that the CHN-PD brain atlases are necessary and important for future typical and atypical developmental studies in Chinese pediatric population. Currently, the CHN-PD atlases have been released on the NITRC website (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/chn-pd).</content:encoded>

The spread of disease through human populations is complex. The characteristics of disease propagation evolve with time, as a result of a multitude of environmental and anthropic factors, this non-stationarity is a key factor in this huge complexity. In the absence of appropriate external data sources, to correctly describe the disease propagation, we explore a flexible approach, based on stochastic models for the disease dynamics, and on diffusion processes for the parameter dynamics. Using such a diffusion process has the advantage of not requiring a specific mathematical function for the parameter dynamics. Coupled with particle MCMC, this approach allows us to reconstruct the time evolution of some key parameters (average transmission rate for instance). Thus, by capturing the time-varying nature of the different mechanisms involved in disease propagation, the epidemic can be described. Firstly we demonstrate the efficiency of this methodology on a toy model, where the parameters and the observation process are known. Applied then to real datasets, our methodology is able, based solely on simple stochastic models, to reconstruct complex epidemics, such as flu or dengue, over long time periods. Hence we demonstrate that time-varying parameters can improve the accuracy of model performances, and we suggest that our methodology can be used as a first step towards a better understanding of a complex epidemic, in situation where data is limited and/or uncertain.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zWKoqREZG3A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Ventral Hippocampal Inputs Preferentially Drive Corticocortical Neurons in the Infralimbic Prefrontal Cortex</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/33/7351?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Inputs from the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) play a key role in working memory and emotional control. However, little is known about how excitatory inputs from the vHPC engage different populations of neurons in the PFC. Here we use optogenetics and whole-cell recordings to study the cell-type specificity of synaptic connections in acute slices from the mouse PFC. We first show that vHPC inputs target pyramidal neurons whose cell bodies are located in layer (L)2/3 and L5 of infralimbic (IL) PFC, but only in L5 of prelimbic (PL) PFC, and not L6 of either IL or PL. We then compare connections onto different classes of projection neurons located in these layers and subregions of PFC. We establish vHPC inputs similarly contact corticocortical (CC) and cortico-amygdala neurons in L2/3 of IL, but preferentially target CC neurons over cortico-pontine neurons in L5 of both IL and PL. Of all these neurons, we determine that vHPC inputs are most effective at driving action potential (AP) firing of CC neurons in L5 of IL. We also show this connection exhibits frequency-dependent facilitation, with repetitive activity enhancing AP firing of IL L5 CC neurons, even in the presence of feedforward inhibition. Our findings reveal how vHPC inputs engage defined populations of projection neurons in the PFC, allowing preferentially activation of the intratelencephalic network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We examined the impact of connections from the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) onto different projection neurons in the mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC). We found vHPC inputs were strongest at corticocortical neurons in layer 5 of infralimbic PFC, where they robustly evoked action potential firing, including during repetitive activity with intact feedforward inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neuropathic Pain Creates an Enduring Prefrontal Cortex Dysfunction Corrected by the Type II Diabetic Drug Metformin But Not by Gabapentin</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/33/7337?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chronic pain patients suffer from pain-related cognitive deficits, even when taking commonly prescribed analgesics. These deficits are likely related to pain-related maladaptive plasticity in the frontal cortex. We sought to model cognitive deficits in mice with neuropathic pain to examine maladaptive morphological plasticity in the mPFC and to assess the effects of several therapeutics. We used an attentional set-shifting task in mice with spared nerve injury (SNI) who received either a single intrathecal injection of an analgesic dose of clonidine, 7 d of 100 mg/kg gabapentin, or 7 d of 200 mg/kg metformin. Male SNI mice were significantly more impaired in the set-shifting task than females. This deficit correlated with a loss of parvalbumin (PV) and reductions in axon initial segment (AIS) length in layers 5/6 of the infralimbic (IL) cortex. Acute pain relief with clonidine had no effect on set-shifting performance, whereas pain relief via 7 day treatment with gabapentin worsened the impairment in both SNI and sham mice. Gabapentin reversed the PV loss in the IL but had no effect on AIS length. Treatment with the AMPK-activator metformin completely reversed the pain-related cognitive impairment and restored AIS length in the IL but had little effect on PV expression. Our findings reveal that neuropathic pain-related cognitive impairments in male mice are correlated to bilateral morphological changes in PV interneurons and layer 5/6 IL pyramidal neuron AIS. Pain relief with metformin can reverse some of the functional and anatomical changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Cognitive impairments are a comorbidity of neuropathic pain but are inadequately addressed by existing therapeutics. We used a neuropathic pain model in mice to demonstrate that male (but not female) mice show a robust pain-related deficit in attentional set-shifting, which is associated with structural plasticity in axon initial segments in the infralimbic cortex. These deficits were completely reversed by 7 day treatment with the antidiabetic drug metformin, suggesting that this drug can be repurposed for the treatment of neuropathic pain and its cognitive comorbidities. Our findings have implications for our understanding of how neuropathic pain causes structural plasticity in the brain, and they point to a marked sexual dimorphism in neuropathic pain mechanisms in mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Modulating Regional Motor Cortical Excitability with Noninvasive Brain Stimulation Results in Neurochemical Changes in Bilateral Motor Cortices</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/33/7327?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Learning a novel motor skill is dependent both on regional changes within the primary motor cortex (M1) contralateral to the active hand and also on modulation between and within anatomically distant but functionally connected brain regions. Interregional changes are particularly important in functional recovery after stroke, when critical plastic changes underpinning behavioral improvements are observed in both ipsilesional and contralesional M1s. It is increasingly understood that reduction in GABA in the contralateral M1 is necessary to allow learning of a motor task. However, the physiological mechanisms underpinning plasticity within other brain regions, most importantly the ipsilateral M1, are not well understood. Here, we used concurrent two-voxel magnetic resonance spectroscopy to simultaneously quantify changes in neurochemicals within left and right M1s in healthy humans of both sexes in response to transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied to left M1. We demonstrated a decrease in GABA in both the stimulated (left) and nonstimulated (right) M1 after anodal tDCS, whereas a decrease in GABA was only observed in nonstimulated M1 after cathodal stimulation. This GABA decrease in the nonstimulated M1 during cathodal tDCS was negatively correlated with microstructure of M1:M1 callosal fibers, as quantified by diffusion MRI, suggesting that structural features of these fibers may mediate GABA decrease in the unstimulated region. We found no significant changes in glutamate. Together, these findings shed light on the interactions between the two major network nodes underpinning motor plasticity, offering a potential framework from which to optimize future interventions to improve motor function after stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Learning of new motor skills depends on modulation both within and between brain regions. Here, we use a novel two-voxel magnetic resonance spectroscopy approach to quantify GABA and glutamate changes concurrently within the left and right primary motor cortex (M1) during three commonly used transcranial direct current stimulation montages: anodal, cathodal, and bilateral. We also examined how the neurochemical changes in the unstimulated hemisphere were related to white matter microstructure between the two M1s. Our results provide insights into the neurochemical changes underlying motor plasticity and may therefore assist in the development of further adjunct therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Closed-Loop Slow-Wave tACS Improves Sleep-Dependent Long-Term Memory Generalization by Modulating Endogenous Oscillations</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/33/7314?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Benefits in long-term memory retention and generalization have been shown to be related to sleep-dependent processes, which correlate with neural oscillations as measured by changes in electric potential. The specificity and causal role of these oscillations, however, are still poorly understood. Here, we investigated the potential for augmenting endogenous slow-wave (SW) oscillations in humans with closed-loop transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) with an aim toward enhancing the consolidation of recent experiences into long-term memory. Sixteen (three female) participants were trained presleep on a target detection task identifying targets hidden in complex visual scenes. During post-training sleep, closed-loop SW detection and stimulation were used to deliver tACS matching the phase and frequency of the dominant oscillation in the range of 0.5–1.2 Hz. Changes in performance were assessed the following day using test images that were identical to the training (&quot;repeated&quot;), and images generated from training scenes but with novel viewpoints (&quot;generalized&quot;). Results showed that active SW tACS during sleep enhanced the postsleep versus presleep target detection accuracy for the generalized images compared with sham nights, while no significant change was found for repeated images. Using a frequency-agnostic clustering approach sensitive to stimulation-induced spectral power changes in scalp EEG, this behavioral enhancement significantly correlated with both a poststimulation increase and a subsequent decrease in measured spectral power within the SW band, which in turn showed increased coupling with spindle amplitude. These results suggest that augmenting endogenous SW oscillations can enhance consolidation by specifically improving generalization over recognition or cued recall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This human study demonstrates the use of a closed-loop noninvasive brain stimulation method to enhance endogenous neural oscillations during sleep with the effect of improving consolidation of recent experiences into long-term memory. Here we show that transient slow oscillatory transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) triggered by endogenous slow oscillations and matching their frequency and phase can increase slow-wave power and coupling with spindles. Further, this increase correlates with overnight improvements in generalization of recent training to facilitate performance in a target detection task. We also provide novel evidence for a tACS-induced refractory period following the tACS-induced increase. Here slow-wave power is temporarily reduced relative to sham stimulation, which nonetheless maintains a positive relationship with behavioral improvements.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Increased Prefrontal Activity with Aging Reflects Nonspecific Neural Responses Rather than Compensation</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/33/7303?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Elevated prefrontal cortex activity is often observed in healthy older adults despite declines in their memory and other cognitive functions. According to one view, this activity reflects a compensatory functional posterior-to-anterior shift, which contributes to maintenance of cognitive performance when posterior cortical function is impaired. Alternatively, the increased prefrontal activity may be less efficient or less specific because of structural and neurochemical changes accompanying aging. These accounts are difficult to distinguish on the basis of average activity levels within brain regions. Instead, we used a novel, model-based multivariate analysis technique applied to two independent fMRI datasets from an adult-lifespan human sample (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 123 and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 115; approximately half female). Standard analysis replicated the age-related increase in average prefrontal activation, but multivariate tests revealed that this activity did not carry additional information. The results contradict the hypothesis of a compensatory posterior-to-anterior shift. Instead, they suggest that the increased prefrontal activation reflects reduced efficiency or specificity rather than compensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Functional brain imaging studies have often shown increased activity in prefrontal brain regions in older adults. This has been proposed to reflect a compensatory shift to greater reliance on prefrontal cortex (PFC), helping to maintain cognitive function. Alternatively, activity may become less specific as people age. This is a key question in the neuroscience of aging. In this study, we used novel tests of how different brain regions contribute to long- and short-term memory. We found increased activity in PFC in older adults, but this activity carried less information about memory outcomes than activity in visual regions. These findings are relevant for understanding why cognitive abilities decline with age, suggesting that optimal function depends on successful brain maintenance rather than compensation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Abnormal Low-Frequency Oscillations Reflect Trait-Like Pain Ratings in Chronic Pain Patients Revealed through a Machine Learning Approach</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/33/7293?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Measures of moment-to-moment fluctuations in brain activity of an individual at rest have been shown to be a sensitive and reliable metric for studying pathological brain mechanisms across various chronic pain patient populations. However, the relationship between pathological brain activity and clinical symptoms are not well defined. Therefore, we used regional BOLD signal variability/amplitude of low-frequency oscillations (LFOs) to identify functional brain abnormalities in the dynamic pain connectome in chronic pain patients that are related to chronic pain characteristics (i.e., pain intensity). Moreover, we examined whether there were sex-specific attributes of these functional brain abnormalities and whether functional brain abnormalities in patients is related to pain intensity characteristics on different time scales. We acquired resting-state functional MRI and quantified frequency-specific regional LFOs in chronic pain patients with ankylosing spondylitis. We found that patients exhibit frequency-specific aberrations in LFOs. Specifically, lower-frequency (slow-5) abnormalities were restricted to the ascending pain pathway (thalamus and S1), whereas higher-frequency abnormalities also included the default mode (i.e., posterior cingulate cortex; slow-3, slow-4) and salience (i.e., mid-cingulate cortex) networks (slow-4). Using a machine learning approach, we found that these abnormalities, in particular within higher frequencies (slow-3), can be used to make generalizable inferences about patients' average pain ratings (trait-like pain) but not current (i.e., state-like) pain levels. Furthermore, we identified sex differences in LFOs in patients that were not present in healthy controls. These novel findings reveal mechanistic brain abnormalities underlying the longer-lasting symptoms (trait pain intensity) in chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Measures of moment-to-moment fluctuations in brain activity of an individual at rest have been shown to be a reliable metric for studying functional brain associated with chronic pain. The current results demonstrate that dysfunction in these intrinsic fluctuations/oscillations in the ascending pain pathway, default mode network, and salience network during resting state display sex differences and can be used to make inferences about trait-like pain intensity ratings in chronic pain patients. These results provide robust and generalizable implications for investigating brain mechanisms associated with longer-lasting/trait-like chronic pain symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neuronal Correlates of Serial Decision-Making in the Supplementary Eye Field</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/33/7280?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human behavior is influenced by serial decision-making: past decisions affect choices that set the context for selecting future options. A primate brain region that may be involved in linking decisions across time is the supplementary eye field (SEF), which, in addition to its well known visual responses and saccade-related activity, also signals the rules that govern flexible decisions and the outcomes of those decisions. Our hypotheses were that SEF neurons encode events during serial decision-making and link the sequential decisions with sustained activity. We recorded from neurons in the SEF of two rhesus monkeys (&lt;i&gt;Macaca mulatta&lt;/i&gt;, one male, one female) that performed a serial decision-making task. The monkeys used saccades to select a rule that had to be applied later in the same trial to discriminate between visual stimuli. We found, first, that SEF neurons encoded the spatial parameters of saccades during rule selection but not during visual discrimination, suggesting a malleability to their movement-related tuning. Second, SEF activity linked the sequential decisions of rule selection and visual discrimination, but not continuously. Instead, rule-encoding activity appeared in a &quot;just-in-time&quot; manner before the visual discrimination. Third, SEF neurons encoded trial outcomes both prospectively, before decisions within a trial, and retrospectively, across multiple trials. The results thus identify neuronal correlates of rule selection and application in the SEF, including transient signals that link these sequential decisions. Its activity patterns suggest that the SEF participates in serial decision-making in a contextually dependent manner as part of a broader network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Much research has gone into studying the neurobiological basis of single, isolated decisions. An important next step is to understand how the brain links multiple decisions to generate a coherent stream of thought and behavior. We studied neural activity related to serial decision-making in an area of frontal cortex known as the supplementary eye field (SEF). Neural recordings were conducted in monkeys that performed a serial decision-making task in which they selected and applied rules. We found that SEF neurons convey signals for serial decision-making, including transient encoding of one decision at the time it is needed for the next one and longer-term representations of trial outcomes, suggesting that the region plays a role in continuity of cognition and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Emergence of an Adaptive Command for Orienting Behavior in Premotor Brainstem Neurons of Barn Owls</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/33/7270?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The midbrain map of auditory space commands sound-orienting responses in barn owls. Owls precisely localize sounds in frontal space but underestimate the direction of peripheral sound sources. This bias for central locations was proposed to be adaptive to the decreased reliability in the periphery of sensory cues used for sound localization by the owl. Understanding the neural pathway supporting this biased behavior provides a means to address how adaptive motor commands are implemented by neurons. Here we find that the sensory input for sound direction is weighted by its reliability in premotor neurons of the midbrain tegmentum of owls (male and female), such that the mean population firing rate approximates the head-orienting behavior. We provide evidence that this coding may emerge through convergence of upstream projections from the midbrain map of auditory space. We further show that manipulating the sensory input yields changes predicted by the convergent network in both premotor neural responses and behavior. This work demonstrates how a topographic sensory representation can be linearly read out to adjust behavioral responses by the reliability of the sensory input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This research shows how statistics of the sensory input can be integrated into a behavioral command by readout of a sensory representation. The firing rate of midbrain premotor neurons receiving sensory information from a topographic representation of auditory space is weighted by the reliability of sensory cues. We show that these premotor responses are consistent with a weighted convergence from the topographic sensory representation. This convergence was also tested behaviorally, where manipulation of stimulus properties led to bidirectional changes in sound localization errors. Thus a topographic representation of auditory space is translated into a premotor command for sound localization that is modulated by sensory reliability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Large-Scale, High-Resolution Comparison of the Core Visual Object Recognition Behavior of Humans, Monkeys, and State-of-the-Art Deep Artificial Neural Networks</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/33/7255?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Primates, including humans, can typically recognize objects in visual images at a glance despite naturally occurring identity-preserving image transformations (e.g., changes in viewpoint). A primary neuroscience goal is to uncover neuron-level mechanistic models that quantitatively explain this behavior by predicting primate performance for each and every image. Here, we applied this stringent behavioral prediction test to the leading mechanistic models of primate vision (specifically, deep, convolutional, artificial neural networks; ANNs) by directly comparing their behavioral signatures against those of humans and rhesus macaque monkeys. Using high-throughput data collection systems for human and monkey psychophysics, we collected more than one million behavioral trials from 1472 anonymous humans and five male macaque monkeys for 2400 images over 276 binary object discrimination tasks. Consistent with previous work, we observed that state-of-the-art deep, feedforward convolutional ANNs trained for visual categorization (termed DCNN&lt;sub&gt;IC&lt;/sub&gt; models) accurately predicted primate patterns of object-level confusion. However, when we examined behavioral performance for individual images within each object discrimination task, we found that all tested DCNN&lt;sub&gt;IC&lt;/sub&gt; models were significantly nonpredictive of primate performance and that this prediction failure was not accounted for by simple image attributes nor rescued by simple model modifications. These results show that current DCNN&lt;sub&gt;IC&lt;/sub&gt; models cannot account for the image-level behavioral patterns of primates and that new ANN models are needed to more precisely capture the neural mechanisms underlying primate object vision. To this end, large-scale, high-resolution primate behavioral benchmarks such as those obtained here could serve as direct guides for discovering such models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Recently, specific feedforward deep convolutional artificial neural networks (ANNs) models have dramatically advanced our quantitative understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying primate core object recognition. In this work, we tested the limits of those ANNs by systematically comparing the behavioral responses of these models with the behavioral responses of humans and monkeys at the resolution of individual images. Using these high-resolution metrics, we found that all tested ANN models significantly diverged from primate behavior. Going forward, these high-resolution, large-scale primate behavioral benchmarks could serve as direct guides for discovering better ANN models of the primate visual system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Archaeal Unfoldase Counteracts Protein Misfolding Retinopathy in Mice</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/33/7248?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deregulation of cellular proteostasis due to the failure of the ubiquitin proteasome system to dispose of misfolded aggregation-prone proteins is a hallmark of various neurodegenerative diseases in humans. Microorganisms have evolved to survive massive protein misfolding and aggregation triggered by heat shock using their protein-unfolding ATPases (unfoldases) from the Hsp100 family. Because the Hsp100 chaperones are absent in homoeothermic mammals, we hypothesized that the vulnerability of mammalian neurons to misfolded proteins could be mitigated by expressing a xenogeneic unfoldase. To test this idea, we expressed proteasome-activating nucleotidase (PAN), a protein-unfolding ATPase from thermophilic &lt;i&gt;Archaea&lt;/i&gt;, which is homologous to the 19S eukaryotic proteasome and similar to the Hsp100 family chaperones in rod photoreceptors of mice. We found that PAN had no obvious effect in healthy rods; however, it effectively counteracted protein-misfolding retinopathy in G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; knock-out mice. We conclude that archaeal PAN can rescue a protein-misfolding neurodegenerative disease, likely by recognizing misfolded mammalian proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This study demonstrates successful therapeutic application of an archaeal molecular chaperone in an animal model of neurodegenerative disease. Introducing the archaeal protein-unfolding ATPase proteasome-activating nucleotidase (PAN) into the retinal photoreceptors of mice protected these neurons from the cytotoxic effect of misfolded proteins.

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Gating of Sensory Input at Subcortical and Cortical Levels during Grasping in Humans</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/33/7237?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Afferent input from the periphery to the cortex contributes to the control of grasping. How sensory input is gated along the ascending sensory pathway and its functional role during gross and fine grasping in humans remain largely unknown. To address this question, we assessed somatosensory-evoked potential components reflecting activation at subcortical and cortical levels and psychophysical tests at rest, during index finger abduction, precision, and power grip. We found that sensory gating at subcortical level and in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), as well as intracortical inhibition in the S1, increased during power grip compared with the other tasks. To probe the functional relevance of gating in the S1, we examined somatosensory temporal discrimination threshold by measuring the shortest time interval to perceive a pair of electrical stimuli. Somatosensory temporal discrimination threshold increased during power grip, and higher threshold was associated with increased intracortical inhibition in the S1. These novel findings indicate that humans gate sensory input at subcortical level and in the S1 largely during gross compared with fine grasping. Inhibitory processes in the S1 may increase discrimination threshold to allow better performance during power grip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Most of our daily life actions involve grasping. Here, we demonstrate that gating of afferent input increases at subcortical level and in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) during gross compared with fine grasping in intact humans. The precise timing of sensory information is critical for human perception and behavior. Notably, we found that the ability to perceive a pair of electrical stimuli, as measured by the somatosensory temporal discrimination threshold, increased during power grip compared with the other tasks. We propose that reduced afferent input to the S1 during gross grasping behaviors diminishes temporal discrimination of sensory processes related, at least in part, to increased inhibitory processes within the S1.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cerebellar Processing Common to Delay and Trace Eyelid Conditioning</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/33/7221?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Results from previous lesion studies have been interpreted as evidence that the cerebellar cortex plays different roles for delay and trace conditioning of eyelid responses. However, the cerebellar cortex is organized by parasagittal stripes of Purkinje cells (PCs) that converge onto common deep nucleus neurons and receive common or related climbing fiber inputs. Based on this organization, we hypothesized that cerebellar tasks involving the same response system, such as delay and trace eyelid conditioning, would engage the same PCs and that the relationships between PC activity and expression of behavioral responses would be similar for both tasks. To test these hypotheses, we used tetrode recordings from eyelid PCs in rabbits during expression of delay- and trace-conditioned eyelid responses. Previous recording studies during delay conditioning described a strong relationship between eyelid PC activity and the kinematics of conditioned eyelid responses. The present results replicate these findings for delay conditioning and show that the same relationship exists during trace eyelid conditioning. During transitions from delay to trace responding, the relationship between eyelid PCs and behavioral responses was relatively stable. We found that an inverse firing rate model tuned to predict PC activity during one training paradigm could then predict equally well the PC activity during the other training paradigm. These results provide strong evidence that cerebellar cortex processing is similar for delay and trace eyelid conditioning and that the parasagittal organization of the cerebellum, not the conditioning paradigm, dictate which neurons are engaged to produce adaptively timed conditioned responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; A variety of evidence from eyelid conditioning and other cerebellar-dependent behaviors indicates that the cerebellar cortex is necessary for learning and proper timing of cerebellar learned responses. Debates exist about whether trace eyelid conditioning data show that fundamentally different mechanisms operate in the cerebellum during tasks when input from the forebrain is necessary for learning. We show here that learning-related changes in a specific population of Purkinje cells control the timing and amplitude of cerebellar responses the same way regardless of the inputs necessary to learn the task. Our results indicate the parasagittal organization of the cerebellar cortex, not the complexity of inputs to the cerebellum, determines which neurons are engaged in the learning and execution of cerebellar-mediated responses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Quantitative Association of Anatomical and Functional Classes of Olfactory Bulb Neurons</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/33/7204?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Juxtaglomerular cells (JGCs) of the olfactory bulb (OB) glomerular layer (GL) play a fundamental role in olfactory information processing. Their variability in morphology, physiology, and connectivity suggests distinct functions. The quantitative understanding of population-wise morphological and physiological properties and a comprehensive classification based on quantitative parameters, however, is still lacking, impeding the analysis of microcircuits. Here, we provide multivariate clustering of 95 &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; sampled cells from the GL of the mouse (male or female C57BL/6) OB and perform detailed morphological and physiological characterization for the seven computed JGC types. Using a classifier based on a subselection of parameters, we identified the neuron types in paired recordings to characterize their functional connectivity. We found that 4 of the 7 clusters comply with prevailing concepts of GL cell types, whereas the other 3 represent own distinct entities. We have labeled these entities horizontal superficial tufted cell (hSTC), vertical superficial tufted cell, and microglomerular cell (MGC): The hSTC is a tufted cell with a lateral dendrite that much like mitral cells and tufted cells receives excitatory inputs from the external tufted cell but likewise serves as an excitatory element for glomerular interneurons. The vertical superficial tufted cell, on the other hand, represents a tufted cell type with vertically projecting basal dendrites. We further define the MGC, characterized by a small dendritic tree and plateau action potentials. In addition to olfactory nerve-driven and external tufted cell driven interneurons, these MGCs represent a third functionally distinct type, the hSTC-driven interneurons. The presented correlative analysis helps to bridge the gap between branching patterns and cellular functional properties, permitting the integration of results from &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; recordings, advanced morphological tools, and connectomics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The variance of neuron properties is a feature across mammalian cerebral circuits, contributing to signal processing and adding computational robustness to the networks. It is particularly noticeable in the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb, the first site of olfactory information processing. We provide the first unbiased population-wise multivariate analysis to correlate morphological and physiological parameters of juxtaglomerular cells. We identify seven cell types, including four previously described neuron types, and identify further three distinct classes. The presented correlative analysis of morphological and physiological parameters gives an opportunity to predict morphological classes from physiological measurements or the functional properties of neurons from morphology and opens the way to integrate results from &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; recordings, advanced morphological tools, and connectomics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/33/7193?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Reinforcement learning is the process by which an agent learns to predict long-term future reward. We now understand a great deal about the brain's reinforcement learning algorithms, but we know considerably less about the representations of states and actions over which these algorithms operate. A useful starting point is asking what kinds of representations we would want the brain to have, given the constraints on its computational architecture. Following this logic leads to the idea of the successor representation, which encodes states of the environment in terms of their predictive relationships with other states. Recent behavioral and neural studies have provided evidence for the successor representation, and computational studies have explored ways to extend the original idea. This paper reviews progress on these fronts, organizing them within a broader framework for understanding how the brain negotiates tradeoffs between efficiency and flexibility for reinforcement learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Synapses in hippocampal area CA1 are known for a robust capacity for long-term potentiation (LTP), whereas synapses in the stratum radiatum of hippocampal area CA2 are particularly resistant to such changes. Although we have yet to fully understand the mechanisms behind this resistance to plasticity, a number of genes and extracellular matrix components highly expressed in CA2 appear to function as molecular brakes on plasticity and develop postnatally in the rodent brain. Curiously, the developmental profile of several CA2-enriched molecules is suggestive of a still undefined critical window of plasticity in the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

tissue microstructure and allows for the estimation of compartmental diffusion

to make the problem less ambiguous, however, it still remained unclear whether

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Structural basis for Scc3-dependent cohesin recruitment to chromatin</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38356</link>
	<content:encoded>The cohesin ring complex is required for numerous chromosomal transactions, including sister chromatid cohesion, DNA damage repair and transcriptional regulation. How cohesin engages its chromatin substrate has remained an unresolved question. We show here, by determining a crystal structure of the budding yeast cohesin HEAT-repeat subunit Scc3 bound to a fragment of the Scc1 kleisin subunit and DNA, that Scc3 and Scc1 together form a composite DNA interaction module. The Scc3-Scc1 subcomplex engages double-strand DNA through a conserved, positively charged surface. We demonstrate that this conserved domain is required for DNA binding by Scc3-Scc1 &lt;i&gt;in vitro,&lt;/i&gt; as well as for the enrichment of cohesin on chromosomes and for cell viability. These findings suggest that the Scc3-Scc1 DNA-binding interface plays a central role in the recruitment of cohesin complexes to chromosomes and therefore for cohesin to faithfully execute its functions during cell division.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Optogenetic dissection of mitotic spindle positioning in vivo</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38198</link>
	<content:encoded>The position of the mitotic spindle determines the plane of cell cleavage, and thereby daughter cell location, size, and content. Spindle positioning is driven by dynein-mediated pulling forces exerted on astral microtubules, which requires an evolutionarily conserved complex of Gα-GDP, GPR-1/2&lt;sup&gt;Pins/LGN&lt;/sup&gt;, and LIN-5&lt;sup&gt;Mud/NuMA&lt;/sup&gt; proteins. To examine individual functions of the complex components, we developed a genetic strategy for light-controlled localization of endogenous proteins in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; embryos. By replacing Gα and GPR-1/2 with a light-inducible membrane anchor, we demonstrate that Gα-GDP, Gα-GTP, and GPR-1/2 are not required for pulling-force generation. In the absence of Gα and GPR-1/2, cortical recruitment of LIN-5, but not dynein itself, induced high pulling forces. The light-controlled localization of LIN-5 overruled normal cell-cycle and polarity regulation and provided experimental control over the spindle and cell-cleavage plane. Our results define Gα∙GDP-GPR-1/2 Pins/LGN as a regulatable membrane anchor, and LIN-5&lt;sup&gt;Mud/NuMA&lt;/sup&gt; as a potent activator of dynein-dependent spindle-positioning forces.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37558</link>
	<content:encoded>Voltage-activated potassium (Kv) channels open to conduct K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions in response to membrane depolarization, and subsequently enter non-conducting states through distinct mechanisms of inactivation. X-ray structures of detergent-solubilized Kv channels appear to have captured an open state even though a non-conducting C-type inactivated state would predominate in membranes in the absence of a transmembrane voltage. However, structures for a voltage-activated ion channel in a lipid bilayer environment have not yet been reported. Here we report the structure of the Kv1.2–2.1 paddle chimera channel reconstituted into lipid nanodiscs using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. At a resolution of ~3 Å for the cytosolic domain and ~4 Å for the transmembrane domain, the structure determined in nanodiscs is similar to the previously determined X-ray structure. Our findings show that large differences in structure between detergent and lipid bilayer environments are unlikely, and enable us to propose possible structural mechanisms for C-type inactivation.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Acute control of the sleep switch in Drosophila reveals a role for gap junctions in regulating behavioral responsiveness</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37105</link>
	<content:encoded>Sleep is a dynamic process in most animals, involving distinct stages that probably achieve multiple functions for the brain. Before sleep functions can be initiated, it is likely that behavioral responsiveness to the outside world needs to be reduced first, even while animals are still awake. Recent work in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila &lt;/i&gt;has uncovered a sleep switch in the dorsal fan-shaped body (dFB) of the fly's central brain, but it is unknown if these sleep-promoting neurons also govern the acute need to ignore salient stimuli in the environment during sleep transitions. We found that optogenetic activation of the sleep switch suppressed behavioral responsiveness to mechanical stimuli, even in awake flies, indicating a broader role for these neurons in regulating arousal. The dFB-mediated suppression mechanism and its associated neural correlates requires &lt;i&gt;innexin6&lt;/i&gt; expression, suggesting that the acute need to reduce sensory perception when flies fall asleep is mediated in part by electrical synapses.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Constraints on neural redundancy</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36774</link>
	<content:encoded>Millions of neurons drive the activity of hundreds of muscles, meaning many different neural population activity patterns could generate the same movement. Studies have suggested that these redundant (i.e., behaviorally equivalent) activity patterns may be beneficial for neural computation. However, it is unknown what constraints may limit the selection of different redundant activity patterns. We leveraged a brain-computer interface, allowing us to define precisely which neural activity patterns were redundant. Rhesus monkeys made cursor movements by modulating neural activity in primary motor cortex. We attempted to predict the observed distribution of redundant neural activity. Principles inspired by work on muscular redundancy did not accurately predict these distributions. Surprisingly, the distributions of redundant neural activity and task-relevant activity were coupled, which enabled accurate predictions of the distributions of redundant activity. This suggests limits on the extent to which redundancy may be exploited by the brain for computation.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: The Peptidisc, a simple method for stabilizing membrane proteins in detergent-free solution</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34085</link>
	<content:encoded>Membrane proteins are difficult to work with due to their insolubility in aqueous solution and quite often their poor stability in detergent micelles. Here, we present the peptidisc for their facile capture into water-soluble particles. Unlike the nanodisc, which requires scaffold proteins of different lengths and precise amounts of matching lipids, reconstitution of detergent solubilized proteins in peptidisc only requires a short amphipathic bi-helical peptide (NSP&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;) and no extra lipids. Multiple copies of the peptide wrap around to shield the membrane-exposed part of the target protein. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this ‘one size fits all’ method using five different membrane protein assemblies (MalFGK&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, FhuA, SecYEG, OmpF, BRC) during ‘on-column’, ‘in-gel’, and ‘on-bead’ reconstitution embedded within the membrane protein purification protocol. The peptidisc method is rapid and cost-effective, and it may emerge as a universal tool for high-throughput stabilization of membrane proteins to advance modern biological studies.</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Open Access: Dominant men are faster in decision-making situations and exhibit a distinct neural signal for promptness</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Social dominance, the main organizing principle of social hierarchies, facilitates priority access to resources by dominant individuals. Throughout taxa, individuals are more likely to become dominant if they act first in social situations and acting fast may provide evolutionary advantage; yet whether fast decision-making is a behavioral predisposition of dominant persons outside of social contexts is not known. Following characterization of participants for social dominance motivation, we found that, indeed, men high in social dominance respond faster–without loss of accuracy–than those low in dominance across a variety of decision-making tasks. Both groups did not differ in a simple reaction task. Then, we selected a decision-making task and applied high-density electroencephalography (EEG) to assess temporal dynamics of brain activation through event related potentials. We found that promptness to respond in the choice task in dominant individuals is related to a strikingly amplified brain signal at approximately 240 ms post-stimulus presentation. Source imaging analyses identified higher activity in the left insula and in the cingulate, right inferior temporal and right angular gyri in high than in low dominance participants. Our findings suggest that promptness to respond in choice situations, regardless of social context, is a biomarker for social disposition.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Here we investigated the sex-specific effects of the CACNA1C variant rs1024582 on psychiatry-related traits, brain activity during tasks and rest, and brain volume in 1207 normal male and female subjects. After correcting for multiple comparisons, there were significant interaction effects between sex and the minor allele of this polymorphism on the hostile behavior subscale scores of the Coronary-Prone Type Scale mediated by higher scores in female carriers of the minor allele. Imaging analyses revealed significant interaction effects between sex and the minor allele on fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and on brain activity during the 2-back task in areas of the right posterior cingulate cortex, right thalamus, and right hippocampus, which were all mediated by reduced activity in female carriers of the minor allele. Our results demonstrated that the rs1024582 risk variant of CACNA1C is associated with reduced activity in the frontolimbic regions at rest and during a working memory task as well as with greater hostility in females in the healthy population.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Functional Role of Large-scale Brain Network Coordination in Placebo-induced Anxiolysis</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Anxiety reduction through mere expectation of anxiolytic treatment effects (placebo anxiolysis) has enormous clinical importance. Recent behavioral and electrophysiological data suggest that placebo anxiolysis involves reduced vigilance and enhanced internalization of attention; however, the underlying neurobiological mechanisms are not yet clear. Given the fundamental function of intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) in basic cognitive processes, we investigated ICN activity patterns associated with externally and internally directed mental states under the influence of an anxiolytic placebo medication. Based on recent findings, we specifically analyzed the functional role of the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) in coordinating placebo-dependent cue-related (phasic) and cue-unrelated (sustained) network activity. Under placebo, we observed a down-regulation of the entire salience network (SN), particularly in response to threatening cues. The rACC exhibited enhanced cue-unrelated functional connectivity (FC) with the SN, which correlated with reductions in tonic arousal and anxiety. Hence, apart from the frequently reported modulation of aversive cue responses, the rACC appears to be crucially involved in exerting a tonically dampening control over salience-responsive structures. In line with a more internally directed mental state, we also found enhanced FC within the default mode network (DMN), again predicting reductions in anxiety under placebo.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: An Autism-Related, Nonsense Foxp1 Mutant Induces Autophagy and Delays Radial Migration of the Cortical Neurons</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy185/5074517?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that has a strong genetic component. Disruptions of FOXP1, a transcription factor expressed in the developing cerebral cortex, were associated with ASD. FOXP1(R525X) is a de novo heterozygous mutation found in patients with autism and severe mental retardation. To explore the neuronal basis of FOXP1(R525X) in ASD, we created Foxp1(R521X), a mouse homolog of the human variant. Ectopic expression of Foxp1(R521X) led to cytoplasmic aggregates and activated macroautophagy in neuroblastoma N2a cells and the developing neuronal cells. Cortical neurons expressing Foxp1(R521X) exhibited delayed migration and altered dendritic morphology. As a control, mutant Y435X that was expressed diffusively in the cytoplasm did not induce autophagy and migration delay in the cortex. The embryonic cortical cells had a minimal activity of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) as assayed by a splicing-dependent NMD reporter. We hypothesize that the developing neuronal cells use autophagy but not NMD as a safeguard mechanism against nonsense mutant aggregates, resulting in impairment of the cortical development. This study suggests a novel mechanism other than heterozygous loss of FOXP1 for the development of ASD and may advance our understanding of the complex relationships between gene mutation and the related psychiatric disorders.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The respective roles of occipital, parietal, and frontal cortices in visual working memory maintenance have long been under debate. Previous work on whether parietal and frontal regions convey mnemonic information has yielded mixed findings. One possibility for this variability is that the mnemonic representations in high-level frontoparietal regions are modulated by attentional priority, such as temporal order. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether the most recent item, which has a higher attentional priority in terms of temporal order, is preferentially encoded in frontoparietal regions. On each trial, participants viewed 2 gratings with different orientations in succession, and were cued to remember one of them. Using fMRI and an inverted encoding model, we reconstructed population-level, orientation representations in occipital (V1–V3), parietal (IPS), and frontal (FEF) areas during memory maintenance. Unlike early visual cortex where robust orientation representations were observed regardless of serial order, parietal, and frontal cortices showed stronger representations when participants remembered the second grating. A subsequent experiment using a change detection task on color rings excluded the possibilities of residual stimulus-driven signals or motor preparative signals for responses. These results suggest that mnemonic representations in parietal and frontal cortices are modulated by temporal-order-based attentional priority signals.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Aberrant network interaction might therefore be a key neural feature of mental disorders that involve emotion dysregulation. Here we tested whether connectivity hierarchies within and between emotion reactivity and cognitive reappraisal networks distinguishes social anxiety disorder (SAD) patients (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 70) from healthy controls (HC) (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 25). To investigate network organization, we implemented a graph-theory method called Dependency Network Analysis. Participants underwent fMRI while watching or reappraising video clips involving interpersonal verbal criticism. During reappraisal, the reappraisal network exerted less influence on the reactivity network in SAD participants. Specifically, the influence of the right inferior frontal gyrus on both reappraisal and reactivity networks was significantly reduced in SAD compared with HC, and correlated negatively with negative emotion ratings among SAD participants. Surprisingly, the amygdala exhibited reduced influence on the reappraisal network in SAD relative to HC. Yet, during the watch condition, the left amygdala’s influence on the reactivity network increased with greater social anxiety symptoms among SAD participants. These findings refine our understanding of network organization that contributes to efficient reappraisal or to disturbances in applying this strategy in SAD.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Nevertheless, the neurobiological mechanisms linking adolescent nicotine exposure to mood and anxiety disorders are not known. Disturbances in the mesocorticolimbic dopamine (DA) system, comprising the prefrontal cortex (PFC), ventral tegmental area (VTA), and nucleus accumbens (NAc), are correlates of mood and anxiety-related symptoms and this circuitry is strongly influenced by acute or chronic nicotine exposure. Using a combination of behavioral pharmacology, in vivo neuronal electrophysiology and molecular analyses, we examined and compared the effects of chronic nicotine exposure in rats during adolescence versus adulthood to characterize the mechanisms by which adolescent nicotine may selectively confer increased risk of developing mood and anxiety-related symptoms in later life. We report that exposure to nicotine, selectively during adolescence, induces profound and long-lasting neuronal, molecular and behavioral disturbances involving PFC DA D1R and downstream extracellular-signal-related kinase 1-2 (ERK 1-2) signaling. Remarkably, adolescent nicotine induced a persistent state of hyperactive DA activity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) concomitant with hyperactive neuronal activity states in the PFC. Our findings identify several unique neuronal and molecular biomarkers that may serve as functional risk mechanisms for the long-lasting neuropsychiatric effects of adolescent smoking behaviors.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Action potentials in mesostriatal dopamine (DA) neurons encode the motivational value of salient stimuli. DA neurons possess extensively branched axonal arbours, and how action potentials are converted to DA output will be influenced dynamically and critically by axonal mechanisms that are poorly understood. We explored the role for mechanisms governing release probability and axonal excitability in determining short-term plasticity (STP) of DA release, using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in ex vivo mouse striatum. The brief short-term facilitation (STF) and longer short-term depression (STD) seen were only weakly dependent on initial release. Rather, STP was strongly governed by release-independent mechanisms that involved K+-dependent axonal excitability and surprisingly, the dopamine transporter (DAT), particularly in dorsal striatum. The DAT acts as a master regulator of DA STP, governing the balance between release-dependent and release-independent mechanisms that also show region-specific gating.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Narrowly confined and glomerulus-specific onset latencies of odor-evoked calcium transients in the periglomerular cells of the mouse main olfactory bulb</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/392274v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Odor information is transmitted from olfactory sensory neurons to principal neurons at the glomeruli of the olfactory bulb. The intraglomerular neuronal circuit also includes hundreds of GABAergic interneurons referred to as periglomerular (PG) cells. Stimulus selectivity is well correlated among PG cells that are associated with the same glomerulus, consistent with their highly homogeneous sensory inputs. However, much less is known about the temporal aspects of their activity, including the temporal coordination of their odor-evoked responses. As many PG cells within a glomerular module respond to the same stimulus, the extent to which their activity is temporally aligned will affect the temporal profile of their population inhibitory inputs. Using random-access high-speed two-photon microscopy, we recorded the odor-evoked calcium transients of mouse PG cells and compared the onset latency and rise time among neurons putatively associated with the same and different glomeruli. Whereas the overall onset latencies of odor-evoked transients were distributed across a ~150 ms time window, those from cells putatively associated with the same glomerulus were confined to a much narrower window of several tens of milliseconds. This result suggests that onset latency primarily depends on the associated glomerulus. We also observed glomerular specificity in the rise time. The glomerulus-specific temporal pattern of odor-evoked activity implies that the temporal patterns of inhibitory inputs are unique to individual glomerulus-odor pairs, which may contribute to efficient shaping of the temporal pattern of activity in the principal neurons.</content:encoded>

The hippocampus is known to store cognitive representations, or maps, that encode both positional and contextual information, critical for episodic memories and functional behavior. How path integration and contextual cues are dynamically combined and processed by the hippocampus to maintain these representations accurate over time remains unclear. To answer this question, we propose a two-way data analysis and modeling approach to CA3 multi-electrode recordings of a moving rat submitted to rapid changes of contextual (light) cues, triggering back-and-forth instabitilies between two cognitive representations (“teleportation” experiment of Jezek et al). We develop a dual neural activity decoder, capable of independently identifying the recalled cognitive map at high temporal resolution (comparable to theta cycle) and the position of the rodent given a map. Remarkably, position can be reconstructed at any time with an accuracy comparable to fixed-context periods, even during highly unstable periods. These findings provide evidence for the capability of the hippocampal neural activity to maintain an accurate encoding of spatial and contextual variables, while one of these variables undergoes rapid changes independently of the other. To explain this result we introduce an attractor neural network model for the hippocampal activity that process inputs from external cues and the path integrator. Our model allows us to make predictions on the frequency of the cognitive map instability, its duration, and the detailed nature of the place-cell population activity, which are validated by a further analysis of the data. Our work therefore sheds light on the mechanisms by which the hippocampal network achieves and updates multi-dimensional neural representations from various input streams.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0tmzKAkXbig&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Interplay of multiple pathways and activity-dependent rules in STDP</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/PZXMmsAWq-I/article</link>

Hebbian plasticity describes a basic mechanism for synaptic plasticity whereby synaptic weights evolve depending on the relative timing of paired activity of the pre- and postsynaptic neurons. Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) constitutes a central experimental and theoretical synaptic Hebbian learning rule. Various mechanisms, mostly calcium-based, account for the induction and maintenance of STDP. Classically STDP is assumed to gradually emerge in a monotonic way as the number of pairings increases. However, non-monotonic STDP accounting for fast associative learning led us to challenge this monotonicity hypothesis and explore how the existence of multiple plasticity pathways affects the dynamical establishment of plasticity. To account for distinct forms of STDP emerging from increasing numbers of pairings and the variety of signaling pathways involved, we developed a general class of simple mathematical models of plasticity based on calcium transients and accommodating various calcium-based plasticity mechanisms. These mechanisms can either compete or cooperate for the establishment of long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD), that emerge depending on past calcium activity. Our model reproduces accurately the striatal STDP that involves endocannabinoid and NMDAR signaling pathways. Moreover, we predict how stimulus frequency alters plasticity, and how triplet rules are affected by the number of pairings. We further investigate the general model with an arbitrary number of pathways and show that depending on those pathways and their properties, a variety of plasticities may emerge upon variation of the number and/or the frequency of pairings, even when the outcome after large numbers of pairings is identical. These findings, built upon a biologically realistic example and generalized to other applications, argue that in order to fully describe synaptic plasticity it is not sufficient to record STDP curves at fixed pairing numbers and frequencies. In fact, considering the whole spectrum of activity-dependent parameters could have a great impact on the description of plasticity, and a better understanding of the engram.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PZXMmsAWq-I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Prospective Analysis of the Effects of Maternal Immune Activation on Rat Cytokines during Pregnancy and Behavior of the Male Offspring Relevant to Schizophrenia</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0249-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Influenza during pregnancy is associated with the development of psychopathology in the offspring. We sought to determine if maternal cytokines produced following administration of viral mimetic polyI:C to pregnant rats were predictive of behavioral abnormalities in the adult offspring. Timed-pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats received a single intravenous injection of 4 mg/kg polyI:C or saline on gestational day 15. Blood was collected for serum analysis of cytokine levels with ELISA. Male offspring were tested in a battery of behavioral tests at adulthood and behavior correlated with maternal cytokine levels. Maternal serum levels of CXCL1 and IL-6, but not TNF-α or CXCL2, were elevated in polyI:C-treated dams. PolyI:C-treated dams experienced post-treatment weight loss and polyI:C pups were smaller than controls at postnatal day 1. Various behavior alterations were seen in the polyI:C-treated offspring. Male polyI:C offspring had enhanced MK-801-induced locomotion, and reduced sociability. PolyI:C offspring failed to display crossmodal and visual memory, and oddity preference was also impaired. Set-shifting, assessed with a lever-based operant conditioning task, was facilitated while touchscreen-based reversal learning was impaired. Correlations were found between maternal serum concentrations of CXCL1, acute maternal temperature and body weight changes, neonatal pup mass, and odd object discrimination and social behavior. Overall, while the offspring of polyI:C-treated rats displayed behavior abnormalities, maternal serum cytokines were not related to the long-term behavior changes in the offspring. Maternal sickness effects and neonatal pup size may be better indicators of later effects in the offspring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Psychiatric pathology is complex, poorly understood, and often results in chronic illness. Many psychiatric conditions are believed to occur as a result of genetic and environmental factors. Gestational adversity such as inflammation in pregnancy may act as a priming experience for the later emergence of psychopathologies, and accurate identification of risk factors may advise early interventions. We sought to characterize long-term behavior effects in the offspring of rats exposed to an inflammatory event during pregnancy and relate these effects to the serum levels of relevant cytokines CXCL1, IL-6, and TNF-α. Our results suggest that these maternal cytokines are not strongly related to offspring behavior outcomes, and other measures may have greater value as predictors of behavior outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Microstructural White Matter Abnormalities in the Dorsal Cingulum of Adolescents with IBS</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/4/ENEURO.0354-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Alterations in fractional anisotropy (FA) have been considered to reflect microstructural white matter (WM) changes in disease conditions; however, no study to date has examined WM changes using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in adolescents with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The objective of the present study was two-fold: (1) to determine whether differences in FA, and other non-FA metrics, were present in adolescents with IBS compared to healthy controls using whole-brain, region of interest (ROI)-restricted tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) and canonical ROI DTI analyses for the cingulum bundle, and (2) to determine whether these metrics were related to clinical measures of disease duration and pain intensity in the IBS group. A total of 16 adolescents with a Rome III diagnosis of IBS (females = 12; mean age = 16.29, age range: 11.96–18.5 years) and 16 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (females = 12; mean age = 16.24; age range: 11.71–20.32 years) participated in this study. Diffusion-weighted images were acquired using a Siemens 3-T Trio Tim Syngo MRI scanner with a 32-channel head coil. The ROI-restricted TBSS and canonical ROI-based DTI analyses revealed that adolescents with IBS showed decreased FA in the right dorsal cingulum bundle compared to controls. No relationship between FA and disease severity measures was found. Microstructural WM alterations in the right dorsal cingulum bundle in adolescents with IBS may reflect a premorbid brain state or the emergence of a disease-driven process that results from complex changes in pain- and affect-related processing via spinothalamic and corticolimbic pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Connectivity-Driven Brain Parcellation via Consensus Clustering. (arXiv:1808.04262v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04262</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We present two related methods for deriving connectivity-based brain atlases
from individual connectomes. The proposed methods exploit a previously proposed
dense connectivity representation, termed continuous connectivity, by first
performing graph-based hierarchical clustering of individual brains, and
subsequently aggregating the individual parcellations into a consensus
parcellation. The search for consensus minimizes the sum of cluster membership
distances, effectively estimating a pseudo-Karcher mean of individual
parcellations. We assess the quality of our parcellations using (1)
Kullback-Liebler and Jensen-Shannon divergence with respect to the dense
connectome representation, (2) inter-hemispheric symmetry, and (3) performance
of the simplified connectome in a biological sex classification task. We find
that the parcellation based-atlas computed using a greedy search at a
hierarchical depth 3 outperforms all other parcellation-based atlases as well
as the standard Dessikan-Killiany anatomical atlas in all three assessments.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04196</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Power laws in nature are considered to be signatures of complexity. The
theory of self-organized criticality (SOC) was proposed to explain their
origins. A longstanding principle of SOC is the \emph{separation of timescales}
axiom. It dictates that external input is delivered to the system at a much
slower rate compared to the timescale of internal dynamics. The statistics of
neural avalanches in the brain was demonstrated to follow a power law,
indicating closeness to a critical state. Moreover, criticality was shown to be
a beneficial state for various computations leading to the hypothesis, that the
brain is a SOC system. However, for neuronal systems that are constantly
bombarded by incoming signals, separation of timescales assumption is
unnatural. Recently it was experimentally demonstrated that a proper correction
of the avalanche detection algorithm to account for the increased drive during
task performance leads to a change of the power-law exponent from $1.5$ to
approximately $1.3$, but there is so far no theoretical explanation for this
change. Here we investigate the importance of timescales separation, by partly
abandoning it in various models. We achieve it by allowing for external input
during the avalanche, without compromising the separation of avalanches. We
develop an analytic treatment and provide numerical simulations of a simple
neuronal model.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03958</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal circuits formed in the brain are complex with intricate connection
patterns. Such a complexity is also observed in the retina as a relatively
simple neuronal circuit. A retinal ganglion cell receives excitatory inputs
from neurons in previous layers as driving forces to fire spikes. Analytical
methods are required that can decipher these components in a systematic manner.
Recently a method termed spike-triggered non-negative matrix factorization
(STNMF) has been proposed for this purpose. In this study, we extend the scope
of the STNMF method. By using the retinal ganglion cell as a model system, we
show that STNMF can detect various biophysical properties of upstream bipolar
cells, including spatial receptive fields, temporal filters, and transfer
nonlinearity. In addition, we recover synaptic connection strengths from the
weight matrix of STNMF. Furthermore, we show that STNMF can separate spikes of
a ganglion cell into a few subsets of spikes where each subset is contributed
by one presynaptic bipolar cell. Taken together, these results corroborate that
STNMF is a useful method for deciphering the structure of neuronal circuits.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A single coordinate framework for optic flow and binocular disparity. (arXiv:1808.03875v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03875</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Optic flow is two dimensional, but no special qualities are attached to one
or other of these dimensions. For binocular disparity, on the other hand, the
terms 'horizontal' and 'vertical' disparities are commonly used. This is odd,
since binocular disparity and optic flow describe essentially the same thing.
The difference is that, generally, people tend to fixate relatively close to
the direction of heading as they move, meaning that fixation is close to the
optic flow epipole, whereas, for binocular vision, fixation is close to the
head-centric midline, i.e. approximately 90 degrees from the binocular epipole.
For fixating animals, some separations of flow may lead to simple algorithms
for the judgement of surface structure and the control of action. We consider
the following canonical flow patterns that sum to produce overall flow: (i)
'towards' flow, the component of translational flow produced by approaching (or
retreating from) the fixated object, which produces pure radial flow on the
retina; (ii) 'sideways' flow, the remaining component of translational flow,
which is produced by translation of the optic centre orthogonal to the
cyclopean line of sight and (iii) 'vergence' flow, rotational flow produced by
a counter-rotation of the eye in order to maintain fixation. A general flow
pattern could also include (iv) 'cyclovergence' flow, produced by rotation of
one eye relative to the other about the line of sight. We consider some
practical advantages of dividing up flow in this way when an observer fixates
as they move. As in some previous treatments, we suggest that there are certain
tasks for which it is sensible to consider 'towards' flow as one component and
'sideways' + 'vergence' flow as another.

	<content:encoded>The labeling and identification of long-range axonal inputs from multiple sources within densely reconstructed EM datasets from mammalian brains has been notoriously difficult because of the limited color label space of EM. Here, we report FluoEM for the identification of multi-color fluorescently labeled axons in dense EM data without the need for artificial fiducial marks or chemical label conversion. The approach is based on correlated tissue imaging and computational matching of neurite reconstructions, amounting to a virtual color labeling of axons in dense EM circuit data. We show that the identification of fluorescent light- microscopically (LM) imaged axons in 3D EM data from mouse cortex is faithfully possible as soon as the EM dataset is about 40-50 µm in extent, relying on the unique trajectories of axons in dense mammalian neuropil. The method is exemplified for the identification of long-distance axonal input into layer 1 of the mouse cerebral cortex.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38325</link>
	<content:encoded>Wnts are evolutionarily conserved signaling proteins with essential roles in development and disease that have often been thought to spread between cells and signal at a distance. However, recent studies have challenged this model, and whether long-distance extracellular Wnt dispersal occurs and is biologically relevant is debated. Understanding fundamental aspects of Wnt dispersal has been limited by challenges with observing endogenous ligands &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, which has prevented directly testing hypotheses. Here, we have generated functional, fluorescently tagged alleles for a &lt;i&gt;C. elegans &lt;/i&gt;Wnt homolog and for the first time visualized a native, long-range Wnt gradient in a living animal. Live imaging of Wnt along with source and responding cell membranes provided support for free, extracellular dispersal. By limiting Wnt transfer between cells, we confirmed that extracellular spreading shapes a long-range gradient and is critical for neuroblast migration. These results provide direct evidence that Wnts spread extracellularly to regulate aspects of long-range signaling.</content:encoded>

We hypothesized that β1(SCN1B) - mediated adhesion scaffolds &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-activating Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.5 (SCN5A) channels within narrow (&amp;lt;30 nm) perinexal clefts adjacent to gap junctions (GJs), facilitating ephaptic coupling. Super-resolution imaging indicated preferential β1 localization at the perinexus, where it co-locates with Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.5. Smart patch clamp (SPC) indicated greater sodium current density (I&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt;) at perinexi, relative to non-junctional sites. A novel, rationally designed peptide, βadp1, potently and selectively inhibited β1-mediated adhesion, in electric cell-substrate impedance sensing studies. βadp1 significantly widened perinexi in guinea pig ventricles, and selectively reduced perinexal I&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt;, but not whole cell I&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt;, in myocyte monolayers. In optical mapping studies, βadp1 precipitated arrhythmogenic conduction slowing. In summary, β1-mediated adhesion at the perinexus facilitates action potential propagation between cardiomyocytes, and may represent a novel target for anti-arrhythmic therapies.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Neural selectivity to orientation is one of the simplest and most thoroughly-studied cortical sensory features. Here, we show that a large body of research that purported to measure orientation tuning may have in fact been inadvertently measuring sensitivity to second-order changes in luminance, a phenomenon we term ‘vignetting'. Using a computational model of neural responses in primary visual cortex (V1), we demonstrate the impact of vignetting on simulated V1 responses. We then used the model to generate a set of predictions, which we confirmed with functional MRI experiments in human observers. Our results demonstrate that stimulus vignetting can wholly determine the orientation selectivity of responses in visual cortex measured at a macroscopic scale, and suggest a reinterpretation of a well-established literature on orientation processing in visual cortex.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36726</link>
	<content:encoded>Brain computations rely on a proper balance between excitation and inhibition which progressively emerges during postnatal development in rodent. g-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission supports inhibition in the adult brain but excites immature rodent neurons. Alterations in the timing of the GABA switch contribute to neurological disorders, so unveiling the involved regulators may be a promising strategy for treatment. Here we show that the adipocyte hormone leptin sets the tempo for the emergence of GABAergic inhibition in the newborn rodent hippocampus. In the absence of leptin signaling, hippocampal neurons show an advanced emergence of GABAergic inhibition. Conversely, maternal obesity associated with hyperleptinemia delays the excitatory to inhibitory switch of GABA action in offspring. This study uncovers a developmental function of leptin that may be linked to the pathogenesis of neurological disorders and helps understanding how maternal environment can adversely impact offspring brain development.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>A central principle for understanding the cerebral cortex is that macroscale anatomy reflects a functional hierarchy from primary to transmodal processing. In contrast, the central axis of motor and nonmotor macroscale organization in the cerebellum remains unknown. Here we applied diffusion map embedding to resting-state data from the Human Connectome Project dataset (n = 1003), and show for the first time that cerebellar functional regions follow a gradual organization which progresses from primary (motor) to transmodal (DMN, task-unfocused) regions. A secondary axis extends from task-unfocused to task-focused processing. Further, these two principal gradients revealed novel functional properties of the well-established cerebellar double motor representation (lobules I-VI and VIII), and its relationship with the recently described triple nonmotor representation (lobules VI/Crus I, Crus II/VIIB, IX/X). Functional differences exist not only between the two motor but also between the three nonmotor representations, and second motor representation might share functional similarities with third nonmotor representation.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Disorders of consciousness are a heterogeneous mixture of different diseases or injuries. Although some indicators and models have been proposed for prognostication, any single method when used alone carries a high risk of false prediction. This study aimed to develop a multidomain prognostic model that combines resting state functional MRI with three clinical characteristics to predict one year outcomes at the single-subject level. The model discriminated between patients who would later recover consciousness and those who would not with an accuracy of around 88% on three datasets from two medical centers. It was also able to identify the prognostic importance of different predictors, including brain functions and clinical characteristics. To our knowledge, this is the first reported implementation of a multidomain prognostic model based on resting state functional MRI and clinical characteristics in chronic disorders of consciousness, which we suggest is accurate, robust, and interpretable.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Devil Facial Tumour 2 (DFT2) is a recently discovered contagious cancer circulating in the Tasmanian devil (&lt;i&gt;Sarcophilus harrisii&lt;/i&gt;), a species which already harbours a more widespread contagious cancer, Devil Facial Tumour 1 (DFT1). Here we show that in contrast to DFT1, DFT2 cells express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, demonstrating that loss of MHC is not necessary for the emergence of a contagious cancer. However, the most highly expressed MHC class I alleles in DFT2 cells are common among host devils or non-polymorphic, reducing immunogenicity in a population sharing these alleles. In parallel, MHC class I loss is emerging in vivo, thus DFT2 may be mimicking the evolutionary trajectory of DFT1. Based on these results we propose that contagious cancers may exploit partial histocompatibility between the tumour and host, but that loss of allogeneic antigens could facilitate widespread transmission of DFT2.</content:encoded>

Manually curating biomedical knowledge from publications is necessary to build a knowledge based service that provides highly precise and organized information to users. The process of retrieving relevant publications for curation, which is also known as document triage, is usually carried out by querying and reading articles in PubMed. However, this query-based method often obtains unsatisfactory precision and recall on the retrieved results, and it is difficult to manually generate optimal queries. To address this, we propose a machine-learning assisted triage method. We collect previously curated publications from two databases UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog, and used them as a gold-standard dataset for training deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks. We then use the trained models to classify and rank new publications for curation. For evaluation, we apply our method to the real-world manual curation process of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and the GWAS Catalog. We demonstrate that our machine-assisted triage method outperforms the current query-based triage methods, improves efficiency, and enriches curated content. Our method achieves a precision 1.81 and 2.99 times higher than that obtained by the current query-based triage methods of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and the GWAS Catalog, respectively, without compromising recall. In fact, our method retrieves many additional relevant publications that the query-based method of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot could not find. As these results show, our machine learning-based method can make the triage process more efficient and is being implemented in production so that human curators can focus on more challenging tasks to improve the quality of knowledge bases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aibwa6AslVc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Gene co-expression network analysis is extremely useful in interpreting a complex biological process. The recent droplet-based single-cell technology is able to generate much larger gene expression data routinely with thousands of samples and tens of thousands of genes. To analyze such a large-scale gene-gene network, remarkable progress has been made in rigorous statistical inference of high-dimensional Gaussian graphical model (GGM). These approaches provide a formal confidence interval or a p-value rather than only a single point estimator for conditional dependence of a gene pair and are more desirable for identifying reliable gene networks. To promote their widespread use, we herein introduce an extensive and efficient R package named SILGGM (Statistical Inference of Large-scale Gaussian Graphical Model) that includes four main approaches in statistical inference of high-dimensional GGM. Unlike the existing tools, SILGGM provides statistically efficient inference on both individual gene pair and whole-scale gene pairs. It has a novel and consistent false discovery rate (FDR) procedure in all four methodologies. Based on the user-friendly design, it provides outputs compatible with multiple platforms for interactive network visualization. Furthermore, comparisons in simulation illustrate that SILGGM can accelerate the existing MATLAB implementation to several orders of magnitudes and further improve the speed of the already very efficient R package FastGGM. Testing results from the simulated data confirm the validity of all the approaches in SILGGM even in a very large-scale setting with the number of variables or genes to a ten thousand level. We have also applied our package to a novel single-cell RNA-seq data set with pan T cells. The results show that the approaches in SILGGM significantly outperform the conventional ones in a biological sense. The package is freely available via CRAN at https://cran.r-project.org/package=SILGGM.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wSym8QD9qKk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Precise positioning of the cell division site is essential for the correct segregation of the genetic material into the two daughter cells. In the bacterium &lt;i&gt;Myxococcus xanthus&lt;/i&gt;, the proteins PomX and PomY form a cluster on the chromosome that performs a biased random walk to midcell and positively regulates cell division there. PomZ, an ATPase, is necessary for tethering of the cluster to the nucleoid and regulates its movement towards midcell. It has remained unclear how the cluster dynamics change when the biochemical parameters, such as the attachment rates of PomZ dimers to the nucleoid and the cluster, the ATP hydrolysis rate of PomZ or the mobility of PomZ interacting with the nucleoid and cluster, are varied. To answer these questions, we investigate a one-dimensional model that includes the nucleoid, the Pom cluster and PomZ proteins. We find that a mechanism based on the diffusive PomZ fluxes on the nucleoid into the cluster can explain the latter’s midnucleoid localization for a broad parameter range. Furthermore, there is an ATP hydrolysis rate that minimizes the time the cluster needs to reach midnucleoid. If the dynamics of PomZ on the nucleoid is slow relative to the cluster’s velocity, we observe oscillatory cluster movements around midnucleoid. To understand midnucleoid localization, we developed a semi-analytical approach that dissects the net movement of the cluster into its components: the difference in PomZ fluxes into the cluster from either side, the force exerted by a single PomZ dimer on the cluster and the effective friction coefficient of the cluster. Importantly, we predict that the Pom cluster oscillates around midnucleoid if the diffusivity of PomZ on the nucleoid is reduced. A similar approach to that applied here may also prove useful for cargo localization in ParAB&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt; systems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SKZXSeDaTnk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Ribosome profiling is a powerful technique used to study translation at the genome-wide level, generating unique information concerning ribosome positions along RNAs. Optimal localization of ribosomes requires the proper identification of the ribosome P-site in each ribosome protected fragment, a crucial step to determine the trinucleotide periodicity of translating ribosomes, and draw correct conclusions concerning where ribosomes are located. To determine the P-site within ribosome footprints at nucleotide resolution, the precise estimation of its offset with respect to the protected fragment is necessary. Here we present riboWaltz, an R package for calculation of optimal P-site offsets, diagnostic analysis and visual inspection of ribosome profiling data. Compared to existing tools, riboWaltz shows improved accuracies for P-site estimation and neat ribosome positioning in multiple case studies. riboWaltz was implemented in R and is available as an R package at https://github.com/LabTranslationalArchitectomics/RiboWaltz.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OhaOvd6bTyU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: State-Dependent Modification of Sensory Sensitivity via Modulation of Backpropagating Action Potentials</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0283-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Neuromodulators play a critical role in sensorimotor processing via various actions, including pre- and postsynaptic signal modulation and direct modulation of signal encoding in peripheral dendrites. Here we present a new mechanism that allows state-dependent modulation of signal encoding in sensory dendrites by neuromodulatory projection neurons. We studied the impact of antidromic action potentials (APs) on stimulus encoding using the anterior gastric receptor (AGR) neuron in the heavily modulated crustacean stomatogastric ganglion. We found that ectopic AP initiation in AGR's axon trunk is under direct neuromodulatory control by the inferior ventricular (IV) neurons, a pair of descending projection neurons. IV neuron activation elicited a long-lasting decrease in AGR ectopic activity. This modulation was specific to the site of AP initiation and could be mimicked by focal application of the IV neuron co-transmitter histamine. IV neuron actions were diminished after blocking H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in AGR's axon trunk, suggesting a direct axonal modulation. This local modulation did not affect the propagation dynamics of en-passant APs. However, decreases in ectopic AP frequency prolonged sensory bursts elicited distantly near AGR's dendrites. This frequency-dependent effect was mediated via the reduction of antidromic APs, and the diminishment of backpropagation into the sensory dendrites. Computational models suggest that invading antidromic APs interact with local ionic conductances the rate constants of which determine the sign and strength of the frequency-dependent change in sensory sensitivity. Antidromic APs therefore provide descending projection neurons with a means to influence sensory encoding without affecting AP propagation or stimulus transduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Descending modulatory projection neurons are a hallmark of motor systems and fundamentally involved in sensorimotor processing. While they have been shown to interact on many levels with motor networks to dynamically and rapidly adjust motor and behavioral output, their actions on sensory neurons are not well understood. We found that descending projection neurons directly modulate action potential initiation in a sensory axon, diminishing the frequency of spontaneously generated ectopic action potentials that propagate antidromically into peripheral sensory dendrites. Changes in the frequency of these backpropagating action potentials determined the response of the sensory neuron to sensory stimuli. This suggests that descending projection neurons modulate sensory encoding by altering axonal membrane excitability and the frequency of antidromic action potential initiation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Early Targeting of L-Selectin on Leukocytes Promotes Recovery after Spinal Cord Injury, Implicating Novel Mechanisms of Pathogenesis</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0101-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;L-selectin, a lectin-like receptor on all leukocyte classes, functions in adhesive and signaling roles in the recruitment of myeloid cells from the blood to sites of inflammation. Herein, we consider L-selectin as a determinant of neurological recovery in a murine model of spinal cord injury. Spinal cord-injured, L-selectin knockout mice (male) showed improved long-term recovery with greater white matter sparing relative to wildtype mice and reduced oxidative stress in the injured cord at 72 hours post-spinal cord injury. There was a partial and transient reduction in accumulation of neutrophils in the injured spinal cords of knockouts at 24 hours post-injury. To complement these findings with knockout mice, we sought a pharmacologic means for lowering L-selectin levels. We found that diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, induced the shedding of L-selectin from the cell surface of myeloid subsets, specifically neutrophils and non-classical monocytes, in the blood and the injured spinal cord. Diclofenac administration to injured wildtype mice enhanced neurological recovery to a level comparable to that of knockouts but did not improve recovery in knockouts. While diclofenac treatment had no effect on myeloid cell accumulation, there was a reduction in oxidative stress at 72 hours post-spinal cord injury. These findings implicate L-selectin in secondary pathogenesis beyond a role in leukocyte recruitment and raise the possibility of repurposing diclofenac for the treatment of spinal cord injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; In this study, we establish L-selectin, an adhesion and signaling receptor on immune cells, as a determinant of long-term recovery and tissue sparing after spinal cord injury. We demonstrate that L-selectin contributes to secondary pathogenesis during acute inflammation, and implicate L-selectin in novel roles other than recruitment. We also report a strategy to improve recovery by employing diclofenac, an FDA-approved NSAID that induces the shedding of L-selectin from the surface of innate immune cells. Our findings demonstrate a critical time-period for anti-inflammatory intervention in a murine model of spinal cord injury and suggest that diclofenac be tested as an acute therapy for attenuating neurologic deficits following spinal cord injury in humans.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Differentiation in Theta and Beta Electrocortical Activity between Visual and Physical Perturbations to Walking and Standing Balance</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/4/ENEURO.0207-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human balance is a complex process in healthy adults, requiring precisely timed coordination among sensory information, cognitive processing, and motor control. It has been difficult to quantify brain dynamics during human balance control due to limitations in brain-imaging modalities. The goal of this study was to determine whether by using high-density electroencephalography (EEG) and independent component analysis, we can identify common cortical responses to visual and physical balance perturbations during walking and standing. We studied the responses of 30 healthy young adults to sensorimotor perturbations that challenged their balance. Subjects performed four 10 min trials of beam walking and tandem stance while either being mediolaterally pulled at the waist or viewing brief 20° field-of-view rotations in virtual reality. We recorded high-density EEG, motion capture, lower leg electromyography (EMG), and neck EMG. We hypothesized that both physical pull and visual rotation perturbations would elicit time–frequency fluctuations in theta (4–8 Hz) and beta (13–30 Hz) bands, with increased occipito-parietal activity during visual rotations compared with pull perturbations. Our results confirmed this hypothesis. For both perturbations, we found early theta synchronization and late alpha–beta (8–30 Hz) desynchronization following perturbation onset. This pattern was strongest in occipito-parietal areas during visual perturbations and strongest in sensorimotor areas during pull perturbations. These results suggest a similar time–frequency electrocortical pattern when humans respond to sensorimotor conflict, but with substantive differences in the brain areas involved for visual versus physical perturbations. Our findings may have important implications for assessing and training balance in individuals with and without motor disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Novel Quantitative Analyses of Spontaneous Synaptic Events in Cortical Pyramidal Cells Reveal Subtle Parvalbumin-Expressing Interneuron Dysfunction in a Knock-In Mouse Model of Alzheimers Disease</title>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that has become a compelling global public health concern. Besides pathological hallmarks such as extracellular amyloid plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and loss of neurons and synapses, clinical reports have shown that epileptiform activity, even seizures, can occur early in the disease. Aberrant synaptic and network activities as well as epileptiform discharges have also been observed in various mouse models of AD. The new &lt;i&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mouse model is generated by a gene knock-in approach and there are limited studies on basic synaptic properties in &lt;i&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice. Therefore, we applied quantitative methods to analyze spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory synaptic events in parietal cortex layer 2/3 pyramidal cells. First, by an objective amplitude distribution analysis, we found decreased amplitudes of spontaneous IPSCs (sIPSCs) in aged &lt;i&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice caused by a reduction in the amplitudes of the large sIPSCs with fast rates of rise, consistent with deficits in the function of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PV INs). Second, we calculated the burstiness and memory in a series of successive synaptic events. Lastly, by using a novel approach to determine the excitation-to-inhibition (E/I) ratio, we found no changes in the &lt;i&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice, indicating that homeostatic mechanisms may have maintained the overall balance of excitation and inhibition in spite of a mildly impaired PV IN function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

in multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) data. Our model defines a network
of seizure propagation paths to capture both the temporal and spatial evolution

the seizure evolution from spectral patterns in the EEG data. We validate our
model on EEG aquired under clinical conditions in the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit
of the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Using 5-fold cross validation, we demonstrate
that our model outperforms three baseline approaches which rely on a classical
detection framework. Our model also demonstrates the potential to localize

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03357</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We introduce Error Forward-Propagation, a biologically plausible mechanism to
propagate error feedback forward through the network. Architectural constraints
on connectivity are virtually eliminated for error feedback in the brain;
systematic backward connectivity is not used or needed to deliver error
feedback. Feedback as a means of assigning credit to neurons earlier in the
forward pathway for their contribution to the final output is thought to be
used in learning in the brain. How the brain solves the credit assignment
problem is unclear. In machine learning, error backpropagation is a highly
successful mechanism for credit assignment in deep multilayered networks.
Backpropagation requires symmetric reciprocal connectivity for every neuron.
From a biological perspective, there is no evidence of such an architectural
constraint, which makes backpropagation implausible for learning in the brain.
This architectural constraint is reduced with the use of random feedback
weights. Models using random feedback weights require backward connectivity
patterns for every neuron, but avoid symmetric weights and reciprocal
connections. In this paper, we practically remove this architectural
constraint, requiring only a backward loop connection for effective error
feedback. We propose reusing the forward connections to deliver the error
feedback by feeding the outputs into the input receiving layer. This mechanism,
Error Forward-Propagation, is a plausible basis for how error feedback occurs
deep in the brain independent of and yet in support of the functionality
underlying intricate network architectures. We show experimentally that
recurrent neural networks with two and three hidden layers can be trained using
Error Forward-Propagation on the MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets, achieving
$1.90\%$ and $11\%$ generalization errors respectively.

The Lombard effect – a rise in call amplitude in response to background noise – has been demonstrated in a wide range of vertebrates. Here, we review both behavioral and neurophysiological data and propose that the Lombard effect is driven by a subcortical neural network, which can be modulated by cortical processes. The proposed framework offers mechanistic explanations for two fundamental features of the Lombard effect: its widespread taxonomic distribution across the vertebrate phylogenetic tree and the widely observed variations in compensation magnitude.</content:encoded>

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology allows researchers to profile the transcriptomes of thousands of cells simultaneously. Protocols that incorporate both designed and random barcodes have greatly increased the throughput of scRNA-seq, but give rise to a more complex data structure. There is a need for new tools that can handle the various barcoding strategies used by different protocols and exploit this information for quality assessment at the sample-level and provide effective visualization of these results in preparation for higher-level analyses. To this end, we developed &lt;i&gt;scPipe&lt;/i&gt;, an R/Bioconductor package that integrates barcode demultiplexing, read alignment, UMI-aware gene-level quantification and quality control of raw sequencing data generated by multiple protocols that include CEL-seq, MARS-seq, Chromium 10X, Drop-seq and Smart-seq. &lt;i&gt;scPipe&lt;/i&gt; produces a count matrix that is essential for downstream analysis along with an HTML report that summarises data quality. These results can be used as input for downstream analyses including normalization, visualization and statistical testing. &lt;i&gt;scPipe&lt;/i&gt; performs this processing in a few simple R commands, promoting reproducible analysis of single-cell data that is compatible with the emerging suite of open-source scRNA-seq analysis tools available in R/Bioconductor and beyond. The &lt;i&gt;scPipe&lt;/i&gt; R package is available for download from https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/scPipe.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SlKOJy98vdo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Discerning evolutionary trends in post-translational modification and the effect of intrinsic disorder: Analysis of methylation, acetylation and ubiquitination sites in human proteins</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/AVRbsaFgEhA/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Mohanalakshmi Narasumani, Paul M. Harrison&lt;/p&gt;

Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of proteins play significant biological functional roles despite lacking a well-defined 3D structure. For example, IDRs provide efficient housing for large numbers of post-translational modification (PTM) sites in eukaryotic proteins. Here, we study the distribution of more than 15,000 experimentally determined human methylation, acetylation and ubiquitination sites (collectively termed ‘MAU’ sites) in ordered and disordered regions, and analyse their conservation across 380 eukaryotic species. Conservation signals for the maintenance and novel emergence of MAU sites are examined at 11 evolutionary levels from the whole eukaryotic domain down to the ape superfamily, in both ordered and disordered regions. We discover that MAU PTM is a major driver of conservation for arginines and lysines in both ordered and disordered regions, across the 11 levels, most significantly across the mammalian clade. Conservation of human methylatable arginines is very strongly favoured for ordered regions rather than for disordered, whereas methylatable lysines are conserved in either set of regions, and conservation of acetylatable and ubiquitinatable lysines is favoured in disordered over ordered. Notably, we find evidence for the emergence of new lysine MAU sites in disordered regions of proteins in deuterostomes and mammals, and in ordered regions after the dawn of eutherians. For histones specifically, MAU sites demonstrate an idiosyncratic significant conservation pattern that is evident since the last common ancestor of mammals. Similarly, folding-on-binding (FB) regions are highly enriched for MAU sites relative to either ordered or disordered regions, with ubiquitination sites in FBs being highly conserved at all evolutionary levels back as far as mammals. This investigation clearly demonstrates the complex patterns of PTM evolution across the human proteome and that it is necessary to consider conservation of sequence features at multiple evolutionary levels in order not to get an incomplete or misleading picture.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AVRbsaFgEhA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Modeling subjective relevance in schizophrenia and its relation to aberrant salience</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/njS8vXy7zbs/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Teresa Katthagen, Christoph Mathys, Lorenz Deserno, Henrik Walter, Norbert Kathmann, Andreas Heinz, Florian Schlagenhauf&lt;/p&gt;

In schizophrenia, increased aberrant salience to irrelevant events and reduced learning of relevant information may relate to an underlying deficit in relevance detection. So far, subjective estimates of relevance have not been probed in schizophrenia patients. The mechanisms underlying belief formation about relevance and their translation into decisions are unclear. Using novel computational methods, we investigated relevance detection during implicit learning in 42 schizophrenia patients and 42 healthy individuals. Participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while detecting the outcomes in a learning task. These were preceded by cues differing in color and shape, which were either relevant or irrelevant for outcome prediction. We provided a novel definition of relevance based on Bayesian precision and modeled reaction times as a function of relevance weighted unsigned prediction errors (UPE). For aberrant salience, we assessed responses to subjectively irrelevant cue manifestations. Participants learned the contingencies and slowed down their responses following unexpected events. Model selection revealed that individuals inferred the relevance of cue features and used it for behavioral adaption to the relevant cue feature. Relevance weighted UPEs correlated with dorsal anterior cingulate cortex activation and hippocampus deactivation. In patients, the aberrant salience bias to subjectively task-irrelevant information was increased and correlated with decreased striatal UPE activation and increased negative symptoms. This study shows that relevance estimates based on Bayesian precision can be inferred from observed behavior. This underscores the importance of relevance detection as an underlying mechanism for behavioral adaptation in complex environments and enhances the understanding of aberrant salience in schizophrenia.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/njS8vXy7zbs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Motivation Modulates Brain Networks in Response to Faces Varying in Race and Status: A Multivariate Approach</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0039-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Previous behavioral and neuroimaging work indicates that individuals who are externally motivated to respond without racial prejudice tend not to spontaneously regulate their prejudice and prefer to focus on non-racial attributes when evaluating others. This fMRI multivariate analysis used Partial Least Squares (PLS) to examine the distributed neural processing of race and a relevant but ostensibly non-racial attribute (viz., socioeconomic status) as a function of the perceiver’s external motivation. Sixty-one White male participants (&lt;i&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/i&gt;) privately formed impressions of Black and White male faces ascribed with high or low status. Across all conditions, greater external motivation was associated with reduced co-activation of brain regions believed to support emotion regulation (rostral anterior cingulate cortex), introspection (middle cingulate), and social cognition (temporal pole, medial prefrontal cortex). The reduced involvement of this network irrespective of target race and status suggests that external motivation is related to the participant’s overall approach to impression formation in an interracial context. The findings highlight the importance of examining network co-activation in understanding the role of external motivation in impression formation, among other interracial social processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; This multivariate fMRI analysis examined distributed neural processing as participants formed impressions of faces varying in race and status. Across all conditions, participants reporting greater external motivation to respond without racial prejudice showed reduced co-activation in brain regions believed to support emotion regulation, introspection, and social cognition. These results suggest that external motivation may calibrate how perceivers form impressions in an interracial context, irrespective of target race. Results from this analysis raise new questions that may not have readily emerged in studies relying on traditional behavioral and univariate fMRI analyses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Evolutionary optimisation of neural network models for fish collective behaviours in mixed groups of robots and zebrafish. (arXiv:1808.03166v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03166</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Animal and robot social interactions are interesting both for ethological
studies and robotics. On the one hand, the robots can be tools and models to
analyse animal collective behaviours, on the other hand, the robots and their
artificial intelligence are directly confronted and compared to the natural
animal collective intelligence. The first step is to design robots and their
behavioural controllers that are capable of socially interact with animals.
Designing such behavioural bio-mimetic controllers remains an important
challenge as they have to reproduce the animal behaviours and have to be
calibrated on experimental data. Most animal collective behavioural models are
designed by modellers based on experimental data. This process is long and
costly because it is difficult to identify the relevant behavioural features
that are then used as a priori knowledge in model building. Here, we want to
model the fish individual and collective behaviours in order to develop robot
controllers. We explore the use of optimised black-box models based on
artificial neural networks (ANN) to model fish behaviours. While the ANN may
not be biomimetic but rather bio-inspired, they can be used to link perception
to motor responses. These models are designed to be implementable as robot
controllers to form mixed-groups of fish and robots, using few a priori
knowledge of the fish behaviours. We present a methodology with multilayer
perceptron or echo state networks that are optimised through evolutionary
algorithms to model accurately the fish individual and collective behaviours in
a bounded rectangular arena. We assess the biomimetism of the generated models
and compare them to the fish experimental behaviours.

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Targeting the Mouse Ventral Hippocampus in the Intrahippocampal Kainic Acid Model of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/4/ENEURO.0158-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Here we describe a novel mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) that moves the site of kainate injection from the rodent dorsal hippocampus (corresponding to the human posterior hippocampus) to the ventral hippocampus (corresponding to the human anterior hippocampus). We compare the phenotypes of this new model—with respect to seizures, cognitive impairment, affective deficits, and histopathology—to the standard dorsal intrahippocampal kainate model. Our results demonstrate that histopathological measures of granule cell dispersion and mossy fiber sprouting maximize near the site of kainate injection. Somewhat surprisingly, both the dorsal and ventral models exhibit similar spatial memory impairments in addition to similar electrographic and behavioral seizure burdens. In contrast, we find a more pronounced affective (anhedonic) phenotype specifically in the ventral model. These results demonstrate that the ventral intrahippocampal kainic acid model recapitulates critical pathologies of the dorsal model while providing a means to further study affective phenotypes such as depression in TLE.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Wakefulness Is Promoted during Day Time by PDFR Signalling to Dopaminergic Neurons in Drosophila melanogaster</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/4/ENEURO.0129-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Circadian clocks modulate timing of sleep/wake cycles in animals; however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;, large ventral lateral neurons (l-LN&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;) are known to promote wakefulness through the action of the neuropeptide pigment dispersing factor (PDF), but the downstream targets of PDF signalling remain elusive. In a screen using downregulation or overexpression (OEX) of the gene encoding PDF receptor (&lt;i&gt;pdfr&lt;/i&gt;), we found that a subset of dopaminergic neurons responds to PDF to promote wakefulness during the day. Moreover, we found that small LN&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; (s-LN&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;) and dopaminergic neurons form synaptic contacts, and PDFR signalling inhibited dopaminergic neurons specifically during day time. We propose that these dopaminergic neurons that respond to PDFR signalling are sleep-promoting and that during the day when PDF levels are high, they are inhibited, thereby promoting wakefulness. Thus, we identify a novel circadian clock pathway that mediates wake promotion specifically during day time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Oscillations are ubiquitous features of brain dynamics that undergo task-related changes in synchrony, power, and frequency. The impact of those changes on target networks is poorly understood. In this work, we used a biophysically detailed model of prefrontal cortex (PFC) to explore the effects of varying the spike rate, synchrony, and waveform of strong oscillatory inputs on the behavior of cortical networks driven by them. Interacting populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons with strong feedback inhibition are inhibition-based network oscillators that exhibit resonance (i.e., larger responses to preferred input frequencies). We quantified network responses in terms of mean firing rates and the population frequency of network oscillation; and characterized their behavior in terms of the natural response to asynchronous input and the resonant response to oscillatory inputs. We show that strong feedback inhibition causes the PFC to generate internal (natural) oscillations in the beta/gamma frequency range (&amp;gt;15 Hz) and to maximize principal cell spiking in response to external oscillations at slightly higher frequencies. Importantly, we found that the fastest oscillation frequency that can be relayed by the network maximizes local inhibition and is equal to a frequency even higher than that which maximizes the firing rate of excitatory cells; we call this phenomenon population frequency resonance. This form of resonance is shown to determine the optimal driving frequency for suppressing responses to asynchronous activity. Lastly, we demonstrate that the natural and resonant frequencies can be tuned by changes in neuronal excitability, the duration of feedback inhibition, and dynamic properties of the input. Our results predict that PFC networks are tuned for generating and selectively responding to beta- and gamma-rhythmic signals due to the natural and resonant properties of inhibition-based oscillators. They also suggest strategies for optimizing transcranial stimulation and using oscillatory networks in neuromorphic engineering.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9krHxaH4sa8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Phylogeny-corrected identification of microbial gene families relevant to human gut colonization</title>

The mechanisms by which different microbes colonize the healthy human gut versus other body sites, the gut in disease states, or other environments remain largely unknown. Identifying microbial genes influencing fitness in the gut could lead to new ways to engineer probiotics or disrupt pathogenesis. We approach this problem by measuring the statistical association between a species having a gene and the probability that the species is present in the gut microbiome. The challenge is that closely related species tend to be jointly present or absent in the microbiome and also share many genes, only a subset of which are involved in gut adaptation. We show that this phylogenetic correlation indeed leads to many false discoveries and propose phylogenetic linear regression as a powerful solution. To apply this method across the bacterial tree of life, where most species have not been experimentally phenotyped, we use metagenomes from hundreds of people to quantify each species’ prevalence in and specificity for the gut microbiome. This analysis reveals thousands of genes potentially involved in adaptation to the gut across species, including many novel candidates as well as processes known to contribute to fitness of gut bacteria, such as acid tolerance in Bacteroidetes and sporulation in Firmicutes. We also find microbial genes associated with a preference for the gut over other body sites, which are significantly enriched for genes linked to fitness in an &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; competition experiment. Finally, we identify gene families associated with higher prevalence in patients with Crohn’s disease, including Proteobacterial genes involved in conjugation and fimbria regulation, processes previously linked to inflammation. These gene targets may represent new avenues for modulating host colonization and disease. Our strategy of combining metagenomics with phylogenetic modeling is general and can be used to identify genes associated with adaptation to any environment.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NwEaQS18QuE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Characterization of Tissue Plasminogen Activator Expression and Trafficking in the Adult Murine Brain</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/4/ENEURO.0119-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is an immediate-early gene important for regulating physiological processes like synaptic plasticity and neurovascular coupling. It has also been implicated in several pathological processes including blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, seizure progression, and stroke. These varied reports suggest that tPA is a pleiotropic mediator whose actions are highly compartmentalized in space and time. The specific localization of tPA, therefore, can provide useful information about its function. Accordingly, the goal of this study was to provide a detailed characterization of tPA’s regional, cellular, and subcellular localization in the brain. To achieve this, two new transgenic mouse lines were utilized: (1) a PlatβGAL reporter mouse, which houses the β-galactosidase gene in the tPA locus and (2) a tPA&lt;sup&gt;BAC&lt;/sup&gt;-Cerulean mouse, which has a cerulean-fluorescent protein fused in-frame to the tPA C-terminus. Using these two transgenic reporters, we show that while tPA is expressed throughout most regions of the adult murine brain, it appears to be preferentially targeted to fiber tracts in the limbic system. In the hippocampus, confocal microscopy revealed tPA-Cerulean (tPA-Cer) puncta localized to giant mossy fiber boutons (MFBs) and astrocytes in stratum lucidum. With amplification of the tPA-Cer signal, somatically localized tPA was also observed in the stratum oriens (SO)/alveus layer of both CA1 and CA3 subfields. Coimmunostaining of tPA-Cer and interneuronal markers indicates that these tPA-positive cell bodies belong to a subclass of somatostatin (SST)/oriens-lacunosum moleculare (O-LM) interneurons. Together, these data imply that tPA’s localization is differentially regulated, suggesting that its neuromodulatory effects may be compartmentalized and specialized to cell type.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Interlimb Generalization of Learned Bayesian Visuomotor Prior Occurs in Extrinsic Coordinates</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/4/ENEURO.0183-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent work suggests that the brain represents probability distributions and performs Bayesian integration during sensorimotor learning. However, our understanding of the neural representation of this learning remains limited. To begin to address this, we performed two experiments. In the first experiment, we replicated the key behavioral findings of Körding and Wolpert (2004), demonstrating that humans can perform in a Bayes-optimal manner by combining information about their own sensory uncertainty and a statistical distribution of lateral shifts encountered in a visuomotor adaptation task. In the second experiment, we extended these findings by testing whether visuomotor learning occurring during the same task generalizes from one limb to the other, and relatedly, whether this learning is represented in an extrinsic or intrinsic reference frame. We found that the learned mean of the distribution of visuomotor shifts generalizes to the opposite limb only when the perturbation is congruent in extrinsic coordinates, indicating that the underlying representation of learning acquired during training is available to the untrained limb and is coded in an extrinsic reference frame.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Sodium Channel-Dependent and -Independent Mechanisms Underlying Axonal Afterdepolarization at Mouse Hippocampal Mossy Fibers</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0254-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Action potentials propagating along axons are often followed by prolonged afterdepolarization (ADP) lasting for several tens of milliseconds. Axonal ADP is thought to be an important factor in modulating the fidelity of spike propagation during repetitive firings. However, the mechanism as well as the functional significance of axonal ADP remain unclear, partly due to inaccessibility to small structures of axon for direct electrophysiological recordings. Here, we examined the ionic and electrical mechanisms underlying axonal ADP using whole-bouton recording from mossy fiber terminals in mice hippocampal slices. ADP following axonal action potentials was strongly enhanced by focal application of veratridine, an inhibitor of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel inactivation. On the contrary, tetrodotoxin (TTX) partly suppressed ADP, suggesting that a Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel-dependent component is involved in axonal ADP. The remaining TTX-resistant Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel-independent component represents slow capacitive discharge reflecting the shape and electrical properties of the axonal membrane. We also addressed the functional impact of axonal ADP on presynaptic function. In paired-pulse stimuli, we found that axonal ADP minimally affected the peak height of subsequent action potentials, although the rising phase of action potentials was slightly slowed, possibly due to steady-state inactivation of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels by prolonged depolarization. Voltage clamp analysis of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; current elicited by action potential waveform commands revealed that axonal ADP assists short-term facilitation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry into the presynaptic terminals. Taken together, axonal ADP maintains reliable firing during repetitive stimuli and plays important roles in the fine-tuning of short-term plasticity of transmitter release by modulating Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry into presynaptic terminals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Axonal action potentials are often followed by depolarizing or hyperpolarizing afterpotentials. This study illuminated the mechanisms of ADP in the hippocampal mossy fibers, where morphologic as well as biophysical data were accumulated. We found that slow activating Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels are partly involved in ADP. Capacitive components also substantially contribute to ADP, suggesting that axonal shape and electrical properties are optimized for high-fidelity propagation during repetitive stimuli. We also tested the roles of ADP in the activity-dependent tuning of the presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; current. Action potential-driven Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry into the axon terminals was facilitated by paired stimuli, possibly due to Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; current facilitation by ADP. Therefore, ADP contributes to fine-tuning of transmitter release and ensures high-fidelity spiking of axons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Neural Pattern Classification Tracks Transfer-Appropriate Processing in Episodic Memory</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0251-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The transfer-appropriate processing (TAP) account holds that episodic memory depends on the overlap between encoding and retrieval processing. In the current study, we employed multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) of electroencephalography to examine the relevance of spontaneously engaged visual processing during encoding for later retrieval. Human participants encoded word- picture associations, where the picture could be a famous face, a landmark, or an object. At test, we manipulated the retrieval demands by asking participants to retrieve either visual or verbal information about the pictures. MVPA revealed classification between picture categories during early perceptual stages of encoding (~170 ms). Importantly, these visual category-specific neural patterns were predictive of later episodic remembering, but the direction of the relationship was contingent on the particular retrieval demand of the memory task: a benefit for the visual and a cost for the verbal. A reinstatement of the category-specific neural patterns established during encoding was observed during retrieval, and again the relationship with behavior varied with retrieval demands. Reactivation of visual representations during retrieval was associated with better memory in the visual task, but with lower performance in the verbal task. Our findings support and extend the TAP account by demonstrating that processing of particular aspects during memory formation can also have detrimental effects on later episodic remembering when other aspects of the event are called-for and shed new light on encoding and retrieval interactions in episodic memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Episodic memory allows us to mentally travel in time to relive our personal past. The likelihood that a previous episode will be remembered is considered to depend on the extent to which processes engaged during encoding are also engaged at the time of retrieval. In the present study, we leveraged multivariate pattern analysis of high time-resolution oscillatory brain activity to assess participants’ category-specific visual processing during memory formation, and later cortical reinstatement at retrieval. The results demonstrate that category-specific visual processing may predict both benefits and costs in episodic memory, depending on the retrieval requirements. These novel findings elucidate the neurocognitive dynamics of encoding and retrieval, which mediate the access to our personal past.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

how tightly all parts of a system are interconnected in terms of information

Analytically and numerically we show that the presence of astrocyte may be

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Transmembrane Domain of Synaptobrevin Influences Neurotransmitter Flux through Synaptic Fusion Pores</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/32/7179?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The soluble &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor (SNARE) proteins synaptobrevin (Syb), syntaxin, and SNAP-25 function in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-triggered exocytosis in both endocrine cells and neurons. The transmembrane domains (TMDs) of Syb and syntaxin span the vesicle and plasma membrane, respectively, and influence flux through fusion pores in endocrine cells as well as fusion pores formed during SNARE-mediated fusion of reconstituted membranes. These results support a model for exocytosis in which SNARE TMDs form the initial fusion pore. The present study sought to test this model in synaptic terminals. Patch-clamp recordings of miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) were used to probe fusion pore properties in cultured hippocampal neurons from mice of both sexes. Mutants harboring tryptophan at four different sites in the Syb TMD reduced the rate-of-rise of mEPSCs. A computer model that simulates glutamate diffusion and receptor activation kinetics could account for this reduction in mEPSC rise rate by slowing the flux of glutamate through synaptic fusion pores. TMD mutations introducing positive charge also reduced the mEPSC rise rate, but negatively charged residues and glycine, which should have done the opposite, had no effect. The sensitivity of mEPSCs to pharmacological blockade of receptor desensitization was enhanced by a mutation that slowed the mEPSC rate-of-rise, suggesting that the mutation prolonged the residence of glutamate in the synaptic cleft. The same four Syb TMD residues found here to influence synaptic release were found previously to influence endocrine release, leading us to propose that a similar TMD-lined fusion pore functions widely in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-triggered exocytosis in mammalian cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; SNARE proteins function broadly in biological membrane fusion. Evidence from non-neuronal systems suggests that SNARE proteins initiate fusion by forming a fusion pore lined by transmembrane domains, but this model has not yet been tested in synapses. The present study addressed this question by testing mutations in the synaptic vesicle SNARE synaptobrevin for an influence on the rise rate of miniature synaptic currents. These results indicate that synaptobrevin's transmembrane domain interacts with glutamate as it passes through the fusion pore. The sites in synaptobrevin that influence this flux are identical to those shown previously to influence flux through endocrine fusion pores. Thus, SNARE transmembrane domains may function in the fusion pores of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-triggered exocytosis of both neurotransmitters and hormones.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02157</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Typical fMRI studies have focused on either the mean trend in the
blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) time course or functional connectivity
(FC). However, other statistics of the neuroimaging data may contain important
information. Despite studies showing links between the variance in the BOLD
time series (BV) and age and cognitive performance, a formal framework for
testing these effects has not yet been developed. We introduce the Variance
Design General Linear Model (VDGLM), a novel framework that facilitates the
detection of variance effects. We designed the framework for general use in any
fMRI study by modeling both mean and variance in BOLD activation as a function
of experimental design. The flexibility of this approach allows the VDGLM to i)
simultaneously make inferences about a mean or variance effect while
controlling for the other and ii) test for variance effects that could be
associated with multiple conditions and/or noise regressors. We demonstrate the
use of the VDGLM in a working memory application and show that engagement in a
working memory task is associated with whole-brain decreases in BOLD variance.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Network-level allosteric effects are elucidated by detailing how ligand-binding events modulate utilization of catalytic potentials</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/cFSQuS8gwrc/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by James T. Yurkovich, Miguel A. Alcantar, Zachary B. Haiman, Bernhard O. Palsson&lt;/p&gt;

Allosteric regulation has traditionally been described by mathematically-complex allosteric rate laws in the form of ratios of polynomials derived from the application of simplifying kinetic assumptions. Alternatively, an approach that explicitly describes all known ligand-binding events requires no simplifying assumptions while allowing for the computation of enzymatic states. Here, we employ such a modeling approach to examine the “catalytic potential” of an enzyme—an enzyme’s capacity to catalyze a biochemical reaction. The catalytic potential is the fundamental result of multiple ligand-binding events that represents a “tug of war” among the various regulators and substrates within the network. This formalism allows for the assessment of interacting allosteric enzymes and development of a network-level understanding of regulation. We first define the catalytic potential and use it to characterize the response of three key kinases (hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase) in human red blood cell glycolysis to perturbations in ATP utilization. Next, we examine the sensitivity of the catalytic potential by using existing personalized models, finding that the catalytic potential allows for the identification of subtle but important differences in how individuals respond to such perturbations. Finally, we explore how the catalytic potential can help to elucidate how enzymes work in tandem to maintain a homeostatic state. Taken together, this work provides an interpretation and visualization of the dynamic interactions and network-level effects of interacting allosteric enzymes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cFSQuS8gwrc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Network supporting contextual fear learning after dorsal hippocampal damage has increased dependence on retrosplenial cortex</title>

Hippocampal damage results in profound retrograde, but no anterograde amnesia in contextual fear conditioning (CFC). Although the content learned in the latter have been discussed, alternative regions supporting CFC learning were seldom proposed and never empirically addressed. Here, we employed network analysis of pCREB expression quantified from brain slices of rats with dorsal hippocampal lesion (dHPC) after undergoing CFC session. Using inter-regional correlations of pCREB-positive nuclei between brain regions, we modelled functional networks using different thresholds. The dHPC network showed small-world topology, equivalent to SHAM (control) network. However, diverging hubs were identified in each network. In a direct comparison, hubs in both networks showed consistently higher centrality values compared to the other network. Further, the distribution of correlation coefficients was different between the groups, with most significantly stronger correlation coefficients belonging to the SHAM network. These results suggest that dHPC network engaged in CFC learning is partially different, and engage alternative hubs. We next tested if pre-training lesions of dHPC and one of the new dHPC network hubs (perirhinal, Per; or disgranular retrosplenial, RSC, cortices) would impair CFC. Only dHPC-RSC, but not dHPC-Per, impaired CFC. Interestingly, only RSC showed a consistently higher centrality in the dHPC network, suggesting that the increased centrality reflects an increased functional dependence on RSC. Our results provide evidence that, without hippocampus, the RSC, an anatomically central region in the medial temporal lobe memory system might support CFC learning and memory.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Nut-R4-WNSE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Differential Involvement of Kinase Activity of Ca2+/Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase II{alpha} in Hippocampus- and Amygdala-Dependent Memory Revealed by Kinase-Dead Knock-in Mouse</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0133-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIα (CaMKIIα) is a key mediator of activity-dependent neuronal modifications and has been implicated in the molecular mechanisms of learning and memory. Indeed, several types of CaMKIIα knock-in and knock-out mice revealed impairments in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and behavioral learning. On the other hand, a similar role for CaMKIIα has been implicated in amygdala-dependent memory, but detailed analyses have not much been performed yet. To better understand its involvement in amygdala-dependent memory as compared to hippocampus-dependent memory, here we performed biochemical analyses and behavioral memory tests using the kinase-dead CaMKIIα (K42R) knock-in mouse. In the Morris water maze tasks, homozygous mutants performed well in the visible platform trials, while they failed to form spatial memory in the hippocampus-dependent hidden platform trials. In fear conditioning, these mice were impaired but showed a certain level of amygdala-dependent cued fear memory, which lasted four weeks, while they showed virtually no hippocampus-dependent context discrimination. Neither stronger stimulation nor repetitive stimulation compensated for their memory deficits. The differential outcome of hippocampus- and amygdala-dependent memory in the mutant mouse was not due to differential expression of CaMKIIα between the hippocampus and the amygdala, because biochemical analyses revealed that both kinase activity and protein levels of CaMKII were indistinguishable between the two brain regions. These results indicate that kinase activity of CaMKIIα is indispensable for hippocampus-dependent memory, but not necessarily for amygdala-dependent memory. There may be a secondary, CaMKIIα activity-independent pathway, in addition to the CaMKIIα activity-dependent pathway, in the acquisition of amygdala-dependent memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Studying molecular mechanisms of learning and memory is important to confront memory-deficient and abnormal memory-associated disorders. An enzyme called Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIα (CaMKIIα) that is abundant in the brain and phosphorylates important proteins has a key role in such mechanisms. However, how CaMKIIα enzymatic activity is involved in hippocampus- vs. amygdala-dependent memory is still not clear. Using our genetically engineered mouse that lacks kinase activity but retains protein expression of CaMKIIα, here we showed that kinase activity of CaMKIIα is indispensable for hippocampus-dependent space/context-related memory, but not necessarily for amygdala-dependent fear-related memory. The role of CaMKIIα kinase activity in distinguishing different contexts indicates its possible involvement as a measure against abnormal fear memory-associated disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Immediate-Early Promoter-Driven Transgenic Reporter System for Neuroethological Researches in a Hemimetabolous Insect</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0061-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Genes expressed in response to increased neuronal activity are widely used as activity markers in recent behavioral neuroscience. In the present study, we established transgenic reporter system for whole-brain activity mapping in the two-spotted cricket &lt;i&gt;Gryllus bimaculatus&lt;/i&gt;, a hemimetabolous insect used in neuroethology and behavioral ecology. In the cricket brain, a homolog of &lt;i&gt;early growth response-1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Gryllus egr-B&lt;/i&gt;) was rapidly induced as an immediate-early gene (IEG) in response to neuronal hyperexcitability. The upstream genomic fragment of &lt;i&gt;Gryllus egr-B&lt;/i&gt; contains potential binding sites for transcription factors regulated by various intracellular signaling pathways, as well as core promoter elements conserved across insect/crustacean &lt;i&gt;egr-B&lt;/i&gt; homologs. Using the upstream genomic fragment of &lt;i&gt;Gryllus egr-B,&lt;/i&gt; we established an IEG promoter-driven transgenic reporter system in the cricket. In the brain of transgenic crickets, the reporter gene (a nuclear-targeted destabilized EYFP) was induced in response to neuronal hyperexcitability. Inducible expression of reporter protein was detected in almost all neurons after neuronal hyperexcitability. Using our novel reporter system, we successfully detected neuronal activation evoked by feeding in the cricket brain. Our IEG promoter-driven activity reporting system allows us to visualize behaviorally relevant neural circuits at cellular resolution in the cricket brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Insects are the largest and most diverse group of organisms, and show a wide variety of behaviors. Despite the importance of a comparative approach, recent insect neuroethology mostly relies on the fruit fly &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;, a versatile model insect with particularly powerful genetic tools, and a relatively small number of researchers use non-&lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; insects. In the present study, a novel genetic reporting system for whole-brain activity mapping was established in the two-spotted cricket &lt;i&gt;Gryllus bimaculatus&lt;/i&gt; by using the newly identified and evolutionary conserved gene regulatory region of an immediate-early gene, &lt;i&gt;early growth response&lt;/i&gt;. This reporting system allowed us to analyze the behaviorally-evoked neural activity patterns at cellular resolution in the cricket brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: December 2018&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 53&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Cameron L Prigge, Jeremy N Kay&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dendrites are the conduits for receiving (and in some cases transmitting) neural signals; their ability to do these jobs is a direct result of their morphology. Developmental patterning mechanisms are critical to ensuring concordance between dendritic form and function. This article reviews recent studies in vertebrate retina and brain that elucidate key strategies for dendrite functional maturation. Specific cellular and molecular signals control the initiation and elaboration of dendritic arbors, and facilitate integration of young neurons into particular circuits. In some cells, dendrite growth and remodeling continues into adulthood. Once formed, dendrites subdivide into compartments with distinct physiological properties that enable dendritic computations. Understanding these key stages of dendrite patterning will help reveal how circuit functional properties arise during development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A new dynamic correlation algorithm reveals novel functional aspects in single cell and bulk RNA-seq data</title>

Dynamic correlations are pervasive in high-throughput data. Large numbers of gene pairs can change their correlation patterns in response to observed/unobserved changes in physiological states. Finding changes in correlation patterns can reveal important regulatory mechanisms. Currently there is no method that can effectively detect global dynamic correlation patterns in a dataset. Given the challenging nature of the problem, the currently available methods use genes as surrogate measurements of physiological states, which cannot faithfully represent true underlying biological signals. In this study we develop a new method that directly identifies strong latent dynamic correlation signals from the data matrix, named DCA: Dynamic Correlation Analysis. At the center of the method is a new metric for the identification of pairs of variables that are highly likely to be dynamically correlated, without knowing the underlying physiological states that govern the dynamic correlation. We validate the performance of the method with extensive simulations. We applied the method to three real datasets: a single cell RNA-seq dataset, a bulk RNA-seq dataset, and a microarray gene expression dataset. In all three datasets, the method reveals novel latent factors with clear biological meaning, bringing new insights into the data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PtZYXnfwjiY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Differentiation in Theta and Beta Electrocortical Activity between Visual and Physical Perturbations to Walking and Standing Balance</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0207-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Human balance is a complex process in healthy adults, requiring precisely-timed coordination between sensory information, cognitive processing, and motor control. It has been difficult to quantify brain dynamics during human balance control due to limitations in brain imaging modalities. The goal of this study was to determine if by using high-density electroencephalography (EEG) and independent component analysis, we can identify common cortical responses to visual and physical balance perturbations during walking and standing. We studied the responses of 30 healthy young adults to sensorimotor perturbations that challenged their balance. Subjects performed four 10-minute trials of beam-walking and tandem stance while either being mediolaterally pulled at the waist or viewing brief 20° field-of-view rotations in virtual reality. We recorded high-density EEG, motion capture, lower leg electromyography (EMG), and neck EMG. We hypothesized that both physical pull and visual rotation perturbations would elicit time-frequency fluctuations in theta (4-8 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) bands, with increased occipito-parietal activity during visual rotations compared to pull perturbations. Our results confirmed this hypothesis. For both perturbations, we found early theta synchronization and late alpha-beta (8-30 Hz) desynchronization following perturbation onset. This pattern was strongest in occipito-parietal areas during visual perturbations and strongest in sensorimotor areas during pull perturbations. These results suggest a similar time-frequency electrocortical pattern when humans respond to sensorimotor conflict, but with substantive differences in the brain areas involved for visual vs. physical perturbations. Our findings may have important implications for assessing and training balance in individuals with and without motor disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; We performed the first EEG time-frequency analysis on source-localized human electrocortical responses to physical and visual balance perturbations during both walking and standing. Perturbations elicited similar time-frequency patterns, but in notably different cortical areas for physical versus visual perturbations. Perturbation-evoked EEG fluctuations localized primarily to occipito-parietal areas during visual perturbations and motor areas during physical perturbations. These similarities suggest a common electrocortical response to sensorimotor perturbations. Notably, standing had greater electrocortical responses than walking. The results from this study may have applications in assessing and assisting treatment of balance dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Epigenetic changes have likely contributed to the large size and enhanced cognitive abilities of the human brain which evolved within the last 2 million years after the human–chimpanzee split. Using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing, we have compared the methylomes of neuronal and non-neuronal cells from 3 human and 3 chimpanzee cortices. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) with genome-wide significance were enriched in specific genomic regions. Intraspecific methylation differences between neuronal and non-neuronal cells were approximately 3 times more abundant than interspecific methylation differences between human and chimpanzee cell types. The vast majority (&amp;gt;90%) of human intraspecific DMRs (including DMRs in retrotransposons) were hypomethylated in neurons, compared with glia. Intraspecific DMRs were enriched in genes associated with different neuropsychiatric disorders. Interspecific DMRs were enriched in genes showing human-specific brain histone modifications. Human–chimpanzee methylation differences were much more frequent in non-neuronal cells (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n. DMRs&lt;/span&gt; = 666) than in neurons (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n. DMRs&lt;/span&gt; = 96). More than 95% of interspecific DMRs in glia were hypermethylated in humans. Although without an outgroup we cannot assign whether a change in methylation occurred in the human or chimpanzee lineage, our results are consistent with a wave of methylation affecting several hundred non-neuronal genes during human brain evolution.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Glycosyltransferases are a class of enzymes that catalyse the posttranslational modification of proteins to produce a large number of glycoconjugate acceptors from a limited number of nucleotide-sugar donors. The products of one glycosyltransferase can be the substrates of several other enzymes, causing a combinatorial explosion in the number of possible glycan products. The kinetic behaviour of systems where multiple acceptor substrates compete for a single enzyme is presented, and the case in which high concentrations of an acceptor substrate are inhibitory as a result of abortive complex formation, is shown to result in non-Michaelian kinetics that can lead to bistability in an open system. A kinetic mechanism is proposed that is consistent with the available experimental evidence and provides a possible explanation for conflicting observations on the &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-1,4-galactosyltransferases. Abrupt switching between steady states in networks of glycosyltransferase-catalysed reactions may account for the observed changes in glycosyl-epitopes in cancer cells.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lG3i3Zrauw4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Rare-event sampling of epigenetic landscapes and phenotype transitions</title>

Stochastic simulation has been a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of gene regulatory networks, particularly in terms of understanding how cell-phenotype stability and fate-transitions are impacted by noisy gene expression. However, gene networks often have dynamics characterized by multiple attractors. Stochastic simulation is often inefficient for such systems, because most of the simulation time is spent waiting for rare, barrier-crossing events to occur. We present a rare-event simulation-based method for computing epigenetic landscapes and phenotype-transitions in metastable gene networks. Our computational pipeline was inspired by studies of metastability and barrier-crossing in protein folding, and provides an automated means of computing and visualizing essential stationary and dynamic information that is generally inaccessible to conventional simulation. Applied to a network model of pluripotency in Embryonic Stem Cells, our simulations revealed rare phenotypes and approximately Markovian transitions among phenotype-states, occurring with a broad range of timescales. The relative probabilities of phenotypes and the transition paths linking pluripotency and differentiation are sensitive to global kinetic parameters governing transcription factor-DNA binding kinetics. Our approach significantly expands the capability of stochastic simulation to investigate gene regulatory network dynamics, which may help guide rational cell reprogramming strategies. Our approach is also generalizable to other types of molecular networks and stochastic dynamics frameworks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ct0OUsyiK38&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: ApoE Regulates the Development of Adult Newborn Hippocampal Neurons</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/4/ENEURO.0155-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Adult hippocampal neurogenesis occurs throughout life and is believed to participate in cognitive functions such as learning and memory. A number of genes that regulate adult hippocampal neurogenesis have been identified, although most of these have been implicated in progenitor proliferation and survival, but not in the development into fully differentiated neurons. Among these genes, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is particularly compelling because the human ApoE isoform E4 is a risk factor for the development of Alzheimer’s disease, where hippocampal neurogenesis is reported to be dysfunctional. To investigate the effects of ApoE and its human isoforms on adult hippocampal neurogenesis and neuronal development, retroviruses carrying a GFP-expressing vector were injected into wild-type (WT), ApoE-deficient, and human targeted replacement (ApoE3 and ApoE4) mice to infect progenitors in the dentate gyrus and analyze the morphology of fully developed GFP-expressing neurons. Analysis of these adult-born neurons revealed significant decreases in the complexity of dendritic arborizations and spine density in ApoE-deficient mice compared with WT mice, as well as in ApoE4 mice compared with ApoE3. These findings demonstrate that ApoE deficiency and the ApoE4 human isoform both impair hippocampal neurogenesis and give insight into how ApoE may influence hippocampal-related neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Ultrastructural, Molecular and Functional Mapping of GABAergic Synapses on Dendritic Spines and Shafts of Neocortical Pyramidal Neurons</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The location of GABAergic synapses on dendrites is likely key for neuronal integration. In particular, inhibitory inputs on dendritic spines could serve to selectively veto or modulate individual excitatory inputs, greatly expanding the computational power of individual neurons. To investigate this, we have undertaken a combined functional, molecular, and ultrastructural mapping of the location of GABAergic inputs onto dendrites of pyramidal neurons from upper layers of juvenile mouse somatosensory cortex. Using two-photon uncaging of GABA, intracellular labeling with gerphyrin intrabodies, and focused ion beam milling with scanning electron microscopy, we find that most (96–98%) spines lack GABAergic synapses, although they still display GABAergic responses, potentially due to extrasynaptic GABA receptors. We conclude that GABAergic inputs, in practice, contact dendritic shafts and likely control clusters of excitatory inputs, defining functional zones on dendrites.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Although NSCs were thought to merely represent a stem cell type in the brain, recent advances have demonstrated the incredible complexity of NSC identity and functions. Ranging between quiescence, activation and intermediary subtypes, NSCs choose their fate through their developmental inheritance, regional positioning within the niche, as well as dynamic transcriptional and metabolic states. The plasticity of their developmental program is reflected in the tremendous changes they undergo upon external environmental cues and extrinsic manipulations, and harnessing these potentials can open new avenues to fight against brain injury, neurodegenerative and age-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(18)30160-7?rss=yes</link>
	<content:encoded>In 1984, biochemists George Glenner and Caine Wong, in search of ‘a unique amyloid fibril precursor protein in the serum’ of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients, successfully isolated and sequenced the first 24 amino acids of a ‘cerebrovascular amyloid fibril protein β’ that we now know as the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide. This landmark paper laid the foundation for extensive research in the following decades that ultimately established the role of β-amyloidosis as a player in the pathogenesis of AD.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>In their 1994 paper, Monyer et al. described unique functional properties and cell type-specific expression of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) GluN2 subunits, suggesting that the roles of NMDAR vary across brain regions and throughout development. This influential work not only provided insight into how molecular diversity impacts synapse function, but also continues to inform new approaches for modulating brain circuits.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Kynurenines, the major degradative products of the essential amino acid tryptophan, may play critical roles in the pathophysiology of depressive disorders. In 2014, Agudelo and colleagues reported that exercise indirectly modulates the metabolism of kynurenines in skeletal muscle, which in turn influences the brain and enhances resilience to depression.</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Revealing a Cortical Circuit Responsive to Predatory Threats and Mediating Contextual Fear Memory</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy173/5062357?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The ventral part of the anteromedial thalamic nucleus (AMv) receives substantial inputs from hypothalamic sites that are highly responsive to a live predator or its odor trace and represents an important thalamic hub for conveying predatory threat information to the cerebral cortex. In the present study, we begin by examining the cortico-amygdalar-hippocampal projections of the main AMv cortical targets, namely, the caudal prelimbic, rostral anterior cingulate, and medial visual areas, as well as the rostral part of the ventral retrosplenial area, one of the main targets of the anterior cingulate area. We observed that these areas form a clear cortical network. Next, we revealed that in animals exposed to a live cat, all of the elements of this circuit presented a differential increase in Fos, supporting the idea of a predator threat-responsive cortical network. Finally, we showed that bilateral cytotoxic lesions in each element of this cortical network did not change innate fear responses but drastically reduced contextual conditioning to the predator-associated environment. Overall, the present findings suggest that predator threat has an extensive representation in the cerebral cortex and revealed a cortical network that is responsive to predatory threats and exerts a critical role in processing fear memory.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Interrogating the Relationship Between Schizotypy, the Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT) Val158Met Polymorphism, and Neuronal Oscillatory Activity</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy171/5062355?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;COMT&lt;/span&gt; Val158Met polymorphism affects the availability of synaptic dopamine in the prefrontal cortex and has been widely studied as a genetic risk factor for psychosis. Schizotypy is associated with an increased risk of psychosis, with some studies implicating similar neurobiological mechanisms to schizophrenia. The present study sought to interrogate the link between the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;COMT&lt;/span&gt; Val158Met polymorphism and schizotypy using electroencephalogram (EEG) to identify neurophysiological mechanisms underpinning psychosis risk. Neurotypical (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 91) adults were genotyped for the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;COMT&lt;/span&gt; Val158Met polymorphism, completed the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ), and had eyes open resting-state EEG recorded for 4 min. SPQ suspiciousness subscale scores were higher for individuals homozygous for Val/Val and Met/Met versus Val/Met genotypes. Delta, theta, alpha-2, beta-1, and beta-2 amplitudes were lower for Val/Val than Met/Met individuals. Lower theta amplitudes were correlated with higher total SPQ scores (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; = 0.050), and multiple regression revealed that higher delta, and lower theta and beta-2 amplitudes (but not &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;COMT&lt;/span&gt; genotype) best predicted total SPQ scores (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; = 0.014). This study demonstrates the importance of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;COMT&lt;/span&gt; genotype in determining trait suspiciousness and EEG oscillatory activity. It also highlights relationships between dopaminergic alterations, EEG and schizotypy that are dissimilar to those observed in schizophrenia.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy090/5062356?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Although frequently discussed in terms of sex dimorphism, the neurobiology of sexual orientation and identity is unknown. We report multimodal magnetic resonance imaging data, including cortical thickness (Cth), subcortical volumes, and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging, from 27 transgender women (TrW), 40 transgender men (TrM), and 80 heterosexual (40 men) and 60 homosexual cisgender controls (30 men). These data show that whereas homosexuality is linked to cerebral sex dimorphism, gender dysphoria primarily involves cerebral networks mediating self–body perception. Among the homosexual cisgender controls, weaker sex dimorphism was found in white matter connections and a partly reversed sex dimorphism in Cth. Similar patterns were detected in transgender persons compared with heterosexual cisgender controls, but the significant clusters disappeared when adding homosexual controls, and correcting for sexual orientation. Instead, both TrW and TrM displayed singular features, showing greater Cth as well as weaker structural and functional connections in the anterior cingulate-precuneus and right occipito-parietal cortex, regions known to process own body perception in the context of self.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Selective attention is central to cognition. Dramatic advances have been made in understanding the neural circuits that mediate selective attention. Forebrain networks, most elaborated in primates, control all forms of attention based on task demands and the physical salience of stimuli. These networks contain circuits that distribute top-down signals to sensory processing areas and enhance information processing in those areas. A midbrain network, most elaborated in birds, controls spatial attention.</content:encoded>

These behavioral responses are thought to be largely driven by genetically pre-programmed circuits. However, they can also vary significantly according to the animal’s previous social experience and physiological state, suggesting that the underlying circuits are shaped by adaptive modulatory changes. Modern tools of neuroscience have enabled the direct interrogation of circuits driving sex-specific behaviors and helped unravel key neural mechanisms underlying their function and modulation. In particular, recent work has shown how individual neuronal responses may combine with population activity to encode specific social information in both sexes. In this review, we summarize recent findings on how sex-specific sensory information is processed in social behavioral circuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

However, the millisecond timescales for association often do not match the much longer delays for behaviorally relevant signals that supervise learning. In particular, information about the behavioral outcome of neural activity can be delayed, leading to a problem of temporal credit assignment. Recent studies suggest that synaptic plasticity can have temporal rules that not only accommodate the delays relevant to the circuit, but also be precisely tuned to the behavior the circuit supports. These discoveries highlight the diversity of plasticity rules, whose temporal requirements may depend on circuit delays and the contingencies of behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: ACC Sulcal Patterns and Their Modulation on Cognitive Control Efficiency Across Lifespan: A Neuroanatomical Study on Bilinguals and Monolinguals</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy175/5060274?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a key structure implicated in the regulation of cognitive control (CC). Previous studies suggest that variability in the ACC sulcal pattern—a neurodevelopmental marker unaffected by maturation or plasticity after birth—is associated with intersubject differences in CC performance. Here, we investigated whether bilingual experience modulates the effects of ACC sulcal variability on CC performance across the lifespan. Using structural MRI, we first established the distribution of the ACC sulcal patterns in a large sample of healthy individuals (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 270) differing on gender and ethnicity. Second, a participants’ subsample (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 157) was selected to test whether CC performance was differentially affected by ACC sulcation in bilinguals and monolinguals across age. A prevalent leftward asymmetry unaffected by gender or ethnicity was reported. Sulcal variability in the ACC predicted CC performance differently in bilinguals and monolinguals, with a reversed pattern of structure–function relationship: asymmetrical versus symmetrical ACC sulcal patterns were associated with a performance advantage in monolinguals and a performance detriment to bilinguals and vice versa. Altogether, these findings provide novel insights on the dynamic interplay between early neurodevelopment, environmental background and cognitive efficiency across age.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Hippocampal Network Oscillations Rescue Memory Consolidation Deficits Caused by Sleep Loss</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy174/5060282?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Oscillations in the hippocampal network during sleep are proposed to play a role in memory storage by patterning neuronal ensemble activity. Here we show that following single-trial fear learning, sleep deprivation (which impairs memory consolidation) disrupts coherent firing rhythms in hippocampal area CA1. State-targeted optogenetic inhibition of CA1 parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons during postlearning NREM sleep, but not REM sleep or wake, disrupts contextual fear memory (CFM) consolidation in a manner similar to sleep deprivation. NREM-targeted inhibition disrupts CA1 network oscillations which predict successful memory storage. Rhythmic optogenetic activation of PV+ interneurons following learning generates CA1 oscillations with coherent principal neuron firing. This patterning of CA1 activity rescues CFM consolidation in sleep-deprived mice. Critically, behavioral and optogenetic manipulations that disrupt CFM also disrupt learning-induced stabilization of CA1 ensembles’ communication patterns in the hours following learning. Conversely, manipulations that promote CFM also promote long-term stability of CA1 communication patterns. We conclude that sleep promotes memory consolidation by generating coherent rhythms of CA1 network activity, which provide consistent communication patterns within neuronal ensembles. Most importantly, we show that this rhythmic patterning of activity is sufficient to promote long-term memory storage in the absence of sleep.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;After spinal cord injury (SCI), the motor-related cortical areas can be a potential substrate for functional recovery in addition to the spinal cord. However, a dynamic description of how motor cortical circuits reorganize after SCI is lacking. Here, we captured the comprehensive dynamics of motor networks across SCI in a nonhuman primate model. Using electrocorticography over the sensorimotor areas in monkeys, we collected broadband neuronal signals during a reaching-and-grasping task at different stages of recovery of dexterous finger movements after a partial SCI at the cervical levels. We identified two distinct network dynamics: grasping-related intrahemispheric interactions from the contralesional premotor cortex (PM) to the contralesional primary motor cortex (M1) in the high-γ band (&amp;gt;70 Hz), and motor-preparation-related interhemispheric interactions from the contralesional to ipsilesional PM in the α and low-β bands (10–15 Hz). The strengths of these networks correlated to the time course of behavioral recovery. The grasping-related network showed enhanced activation immediately after the injury, but gradually returned to normal while the strength of the motor-preparation-related network gradually increased. Our findings suggest a cortical compensatory mechanism after SCI, where two interdependent motor networks redirect activity from the contralesional hemisphere to the other hemisphere to facilitate functional recovery.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Control Engagement During Sentence and Inhibition fMRI Tasks in Children With Reading Difficulties</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy170/5060275?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Recent reading research implicates executive control regions as sites of difference in struggling readers. However, as studies often employ only reading or language tasks, the extent of deviation in control engagement in children with reading difficulties is not known. The current study investigated activation in reading and executive control brain regions during both a sentence comprehension task and a nonlexical inhibitory control task in third–fifth grade children with and without reading difficulties. We employed both categorical (group-based) and individual difference approaches to relate reading ability to brain activity. During sentence comprehension, struggling readers had less activation in the left posterior temporal cortex, previously implicated in language, semantic, and reading research. Greater negative activity (relative to fixation) during sentence comprehension in a left inferior parietal region from the executive control literature correlated with poorer reading ability. Greater comprehension scores were associated with less dorsal anterior cingulate activity during the sentence comprehension task. Unlike the sentence task, there were no significant differences between struggling and nonstruggling readers for the nonlexical inhibitory control task. Thus, differences in executive control engagement were largely specific to reading, rather than a general control deficit across tasks in children with reading difficulties, informing future intervention research.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Timing of Sensory-Guided Behavioral Response is Represented in
the Mouse Primary Somatosensory Cortex</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy169/5060281?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Whisker-guided decision making in mice is thought to critically depend on
information processing occurring in the primary somatosensory cortex. However,
it is not clear if neuronal activity in this “early”
sensory region contains information about the timing and speed of motor
response. To address this question we designed a new task in which freely moving
mice learned to associate a whisker stimulus to reward delivery. The task was
tailored in such a way that a wide range of delays between whisker stimulation
and reward collection were observed due to differences of motivation and
perception. After training, mice were anesthetized and neuronal responses evoked
by stimulating trained and untrained whiskers were recorded across several
cortical columns of barrel cortex. We found a strong correlation between the
delay of the mouse behavioral response and the timing of multiunit activity
evoked by the trained whisker, outside its principal cortical column, in layers
4 and 5A but not in layer 2/3. Circuit mapping ex vivo revealed this effect was
associated with a weakening of layer 4 to layer 2/3 projection. We conclude that
the processes controlling the propagation of key sensory inputs to naive
cortical columns and the timing of sensory-guided action are linked.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Prefrontal Control Over Occipital Responses to Crossmodal Overlap Varies Across the Congruency Spectrum</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy168/5060272?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;While matched crossmodal information is known to facilitate object recognition, it is unclear how our perceptual systems encode the more gradual congruency variations that occur in our natural environment. Combining visual objects with odor mixtures to create a gradual increase in semantic object overlap, we demonstrate high behavioral acuity to linear variations of olfactory–visual overlap in a healthy adult population. This effect was paralleled by a linear increase in cortical activation at the intersection of occipital fusiform and lingual gyri, indicating linear encoding of crossmodal semantic overlap in visual object recognition networks. Effective connectivity analyses revealed that this integration of olfactory and visual information was achieved by direct information exchange between olfactory and visual areas. In addition, a parallel pathway through the superior frontal gyrus was increasingly recruited towards the most ambiguous stimuli. These findings demonstrate that cortical structures involved in object formation are inherently crossmodal and encode sensory overlap in a linear manner. The results further demonstrate that prefrontal control of these processes is likely required for ambiguous stimulus combinations, a fact of high ecological relevance that may be inappropriately captured by common task designs juxtaposing congruency and incongruency.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Role of the Default Mode Network in Cognitive Transitions</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy167/5060278?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;A frequently repeated finding is that the default mode network (DMN) shows activation decreases during externally focused tasks. This finding has led to an emphasis in DMN research on internally focused self-relevant thought processes. A recent study, in contrast, implicates the DMN in substantial externally focused task switches. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we scanned 24 participants performing a task switch experiment. Whilst replicating previous DMN task switch effects, we also found large DMN increases for brief rests as well as task restarts after rest. Our findings are difficult to explain using theories strictly linked to internal or self-directed cognition. In line with principal results from the literature, we suggest that the DMN encodes scene, episode or context, by integrating spatial, self-referential, and temporal information. Context representations are strong at rest, but rereference to context also occurs at major cognitive transitions.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>
