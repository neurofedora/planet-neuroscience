	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Designing microbial communities to maximize the thermodynamic driving force for the production of chemicals</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/AsBjj8YyUk8/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Pavlos Stephanos Bekiaris, Steffen Klamt&lt;/p&gt;

Microbial communities have become a major research focus due to their importance for biogeochemical cycles, biomedicine and biotechnological applications. While some biotechnological applications, such as anaerobic digestion, make use of naturally arising microbial communities, the rational design of microbial consortia for bio-based production processes has recently gained much interest. One class of synthetic microbial consortia is based on specifically designed strains of one species. A common design principle for these consortia is based on division of labor, where the entire production pathway is divided between the different strains to reduce the metabolic burden caused by product synthesis. We first show that classical division of labor does not automatically reduce the metabolic burden when metabolic flux per biomass is analyzed. We then present ASTHERISC (Algorithmic Search of THERmodynamic advantages in Single-species Communities), a new computational approach for designing multi-strain communities of a single-species with the aim to divide a production pathway between different strains such that the thermodynamic driving force for product synthesis is maximized. ASTHERISC exploits the fact that compartmentalization of segments of a product pathway in different strains can circumvent thermodynamic bottlenecks arising when operation of one reaction requires a metabolite with high and operation of another reaction the same metabolite with low concentration. We implemented the ASTHERISC algorithm in a dedicated program package and applied it on &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; core and genome-scale models with different settings, for example, regarding number of strains or demanded product yield. These calculations showed that, for each scenario, many target metabolites (products) exist where a multi-strain community can provide a thermodynamic advantage compared to a single strain solution. In some cases, a production with sufficiently high yield is thermodynamically only feasible with a community. In summary, the developed ASTHERISC approach provides a promising new principle for designing microbial communities for the bio-based production of chemicals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AsBjj8YyUk8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: BIO-LGCA: A cellular automaton modelling class for analysing collective cell migration</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/vilLL9K1a5s/article</link>

Collective dynamics in multicellular systems such as biological organs and tissues plays a key role in biological development, regeneration, and pathological conditions. Collective tissue dynamics—understood as population behaviour arising from the interplay of the constituting discrete cells—can be studied with on- and off-lattice agent-based models. However, classical on-lattice agent-based models, also known as cellular automata, fail to replicate key aspects of collective migration, which is a central instance of collective behaviour in multicellular systems. To overcome drawbacks of classical on-lattice models, we introduce an on-lattice, agent-based modelling class for collective cell migration, which we call biological lattice-gas cellular automaton (BIO-LGCA). The BIO-LGCA is characterised by synchronous time updates, and the explicit consideration of individual cell velocities. While rules in classical cellular automata are typically chosen ad hoc, rules for cell-cell and cell-environment interactions in the BIO-LGCA can also be derived from experimental cell migration data or biophysical laws for individual cell migration. We introduce elementary BIO-LGCA models of fundamental cell interactions, which may be combined in a modular fashion to model complex multicellular phenomena. We exemplify the mathematical mean-field analysis of specific BIO-LGCA models, which allows to explain collective behaviour. The first example predicts the formation of clusters in adhesively interacting cells. The second example is based on a novel BIO-LGCA combining adhesive interactions and alignment. For this model, our analysis clarifies the nature of the recently discovered invasion plasticity of breast cancer cells in heterogeneous environments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vilLL9K1a5s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Promoting inclusive metrics of success and impact to dismantle a discriminatory reward system in science</title>

Success and impact metrics in science are based on a system that perpetuates sexist and racist “rewards” by prioritizing citations and impact factors. These metrics are flawed and biased against already marginalized groups and fail to accurately capture the breadth of individuals’ meaningful scientific impacts. We advocate shifting this outdated value system to advance science through principles of justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion.

	<title>PLoS Biology: What’s not in the news headlines or titles of Alzheimer disease articles? #InMice</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Marcia Triunfol, Fabio C. Gouveia&lt;/p&gt;

There is increasing scrutiny around how science is communicated to the public. For instance, a Twitter account @justsaysinmice (with 70.4K followers in January 2021) was created to call attention to news headlines that omit that mice, not humans, are the ones for whom the study findings apply. This is the case of many headlines reporting on Alzheimer disease (AD) research. AD is characterized by a degeneration of the human brain, loss of cognition, and behavioral changes, for which no treatment is available. Around 200 rodent models have been developed to study AD, even though AD is an exclusively human condition that does not occur naturally in other species and appears impervious to reproduction in artificial animal models, an information not always disclosed. It is not known what prompts writers of news stories to either omit or acknowledge, in the story’s headlines, that the study was done in mice and not in humans. Here, we raised the hypothesis that how science is reported by scientists plays a role on the news reporting. To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether an association exists between articles’ titles and news’ headlines regarding the omission, or not, of mice. To this end, we analyzed a sample of 623 open-access scientific papers indexed in PubMed in 2018 and 2019 that used mice either as models or as the biological source for experimental studies in AD research. We found a significant association (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) between articles’ titles and news stories’ headlines, revealing that when authors omit the species in the paper’s title, writers of news stories tend to follow suit. We also found that papers not mentioning mice in their titles are more newsworthy and significantly more tweeted than papers that do. Our study shows that science reporting may affect media reporting and asks for changes in the way we report about findings obtained with animal models used to study human diseases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Vyr7Oq10CKM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07622</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a high-risk dementia condition which
progresses to probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) at approximately 10% to 15% per
year. Characterization of group-level differences between two subtypes of MCI -
stable MCI (sMCI) and progressive MCI (pMCI) is the key step to understand the
mechanisms of MCI progression and enable possible delay of transition from MCI
to AD. Functional connectivity (FC) is considered as a promising way to study
MCI progression since which may show alterations even in preclinical stages and
provide substrates for AD progression. However, the representative FC patterns
during AD development for different clinical groups, especially for sMCI and
pMCI, have been understudied. In this work, we integrated autoencoder and
multi-class classification into a single deep model and successfully learned a
set of clinical group related feature vectors. Specifically, we trained two
non-linear mappings which realized the mutual transformations between original
FC space and the feature space. By mapping the learned clinical group related
feature vectors to the original FC space, representative FCs were constructed
for each group. Moreover, based on these feature vectors, our model achieves a
high classification accuracy - 68% for multi-class classification (NC vs SMC vs
sMCI vs pMCI vs AD).

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Partial success in closing the gap between human and machine vision. (arXiv:2106.07411v1 [cs.CV])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07411</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, the first CNN surpassed human performance on ImageNet.
However, it soon became clear that machines lack robustness on more challenging
test cases, a major obstacle towards deploying machines &quot;in the wild&quot; and
towards obtaining better computational models of human visual perception. Here
we ask: Are we making progress in closing the gap between human and machine
vision? To answer this question, we tested human observers on a broad range of
out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets, adding the &quot;missing human baseline&quot; by
recording 85,120 psychophysical trials across 90 participants. We then
investigated a range of promising machine learning developments that crucially
deviate from standard supervised CNNs along three axes: objective function
(self-supervised, adversarially trained, CLIP language-image training),
architecture (e.g. vision transformers), and dataset size (ranging from 1M to
1B). Our findings are threefold. (1.) The longstanding robustness gap between
humans and CNNs is closing, with the best models now matching or exceeding
human performance on most OOD datasets. (2.) There is still a substantial
image-level consistency gap, meaning that humans make different errors than
models. In contrast, most models systematically agree in their categorisation
errors, even substantially different ones like contrastive self-supervised vs.
standard supervised models. (3.) In many cases, human-to-model consistency
improves when training dataset size is increased by one to three orders of
magnitude. Our results give reason for cautious optimism: While there is still
much room for improvement, the behavioural difference between human and machine
vision is narrowing. In order to measure future progress, 17 OOD datasets with
image-level human behavioural data are provided as a benchmark here:

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07369</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Understanding how agents learn to generalize -- and, in particular, to
extrapolate -- in high-dimensional, naturalistic environments remains a
challenge for both machine learning and the study of biological agents. One
approach to this has been the use of function learning paradigms, which allow
peoples' empirical patterns of generalization for smooth scalar functions to be
described precisely. However, to date, such work has not succeeded in
identifying mechanisms that acquire the kinds of general purpose
representations over which function learning can operate to exhibit the
patterns of generalization observed in human empirical studies. Here, we
present a framework for how a learner may acquire such representations, that
then support generalization -- and extrapolation in particular -- in a few-shot
fashion. Taking inspiration from a classic theory of visual processing, we
construct a self-supervised encoder that implements the basic inductive bias of
invariance under topological distortions. We show the resulting representations
outperform those from other models for unsupervised time series learning in
several downstream function learning tasks, including extrapolation.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the brain and cognitive sciences have made great strides
developing a mechanistic understanding of object recognition in mature brains.
Despite this progress, fundamental questions remain about the origins and
computational foundations of object recognition. What learning algorithms
underlie object recognition in newborn brains? Since newborn animals learn
largely through unsupervised learning, we explored whether unsupervised
learning algorithms can be used to predict the view-invariant object
recognition behavior of newborn chicks. Specifically, we used feature
representations derived from unsupervised deep neural networks (DNNs) as inputs
to cognitive models of categorization. We show that features derived from
unsupervised DNNs make competitive predictions about chick behavior compared to
supervised features. More generally, we argue that linking controlled-rearing
studies to image-computable DNN models opens new experimental avenues for
studying the origins and computational basis of object recognition in newborn
animals.

study, we present a neuromorphic, spiking backpropagation algorithm based on
pulse-gated dynamical information coordination and processing, implemented on
Intel's Loihi neuromorphic research processor. We demonstrate a
proof-of-principle three-layer circuit that learns to classify digits from the

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent research in adversarially robust classifiers suggests their
representations tend to be aligned with human perception, which makes them
attractive for image synthesis and restoration applications. Despite favorable
empirical results on a few downstream tasks, their advantages are limited to
slow and sensitive optimization-based techniques. Moreover, their use on
generative models remains unexplored. This work proposes the use of robust
representations as a perceptual primitive for feature inversion models, and
show its benefits with respect to standard non-robust image features. We
empirically show that adopting robust representations as an image prior
significantly improves the reconstruction accuracy of CNN-based feature
inversion models. Furthermore, it allows reconstructing images at multiple
scales out-of-the-box. Following these findings, we propose an
encoding-decoding network based on robust representations and show its
advantages for applications such as anomaly detection, style transfer and image
denoising.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Modern neuroscience employs in silico experimentation on ever-increasing and
more detailed neural networks. The high modelling detail goes hand in hand with
the need for high model reproducibility, reusability and transparency. Besides,
the size of the models and the long timescales under study mandate the use of a
simulation system with high computational performance, so as to provide an
acceptable time to result. In this work, we present EDEN (Extensible Dynamics
Engine for Networks), a new general-purpose, NeuroML-based neural simulator
that achieves both high model flexibility and high computational performance,
through an innovative model-analysis and code-generation technique. The
simulator runs NeuroML v2 models directly, eliminating the need for users to
learn yet another simulator-specific, model-specification language. EDEN's
functional correctness and computational performance were assessed through
NeuroML models available on the NeuroML-DB and Open Source Brain model
repositories. In qualitative experiments, the results produced by EDEN were
verified against the established NEURON simulator, for a wide range of models.
At the same time, computational-performance benchmarks reveal that EDEN runs up
to 2 orders-of-magnitude faster than NEURON on a typical desktop computer, and
does so without additional effort from the user. Finally, and without added
user effort, EDEN has been built from scratch to scale seamlessly over multiple
CPUs and across computer clusters, when available.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06743</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Alzheimers disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder
and the main cause of dementia in aging. Hippocampus is prone to changes in the
early stages of Alzheimers disease. Detection and observation of the
hippocampus changes using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before the onset of
Alzheimers disease leads to the faster preventive and therapeutic measures.
Objective: The aim of this study was the segmentation of the hippocampus in
magnetic resonance (MR) images of Alzheimers patients using deep machine
learning method. Methods: U-Net architecture of convolutional neural network
was proposed to segment the hippocampus in the real MRI data. The MR images of
the 100 and 35 patients available in Alzheimers disease Neuroimaging Initiative
(ADNI) dataset, was used for the train and test of the model, respectively. The
performance of the proposed method was compared with manual segmentation by
measuring the similarity metrics. Results: The desired segmentation achieved
after 10 iterations. A Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) = 92.3%, sensitivity =
96.5%, positive predicted value (PPV) = 90.4%, and Intersection over Union
(IoU) value for the train 92.94 and test 92.93 sets were obtained which are
acceptable. Conclusion: The proposed approach is promising and can be extended
in the prognosis of Alzheimers disease by the prediction of the hippocampus
volume changes in the early stage of the disease.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Federated Learning with Spiking Neural Networks. (arXiv:2106.06579v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06579</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As neural networks get widespread adoption in resource-constrained embedded
devices, there is a growing need for low-power neural systems. Spiking Neural
Networks (SNNs)are emerging to be an energy-efficient alternative to the
traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) which are known to be
computationally intensive. From an application perspective, as federated
learning involves multiple energy-constrained devices, there is a huge scope to
leverage energy efficiency provided by SNNs. Despite its importance, there has
been little attention on training SNNs on a large-scale distributed system like
federated learning. In this paper, we bring SNNs to a more realistic federated
learning scenario. Specifically, we propose a federated learning framework for
decentralized and privacy-preserving training of SNNs. To validate the proposed
federated learning framework, we experimentally evaluate the advantages of SNNs
on various aspects of federated learning with CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 benchmarks.
We observe that SNNs outperform ANNs in terms of overall accuracy by over 15%
when the data is distributed across a large number of clients in the federation
while providing up to5.3x energy efficiency. In addition to efficiency, we also
analyze the sensitivity of the proposed federated SNN framework to data
distribution among the clients, stragglers, and gradient noise and perform a
comprehensive comparison with ANNs.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: DeepShift: Towards Multiplication-Less Neural Networks. (arXiv:1905.13298v4 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13298</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The high computation, memory, and power budgets of inferring convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) are major bottlenecks of model deployment to edge
computing platforms, e.g., mobile devices and IoT. Moreover, training CNNs is
time and energy-intensive even on high-grade servers. Convolution layers and
fully connected layers, because of their intense use of multiplications, are
the dominant contributor to this computation budget.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We propose to alleviate this problem by introducing two new operations:
convolutional shifts and fully-connected shifts which replace multiplications
with bitwise shift and sign flipping during both training and inference. During
inference, both approaches require only 5 bits (or less) to represent the
weights. This family of neural network architectures (that use convolutional
shifts and fully connected shifts) is referred to as DeepShift models. We
propose two methods to train DeepShift models: DeepShift-Q which trains regular
weights constrained to powers of 2, and DeepShift-PS that trains the values of
the shifts and sign flips directly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very close accuracy, and in some cases higher accuracy, to baselines are
achieved. Converting pre-trained 32-bit floating-point baseline models of
ResNet18, ResNet50, VGG16, and GoogleNet to DeepShift and training them for 15
to 30 epochs, resulted in Top-1/Top-5 accuracies higher than that of the
original model.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, we implemented the convolutional shifts and fully
connected shift GPU kernels and showed a reduction in latency time of 25% when
inferring ResNet18 compared to unoptimized multiplication-based GPU kernels.
The code can be found at https://github.com/mostafaelhoushi/DeepShift.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Lifelong Neural Predictive Coding: Learning Cumulatively Online without Forgetting. (arXiv:1905.10696v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10696</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In lifelong learning systems, especially those based on artificial neural
networks, one of the biggest obstacles is the severe inability to retain old
knowledge as new information is encountered. This phenomenon is known as
catastrophic forgetting. In this article, we propose a new kind of
connectionist architecture, the Sequential Neural Coding Network, that is
robust to forgetting when learning from streams of data points and, unlike
networks of today, does not learn via the immensely popular back-propagation of
errors. Grounded in the neurocognitive theory of predictive processing, our
model adapts its synapses in a biologically-plausible fashion, while another,
complementary neural system rapidly learns to direct and control this
cortex-like structure by mimicking the task-executive control functionality of
the basal ganglia. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our self-organizing
system experiences significantly less forgetting as compared to standard neural
models and outperforms a wide swath of previously proposed methods even though
it is trained across task datasets in a stream-like fashion. The promising
performance of our complementary system on benchmarks, e.g., SplitMNIST, Split
Fashion MNIST, and Split NotMNIST, offers evidence that by incorporating
mechanisms prominent in real neuronal systems, such as competition, sparse
activation patterns, and iterative input processing, a new possibility for
tackling the grand challenge of lifelong machine learning opens up.

	<title>Journal of Neurology: The impact of device-assisted therapies on the gut microbiome in Parkinson’s disease</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00415-021-10657-9</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Microbiome feedbacks are proposed to influence Parkinson’s disease (PD) pathophysiology. A number of studies have evaluated the impact of oral medication on the gut microbiome (GM) in PD. However, the influence of PD device-assisted therapies (DATs) on the GM remains to be investigated.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To profile acute gut microbial community alterations in response to PD DAT initiation.
      &lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Clinical data and stool samples were collected from 21 PD patients initiating either deep brain stimulation (DBS) or levodopa–carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) and ten spousal healthy control (HC) subjects. 16S amplicon sequencing of stool DNA enabled comparison of temporal GM stability between groups and with clinical measures, including disease alterations relative to therapy initiation.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We assessed GM response to therapy in the PD group by comparing pre-therapy (− 2 and 0 weeks) with post-therapy initiation timepoints (+ 2 and + 4 weeks) and HCs at baseline (0 weeks). Altered GM compositions were noted between the PD and HC groups at various taxonomic levels, including specific differences for DBS (overrepresentation of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Clostridium_XlVa, Bilophila, Parabacteroides&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Pseudoflavonifractor&lt;/em&gt; and underrepresentation of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Dorea&lt;/em&gt;) and LCIG therapy (overrepresentation of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Pseudoflavonifractor, Escherichia/Shigella&lt;/em&gt;, and underrepresentation of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Gemmiger&lt;/em&gt;). Beta diversity changes were also found over the 4 week post-treatment initiation period.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec5&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We report on initial short-term GM changes in response to the initiation of PD DATs. Prior to the introduction of the DAT, a PD-associated GM was observed. Following initiation of DAT, several DAT-specific changes in GM composition were identified, suggesting DATs can influence the GM in PD.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Roles and Transcriptional Responses of Inhibitory Neurons in Learning and Memory</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.689952</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Increasing evidence supports a model whereby memories are encoded by sparse ensembles of neurons called engrams, activated during memory encoding and reactivated upon recall. An engram consists of a network of cells that undergo long-lasting modifications of their transcriptional programs and connectivity. Ground-breaking advancements in this field have been made possible by the creative exploitation of the characteristic transcriptional responses of neurons to activity, allowing both engram labeling and manipulation. Nevertheless, numerous aspects of engram cell-type composition and function remain to be addressed. As recent transcriptomic studies have revealed, memory encoding induces persistent transcriptional and functional changes in a plethora of neuronal subtypes and non-neuronal cells, including glutamatergic excitatory neurons, GABAergic inhibitory neurons, and glia cells. Dissecting the contribution of these different cellular classes to memory engram formation and activity is quite a challenging yet essential endeavor. In this review, we focus on the role played by the GABAergic inhibitory component of the engram through two complementary lenses. On one hand, we report on available physiological evidence addressing the involvement of inhibitory neurons to different stages of memory formation, consolidation, storage and recall. On the other, we capitalize on a growing number of transcriptomic studies that profile the transcriptional response of inhibitory neurons to activity, revealing important clues on their potential involvement in learning and memory processes. The picture that emerges suggests that inhibitory neurons are an essential component of the engram, likely involved in engram allocation, in tuning engram excitation and in storing the memory trace.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Conceptual and Methodological Pitfalls in Experimental Studies: An Overview, and the Case of Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.684977</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The main goal of scientific research is to uncover new knowledge to understand reality. In the field of life sciences, the aim of translational research—to transfer results “from bench to bedside”—has to contend with the problem that the knowledge acquired at the “bench” is often not reproducible at the “bedside,” raising the question whether scientific discoveries truly mirror the real world. As a result, researchers constantly struggle to overcome the dichotomy between methodological problems and expectations, as funding agencies and industries demand expandable and quick results whereas patients, who are uninterested in the epistemological dispute, only ask for an effective cure. Despite the numerous attempts made to address reproducibility and reliability issues, some essential pitfalls of scientific investigations are often overlooked. Here, we discuss some limitations of the conventional scientific method and how researcher cognitive bias and conceptual errors have the potential to steer an experimental study away from the search for the vera causa of a phenomenon. As an example, we focus on Alzheimer’s disease research and on some problems that may have undermined most of the clinical trials conducted to investigate it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Mammalian Neuronal mRNA Transport Complexes: The Few Knowns and the Many Unknowns</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2021.692948</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are transported into neurites to provide templates for the assembly of local protein networks. These networks enable a neuron to configure different cellular domains for specialized functions. According to current evidence, mRNAs are mostly transported in rather small packages of one to three copies, rarely containing different transcripts. This opens up fascinating logistic problems: how are hundreds of different mRNA cargoes sorted into distinct packages and how are they coupled to and released from motor proteins to produce the observed mRNA distributions? Are all mRNAs transported by the same transport machinery, or are there different adaptors or motors for different transcripts or classes of mRNAs? A variety of often indirect evidence exists for the involvement of proteins in mRNA localization, but relatively little is known about the essential activities required for the actual transport process. Here, we summarize the different types of available evidence for interactions that connect mammalian mRNAs to motor proteins to highlight at which point further research is needed to uncover critical missing links. We further argue that a combination of discovery approaches reporting direct interactions, in vitro reconstitution, and fast perturbations in cells is an ideal future strategy to unravel essential interactions and specific functions of proteins in mRNA transport processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Central Nervous System-Endogenous TLR7 and TLR9 Induce Different Immune Responses and Effects on Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.685645</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Innate receptors, including Toll like receptors (TLRs), are implicated in pathogenesis of CNS inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). TLR response to pathogens or endogenous signals includes production of immunoregulatory mediators. One of these, interferon (IFN)β, a Type I IFN, plays a protective role in MS and EAE. We have previously shown that intrathecal administration of selected TLR ligands induced IFNβ and infiltration of blood-derived myeloid cells into the central nervous system (CNS), and suppressed EAE in mice. We have now extended these studies to evaluate a potential therapeutic role for CNS-endogenous TLR7 and TLR9. Intrathecal application of Imiquimod (TLR7 ligand) or CpG oligonucleotide (TLR9 ligand) into CNS of otherwise unmanipulated mice induced IFNβ expression, with greater magnitude in response to CpG. CD45+ cells in the meninges were identified as source of IFNβ. Intrathecal CpG induced infiltration of monocytes, neutrophils, CD4+ T cells and NK cells whereas Imiquimod did not recruit blood-derived CD45+ cells. CpG, but not Imiquimod, had a beneficial effect on EAE, when given at time of disease onset. This therapeutic effect of CpG on EAE was not seen in mice lacking the Type I IFN receptor. In mice with EAE treated with CpG, the proportion of monocytes was significantly increased in the CNS. Infiltrating cells were predominantly localized to spinal cord meninges and demyelination was significantly reduced compared to non-treated mice with EAE. Our findings show that TLR7 and TLR9 signaling induce distinct inflammatory responses in the CNS with different outcome in EAE and point to recruitment of blood-derived cells and IFNβ induction as possible mechanistic links between TLR9 stimulation and amelioration of EAE. The protective role of TLR9 signaling in the CNS may have application in treatment of diseases such as MS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Hualpha-Syn (A53T) mice had significantly lower [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG uptake in several brain regions compared to the no-carrier mice. Significant hind limb muscle and lower spinal cord [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG hypometabolism at 9 months of age in A53T PD mice was also indicative of neurodegenerative disease, with a progressive motoric dysfunction leading to death. Significant decrease (up to 30%) in [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG uptake were observed in 9-month old male and female Hualpha-Syn (A53) mice. This is consistent with the cortical hypometabolism in PD patients. Hualpha-Syn (A53) mice may thus be a suitable model for studies related to PD α-synucleinopathy for the discovery of new biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Self-Reset Image Sensor With a Signal-to-Noise Ratio Over 70 dB and Its Application to Brain Surface Imaging</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.667932</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this study, we propose a complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor with a self-resetting system demonstrating a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to detect small intrinsic signals such as a hemodynamic reaction or neural activity in a mouse brain. The photodiode structure was modified from N-well/P-sub to P+/N-well/P-sub to increase the photodiode capacitance to reduce the number of self-resets required to decrease the unstable stage. Moreover, our new relay board was used for the first time. As a result, an effective SNR of over 70 dB was achieved within the same pixel size and fill factor. The unstable state was drastically reduced. Thus, we will be able to detect neural activity. With its compact size, this device has significant potential to become an intrinsic signal detector in freely moving animals. We also demonstrated in vivo imaging with image processing by removing additional noise from the self-reset operation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.663174</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Flexible polymer neural probes are an attractive emerging approach for invasive brain recordings, given that they can minimize the risks of brain damage or glial scaring. However, densely packed electrode sites, which can facilitate neuronal data analysis, are not widely available in flexible probes. Here, we present a new flexible polyimide neural probe, based on standard and low-cost lithography processes, which has 32 closely spaced 10 μm diameter gold electrode sites at two different depths from the probe surface arranged in a matrix, with inter-site distances of only 5 μm. The double-layer design and fabrication approach implemented also provides additional stiffening just sufficient to prevent probe buckling during brain insertion. This approach avoids typical laborious augmentation strategies used to increase flexible probes’ mechanical rigidity while allowing a small brain insertion footprint. Chemical composition analysis and metrology of structural, mechanical, and electrical properties demonstrated the viability of this fabrication approach. Finally, in vivo functional assessment tests in the mouse cortex were performed as well as histological assessment of the insertion footprint, validating the biological applicability of this flexible neural probe for acquiring high quality neuronal recordings with high signal to noise ratio (SNR) and reduced acute trauma.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Bundle-Specific Axon Diameter Index as a New Contrast to Differentiate White Matter Tracts</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.646034</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the central nervous system of primates, several pathways are characterized by different spectra of axon diameters. In vivo methods, based on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, can provide axon diameter index estimates non-invasively. However, such methods report voxel-wise estimates, which vary from voxel-to-voxel for the same white matter bundle due to partial volume contributions from other pathways having different microstructure properties. Here, we propose a novel microstructure-informed tractography approach, COMMIT&lt;sub&gt;AxSize&lt;/sub&gt;, to resolve axon diameter index estimates at the streamline level, thus making the estimates invariant along trajectories. Compared to previously proposed voxel-wise methods, our formulation allows the estimation of a distinct axon diameter index value for each streamline, directly, furnishing a complementary measure to the existing calculation of the mean value along the bundle. We demonstrate the favourable performance of our approach comparing our estimates with existing histologically-derived measurements performed in the corpus callosum and the posterior limb of the internal capsule. Overall, our method provides a more robust estimation of the axon diameter index of pathways by jointly estimating the microstructure properties of the tissue and the macroscopic organisation of the white matter connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: A Quick and Easy Way to Estimate Entropy and Mutual Information for Neuroscience</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.596443</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Calculations of entropy of a signal or mutual information between two variables are valuable analytical tools in the field of neuroscience. They can be applied to all types of data, capture non-linear interactions and are model independent. Yet the limited size and number of recordings one can collect in a series of experiments makes their calculation highly prone to sampling bias. Mathematical methods to overcome this so-called “sampling disaster” exist, but require significant expertise, great time and computational costs. As such, there is a need for a simple, unbiased and computationally efficient tool for estimating the level of entropy and mutual information. In this article, we propose that application of entropy-encoding compression algorithms widely used in text and image compression fulfill these requirements. By simply saving the signal in PNG picture format and measuring the size of the file on the hard drive, we can estimate entropy changes through different conditions. Furthermore, with some simple modifications of the PNG file, we can also estimate the evolution of mutual information between a stimulus and the observed responses through different conditions. We first demonstrate the applicability of this method using white-noise-like signals. Then, while this method can be used in all kind of experimental conditions, we provide examples of its application in patch-clamp recordings, detection of place cells and histological data. Although this method does not give an absolute value of entropy or mutual information, it is mathematically correct, and its simplicity and broad use make it a powerful tool for their estimation through experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Exclusion of the Possibility of “False Ripples” From Ripple Band High-Frequency Oscillations Recorded From Scalp Electroencephalogram in Children With Epilepsy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.696882</link>
	<content:encoded>Aim&lt;p&gt;Ripple-band epileptic high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) can be recorded by scalp electroencephalography (EEG), and tend to be associated with epileptic spikes. However, there is a concern that the filtration of steep waveforms such as spikes may cause spurious oscillations or “false ripples.” We excluded such possibility from at least some ripples by EEG differentiation, which, in theory, enhances high-frequency signals and does not generate spurious oscillations or ringing.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The subjects were 50 pediatric patients, and ten consecutive spikes during sleep were selected for each patient. Five hundred spike data segments were initially reviewed by two experienced electroencephalographers using consensus to identify the presence or absence of ripples in the ordinary filtered EEG and an associated spectral blob in time-frequency analysis (Session A). These EEG data were subjected to numerical differentiation (the second derivative was denoted as EEG″). The EEG″ trace of each spike data segment was shown to two other electroencephalographers who judged independently whether there were clear ripple oscillations or uncertain ripple oscillations or an absence of oscillations (Session B).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;In Session A, ripples were identified in 57 spike data segments (Group A-R), but not in the other 443 data segments (Group A-N). In Session B, both reviewers identified clear ripples (strict criterion) in 11 spike data segments, all of which were in Group A-R (p &amp;lt; 0.0001 by Fisher’s exact test). When the extended criterion that included clear and/or uncertain ripples was used in Session B, both reviewers identified 25 spike data segments that fulfilled the criterion: 24 of these were in Group A-R (p &amp;lt; 0.0001).&lt;/p&gt;Discussion&lt;p&gt;We have demonstrated that real ripples over scalp spikes exist in a certain proportion of patients. Ripples that were visualized consistently using both ordinary filters and the EEG″ method should be true, but failure to clarify ripples using the EEG″ method does not mean that true ripples are absent.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The numerical differentiation of EEG data provides convincing evidence that HFOs were detected in terms of the presence of such unusually fast oscillations over the scalp and the importance of this electrophysiological phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Gender Beneath the Skull: Agency, Trauma and Persisting Stereotypes in Neuroepigenetics</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.667896</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Epigenetics stands in a complex relationship to issues of sex and gender. As a scientific field, it has been heavily criticized for disproportionately targeting the maternal body and reproducing deterministic views of biological sex (Kenney and Müller, 2017; Lappé, 2018; Richardson et al., 2014). And yet, it also represents the culmination of a long tradition of engaging with developmental biology as a feminist cause, because of the dispersal of the supposed ‘master code’ of DNA among wider cellular, organismic and ecological contexts (Keller, 1988). In this paper, we explore a number of tensions at the intersection of sex, gender and trauma that are playing out in the emerging area of neuroepigenetics - a relatively new subfield of epigenetics specifically interested in environment-brain relations through epigenetic modifications in neurons. Using qualitative interviews with leading scientists, we explore how trauma is conceptualized in neuroepigenetics, paying attention to its gendered dimensions. We address a number of concerns raised by feminist STS researchers in regard to epigenetics, and illustrate why we believe close engagement with neuroepigenetic claims, and neuroepigenetic researchers themselves, is a crucial step for social scientists interested in questions of embodiment and trauma. We argue this for three reasons: (1) Neuroepigenetic studies are recognizing the agential capacities of biological materials such as genes, neurotransmitters and methyl groups, and how they influence memory formation; (2) Neuroepigenetic conceptions of trauma are yet to be robustly coupled with social and anthropological theories of violence (Eliot, 2021; Nelson, 2021; Walby, 2013); (3) In spite of the gendered assumptions we find in neuroepigenetics, there are fruitful spaces – through collaboration – to be conceptualizing gender beyond culture-biology and nature-nurture binaries (Lock and Nguyen, 2010). To borrow Gravlee’s (2009: 51) phrase, we find reason for social scientists to consider how gender is not only constructed, but how it may “become biology” via epigenetic and other biological pathways. Ultimately, we argue that a robust epigenetic methodology is one which values the integrity of expertise outside its own field, and can have an open, not empty mind to cross-disciplinary dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Design Considerations for Long Term Non-invasive Brain Computer Interface Training With Tetraplegic CYBATHLON Pilot</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.648275</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Several studies in the recent past have demonstrated how Brain Computer Interface (BCI) technology can uncover the neural mechanisms underlying various tasks and translate them into control commands. While a multitude of studies have demonstrated the theoretic potential of BCI, a point of concern is that the studies are still confined to lab settings and mostly limited to healthy, able-bodied subjects. The CYBATHLON 2020 BCI race represents an opportunity to further develop BCI design strategies for use in real-time applications with a tetraplegic end user. In this study, as part of the preparation to participate in CYBATHLON 2020 BCI race, we investigate the design aspects of BCI in relation to the choice of its components, in particular, the type of calibration paradigm and its relevance for long-term use. The end goal was to develop a user-friendly and engaging interface suited for long-term use, especially for a spinal-cord injured (SCI) patient. We compared the efficacy of conventional open-loop calibration paradigms with real-time closed-loop paradigms, using pre-trained BCI decoders. Various indicators of performance were analyzed for this study, including the resulting classification performance, game completion time, brain activation maps, and also subjective feedback from the pilot. Our results show that the closed-loop calibration paradigms with real-time feedback is more engaging for the pilot. They also show an indication of achieving better online median classification performance as compared to conventional calibration paradigms (p = 0.0008). We also observe that stronger and more localized brain activation patterns are elicited in the closed-loop paradigm in which the experiment interface closely resembled the end application. Thus, based on this longitudinal evaluation of single-subject data, we demonstrate that BCI-based calibration paradigms with active user-engagement, such as with real-time feedback, could help in achieving better user acceptability and performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hemispheric asymmetry in the power spectrum of low-frequency spontaneous hemodynamic fluctuations has been previously observed in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This observation may imply a specific narrow-frequency band in which individuals with ASD could show more significant alteration in resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC). To test this assumption, we evaluated narrowband RSFC at several frequencies for functional near-infrared spectroscopy signals recorded from the bilateral temporal lobes on 25 children with ASD and 22 typically developing (TD) children. In several narrow-frequency bands, we observed altered interhemispheric RSFC in ASD. However, in the band of 0.01–0.02 Hz, more mirrored channel pairs (or cortical sites) showed significantly weaker RSFC in the ASD group. Receiver operating characteristic analysis further demonstrated that RSFC in the narrowband of 0.01–0.02 Hz might have better differentiation ability between the ASD and TD groups. This may indicate that the narrowband RSFC could serve as a characteristic for the prediction of ASD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

In order to study the influence of I&lt;sub&gt;CaN&lt;/sub&gt; and stimulus current I&lt;sub&gt;exc&lt;/sub&gt; in PBC inspiratory neurons, a single compartment model was simplified, and firing patterns of the model was discussed by using stability theory, bifurcation analysis, fast, and slow decomposition technology combined with numerical simulation.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aminoglycosides, a class of clinically important drugs, are widely used worldwide against gram-negative bacterial infections. However, there is growing evidence that aminoglycosides can cause hearing loss or balance problems. In this article, we mainly introduce the main mechanism of ototoxicity induced by aminoglycosides. Genetic analysis showed that the susceptibility of aminoglycosides was attributable to mutations in mtDNA, especially A1555G and C1494T mutations in 12S rRNA. In addition, the overexpression of NMDA receptors and the formation of free radicals also play an important role. Understanding the mechanism of ototoxicity induced by aminoglycosides is helpful to develop new therapeutic methods to protect hearing. In this article, the prevention methods of ototoxicity induced by aminoglycosides were introduced from the upstream and downstream aspects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.689332</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Huntington disease (HD) is a monogenic disease that results in a combination of motor, psychiatric and cognitive symptoms. HD is caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene, which results in the production of a pathogenic mutant HTT protein (mHTT). Although there is no cure at present for HD, a number of RNA-targeting therapies have recently entered clinical trials which aim to lower mHTT production through the use of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and RNAi. However, many of these treatment strategies are non-selective in that they cannot differentiate between non-pathogenic wild type HTT (wtHTT) and the mHTT variant. As HD patients are already born with decreased levels of wtHTT, these genetic therapies may result in critically low levels of wtHTT. The consequence of wtHTT reduction in the adult brain is currently under debate, and here we argue that wtHTT loss is not well-tolerated at the synaptic level. Synaptic dysfunction is an extremely sensitive measure of subsequent cell death, and is known to precede neurodegeneration in numerous brain diseases including HD. The present review focuses on the prominent role of wtHTT at the synapse and considers the consequences of wtHTT loss on both pre- and postsynaptic function. We discuss how wtHTT is implicated in virtually all major facets of synaptic neurotransmission including anterograde and retrograde transport of proteins to/from terminal buttons and dendrites, neurotransmitter release, endocytic vesicle recycling, and postsynaptic receptor localization and recycling. We conclude that wtHTT presence is essential for proper synaptic function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.689268</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Astrocytic networks are critically involved in regulating the activity of neuronal networks. However, a comprehensive and ready-to-use data analysis tool for investigating functional interactions between the astrocytes is missing. We developed the novel software package named “Astral” to analyse intercellular communication in astrocytic networks based on live-cell calcium imaging. Our method for analysing calcium imaging data does not require the assignment of regions of interest. The package contains two applications: the core processing pipeline for detecting and quantifying Ca&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; events, and the auxiliary visualization tool for controlling data quality. Our method allows for the network-wide quantification of Ca&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; events and the analysis of their intercellular propagation. In a set of proof-of-concept experiments, we examined Ca&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; events in flat monolayers of primary astrocytes and confirmed that inter-astrocytic interactions depend on the permeability of gap junctions and connexin hemichannels. The Astral tool is particularly useful for studying astrocyte-neuronal interactions on the network level. We demonstrate that compared with purely astrocytic cultures, spontaneous generation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; events in astrocytes that were co-cultivated with neurons was significantly increased. Interestingly, the increased astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; activity after long-term co-cultivation with neurons was driven by the enhanced formation of gap junctions and connexin hemichannels but was not affected by silencing neuronal activity. Our data indicate the necessity for systematic investigation of astrocyte-neuronal interactions at the network level. For this purpose, the Astral software offers a powerful tool for processing and quantifying calcium imaging data.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.678113</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The two types of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), types I and II, innervate inner hair cells and outer hair cells, respectively, within the mammalian cochlea and send another process back to cochlear nuclei in the hindbrain. Studying these two neuronal types has been made easier with the identification of unique molecular markers. One of these markers, peripherin, was shown using antibodies to be present in all SGNs initially but becomes specific to type II SGNs during maturation. We used mice with fluorescently labeled peripherin (Prph-eGFP) to examine peripherin expression in SGNs during development and in aged mice. Using these mice, we confirm the initial expression of Prph-eGFP in both types I and II neurons and eventual restriction to only type II perikarya shortly after birth. However, while Prph-eGFP is uniquely expressed within type II cell bodies by P8, both types I and II peripheral and central processes continue to express Prph-eGFP for some time before becoming downregulated. Only at P30 was there selective type II Prph-eGFP expression in central but not peripheral processes. By 9 months, only the type II cell bodies and more distal central processes retain Prph-eGFP expression. Our results show that Prph-eGFP is a reliable marker for type II SGN cell bodies beyond P8; however, it is not generally a suitable marker for type II processes, except for central processes beyond P30. How the changes in Prph-eGFP expression relate to subsequent protein expression remains to be explored.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Microglial Implications in SARS-CoV-2 Infection and COVID-19: Lessons From Viral RNA Neurotropism and Possible Relevance to Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.670298</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Since December 2019, humankind has been experiencing a ravaging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak, the second coronavirus pandemic in a decade after the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) disease in 2012. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 results in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is responsible for over 3.1 million deaths worldwide. With the emergence of a second and a third wave of infection across the globe, and the rising record of multiple reinfections and relapses, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows no sign of abating. In addition, it is now evident that SARS-CoV-2 infection presents with neurological symptoms that include early hyposmia, ischemic stroke, meningitis, delirium and falls, even after viral clearance. This may suggest chronic or permanent changes to the neurons, glial cells, and/or brain vasculature in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19. Within the central nervous system (CNS), microglia act as the central housekeepers against altered homeostatic states, including during viral neurotropic infections. In this review, we highlight microglial responses to viral neuroinfections, especially those with a similar genetic composition and route of entry as SARS-CoV-2. As the primary sensor of viral infection in the CNS, we describe the pathogenic and neuroinvasive mechanisms of RNA viruses and SARS-CoV-2 vis-à-vis the microglial means of viral recognition. Responses of microglia which may culminate in viral clearance or immunopathology are also covered. Lastly, we further discuss the implication of SARS-CoV-2 CNS invasion on microglial plasticity and associated long-term neurodegeneration. As such, this review provides insight into some of the mechanisms by which microglia could contribute to the pathophysiology of post-COVID-19 neurological sequelae and disorders, including Parkinson’s disease, which could be pervasive in the coming years given the growing numbers of infected and re-infected individuals globally.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Various working memory (WM) trainings have been tested, but differences in experimental designs, the lack of theoretical background, and the need of identifying task-related processes such as filtering efficiency limit conclusions about their comparative efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: In this study, we compared the efficacy of a model-based WM training with (MB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and without (MB) distractor inhibition on improving WM capacity to a dual n-back and active control condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: This randomized clinical trial included 123 healthy elderly adults (78 women, 45 men; aged 64.1 ± 8.3 years). All groups underwent 12 40-min training sessions over 3 weeks and four cognitive testing sessions. The first two sessions served as double baseline to account for practice effects. Primary outcome was WM capacity post-training measured by complex span tasks. Near and far transfer was assessed by simple span, n-back, visuospatial and verbal learning, processing speed, and reasoning tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Due to preliminary termination (COVID-19), 93 subjects completed the post-training and 60 subjects the follow-up session. On a whole group level, practice effects occurred from prebaseline to baseline in WM capacity (b = 4.85, t&lt;sub&gt;(103)&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.01, p &amp;lt; 0.001, r = 0.37). Linear mixed-effects models revealed a difference in WM capacity post-training between MB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and MB (b = −9.62, t&lt;sub&gt;(82)&lt;/sub&gt; = −2.52, p = 0.014, r = 0.27) and a trend difference between MB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and dual n-back (b = −7.59, t&lt;sub&gt;(82)&lt;/sub&gt; = −1.87, p = 0.065, r = 0.20) and control training (b = −7.08, t&lt;sub&gt;(82)&lt;/sub&gt; = −1.86, p = 0.067, r = 0.20). Univariate analyses showed an increase between pre- and post-training for WM capacity within MB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (t&lt;sub&gt;(22)&lt;/sub&gt; = −3.34, p &amp;lt; 0.05) only. There was no difference between groups pre- and post-training regarding near and far transfer. Univariate analyses showed improved visuospatial learning within MB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (t&lt;sub&gt;(21)&lt;/sub&gt; = −3.8, p &amp;lt; 0.05), improved processing speed (t&lt;sub&gt;(23)&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.19, p&amp;lt; 0.05) and n-back performance (t&lt;sub&gt;(23)&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.12, p &amp;lt; 0.05) in MB, and improved n-back performance (t&lt;sub&gt;(25)&lt;/sub&gt; = 3.83, p &amp;lt; 0.001) in the dual n-back training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: A model-based WM training including filtering efficacy may be a promising approach to increase WM capacity and needs further investigation in randomized controlled studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Age-Related Alterations in DTI Metrics in the Human Brain—Consequences for Age Correction</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.682109</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Over the life span, the diffusion metrics in brain MRI show different, partly nonlinear changes. These age-dependent changes also seem to exhibit regional differences with respect to the brain anatomy. The age correction of a study cohort's diffusion metrics might thus require consideration of age-related factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Diffusion tensor imaging data sets were acquired from 219 healthy participants at ages between 19 and 81 years. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and axial and radial diffusivity (AD and RD, respectively) maps were analyzed by a tract of interest-based fiber tracking approach. To describe diffusion metrics as a function of the participant age, linear splines were used to perform curve fitting in 21 specific tract systems covering different functional areas and diffusion directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In the majority of tracts, an interpolation with a change of alteration rate during adult life described the diffusion properties more accurately than a linear model. Consequently, the diffusion properties remained relatively stable until a decrease (of FA) or increase (of MD, AD, and RD) started at a region-specific time point, whereas a uniform change of diffusion properties was observed only in a few tracts. Single tracts, e.g., located in the cerebellum, remained nearly unaltered throughout the ages between 19 and 81 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Age corrections of diffusion properties should not be applied to all white matter regions and all age spans in the same way. Therefore, we propose three different approaches for age correction based on fiber tracking techniques, i.e., no correction for areas that do not experience age-related changes and two variants of an age correction depending on the age range of the cohort and the tracts considered.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Alix: A Candidate Serum Biomarker of Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.669612</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common fatal neurodegenerative disease of the elderly worldwide. The identification of AD biomarkers will allow for earlier diagnosis and thus earlier intervention. The aim of this study was to find such biomarkers. It was observed that the expression of Alix was significantly decreased in brain tissues and serum samples from AD patients compared to the controls. A significant correlation between Alix levels and cognitive decline was observed (r = 0.80; p &amp;lt; 0.001) as well as a significant negative correlation between Alix and Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; in serum levels (r =−0.60, p &amp;lt; 0.001). The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis showed the area under the curve (AUC) of Alix was 0.80, and the optimal cut-off point of 199.5 pg/ml was selected with the highest sum of sensitivity and specificity. The diagnostic accuracy for serum Alix was 74%, with 76% sensitivity and 71% specificity respectively, which could differentiate AD from controls. In addition, the expression of Alix was found to be significantly decreased in AD compared to vascular dementia (VaD). ROC analysis between AD and VaD showed that the AUC was 0.777, which could be indicative of the role of serum Alix as a biomarker in the differential diagnosis between AD and VaD. Most surprisingly, the decreased expression of Alix was attenuated after the treatment of Memantine in different AD animal models. In conclusion, our results indicate the possibility of serum Alix as a novel and non-invasive biomarker for AD for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Role of Neuron and Glia in Alzheimer’s Disease and Associated Vascular Dysfunction</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.653334</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Amyloidogenicity and vascular dysfunction are the key players in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), involving dysregulated cellular interactions. An intricate balance between neurons, astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes and vascular cells sustains the normal neuronal circuits. Conversely, cerebrovascular diseases overlap neuropathologically with AD, and glial dyshomeostasis promotes AD-associated neurodegenerative cascade. While pathological hallmarks of AD primarily include amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, microvascular disorders, altered cerebral blood flow (CBF), and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability induce neuronal loss and synaptic atrophy. Accordingly, microglia-mediated inflammation and astrogliosis disrupt the homeostasis of the neuro-vascular unit and stimulate infiltration of circulating leukocytes into the brain. Large-scale genetic and epidemiological studies demonstrate a critical role of cellular crosstalk for altered immune response, metabolism, and vasculature in AD. The glia associated genetic risk factors include APOE, TREM2, CD33, PGRN, CR1, and NLRP3, which correlate with the deposition and altered phagocytosis of Aβ. Moreover, aging-dependent downregulation of astrocyte and microglial Aβ-degrading enzymes limits the neurotrophic and neurogenic role of glial cells and inhibits lysosomal degradation and clearance of Aβ. Microglial cells secrete IGF-1, and neurons show a reduced responsiveness to the neurotrophic IGF-1R/IRS-2/PI3K signaling pathway, generating amyloidogenic and vascular dyshomeostasis in AD. Glial signals connect to neural stem cells, and a shift in glial phenotype over the AD trajectory even affects adult neurogenesis and the neurovascular niche. Overall, the current review informs about the interaction of neuronal and glial cell types in AD pathogenesis and its critical association with cerebrovascular dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/67714</link>
	<content:encoded>Human reproduction is controlled by ~2,000 hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons. Here we report the discovery and characterization of additional ~150,000-200,000 GnRH-synthesizing cells in the human basal ganglia and basal forebrain. Nearly all extrahypothalamic GnRH neurons expressed the cholinergic marker enzyme choline acetyltransferase. Similarly, hypothalamic GnRH neurons were also cholinergic both in embryonic and adult human brains. Whole-transcriptome analysis of cholinergic interneurons and medium spiny projection neurons laser-microdissected from the human putamen showed selective expression of &lt;i&gt;GNRH1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;GNRHR1&lt;/i&gt; autoreceptors in the cholinergic cell population and uncovered the detailed transcriptome profile and molecular connectome of these two cell types. Higher-order non-reproductive functions regulated by GnRH under physiological conditions in the human basal ganglia and basal forebrain require clarification. The role and changes of GnRH/GnRHR1 signaling in neurodegenerative disorders affecting cholinergic neurocircuitries, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, need to be explored.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Biosynthesis of a sulfated exopolysaccharide, synechan, and bloom formation in the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66538</link>
	<content:encoded>Extracellularpolysaccharides of bacteria contribute to biofilm formation, stress tolerance, and infectivity. Cyanobacteria, the oxygenic photoautotrophic bacteria, uniquely produce sulfated extracellular polysaccharides among bacteria to support phototrophic biofilms. In addition, sulfated polysaccharides of cyanobacteria and other organisms have been focused as beneficial biomaterial. However, very little is known about their biosynthesis machinery and function in cyanobacteria. Here, we found that the model cyanobacterium, &lt;i&gt;Synechocystis&lt;/i&gt; sp. strain PCC 6803, formed bloom-like cell aggregates embedded in sulfated extracellular polysaccharides (designated as synechan) and identified whole set of genes responsible for synechan biosynthesis and its transcriptional regulation, thereby suggesting a model for the synechan biosynthesis apparatus. Because similar genes are found in many cyanobacterial genomes with wide variation, our findings may lead elucidation of various sulfated polysaccharides, their functions, and their potential application in biotechnology.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66398</link>
	<content:encoded>We previously reported xanthohumol (XN), and its synthetic derivative tetrahydro-XN (TXN), attenuates high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and metabolic syndrome in C57Bl/6J mice. The objective of the current study was to determine the effect of XN and TXN on lipid accumulation in the liver. Non-supplemented mice were unable to adapt their caloric intake to 60% HFD, resulting in obesity and hepatic steatosis; however, TXN reduced weight gain and decreased hepatic steatosis. Liver transcriptomics indicated that TXN might antagonize lipogenic PPARγ actions in vivo. XN and TXN inhibited rosiglitazone-induced 3T3-L1 cell differentiation concomitant with decreased expression of lipogenesis-related genes. A peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) competitive binding assay showed that XN and TXN bind to PPARγ with an IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; similar to pioglitazone and 8–10 times stronger than oleate. Molecular docking simulations demonstrated that XN and TXN bind in the PPARγ ligand-binding domain pocket. Our findings are consistent with XN and TXN acting as antagonists of PPARγ.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Cardiometabolic diseases are an increasing global health burden. While socioeconomic, environmental, behavioural, and genetic risk factors have been identified, a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms is required to develop more effective interventions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to assess organ health, but biobank-scale studies are still in their infancy. Using over 38,000 abdominal MRI scans in the UK Biobank, we used deep learning to quantify volume, fat, and iron in seven organs and tissues, and demonstrate that imaging-derived phenotypes reflect health status. We show that these traits have a substantial heritable component (8–44%) and identify 93 independent genome-wide significant associations, including four associations with liver traits that have not previously been reported. Our work demonstrates the tractability of deep learning to systematically quantify health parameters from high-throughput MRI across a range of organs and tissues, and use the largest-ever study of its kind to generate new insights into the genetic architecture of these traits.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Humans refer to their mood state regularly in day-to-day as well as clinical interactions. Theoretical accounts suggest that when reporting on our mood we integrate over the history of our experiences; yet, the temporal structure of this integration remains unexamined. Here we use a computational approach to quantitatively answer this question and show that early events exert a stronger influence on reported mood compared to recent events. We show that a Primacy model accounts better for mood reports compared to a range of alternative temporal representations across random, consistent or dynamic reward environments, different age groups and in both healthy and depressed participants. Moreover, we find evidence for neural encoding of the Primacy, but not the Recency, model in frontal brain regions related to mood regulation. These findings hold implications for the timing of events in experimental or clinical settings and suggest new directions for individualized mood interventions.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Establishment of H3K9me3-dependent heterochromatin during embryogenesis in Drosophila miranda</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55612</link>
	<content:encoded>Heterochromatin is a key architectural feature of eukaryotic genomes crucial for silencing of repetitive elements. During Drosophila embryonic cellularization, heterochromatin rapidly appears over repetitive sequences but the molecular details of how heterochromatin is established are poorly understood. Here, we map the genome-wide distribution of H3K9me3-dependent heterochromatin in individual embryos of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila miranda&lt;/i&gt; at precisely-staged developmental time points. We find that canonical H3K9me3 enrichment is established prior to cellularization, and matures into stable and broad heterochromatin domains through development. Intriguingly, initial nucleation sites of H3K9me3 enrichment appear as early as embryonic stage3 over transposable elements (TE) and progressively broaden, consistent with spreading to neighboring nucleosomes. The earliest nucleation sites are limited to specific regions of a small number of recently active retrotransposon families and often appear over promoter and 5' regions of LTR retrotransposons, while late nucleation develops broadly across the entirety of most TEs. Interestingly, early nucleating TEs are strongly associated with abundant maternal piRNAs and show early zygotic transcription. These results support a model of piRNA-associated co-transcriptional silencing while also suggesting additional mechanisms for site-restricted H3K9me3 nucleation at TEs in pre-cellular &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; embryos.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Regulation of auditory fear discrimination by the novel Kv3 voltage-gated potassium channel modulator AUT00206</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.15.448180v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Psychiatric diseases like anxiety-related disorders and schizophrenia are characterized by impaired cognition and emotional regulation linked to corticolimbic disinhibition. Restoring the balance between excitation and inhibition in corticolimbic circuits may therefore ameliorate certain features of these disorders, such as inappropriately attributing affective salience to innocuous cues. Corticolimbic activity is tightly controlled by parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic interneurons, which also regulate fear discrimination. The voltage-gated potassium channels Kv3.1 and Kv3.2 are highly expressed in these neurons, therefore Kv3.1/3.2 modulation may have potential for treating disorders associated with cognitive and emotional dysregulation. We determined the effects of the novel Kv3.1/3.2 positive modulator AUT00206 on fear discrimination. Female rats underwent limited or extended auditory fear discrimination training that we previously showed leads to discrimination or generalization, respectively, based on passive fear responding (i.e. freezing). We also assessed darting as an active fear response. We found that limited training resulted in discrimination based on freezing, which was unaffected by AUT00206. In contrast, we found that extended training resulted in generalization based on freezing and the emergence of discrimination based on darting. Importantly, AUT00206 had dissociable effects on fear discrimination and expression with extended training. While AUT00206 mitigated generalization without affecting expression based on freezing, it reduced expression without affecting discrimination based on darting. Our results indicate that Kv3.1/3.2 modulation regulates the attribution of affective significance to threat- and safety-related cues in a response-specific manner. This suggests that targeting Kv3.1 and Kv3.2 channels may provide a promising avenue for treating cognitive and emotional dysregulation in psychiatric disease.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Whether activity in the autonomic nervous system differs during distinct emotions remains controversial. We obtained continuous multichannel recordings of autonomic nervous system activity in healthy adults during a video-based emotional reactivity task. Dimensionality reduction revealed five principal components in the autonomic time series data, and these modes of covariation differentiated periods of baseline from those of video-viewing. Unsupervised clustering of the principal component time series data uncovered separable autonomic states that distinguished among the five emotion-inducing trials. These autonomic states were also detected in baseline physiology but were intermittent and of smaller magnitude. Our results suggest the autonomic nervous system assembles dynamic activity patterns during emotions that are similar across people and are present even during undirected moments of rest.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.14.448440v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are pervasive neurodevelopmental conditions detected during childhood when delayed language onset and social deficits are observed. Children diagnosed with ASD frequently display sensorimotor deficits associated with the cerebellum, suggesting a dysfunction of synaptic circuits. Astroglia are part of the tripartite synapses and postmortem studies reported an increased expression of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the cerebellum of ASD patients. Astroglia respond to neuronal activity with calcium transients that propagate to neighboring cells, resulting in a functional network response known as a calcium wave. This form of intercellular signaling is implicated in proliferation, migration, and differentiation of neural precursors. Prenatal exposure to valproate (VPA) is a preclinical model of ASD in which premature migration and excess of apoptosis occur in the internal granular layer (IGL) of the cerebellum during the early postnatal period. In this study we tested calcium wave propagation in the IGL of mice prenatally exposed to VPA. Sensorimotor and social deficits were observed and IGL depolarization evoked a calcium wave with astrocyte recruitment. The calcium wave propagation, initial cell recruitment, and mean amplitude of the calcium transients increased significantly in VPA-exposed mice compared to the control group. Astrocyte recruitment was significantly increased in the VPA model, but the mean amplitude of the calcium transients was unchanged. Western blot and histological studies revealed an increased expression of GFAP and higher astroglial density. We conclude that the functional network of the IGL is remarkably augmented in the preclinical model of autism.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Oscillations and variability in neuronal systems: interplay of autonomous transient dynamics and fast deterministic fluctuations</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.14.448371v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Neuronal systems are subject to rapidly fluctuations both intrinsically and externally. In mathematical models, these fluctuations are typically incorporated as stochastic noise (e.g., Gaussian white or colored noise). Noise can be both disruptive and constructive, for example, by creating irregularities and variability in otherwise regular patterns or by creating oscillatory patterns and increasing the signal coherence, respectively. The dynamic mechanisms underlying the interactions between rapidly fluctuating signals and the intrinsic properties of the target cells to produce variable and/or coherent responses are not fully understood. In particular, it is not clear what properties of the target cell's intrinsic dynamics control these interactions and whether the generation of this phenomena requires stochasticity of the input signal and, if yes, to what degree. In this paper we investigate these issues by using linearized and non-linear conductance-based models and piecewise constant (PWC) inputs with short duration pieces and variable amplitudes, which are arbitrarily, but not necessarily stochastically distributed. The amplitude distributions of the constant pieces consist of arbitrary permutations of a baseline PWC function with monotonically increasing amplitudes. In each trial within a given protocol we use one of these permutations and each protocol consists of a subset of all possible permutations, which is the only source of uncertainty in the protocol. We show that sustained oscillatory behavior can be generated in response to additive and multiplicative PWC inputs in both linear and nonlinear systems, independently of whether the stable equilibria of the corresponding unperturbed systems are foci (exhibiting damped oscillations) or nodes (exhibiting overshoots). The oscillatory responses are amplified by the model nonlinearities and attenuated for conductance-based PWC inputs as compared to current-based PWC inputs, consistent with previous theoretical and experimental work. In addition, the responses to PWC inputs exhibited variability across trials, which is reminiscent of the variability generated by stochastic noise (e.g., Gaussian white noise). This variability was modulated by the model parameters and the type of cellular intrinsic dynamics. Our analysis demonstrates that both oscillations and variability are the result of the interaction between the PWC input and the autonomous transient dynamics with little to no contribution from the dynamics around the steady-state. The generation of oscillations and variability does not require input stochasticity, but rather the sequential activation of the transient responses to abrupt changes in constant inputs. Each piece with the same amplitude evokes different responses across trials due to the differences in initial conditions in the corresponding regime. These initial conditions are determined by the value of the voltage at the end of the previous regime, which is different for different trials.The predictions made in this papers are amenable for experimental testing both in vitro and in vivo.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The voltage and spiking responses of subthreshold resonant neurons to structured and fluctuating inputs: resonance, loss of resonance and variability</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.14.448368v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The communication of oscillatory activity between neurons in a network result from the interplay of the subthreshold oscillatory properties of the participating neurons, when they exist, the properties of the synaptic connectivity and modulatory effects (e.g., oscillatory, deterministic and stochastic fluctuations) capturing identified external activity and unidentified background activity. A necessary step to address the underlying mechanisms is to understand how the response of neurons to period inputs, and external inputs in general, depends on the interplay of the neuronal intrinsic properties and the properties of the input. We address this issues in a systematic manner in the context of the response of neurons to oscillatory and synaptic-like inputs, and we extend our investigation to fluctuating spiking inputs with more realistic distributions of spike times. We use relatively simple neuronal models subject to additive current-based inputs and multiplicative conductance-based synaptic inputs, and we use two types of chirp-like inputs, one consisting of a sequence of cycles with discretely increasing frequencies over time, and the other consisting of the same cycles arranged in an arbitrary order. We develop a number of voltage response metrics to capture the different aspects of the voltage response, including the standard impedance profiles (curves of the impedance amplitude as a function of the input frequency) and the peak-to-trough amplitude envelope (VENV) profiles. We show that Z-resonant cells (cells that exhibit subthreshold resonance in response to sinusoidal inputs) also show VENV-resonance in response to sinusoidal inputs, but generally do not (or very mildly) in response to square-wave and synaptic-like inputs. We also show that responses to conductance-based synaptic-like inputs are attenuated as compared to the response to current-based synaptic-like inputs. These response patterns were strongly dependent on the intrinsic properties of the participating neurons, in particular whether the unperturbed Z-resonant cells had a stable node or a focus. In addition, we show that variability emerges in response to chirp-like inputs with arbitrarily ordered patterns where all signals (trials) in a given protocol have the same frequency content and the only source of uncertainty is the subset of all possible permutations of cycles chosen for a given protocol. This variability is the result of the multiple different ways in which the autonomous transient dynamics is activated across cycles in each signal (different cycle orderings) and across trials. We extend our results to include high-rate Poisson distributed current- and conductance-based synaptic inputs and compare them with similar results using additive Gaussian white noise. We show that the responses to both Poisson-distributed synaptic inputs are attenuated with respect to the responses to Gaussian white noise. For cells that exhibit oscillatory responses to Gaussian white noise (band-pass filters), the response to conductance-based synaptic inputs are low-pass filters, while the response to current-based synaptic inputs may remain band-pass filters, consistent with experimental findings. Our results shed ling on the mechanisms of communication of oscillatory activity among neurons in a network in a network via subthreshold oscillations and resonance and the generation of network resonance.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.14.448367v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Body perception has been extensively investigated, with one particular focus being the integration of vision and touch within a neuronal body representation. Previous studies have implicated a distributed network comprising the extrastriate body area (EBA), posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and ventral premotor cortex (PMv) during illusory self-attribution of a rubber hand. Here, we set up a fMRI paradigm in virtual reality (VR) to study whether and how threatening (artificial) body parts affects their self-attribution. Participants (N=30) saw a spider (aversive stimulus) or a toy-car (neutral stimulus) moving along a 3D-rendered virtual forearm positioned like their real forearm, while tactile stimulation was applied on the real arm in the same (congruent) or opposite (incongruent) direction. We found that the PPC was more activated during congruent stimulation; higher visual areas and the anterior insula (aIns) showed increased activation during aversive stimulus presentation; and the amygdala and pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) were more strongly activated for aversive stimuli when there was stronger multisensory integration of body-related information (interaction of aversiveness and congruency). Together, these findings suggest an enhanced processing of aversive stimuli within the amygdala when they represent a threat to body integrity.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Most are familiar with the notion of socially &quot;clicking&quot; with someone, namely sensing an immediate bond that can lead to strong and often long-lasting friendships. The mechanisms underlying such rapid bonding remain unclear. Given that body-odor similarity is a critical cue for social interaction in non-human mammals, we tested the hypothesis that body-odor similarly contributes to bonding in same-sex non-romantic human dyads. We observed that objective ratings obtained with an electronic nose, and subjective ratings obtained from human smellers, converged to suggest that click-friends smell more similar to each other than random dyads. Remarkably, we then found that we could use the electronic nose to predict which strangers would later form better dyadic interactions. Thus, humans may literally sniff-out new friends based on similarities in body-odor.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.14.448300v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Many cross-sectional findings suggest that volumes of specific hippocampal subfields increase in middle childhood and early adolescence. In contrast, a small number of available longitudinal studies observed decreased volumes in most subfields over this age range. Further, it remains unknown whether structural changes in development are associated with corresponding gains in children's memory. Here we report cross-sectional age differences in children's hippocampal subfield volumes together with longitudinal developmental trajectories and their relationships with memory performance. In two waves, 109 healthy participants aged 6 to 10 years (wave 1: M=7.25 years, wave 2: M=9.27 years) underwent high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging to assess hippocampal subfield volumes, and completed cognitive tasks assessing hippocampus dependent memory processes. We found that cross-sectional age-associations and longitudinal developmental trends in hippocampal subfield volumes were highly discrepant, both by subfields and in direction. Further, volumetric changes were largely unrelated to changes in memory, with the exception that increase in subiculum volume was associated with gains in spatial memory. Importantly, the observed longitudinal patterns of brain-cognition coupling could not be inferred from cross-sectional findings. We discuss potential sources of these discrepancies. This study underscores that children's structural brain development and its relationship to cognition cannot be inferred from cross-sectional age comparisons.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>SARM1 is an inducible NAD+ hydrolase that triggers axon loss and neuronal cell death in the injured and diseased nervous system. While SARM1 activation and enzyme function are well defined, the cellular events downstream of SARM1 activity but prior to axonal demise are much less well understood. Defects in calcium, mitochondria, ATP, and membrane homeostasis occur in injured axons, but the relationships among these events have been difficult to disentangle because prior studies analyzed large collections of axons in which cellular events occur asynchronously. Here we used live imaging with single axon resolution to investigate the cellular events downstream of SARM1 activity. Our studies support a model in which SARM1 NADase activity leads to an ordered sequence of events from loss of cellular ATP, to defects in mitochondrial movement and depolarization, followed by calcium influx, externalization of phosphatidylserine, and loss of membrane permeability prior to catastrophic axonal self destruction.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The role of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACCd) in decision making has often been discussed but remains somewhat unclear. On the one hand, numerous studies implicated this area in decisions driven by effort or action cost. On the other hand, work on economic choices between goods (under fixed action costs) found that neurons in ACCd encoded only post-decision variables. To advance our understanding of the role played by this area in decision making, we trained monkeys to choose between different goods (juice types) offered in variable amounts and with different action costs. Importantly, the task design dissociated computation of the action cost from planning of any particular action. Neurons in ACCd encoded the chosen value and the binary choice outcome in several reference frames (chosen juice, chosen cost, chosen action). Thus, this area provided a rich representation of post-decision variables. In contrast, neurons in ACCd did not represent pre-decision variables such as individual offer values in any reference frame. Hence, ongoing decisions are unlikely guided by ACCd. Conversely, neuronal activity in this area might inform subsequent choices.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.14.448277v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Defects in interneuron migration during forebrain development can disrupt the assembly of cortical circuits and have been associated with neuropsychiatric disease. The molecular and cellular bases of such deficits have been particularly difficult to study in humans due to limited access to functional forebrain tissue from patients. We previously developed a human forebrain assembloid model of Timothy Syndrome (TS), caused by a gain-of-function mutation in CACNA1C which encodes the L-type calcium channel (LTCC) Cav1.2. By functionally integrating human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived organoids resembling the dorsal and ventral forebrain from patients and control individuals, we uncovered that migration is disrupted in TS cortical interneurons. Here, we dissect the molecular underpinnings of this phenotype and report that acute pharmacological modulation of Cav1.2 can rescue the saltation length but not the saltation frequency of TS migrating interneurons. Furthermore, we find that the defect in saltation length in TS interneurons is associated with aberrant actomyosin function and is rescued by pharmacological modulation of MLC phosphorylation, whereas the saltation frequency phenotype in TS interneurons is driven by enhanced GABA sensitivity and can be restored by GABA receptor antagonism. Overall, these findings uncover multi-faceted roles of LTCC function in human cortical interneuron migration in the context of disease and suggest new strategies to restore interneuron migration deficits.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.14.448275v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Affective biases can influence how past events are recalled from memory. However, the mechanisms underlying how discrete affective events shape memory formation and subsequent recall are not well understood. Further understanding this is important given the central role of negative biases in affective memory recall in depression and antidepressant drug action. In order to capture cognitive processes associated with affective memory formation and recall, we studied value-based decision-making between affective memories in two within-subject experiments (n=45 and n=74). Our findings suggest that discrete affective events, created by large magnitude Wheel of Fortune (WoF) outcomes, influence affective memory formation processes during reinforcement-learning (RL). After 24 hours, we show that healthy volunteers display stable preferences during value-based recall of affective memories in a binary decision-making task. Computational modelling of these preferences demonstrated a positive bias during value-based recall, induced by previously winning in the WoF. We further showed that value-based decision-making between affective memories engages the pupil-linked central arousal systems, leading to pupil constriction prior to, and differential pupil dilation after the decision onset depending on the valence of the chosen options. Taken together, we demonstrate that mechanisms underlying human affective memory systems can be described by RL and probability weighting models. This approach could be used as a translational assay to study the effects of novel antidepressants.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.14.448271v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>For the past century, the anatomy of a neuron has been considered one of its defining features: The shape of a neuron`s dendrites and axon fundamentally determines what other neurons it can connect to. These neurites have been described using mathematical tools e.g. in the context of cell type classification, but generative models of these structures have only rarely been proposed and are often computationally inefficient. Here we propose MORPHVAE, a sequence-to-sequence variational autoencoder with spherical latent space as a generative model for neural morphologies. The model operates on walks within the tree structure of a neuron and can incorporate expert annotations on a subset of the data using semi-supervised learning. We develop our model on artificially generated toy data and evaluate its performance on dendrites of excitatory cells and axons of inhibitory cells of mouse motor cortex (M1) and dendrites of retinal ganglion cells. We show that the learned latent feature space allows for better cell type discrimination than other commonly used features. By sampling new walks from the latent space we can easily construct new morphologies with a specified degree of similarity to their reference neuron, providing an efficient generative model for neural morphologies.</content:encoded>

Synaptic molecular integrity in humans and NHP was similar. Although not detected in human synapses, A{beta} was in PS/APP mice synaptic events. Clustering and pattern identification of human synapses showed expected disease-specific differences, like increased hippocampal pathologic tau in AD and reduced caudate dopamine transporter in LBD, and revealed novel findings including increased hippocampal CD47 and lowered DJ1 in AD and higher ApoE in AD dementia.

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Transcriptomic analysis of dorsal and ventral subiculum after induction of acute seizures by electric stimulation of the perforant pathway in rats</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.14.447935v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Preconditioning is a mechanism in which injuries induced by non-lethal hypoxia or seizures trigger cellular resistance to subsequent events. Norwood et al., in a 2010 study, showed that an 8-hour-long period of electrical stimulation of the perforant pathway in rats is required for the induction of hippocampal sclerosis. However, in order to avoid generalized seizures, status epilepticus (SE), and death, a state of resistance to seizures must be induced in the hippocampus by a preconditioning paradigm consisting of 2 daily 30-minute stimulation periods. Due to the importance of the subiculum in the hippocampal formation, this study aims to investigate differential gene expression patterns in the dorsal and ventral subiculum using RNA-sequencing, after induction of a preconditioning protocol by electrical stimulation of the perforant pathway. The dorsal (dSub) and ventral (vSub) subiculum regions were collected by laser-microdissection 24 hours after preconditioning protocol induction in rats. RNA sequencing was performed in a Hiseq 4000 platform, reads were aligned using the STAR and DESEq2 statistics package was used to estimate gene expression. We identified 1176 differentially expressed genes comparing control to preconditioned subiculum regions, 204 genes were differentially expressed in dSub and 972 in vSub. The gene ontology enrichment analysis showed that the most significant common enrichment pathway considering up-regulated genes in dSub and vSub was Cholesterol Biosynthesis. In contrast, the most significant enrichment pathway considering down-regulated genes in vSub was Axon guidance. Our results indicate that preconditioning induces synaptic reorganization, increased cholesterol metabolism, and astrogliosis in both dSub and vSub. Both regions also presented a decrease in glutamatergic transmission, an increase in complement system activation, and increased in GABAergic transmission. The down-regulation of proapoptotic and axon guidance genes in the ventral subiculum suggests that preconditioning induces a neuroprotective environment in this region.</content:encoded>

Specific interaction between the start codon, 5’-AUG-3’, and the anticodon, 5’-CAU-3’, ensures accurate initiation of translation. Recent studies show that several near-cognate start codons (e.g. GUG and CUG) can play a role in initiating translation in eukaryotes. However, the mechanism allowing initiation through mismatched base-pairs at the ribosomal decoding site is still unclear at an atomic level. In this work, we propose an extended simulation-based method to evaluate free energy profiles, through computing the distance between each base-pair of the triplet interactions involved in recognition of start codons in eukaryotic translation pre-initiation complex. Our method provides not only the free energy penalty for mismatched start codons relative to the AUG start codon, but also the preferred pathways of transitions between bound and unbound states, which has not been described by previous studies. To verify the method, the binding dynamics of cognate (AUG) and near-cognate start codons (CUG and GUG) were simulated. Evaluated free energy profiles agree with experimentally observed changes in initiation frequencies from respective codons. This work proposes for the first time how a G:U mismatch at the first position of codon (GUG)-anticodon base-pairs destabilizes the accommodation in the initiating eukaryotic ribosome and how initiation at a CUG codon is nearly as strong as, or sometimes stronger than, that at a GUG codon. Our method is expected to be applied to study the affinity changes for various mismatched base-pairs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tPecjyTY_U4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;i&gt;Campylobacter jejuni&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;C. jejuni&lt;/i&gt;) causes gastroenteritis following the consumption of contaminated poultry meat, resulting in a large health and economic burden worldwide. Phage therapy is a promising technique for eradicating &lt;i&gt;C. jejuni&lt;/i&gt; from poultry flocks and chicken carcasses. However, &lt;i&gt;C. jejuni&lt;/i&gt; can resist infections by some phages through stochastic, phase-variable ON/OFF switching of the phage receptors mediated by simple sequence repeats (SSR). While selection strength and exposure time influence the evolution of SSR-mediated phase variation (PV), phages offer a more complex evolutionary environment as phage replication depends on having a permissive host organism. Here, we build and explore several continuous culture bacteria-phage computational models, each analysing different phase-variable scenarios calibrated to the experimental SSR rates of &lt;i&gt;C. jejuni&lt;/i&gt; loci and replication parameters for the F336 phage. We simulate the evolution of PV rates via the adaptive dynamics framework for varying levels of selective pressures that act on the phage-resistant state. Our results indicate that growth reducing counter-selection on a single PV locus results in the stable maintenance of the phage, while compensatory selection between bacterial states affects the evolutionary stable mutation rates (i.e. very high and very low mutation rates are evolutionarily disadvantageous), whereas, in the absence of either selective pressure the evolution of PV rates results in mutation rates below the basal values. Contrastingly, a biologically-relevant model with two phase-variable loci resulted in phage extinction and locking of the bacteria into a phage-resistant state suggesting that another counter-selective pressure is required, for instance the use of a distinct phage whose receptor is an F336-phage-resistant state. We conclude that a delicate balance between counter-selection and phage-attack can result in both the evolution of phase-variable phage receptors and persistence of PV-receptor-specific phage.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PTygv1_RlsE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Neonatal invasive disease caused by Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is responsible for much acute mortality and long-term morbidity. To guide development of better prevention strategies, including maternal vaccines that protect neonates against GBS, it is necessary to estimate the burden of this condition globally and in different regions. Here, we present a Bayesian model that estimates country-specific invasive GBS (iGBS) disease incidence in children aged 0 to 6 days. The model combines different types of epidemiological data, each of which has its own limitations: GBS colonization prevalence in pregnant women, risk of iGBS disease in children born to GBS-colonized mothers and direct estimates of iGBS disease incidence where available. In our analysis, we present country-specific maternal GBS colonization prevalence after adjustment for GBS detection assay used in epidemiological studies. We then integrate these results with other epidemiological data and estimate country-level incidence of iGBS disease including in countries with no studies that directly estimate incidence. We are able to simultaneously estimate two key epidemiological quantities: the country-specific incidence of early-onset iGBS disease, and the risk of iGBS disease in babies born to GBS-colonized women. Overall, we believe our method will contribute to a more comprehensive quantification of the global burden of this disease, inform cost-effectiveness assessments of potential maternal GBS vaccines and identify key areas where data are necessary.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jrzDICINQ5g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Understanding the relationships between biological processes is paramount to unravel pathophysiological mechanisms. These relationships can be modeled with Transfer Functions (TFs), with no need of &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; hypotheses as to the shape of the transfer function. Here we present Iliski, a software dedicated to TFs computation between two signals. It includes different pre-treatment routines and TF computation processes: deconvolution, deterministic and non-deterministic optimization algorithms that are adapted to disparate datasets. We apply Iliski to data on neurovascular coupling, an ensemble of cellular mechanisms that link neuronal activity to local changes of blood flow, highlighting the software benefits and caveats in the computation and evaluation of TFs. We also propose a workflow that will help users to choose the best computation according to the dataset. Iliski is available under the open-source license CC BY 4.0 on GitHub (https://github.com/alike-aydin/Iliski) and can be used on the most common operating systems, either within the MATLAB environment, or as a standalone application.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fSbhMDOSwQ8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Despite the clear importance of language in our life, our vital ability to quickly and effectively learn new words and meanings is neurobiologically poorly understood. Conventional knowledge maintains that language learning—especially in adulthood—is slow and laborious. Furthermore, its structural basis remains unclear. Even though behavioural manifestations of learning are evident near instantly, previous neuroimaging work across a range of semantic categories has largely studied neural changes associated with months or years of practice. Here, we address rapid neuroanatomical plasticity accompanying new lexicon acquisition, specifically focussing on the learning of action-related language, which has been linked to the brain’s motor systems. Our results show that it is possible to measure and to externally modulate (using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of motor cortex) cortical microanatomic reorganisation after mere minutes of new word learning. Learning-induced microstructural changes, as measured by diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) and machine learning-based analysis, were evident in prefrontal, temporal, and parietal neocortical sites, likely reflecting integrative lexico-semantic processing and formation of new memory circuits immediately during the learning tasks. These results suggest a structural basis for the rapid neocortical word encoding mechanism and reveal the causally interactive relationship of modal and associative brain regions in supporting learning and word acquisition.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/L4Qros8z-X0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: A Novel Multisystem Proteinopathy Caused by a Missense ANXA11 Variant</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26136?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Protein misfolding plays a central role not only in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but also in other conditions, such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD), inclusion body myopathy (hIBM) or Paget's disease of bone. The concept of multisystem proteinopathies (MSP) was created to account for those rare families that segregate at least 2 out of these 4 conditions in the same pedigree. The calcium‐dependent phospholipid‐binding protein annexin A11 was recently associated to ALS in European pedigrees. Herein, we describe in detail 3 Brazilian families presenting hIBM (isolated or in combination with ALS/FTD) caused by the novel p.D40Y change in the gene encoding annexin A11 (ANXA11).


Methods
We collected clinical, genetic, pathological and skeletal muscle imaging from 11 affected subjects. Neuroimaging was also obtained from 8 patients and 8 matched controls.


Results
Clinico‐radiological phenotype of this novel hIBM reveals a slowly progressive predominant limb‐girdle syndrome, but with frequent axial (ptosis/dropped head) and distal (medial gastrocnemius) involvement as well. Muscle pathology identified numerous rimmed vacuoles with positive annexin A11, TDP‐43 and p62 inclusions, but no inflammation. Central nervous system was also involved: two patients had FTD, but diffusion tensor imaging uncovered multiple areas of cerebral white matter damage in the whole group (including the corticospinal tracts and frontal subcortical regions).


Interpretation
These findings expand the phenotypic spectrum related to ANXA11. This gene should be considered the cause of a novel multisystem proteinopathy (MSP type 6), rather than just ALS. ANN NEUROL 2021</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Finding the best configuration of algorithms' hyperparameters for a given
optimization problem is an important task in evolutionary computation. We
compare in this work the results of four different hyperparameter tuning
approaches for a family of genetic algorithms on 25 diverse pseudo-Boolean
optimization problems. More precisely, we compare previously obtained results
from a grid search with those obtained from three automated configuration
techniques: iterated racing, mixed-integer parallel efficient global
optimization, and mixed-integer evolutionary strategies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using two different cost metrics, expected running time and the area under
the empirical cumulative distribution function curve, we find that in several
cases the best configurations with respect to expected running time are
obtained when using the area under the empirical cumulative distribution
function curve as the cost metric during the configuration process. Our results
suggest that even when interested in expected running time performance, it
might be preferable to use anytime performance measures for the configuration
task. We also observe that tuning for expected running time is much more
sensitive with respect to the budget that is allocated to the target
algorithms.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06232</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep Q Network (DQN) firstly kicked the door of deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) via combining deep learning (DL) with reinforcement learning (RL), which
has noticed that the distribution of the acquired data would change during the
training process. DQN found this property might cause instability for training,
so it proposed effective methods to handle the downside of the property.
Instead of focusing on the unfavourable aspects, we find it critical for RL to
ease the gap between the estimated data distribution and the ground truth data
distribution while supervised learning (SL) fails to do so. From this new
perspective, we extend the basic paradigm of RL called the Generalized Policy
Iteration (GPI) into a more generalized version, which is called the
Generalized Data Distribution Iteration (GDI). We see massive RL algorithms and
techniques can be unified into the GDI paradigm, which can be considered as one
of the special cases of GDI. We provide theoretical proof of why GDI is better
than GPI and how it works. Several practical algorithms based on GDI have been
proposed to verify the effectiveness and extensiveness of it. Empirical
experiments prove our state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on Arcade Learning
Environment (ALE), wherein our algorithm has achieved 9620.98% mean human
normalized score (HNS), 1146.39% median HNS and 22 human world record
breakthroughs (HWRB) using only 200 training frames. Our work aims to lead the
RL research to step into the journey of conquering the human world records and
seek real superhuman agents on both performance and efficiency.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06216</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Entity Recognition (ER) within a text is a fundamental exercise in Natural
Language Processing, enabling further depending tasks such as Knowledge
Extraction, Text Summarisation, or Keyphrase Extraction. An entity consists of
single words or of a consecutive sequence of terms, constituting the basic
building blocks for communication. Mainstream ER approaches are mainly limited
to flat structures, concentrating on the outermost entities while ignoring the
inner ones. This paper introduces a partly-layered network architecture that
deals with the complexity of overlapping and nested cases. The proposed
architecture consists of two parts: (1) a shared Sequence Layer and (2) a
stacked component with multiple Tagging Layers. The adoption of such an
architecture has the advantage of preventing overfit to a specific word-length,
thus maintaining performance for longer entities despite their lower frequency.
To verify the proposed architecture's effectiveness, we train and evaluate this
architecture to recognise two kinds of entities - Concepts (CR) and Named
Entities (NER). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art NER performances, while
it outperforms previous CR approaches. Considering these promising results, we
see the possibility to evolve the architecture for other cases such as the
extraction of events or the detection of argumentative components.

is reminiscent of a biological learning mechanism known as synaptogenesis, and
it is carried out by an electrochemical reaction that we name field-directed
polymerization. We employ it to dendritic connections and, by modulating the
growth parameters, control material properties such as the resistance and the
time constants relevant for plasticity. We believe these results will inspire
further research towards the complex integration of polymerized synapses for

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This document describes the Generalized Moving Peaks Benchmark (GMPB) that
generates continuous dynamic optimization problem instances. The landscapes
generated by GMPB are constructed by assembling several components with a
variety of controllable characteristics ranging from unimodal to highly
multimodal, symmetric to highly asymmetric, smooth to highly irregular, and
various degrees of variable interaction and ill-conditioning. In this document,
we explain how these characteristics can be generated by different parameter
settings of GMPB. The MATLAB source code of GMPB is also explained. This
document forms the basis for a range of competitions on Evolutionary Continuous
Dynamic Optimization in the upcoming well-known conferences.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06158</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This paper introduces PyGAD, an open-source easy-to-use Python library for
building the genetic algorithm. PyGAD supports a wide range of parameters to
give the user control over everything in its life cycle. This includes, but is
not limited to, population, gene value range, gene data type, parent selection,
crossover, and mutation. PyGAD is designed as a general-purpose optimization
library that allows the user to customize the fitness function. Its usage
consists of 3 main steps: build the fitness function, create an instance of the
pygad.GA class, and calling the pygad.GA.run() method. The library supports
training deep learning models created either with PyGAD itself or with
frameworks like Keras and PyTorch. Given its stable state, PyGAD is also in
active development to respond to the user's requested features and enhancement
received on GitHub https://github.com/ahmedfgad/GeneticAlgorithmPython. PyGAD
comes with documentation https://pygad.readthedocs.io for further details and
examples.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06086</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For the past six years, researchers in genetic programming and other program
synthesis disciplines have used the General Program Synthesis Benchmark Suite
to benchmark many aspects of automatic program synthesis systems. These
problems have been used to make notable progress toward the goal of general
program synthesis: automatically creating the types of software that human
programmers code. Many of the systems that have attempted the problems in the
original benchmark suite have used it to demonstrate performance improvements
granted through new techniques. Over time, the suite has gradually become
outdated, hindering the accurate measurement of further improvements. The field
needs a new set of more difficult benchmark problems to move beyond what was
previously possible.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we describe the 25 new general program synthesis benchmark
problems that make up PSB2, a new benchmark suite. These problems are curated
from a variety of sources, including programming katas and college courses. We
selected these problems to be more difficult than those in the original suite,
and give results using PushGP showing this increase in difficulty. These new
problems give plenty of room for improvement, pointing the way for the next six
or more years of general program synthesis research.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Problem-solving benefits of down-sampled lexicase selection. (arXiv:2106.06085v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06085</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In genetic programming, an evolutionary method for producing computer
programs that solve specified computational problems, parent selection is
ordinarily based on aggregate measures of performance across an entire training
set. Lexicase selection, by contrast, selects on the basis of performance on
random sequences of training cases; this has been shown to enhance
problem-solving power in many circumstances. Lexicase selection can also be
seen as better reflecting biological evolution, by modeling sequences of
challenges that organisms face over their lifetimes. Recent work has
demonstrated that the advantages of lexicase selection can be amplified by
down-sampling, meaning that only a random subsample of the training cases is
used each generation. This can be seen as modeling the fact that individual
organisms encounter only subsets of the possible environments, and that
environments change over time. Here we provide the most extensive benchmarking
of down-sampled lexicase selection to date, showing that its benefits hold up
to increased scrutiny. The reasons that down-sampling helps, however, are not
yet fully understood. Hypotheses include that down-sampling allows for more
generations to be processed with the same budget of program evaluations; that
the variation of training data across generations acts as a changing
environment, encouraging adaptation; or that it reduces overfitting, leading to
more general solutions. We systematically evaluate these hypotheses, finding
evidence against all three, and instead draw the conclusion that down-sampled
lexicase selection's main benefit stems from the fact that it allows the
evolutionary process to examine more individuals within the same computational
budget, even though each individual is examined less completely.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06061</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As the world seeks to become more sustainable, intelligent solutions are
needed to increase the penetration of renewable energy. In this paper, the
model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm Rainbow Deep Q-Networks is
used to control a battery in a small microgrid to perform energy arbitrage and
more efficiently utilise solar and wind energy sources. The grid operates with
its own demand and renewable generation based on a dataset collected at Keele
University, as well as using dynamic energy pricing from a real wholesale
energy market. Four scenarios are tested including using demand and price
forecasting produced with local weather data. The algorithm and its
subcomponents are evaluated against two continuous control benchmarks with
Rainbow able to outperform all other method. This research shows the importance
of using the distributional approach for reinforcement learning when working
with complex environments and reward functions, as well as how it can be used
to visualise and contextualise the agent's behaviour for real-world
applications.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Neuroadaptive electroencephalography: a proof-of-principle study in infants. (arXiv:2106.06029v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06029</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A core goal of functional neuroimaging is to study how the environment is
processed in the brain. The mainstream paradigm involves concurrently measuring
a broad spectrum of brain responses to a small set of environmental features
preselected with reference to previous studies or a theoretical framework. As a
complement, we invert this approach by allowing the investigator to record the
modulation of a preselected brain response by a broad spectrum of environmental
features. Our approach is optimal when theoretical frameworks or previous
empirical data are impoverished. By using a prespecified closed-loop design,
the approach addresses fundamental challenges of reproducibility and
generalisability in brain research. These conditions are particularly acute
when studying the developing brain, where our theories based on adult brain
function may fundamentally misrepresent the topography of infant cognition and
where there are substantial practical challenges to data acquisition. Our
methodology employs machine learning to map modulation of a neural feature
across a space of experimental stimuli. Our method collects, processes and
analyses EEG brain data in real-time; and uses a neuro-adaptive Bayesian
optimisation algorithm to adjust the stimulus presented depending on the prior
samples of a given participant. Unsampled stimuli can be interpolated by
fitting a Gaussian process regression along the dataset. We show that our
method can automatically identify the face of the infant's mother through
online recording of their Nc brain response to a face continuum. We can
retrieve model statistics of individualised responses for each participant,
opening the door for early identification of atypical development. This
approach has substantial potential in infancy research and beyond for improving
power and generalisability of mapping the individual cognitive topography of
brain function.

Using lipid vesicles in which progression to hemifusion is arrested, the authors show that the metastable intermediate is enhanced by divalent cations and is characterized by the absence of proteins and local membrane thickening. Simulations reveal that thickening is induced by dehydration of the membrane surface.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/Kc7lCJjdsXo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Quantitative Evaluation of Cerebellar Function in Multiple System Atrophy with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Objective evaluation of cerebellar dysfunction in neurodegenerative disorders is often difficult because of other overlapping symptoms. Cerebellar inhibition (CBI) tested by dual-coil transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is anticipated as a promising measure to estimate cerebellar function. Cerebellar TMS inhibits the primary motor cortex (M1), which can be measured as the decrease of motor evoked potential (MEP) elicited by a single-pulse TMS over the M1. This study was conducted to quantify cerebellar dysfunction using CBI in cerebellar type multiple system atrophy (MSA-C) patients. First, CBI was measured using MEP elicited from a hand muscle by stimulating the hand motor area of M1. The amount of CBI was defined as the degree of decrease in the MEP amplitude in the presence of cerebellar stimulation compared with the condition of M1 stimulation alone. Results of the MSA-C patients were compared with those of healthy volunteers. Correlation between amounts of CBI and a clinical scale of ataxia, the International Cooperative Ataxia Scale Rating (ICARS), was assessed. Healthy volunteers showed more inhibition than MSA-C patients. Moreover, ICARS showed that the CBI amount in the patients is correlated with the degree of ataxia significantly. Results suggest that CBI can be a good marker of disease progression in MSA-C patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The projection from dopaminergic neurons to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) interneurons in the prefrontal cortex is involved in the etiology of schizophrenia. The impact of interacting effects between dopamine signals and the expression of GABA on the clinical phenotypes of schizophrenia has not been studied. Since these interactions could be closely involved in prefrontal cortex functions, patients with specific alleles of these relevant molecules (which lead to lower or vulnerable genetic functions) may develop treatment-refractory symptoms. We conducted a genetic association study focusing on &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;COMT&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;GAD1&lt;/em&gt; genes for a treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) group (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;=171), a non-TRS group (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;=592), and healthy controls (HC: &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;=447), and we examined allelic combinations specific to TRS. The results revealed that the percentage of subjects with Met allele of rs4680 on the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;COMT&lt;/em&gt; gene and C/C homozygote of rs3470934 on the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;GAD1&lt;/em&gt; gene was significantly higher in the TRS group than the other two groups. There was no significant difference between the non-TRS group and HC groups. Considering the direction of functions of these single-nucleotide polymorphisms revealed by previous studies, we speculate that subjects with the Met/CC allelic combination could have a higher dopamine level and a lower expression of GABA in the prefrontal cortex. Our results suggest that an interaction between the dopaminergic signal and GABA signal intensities could differ between TRS patients and patients with other types of schizophrenia and healthy subjects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Vitamin D receptor (VDR) signaling has been reported to affect neurodevelopment, thus participating in the risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We have measured expression amounts of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;VDR&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CYP27B1&lt;/em&gt;, and two related long non-coding RNAs, namely &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SNHG6&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LINC00511&lt;/em&gt;, in the circulation of ASD patients compared with normal controls. Expression of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CYP27B1&lt;/em&gt; was remarkably higher in ASD cases compared with controls (posterior beta = 2.38, SE = 0.46, adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value &amp;lt; 0.0001, 95% credible interval (CrI) for beta = [1.49, 3.27]). Level of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SNHG6&lt;/em&gt; was lower in ASD cases compared with controls (posterior beta = − 0.791, SE = 0.24, adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.029, 95% CrI for beta = [− 1.27, − 0.33]). Expression levels of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;VDR&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LINC00511&lt;/em&gt; were similar between ASD cases and controls (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; values = 0.97 and 0.46, respectively). Expressions of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;VDR&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CYP27B1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SNHG6&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LINC00511&lt;/em&gt; were not correlated with age of children. However, significant correlations were perceived between expressions of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CYP27B1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LINC00511&lt;/em&gt; (r = 0.47, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001), &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;VDR&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CYP27B1&lt;/em&gt; (r = 0.42, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001), and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;VDR&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SNHG6&lt;/em&gt; (r = 0.32, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). Therefore, these results imply dysregulation of a number of VDR-related genes in ASD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder in which dopaminergic neurons located in the substantia nigra are gradually lost. Currently, combined treatment strategies are receiving increasing attention as potential therapeutic approaches for Parkinson's disease. This study aimed to evaluate the potential effects of exosomes released from SH-Sy5y cells and the liposomal form of L-dopa on Parkinson's rat models. Twenty-five male Wistar albino rats, in five groups, were included in this study. Parkinson's disease was induced through microinjection of 6-OHDA (2.5 mg/mL) into the right substantia nigra. The exosomes released from the SH-Sy5y cell line were isolated and administered (0.2 µg/5 µL) alone or in combination with the liposomal form of L-Dopa (80 mg/kg) to the defined model groups. Behavioral tests and molecular assays were conducted to evaluate the expression levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2). The rats in the groups receiving the combined liposomal form of L-Dopa and exosome treatment and the liposomal form of L-Dopa alone showed a significant improvement in their movement ability (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). At molecular levels, these two groups also exhibited significant increases in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Th&lt;/em&gt; (0.005 ± 0.001) and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Drd2&lt;/em&gt; (0.002 ± 0.0001) expression compared to controls (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). The observed alterations of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Th&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Drd2&lt;/em&gt; expression were not statistically significant in exosome- and L-Dopa-treated groups. The current study shows that exosome-derived neuronal cells and liposomal form of L-Dopa can protect different cells against pathological complications such as Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Place cells and grid cells are important neurons involved in spatial navigation in the mammalian brain. Grid cells are believed to play an important role in forming a cognitive map of the environment. Experimental observations in recent years showed that the grid pattern is not invariant but is influenced by the shape of the spatial environment. However, the cause of this deformation remains elusive. Here, we focused on the functional interactions between place cells and grid cells, utilizing the information of location relationships between the firing fields of place cells to optimize the previous grid cell feedforward generation model and expand its application to more complex environmental scenarios. Not only was the regular equilateral triangle periodic firing field structure of the grid cells reproduced, but the expected results were consistent with the experiment for the environment with various complex boundary shapes and environmental deformation. Even in the field of three-dimensional spatial grid patterns, forward-looking predictions have been made. This provides a possible model explanation for how the coupling of grid cells and place cells adapt to the diversity of the external environment to deepen our understanding of the neural basis for constructing cognitive maps.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (ATTRv-PN) is a rare disease characterized by rapid neuropathic progression. In pivotal studies of gene-silencing treatments, the modified Neuropathy Impairment Score + 7 tests (mNIS + 7) and Norfolk-Quality of Life (QOL)-Diabetic Neuropathy (DN) questionnaire assessed treatment impact on neuropathic progression. Establishing responder definition (RD) thresholds for these measures would enable evaluation of clinically meaningful treatment benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;mNIS + 7 and Norfolk-QOL-DN were administered at baseline and week 65 to 165 adults with ATTRv-PN receiving inotersen (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 106) or placebo (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 59) in the NEURO-TTR study. Anchor-based approaches for estimating RD thresholds were used for Norfolk QOL-DN, while distribution-based approaches were used for both measures. Responders were patients with a score change &amp;lt; RD, indicating improvement or stabilization (i.e., no clinically meaningful progression). Odds ratios (ORs) and Fisher’s exact tests compared proportions of responders by treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The mean RD estimates were 12.2 points and 8.8 points for mNIS + 7 and Norfolk QOL-DN, respectively. The proportions of patients whose change in score indicated improvement or stabilization were statistically significantly larger for inotersen than placebo for all estimated RD thresholds for mNIS + 7 (64–86% responders for inotersen vs. 27–46% for placebo, ORs = 3.8–7.2, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;s &amp;lt; 0.001) and Norfolk QOL-DN (66–81% vs. 35–56%, ORs = 2.4–3.6, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;s &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Discussion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Establishing RD thresholds for these instruments enables evaluation of clinically relevant and individual-level treatment benefit on neuropathic progression. Across RDs estimated using multiple methods, a higher proportion of patients receiving inotersen than placebo showed improved or stabilized neuropathic progression at week 65.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.697973</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Since neurons have long neurites including axons, it is crucial for the axons to transport many intracellular substances such as proteins and mitochondria in order to maintain their morphology and function. In addition, mRNAs have also been shown to be transported within axons. RNA-binding proteins form complexes with mRNAs, and regulate transport of the mRNAs to axons, as well as locally translate them into proteins. Local translation of mRNAs actively occurs during the development and damage of neurons, and plays an important role in axon elongation, regeneration, and synapse formation. In recent years, it has been reported that impaired axonal transport and local translation of mRNAs may be involved in the pathogenesis of some neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we discuss the significance of mRNA axonal transport and their local translation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia, spinal muscular atrophy, Alzheimer’s disease, and fragile X syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Wnt-Frizzled Signaling Regulates Activity-Mediated Synapse Formation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.683035</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The formation of synapses is a tightly regulated process that requires the coordinated assembly of the presynaptic and postsynaptic sides. Defects in synaptogenesis during development or in the adult can lead to neurodevelopmental disorders, neurological disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. In order to develop therapeutic approaches for these neurological conditions, we must first understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate synapse formation. The Wnt family of secreted glycoproteins are key regulators of synapse formation in different model systems from invertebrates to mammals. In this review, we will discuss the role of Wnt signaling in the formation of excitatory synapses in the mammalian brain by focusing on Wnt7a and Wnt5a, two Wnt ligands that play an in vivo role in this process. We will also discuss how changes in neuronal activity modulate the expression and/or release of Wnts, resulting in changes in the localization of surface levels of Frizzled, key Wnt receptors, at the synapse. Thus, changes in neuronal activity influence the magnitude of Wnt signaling, which in turn contributes to activity-mediated synapse formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) is complex and diverse. Over the decades, our understanding of NDD has been limited to pathological features. However, recent advances in gene sequencing have facilitated elucidation of NDD at a deeper level.

The current review describes the history of evolution of gene editing tools, with the aim of improving overall understanding of this technology, and focuses on the four most common NDD disorders to demonstrate the potential future applications and research directions of gene editing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Multimodal Simulation of a Novel Device for a Safe and Effective External Ventricular Drain Placement</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.690705</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;External ventricular drain (EVD) placement is mandatory for several pathologies. The misplacement rate of the EVD varies widely in literature, ranging from 12.3 to 60%. The purpose of this simulation study is to provide preliminary data about the possibility of increasing the safety of one of the most common life-saving procedures in neurosurgery by testing a new device for EVD placement.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We used a novel guide for positioning the ventricular catheter (patent RM2014A000376). The trajectory was assessed using 25 anonymized head CT scans. The data sets were used to conduct three-dimensional computer-based and combined navigation and augmented reality-based simulations using plaster models. The data set inclusion criteria were volumetric head CT scan, without midline shift, of patients older than 18. Evans’ index was used to quantify the ventricle’s size. We excluded patients with slit ventricles, midline shift, skull fractures, or complex skull malformations. The proximal end of the device was tested on the cadaver.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The cadaveric tests proved that a surgeon could use the device without any external help. The multimodal simulation showed Kakarla grade 1 in all cases but one (grade 2) on both sides, after right and left EVD placement. The mean Evans’ index was 0.28. The geometric principles that explain the device’s efficacy can be summarized by studying the properties of circumference and chord. The contact occurs, for each section considered, at the extreme points of the chord. Its axis, perpendicular to the plane tangent to the spherical surface at the entry point, corresponds to the direction of entry of the catheter guided by the instrument.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;According to our multimodal simulation on cadavers, 3D computer-based simulation, 3D plaster modeling, 3D neuronavigation, and augmented reality, the device promises to offer safer and effective EVD placement. Further validation in future clinical studies is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: MRIES: A Matlab Toolbox for Mapping the Responses to Intracranial Electrical Stimulation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.652841</link>
	<content:encoded>Propose&lt;p&gt;Directed cortical responses to intracranial electrical stimulation are a good standard for mapping inter-regional direct connectivity. Cortico-cortical evoked potential (CCEP), elicited by single pulse electrical stimulation (SPES), has been widely used to map the normal and abnormal brain effective network. However, automated processing of CCEP datasets and visualization of connectivity results remain challenging for researchers and clinicians. In this study, we develop a Matlab toolbox named MRIES (Mapping the Responses to Intracranial Electrical Stimulation) to automatically process CCEP data and visualize the connectivity results.&lt;/p&gt;Method&lt;p&gt;The MRIES integrates the processing pipeline of the CCEP datasets and various methods for connectivity calculation based on low- and high-frequency signals with stimulation artifacts removed. The connectivity matrices are saved in different folders for visualization. Different visualization patterns (connectivity matrix, circle map, surface map, and volume map) are also integrated to the graphical user interface (GUI), which makes it easy to intuitively display and compare different connectivity measurements. Furthermore, one sample CCEP data set collected from eight epilepsy patients is used to validate the MRIES toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;Result&lt;p&gt;We show the GUI and visualization functions of MRIES using one example CCEP data that has been described in a complete tutorial. We applied this toolbox to the sample CCEP data set to investigate the direct connectivity between the medial temporal lobe and the insular cortex. We find bidirectional connectivity between MTL and insular that are consistent with the findings of previous studies.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;MRIES has a friendly GUI and integrates the full processing pipeline of CCEP data and various visualization methods. The MRIES toolbox, tutorial, and example data can be freely downloaded. As an open-source package, MRIES is expected to improve the reproducibility of CCEP findings and facilitate clinical translation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;No matter how hard we concentrate, our attention fluctuates – a fact that greatly affects our success in completing a current task. Here, we review work from two methods that, in a closed-loop manner, have the potential to ameliorate these fluctuations. Ear-EEG can measure electric brain activity from areas in or around the ear, using small and thus portable hardware. It has been shown to capture the state of attention with high temporal resolution. Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) comes with the same advantages (small and light) and critically current research suggests that it is possible to influence ongoing brain activity that has been linked to attention. Following the review of current work on ear-EEG and taVNS we suggest that a combination of the two methods in a closed-loop system could serve as a potential application to modulate attention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Radiofrequency lesioning (RFL) though used since the 1950s, had been replaced by DBS in the 1990s. The availability of magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound for lesioning has renewed the interest in RFL.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;This paper analysis RFL in contemporary Functional Neurosurgery for various indications and its outcome. Complication rates of RFL are compared with the same author’s experience of DBS.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;One hundred and seven patients underwent RFL between 1998 and 2019. Indications included Parkinson’s Disease (PD), tremors, dystonia, and obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD). The surgeries performed include thalamotomy (29), pallidotomy (49), subthalamotomy (23), and anterior capsulotomy/nucleus accumbens lesioning (6). Appropriate rating scales were used for preoperative and postoperative evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;There was a 25% recurrence rate of tremors for PD after thalamotomy. Writer’s cramp rating scale improved from a mean of 10.54–1.6 in task specific dystonia (TSD) patients, after thalamotomy. In PD patients, after pallidotomy, contralateral motor Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and dyskinesia scores, improved by 41 and 57%, respectively, at 1-year. Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale in hemidystonia patients improved from 18.04 to 6.91, at 1-year. There was 32 and 31% improvement in total and motor UPDRS, respectively, in the subthalamotomy patients, at 2-year. All patients of OCD were in remission. There were three deaths in the pallidotomy group. Postoperative, dysarthria, confusion, hemiparesis, dyskinesia, and paraesthesia occurred in 12 patients, of which, 7 were transient.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;RFL is a useful option in a select group of patients with tremors and dystonia. It is our preferred treatment option for TSD and OCD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Behavioural Features of Cerebral Visual Impairment Are Common in Children With Down Syndrome</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.673342</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It is widely recognised that children with Down syndrome have a broad range and a high prevalence of visual deficits and it has been suggested that those with Down syndrome are more likely to exhibit visual perception deficits indicative of cerebral visual impairment. This exploratory study aims to determine the prevalence of behavioural features suggestive of cerebral visual impairment (CVI) occurring with Down syndrome and whether the visual problems can be ascribed to optometric factors. A cohort of 226 families of children with Down syndrome (trisomy 21), aged 4–17, were invited to participate in a validated question inventory, to recognise visual perception issues. The clinical records of the participants were then reviewed retrospectively. A five-question screening instrument was used to indicate suspected CVI. The majority of the 81 families who responded to the questionnaire reported some level of visual perceptual difficulty in their child. Among this cohort, the prevalence of suspected CVI as indicated by the screening questionnaire was 38%. Only ametropia was found to have a significant association with suspected CVI, although this increased the correct prediction of suspected CVI outcome by only a small amount. Results suggest that children with Down syndrome are more likely to experience problems consistent with cerebral visual impairment, and that these may originate from a similar brain dysfunction to that which contributes to high levels of ametropia and failure to emmetropise. It is important that behavioural features of CVI are recognised in children with Down syndrome, further investigations initiated and appropriate management applied.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Two Aspects of Feedforward Control During a Fencing Lunge: Early and Anticipatory Postural Adjustments</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.638675</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The present study investigated whether expertise in fencing influences the onset of postural preparation during the fencing lunge and how it changes under different performance conditions. We also questioned if the onset of feedforward control can be categorized into one of the postural phases: anticipatory or early postural adjustment. Eight elite fencers and nine physical education students performed an attack with a lunge in self-paced and reaction time conditions from three different initial stance widths. The onset of the center of pressure (COP) displacement and EMG activities for the tibialis anterior (TA) of both limbs were recorded. The results show that expertise in fencing delays the onset of the activity of TA of the front leg and the onset of COP displacement during fencing lunge performance in comparison to controls. Additionally, in contrast to the control group, fencers produce typical APA patterns in the activation of TA under different performance conditions, delayed reaction time in comparison to self-initiated lunging, and constant time of APA onset under different widths of stance. According to different times and functions of TA activity and COP displacement in lunging, we propose to address them as anticipatory postural adjustment and early postural adjustment, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Cortical Electrical Stimulation Ameliorates Traumatic Brain Injury-Induced Sensorimotor and Cognitive Deficits in Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.693073</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Individuals with different severities of traumatic brain injury (TBI) often suffer long-lasting motor, sensory, neurological, or cognitive disturbances. To date, no neuromodulation-based therapies have been used to manage the functional deficits associated with TBI. Cortical electrical stimulation (CES) has been increasingly developed for modulating brain plasticity and is considered to have therapeutic potential in TBI. However, the therapeutic value of such a technique for TBI is still unclear. Accordingly, an animal model of this disease would be helpful for mechanistic insight into using CES as a novel treatment approach in TBI. The current study aims to apply a novel CES scheme with a theta-burst stimulation (TBS) protocol to identify the therapeutic potential of CES in a weight drop-induced rat model of TBI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: TBI rats were divided into the sham CES treatment group and CES treatment group. Following early and long-term CES intervention (starting 24 h after TBI, 1 session/day, 5 days/week) in awake TBI animals for a total of 4 weeks, the effects of CES on the modified neurological severity score (mNSS), sensorimotor and cognitive behaviors and neuroinflammatory changes were identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We found that the 4-week CES intervention significantly alleviated the TBI-induced neurological, sensorimotor, and cognitive deficits in locomotor activity, sensory and recognition memory. Immunohistochemically, we found that CES mitigated the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) activation in the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: These findings suggest that CES has significant benefits in alleviating TBI-related symptoms and represents a promising treatment for TBI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Oxytocinergic Feedback Circuitries: An Anatomical Basis for Neuromodulation of Social Behaviors</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.688234</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Oxytocin (OT) is a neuropeptide produced by hypothalamic neurons and is known to modulate social behavior among other functions. Several experiments have shown that OT modulates neuronal activity in many brain areas, including sensory cortices. OT neurons thus project axons to various cortical and subcortical structures and activate neuronal subpopulations to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, and in turn, increases the saliency of social stimuli. Less is known about the origin of inputs to OT neurons, but recent studies show that cells projecting to OT neurons are often located in regions where the OT receptor (OTR) is expressed. Thus, we propose the existence of reciprocal connectivity between OT neurons and extrahypothalamic OTR neurons to tune OT neuron activity depending on the behavioral context. Furthermore, the latest studies have shown that OTR-expressing neurons located in social brain regions also project to other social brain regions containing OTR-expressing neurons. We hypothesize that OTR-expressing neurons across the brain constitute a common network coordinated by OT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Modulatory Effects of Monoamines and Perineuronal Nets on Output of Cerebellar Purkinje Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.661899</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Classically, the cerebellum has been thought to play a significant role in motor coordination. However, a growing body of evidence for novel neural connections between the cerebellum and various brain regions indicates that the cerebellum also contributes to other brain functions implicated in reward, language, and social behavior. Cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) make inhibitory GABAergic synapses with their target neurons: other PCs and Lugaro/globular cells via PC axon collaterals, and neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) via PC primary axons. PC-Lugaro/globular cell connections form a cerebellar cortical microcircuit, which is driven by serotonin and noradrenaline. PCs’ primary outputs control not only firing but also synaptic plasticity of DCN neurons following the integration of excitatory and inhibitory inputs in the cerebellar cortex. Thus, strong PC-mediated inhibition is involved in cerebellar functions as a key regulator of cerebellar neural networks. In this review, we focus on physiological characteristics of GABAergic transmission from PCs. First, we introduce monoaminergic modulation of GABAergic transmission at synapses of PC-Lugaro/globular cell as well as PC-large glutamatergic DCN neuron, and a Lugaro/globular cell-incorporated microcircuit. Second, we review the physiological roles of perineuronal nets (PNNs), which are organized components of the extracellular matrix and enwrap the cell bodies and proximal processes, in GABA release from PCs to large glutamatergic DCN neurons and in cerebellar motor learning. Recent evidence suggests that alterations in PNN density in the DCN can regulate cerebellar functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Multi-structure Cortical States Deduced From Intracellular Representations of Fixed Tactile Input Patterns</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.677568</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The brain has a never-ending internal activity, whose spatiotemporal evolution interacts with external inputs to constrain their impact on brain activity and thereby how we perceive them. We used reproducible touch-related spatiotemporal sensory inputs and recorded intracellularly from rat (Sprague-Dawley, male) neocortical neurons to characterize this interaction. The synaptic responses, or the summed input of the networks connected to the neuron, varied greatly to repeated presentations of the same tactile input pattern delivered to the tip of digit 2. Surprisingly, however, these responses tended to sort into a set of specific time-evolving response types, unique for each neuron. Further, using a set of eight such tactile input patterns, we found each neuron to exhibit a set of specific response types for each input provided. Response types were not determined by the global cortical state, but instead likely depended on the time-varying state of the specific subnetworks connected to each neuron. The fact that some types of responses recurred indicates that the cortical network had a non-continuous landscape of solutions for these tactile inputs. Therefore, our data suggest that sensory inputs combine with the internal dynamics of the brain networks, thereby causing them to fall into one of the multiple possible perceptual attractor states. The neuron-specific instantiations of response types we observed suggest that the subnetworks connected to each neuron represent different components of those attractor states. Our results indicate that the impact of cortical internal states on external inputs is substantially more richly resolvable than previously shown.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.700306</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aging is a process that adversely affects brain functions such as cognition. Brain activity is highly energy consuming, with glucose serving as the main energy source under normal circumstances. Whether the dynamics of glucose metabolism change with aging is not well understood. This study sought to investigate the activity-dependent changes in glucose metabolism of the mouse hippocampus during aging. In brief, after 1 h of contextual exploration in an enriched environmental condition or 1 h in a familiar home cage condition, metabolites were measured from the hippocampus of both young adult and aged mice with metabolomic profiling. Compared to the home cage context, the enriched contextual exploration condition resulted in changes in the concentration of 11 glucose metabolism-related metabolites in the young adult hippocampus. In contrast, glucose metabolism-related metabolite changes were more apparent in the aged group altered by contextual exploration when compared to those in the home cage condition. Importantly, in the aged groups, several key metabolites involved in glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and ketone body metabolism accumulated, suggesting the less efficient metabolization of glucose-based energy resources. Altogether, the analyses revealed that in the aged mice altered by enriched contextual exploration, the glucose resource seems to be unable to provide enough energy for hippocampal function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aberrant cortical spike-local field potential (LFP) coupling leads to abnormal basal ganglia activity, disruption of cortical function, and impaired movement in Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, the primary motor cortex mediated plasticity mechanism underlying behavioral improvement by exercise intervention was investigated. Exercise alleviates motor dysfunction and induces neuroplasticity in PD. In this study, Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were injected with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) to induce unilateral nigrostriatal dopamine depletion. Two weeks later, a 4-week exercise intervention was initiated in the PD + exercise (Ex) group. Multichannel recording technology recorded spikes and LFPs in rat motor cortices, and balanced ability tests evaluated behavioral performance. The balanced ability test showed that the total crossing time/front leg error/input latency time was significantly lower in PD + Ex rats than in PD rats (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Scalograms and LFP power spectra indicated increased beta-range LFP power in lesioned hemispheres, with exercise reducing LFP power spectral density. Spike-triggered LFP waveform averages showed strong phase-locking in PD motor cortex cells, and exercise reduced spike-LFP synchronization. Our results suggest that exercise can suppress overexcitability of LFPs and minimize spike-LFP synchronization in the motor cortex, leading to motor-improving effects in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.685683</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;The estimated absolute cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk level is known to be a useful surrogate marker for future cognitive impairment; however, evidence regarding its predictive validity in terms of cognitive subtypes is limited. We aimed to examine subtype-dependent differences in the associations between absolute CVD risk and the incidence of cognitive impairment in a community-dwelling older Japanese cohort.&lt;/p&gt;Methods and Results&lt;p&gt;This study comprised 1,641 cognitively intact older Japanese participants without CVDs at baseline. We estimated absolute CVD risk using WHO region-specific risk estimation charts and included age, sex, diabetes mellitus, smoking, systolic blood pressure, and total cholesterol at baseline, and the CVD risk level was stratified into the three following risk categories: low (&amp;lt;10%), moderate (10 to &amp;lt;20%), and high (≥20%). Objective cognitive screening was performed using a multicomponent neurocognitive test at baseline and follow-up, and the incidence of cognitive impairment over 48 ± 2 months was determined. The incidence of cognitive impairment in low-, moderate-, and high-CVD risk participants was 1.2, 3.0, and 5.4%, respectively, for amnestic subtypes and 5.8, 10.1, and 14.0%, respectively, for non-amnestic subtypes. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, the absolute CVD risk level was significantly associated with non-amnestic impairment but not with amnestic impairment.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusions&lt;p&gt;The absolute CVD risk estimated using region-specific risk estimation charts in old age is useful to predict incidence of cognitive impairment. Strategies to screen populations at risk of cognitive impairment and to prevent progression to dementia should be cognitive subtype-specific.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Motor Sequence Learning Deficits in Idiopathic Parkinson’s Disease Are Associated With Increased Substantia Nigra Activity</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.685168</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have shown that persons with Parkinson’s disease (pwPD) share specific deficits in learning new sequential movements, but the neural substrates of this impairment remain unclear. In addition, the degree to which striatal dopaminergic denervation in PD affects the cortico-striato-thalamo-cerebellar motor learning network remains unknown. We aimed to answer these questions using fMRI in 16 pwPD and 16 healthy age-matched control subjects while they performed an implicit motor sequence learning task. While learning was absent in both pwPD and controls assessed with reaction time differences between sequential and random trials, larger error-rates during the latter suggest that at least some of the complex sequence was encoded. Moreover, we found that while healthy controls could improve general task performance indexed by decreased reaction times across both sequence and random blocks, pwPD could not, suggesting disease-specific deficits in learning of stimulus-response associations. Using fMRI, we found that this effect in pwPD was correlated with decreased activity in the hippocampus over time. Importantly, activity in the substantia nigra (SN) and adjacent bilateral midbrain was specifically increased during sequence learning in pwPD compared to healthy controls, and significantly correlated with sequence-specific learning deficits. As increased SN activity was also associated (on trend) with higher doses of dopaminergic medication as well as disease duration, the results suggest that learning deficits in PD are associated with disease progression, indexing an increased drive to recruit dopaminergic neurons in the SN, however, unsuccessfully. Finally, there were no differences between pwPD and controls in task modulation of the cortico-striato-thalamo-cerebellar network. However, a restricted nigral-striatal model showed that negative modulation of SN to putamen connection was larger in pwPD compared to controls during random trials, while no differences between the groups were found during sequence learning. We speculate that learning-specific SN recruitment leads to a relative increase in SN- &amp;gt; putamen connectivity, which returns to a pathological reduced state when no learning takes place.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Learning by Insight-Like Sudden Comprehension as a Potential Strategy to Improve Memory Encoding in Older Adults</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.661346</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Several cognitive functions show a decline with advanced age, most prominently episodic memory. Problem-solving by insight represents a special associative form of problem-solving that has previously been shown to facilitate long-term memory formation. Recent neuroimaging evidence suggests that the encoding network involved in insight-based memory formation is largely hippocampus-independent. This may represent a potential advantage in older adults, as the hippocampus is one of the earliest brain structures to show age-related volume loss and functional impairment. Here, we investigated the potential beneficial effects of learning by insight in healthy older (60–79 years) compared to young adults (19–28 years). To this end, we compared later memory performance for verbal riddles encoded incidentally via induced insight-like sudden comprehension in both age groups. We employed a variant of the Compound Remote Associate Task (CRAT) for incidental encoding, during which participants were instructed to judge the solvability of items. In a 24-h delayed surprise memory test, participants attempted to solve previously encountered items and additionally performed a recognition memory test. During this test, older adults correctly solved an equal proportion of new CRA items compared to young adults and both age groups reported a similar frequency of Aha! experiences. While overall memory performance was better in young participants (higher proportion of correctly solved and correctly recognized old CRA items), older participants exhibited a stronger beneficial effect of insight-like sudden comprehension on later recognition memory for CRA items. Our results suggest that learning via insight might constitute a promising approach to improve memory function in old age.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.657646</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background and Objectives: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is often a precursor of dementia, and in particular of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) which is the most common cause of dementia. Individuals with amnestic MCI are several-fold more likely to develop AD than the general population. Therefore, MCI comprises a well-detectable, early stage time-point for therapeutic intervention and strategic prevention. Based on common electroencephalographical (EEG) pattern changes seen in individuals with MCI, we postulated that EEG-based neurofeedback could help improve the memory performance of patients with MCI. Memory performance is of particular importance in these patients, since memory decline is the most prominent symptom in most patients with MCI, and is the most predictive symptom for cognitive deterioration and the development of AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: In order to improve the memory performance of patients with MCI we used a system of EEG-based neurofeedback in an attempt to reverse alterations of the EEG that are known to be common in patients with MCI. Our protocol comprised the provision of positive feedback in order to enhance the activity level of the upper alpha band. Participants were divided to two groups receiving either neurofeedback training to enhance the upper alpha frequency (Experimental group) or random feedbacks (Sham group)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We witnessed a significant improvement in memory performance in subjects in the experimental group compared to those in the sham group. This improvement was maintained for at least 1 month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Neurofeedback may be a promising and affordable novel approach for treating the decline in memory witnessed in patients with MCI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a common global health problem. Recently, the potential of mind-body intervention for MCI has drawn the interest of investigators. This study aims to comparatively explore the modulation effect of Baduanjin, a popular mind-body exercise, and physical exercise on the cognitive function, as well as the norepinephrine and dopamine systems using the resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) method in patients with MCI. 69 patients were randomized to the Baduanjin, brisk walking, or healthy education control group for 6 months. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were applied at baseline and at the end of the experiment. Results showed that (1) compared to the brisk walking, the Baduanjin significantly increased MoCA scores; (2) Baduanjin significantly increased the right locus coeruleus (LC) and left ventral tegmental area (VTA) rsFC with the right insula and right amygdala compared to that of the control group; and the right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) compared to that of the brisk walking group; (3) the increased right LC-right insula rsFC and right LC-right ACC rsFC were significantly associated with the corresponding MoCA score after 6-months of intervention; (4) both exercise groups experienced an increased effective connectivity from the right ACC to the left VTA compared to the control group; and (5) Baduanjin group experienced an increase in gray matter volume in the right ACC compared to the control group. Our results suggest that Baduanjin can significantly modulate intrinsic functional connectivity and the influence of the norepinephrine (LC) and dopamine (VTA) systems. These findings may shed light on the mechanisms of mind-body intervention and aid the development of new treatments for MCI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.642647</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Advances in machine learning (ML) technology have opened new avenues for detection and monitoring of cognitive decline. In this study, a multimodal approach to Alzheimer's dementia detection based on the patient's spontaneous speech is presented. This approach was tested on a standard, publicly available Alzheimer's speech dataset for comparability. The data comprise voice samples from 156 participants (1:1 ratio of Alzheimer's to control), matched by age and gender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials and Methods: A recently developed Active Data Representation (ADR) technique for voice processing was employed as a framework for fusion of acoustic and textual features at sentence and word level. Temporal aspects of textual features were investigated in conjunction with acoustic features in order to shed light on the temporal interplay between paralinguistic (acoustic) and linguistic (textual) aspects of Alzheimer's speech. Combinations between several configurations of ADR features and more traditional bag-of-n-grams approaches were used in an ensemble of classifiers built and evaluated on a standardised dataset containing recorded speech of scene descriptions and textual transcripts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Employing only semantic bag-of-n-grams features, an accuracy of 89.58% was achieved in distinguishing between Alzheimer's patients and healthy controls. Adding temporal and structural information by combining bag-of-n-grams features with ADR audio/textual features, the accuracy could be improved to 91.67% on the test set. An accuracy of 93.75% was achieved through late fusion of the three best feature configurations, which corresponds to a 4.7% improvement over the best result reported in the literature for this dataset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The proposed combination of ADR audio and textual features is capable of successfully modelling temporal aspects of the data. The machine learning approach toward dementia detection achieves best performance when ADR features are combined with strong semantic bag-of-n-grams features. This combination leads to state-of-the-art performance on the AD classification task.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the major threats of the twenty-first century and lacks available therapy. Identification of novel molecular markers for diagnosis and treatment of AD is urgently demanded, and genetic biomarkers show potential prospects.&lt;/p&gt;Method&lt;p&gt;We identify and intersected differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from five microarray datasets to detect consensus DEGs. Based on these DEGs, we conducted Gene Ontology (GO), performed the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis, constructed a protein—protein interaction (PPI) network, and utilized Cytoscape to identify hub genes. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression was applied to identify potential diagnostic biomarkers. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to investigate the biological functions of the key genes.&lt;/p&gt;Result&lt;p&gt;We identified 608 consensus DEGs, several dysregulated pathways, and 18 hub genes. Sixteen hub genes dysregulated as AD progressed. The diagnostic model of 35 genes was constructed, which has a high area under the curve (AUC) value in both the validation dataset and combined dataset (AUC = 0.992 and AUC = 0.985, respectively). The model can also differentiate mild cognitive impairment and AD patients from controls in two blood datasets. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and WW domain-containing transcription regulator protein 1 (WWTR1), which are associated with the Braak stage, Aβ 42 levels, and β-secretase activity, were identified as critical genes of AD.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our study identified 16 hub genes correlated to the neuropathological stage and 35 potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of AD. WWTR1 were identified as candidate genes for future studies. This study deepens our understanding of the transcriptomic and functional features and provides new potential diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/68211</link>
	<content:encoded>Time-resolved X-ray diffraction from isolated fast-twitch muscles of the mouse was used to show how structural changes in the myosin-containing thick filaments contribute to the regulation of muscle contraction, extending the previous focus on regulation by the actin-containing thin filaments. This study shows that muscle activation involves the following sequence of structural changes: thin filament activation, disruption of the helical array of myosin motors characteristic of resting muscle, release of myosin motor domains from the folded conformation on the filament backbone, and actin attachment. Physiological force generation in the 'twitch' response of skeletal muscle to single action potential stimulation is limited by incomplete activation of the thick filament and the rapid inactivation of both filaments. Muscle relaxation after repetitive stimulation is accompanied by complete recovery of the folded motor conformation on the filament backbone but incomplete reformation of the helical array, revealing a structural basis for post-tetanic potentiation in isolated muscle.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66524</link>
	<content:encoded>Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is neuroendocrine in origin and rarely contains mutations in the MAPK pathway. Likewise, non-SCLC (NSCLC) that transform to SCLC concomitantly with development of therapy resistance downregulate MAPK signaling, suggesting an inverse relationship between pathway activation and lineage state. To test this, we activated MAPK in SCLC through expression of mutant KRAS or EGFR, which revealed suppression of the neuroendocrine differentiation via ERK. We found that ERK induces expression of ETS factors that mediate transformation into a NSCLC-like state. ATAC-seq demonstrated ERK-driven changes in chromatin accessibility at putative regulatory regions and global chromatin rewiring at neuroendocrine and ETS transcriptional targets. Further, induction of ETS factors and suppression of neuroendocrine differentiation were dependent on histone acetyltransferases CBP/p300. Overall, we describe how the ERK-CBP/p300-ETS axis promotes a lineage shift between neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine phenotypes and provide rationale for the disruption of this program during transformation-driven resistance to targeted therapy.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64431</link>
	<content:encoded>Conflict detection in sensory input is central to adaptive human behavior. Perhaps unsurprisingly, past research has shown that conflict may even be detected in absence of conflict awareness, suggesting that conflict detection is an automatic process that does not require attention. To test the possibility of conflict processing in the absence of attention, we manipulated task relevance and response overlap of potentially conflicting stimulus features across six behavioral tasks. Multivariate analyses on human electroencephalographic data revealed neural signatures of conflict only when at least one feature of a conflicting stimulus was attended, regardless of whether that feature was part of the conflict, or overlaps with the response. In contrast, neural signatures of basic sensory processes were present even when a stimulus was completely unattended.

	<title>eLife: Cancer immunotherapy by NC410, a LAIR-2 Fc protein blocking human LAIR-collagen interaction</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/62927</link>
	<content:encoded>Collagens are a primary component of the extracellular matrix and are functional ligands for the inhibitory immune receptor leukocyte associated immunoglobulin-like receptor (LAIR)-1. LAIR-2 is a secreted protein that can act as a decoy receptor by binding collagen with higher affinity than LAIR-1. We propose that collagens promote immune evasion by interacting with LAIR-1 expressed on immune cells, and that LAIR-2 releases LAIR-1 mediated immune suppression. Analysis of public human datasets show that collagens, LAIR-1 and LAIR-2 have unique and overlapping associations with survival in certain tumors. We designed a dimeric LAIR-2 with a functional IgG1 Fc tail, NC410, and showed that NC410 increases human T cell expansion and effector function &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; in a mouse xenogeneic-graft versus-host disease model. In humanized mouse tumor models NC410 reduces tumor growth that is dependent on T cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of human tumors shows that NC410 binds to collagen-rich areas where LAIR-1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; immune cells are localized. Our findings show that NC410 might be a novel strategy for cancer immunotherapy for immune-excluded tumors.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Identical sequences found in distant genomes reveal frequent horizontal transfer across the bacterial domain</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/62719</link>
	<content:encoded>Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) is an essential force in microbial evolution. Despite detailed studies on a variety of systems, a global picture of HGT in the microbial world is still missing. Here, we exploit that HGT creates long identical DNA sequences in the genomes of distant species, which can be found efficiently using alignment-free methods. Our pairwise analysis of 93 481 bacterial genomes identified 138 273 HGT events. We developed a model to explain their statistical properties as well as estimate the transfer rate between pairs of taxa. This reveals that long-distance HGT is frequent: our results indicate that HGT between species from different phyla has occurred in at least 8% of the species. Finally, our results confirm that the function of sequences strongly impacts their transfer rate, which varies by more than 3 orders of magnitude between different functional categories. Overall, we provide a comprehensive view of HGT, illuminating a fundamental process driving bacterial evolution.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Glycinergic axonal inhibition subserves acute spatial sensitivity to sudden increases in sound intensity</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/62183</link>
	<content:encoded>Locomotion generates adventitious sounds which enable detection and localization of predators and prey. Such sounds contain brisk changes or transients in amplitude. We investigated the hypothesis that ill-understood temporal specializations in binaural circuits subserve lateralization of such sound transients, based on different time of arrival at the ears (interaural time differences, ITDs). We find that Lateral Superior Olive (LSO) neurons show exquisite ITD-sensitivity, reflecting extreme precision and reliability of excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, in contrast to Medial Superior Olive neurons, traditionally viewed as the ultimate ITD-detectors. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt;, inhibition blocks LSO excitation over an extremely short window, which, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, required synaptically-evoked inhibition. Light and electron microscopy revealed inhibitory synapses on the axon initial segment as the structural basis of this observation. These results reveal a neural vetoing mechanism with extreme temporal and spatial precision and establish the LSO as the primary nucleus for binaural processing of sound transients.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61018</link>
	<content:encoded>Human dexterous motor control improves from childhood to adulthood, but little is known about the changes in cortico-cortical communication that support such ontogenetic refinement of motor skills. To investigate age-related differences in connectivity between cortical regions involved in dexterous control we analyzed electroencephalographic data from 88 individuals (range 8-30y) performing a visually-guided precision grip task using Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) and Parametric Empirical Bayes (PEB). Our results demonstrate that bidirectional coupling in a canonical 'grasping network' is associated with precision grip performance across age groups. We further demonstrate greater backward coupling from higher-order to lower-order sensorimotor regions from late adolescence in addition to differential associations between connectivity strength in a premotor-prefrontal network and motor performance for different age groups. We interpret these findings as reflecting greater use of top-down and executive control processes with development. These results expand our understanding of the cortical mechanisms that support dexterous abilities through development.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.14.448404v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC, approximately corresponding to Brodmann areas 9 and 46) has demonstrable roles in diverse executive functions such as working memory, cognitive flexibility, planning, inhibition, and abstract reasoning. However, it remains unclear whether this is the result of one functionally homogeneous region or whether there are functional subdivisions within the DLPFC. Here, we divided the DLPFC into seven areas along with rostral-caudal and dorsal-ventral axes anatomically and explored their respective patterns of structural and functional connectivity. In vivo probabilistic tractography and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging were employed to map out the patterns of connectivity from each DLPFC subregions. Structural connectivity demonstrated graded intra-regional connectivity within the DLPFC. The patterns of structural connectivity between the DLPFC subregions and other cortical areas revealed that he dorsal-rostral subregions was restricted to connect to other frontal and limbic areas, whereas the ventral-caudal region was widely connected to frontal, temporal, parietal, and limbic cortex. Functional connectivity analysis demonstrated that subregions of DLPFC were strongly interconnected to each other. The dorsal subregions were associated with the default mode network (DMN), while middle dorsal-rostral subregions were linked with the multiple demand network (MDN), respectively. Similar to the results of structural connectivity, the ventral-caudal subregion showed increased functional coupling with both DMN and MDN. Our results suggest that DLPFC may be subdivided by the diagonal axis of the dorsal-ventral axis and rostral-caudal axis, which support the patterns of connectivity the parts of the DLPFC reflects its integrative executive function.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Comparing the Accuracy and Precision of Multi-echo Combination Methods for Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping Using Laplacian-Based Methods at 3 T</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.14.448385v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Purpose: To compare different multi-echo combination methods for MRI quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), aiming to elucidate, given the current lack of consensus, how to optimally combine multi-echo gradient-recalled echo (GRE) signal phase information, either before or after applying Laplacian-base methods (LBMs) for phase unwrapping or background field removal. Methods: Multi-echo GRE data were simulated in a numerical head phantom, and multi-echo GRE images were acquired at 3 T in 10 healthy volunteers. To enable image-based estimation of GRE signal noise, 5 volunteers were scanned twice in the same session without repositioning. Five QSM processing pipelines were designed: one applied nonlinear phase fitting over echo times (TEs) before LBMs; two applied LBMs to the TE-dependent phase and then combined multiple TEs via either TE-weighted or signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-weighted averaging; two calculated TE-dependent susceptibility maps via either multi-step or single-step QSM and then combined multiple TEs via magnitude-weighted averaging. Results from different pipelines were compared using visual inspection; summary statistics of susceptibility in deep gray matter, white matter and venous regions; phase noise propagation maps (error propagation theory); and, in the healthy volunteers, regional fixed bias analysis (Bland-Altman) and regional differences between the means (non-parametric tests). Results: Nonlinearly fitting the multi-echo phase over TEs before applying LBMs provided the best compromise between regional accuracy/precision and mitigation of phase noise propagation compared to averaging the LBM-processed TE-dependent phase. This result was especially true in high-susceptibility venous regions. Conclusion: For multi-echo QSM, combining the signal phase by nonlinear fitting before applying LBMs is recommended.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Observed across species, operant conditioning facilitates learned associations between behaviours and outcomes, biasing future action selection to maximise reward and avoid punishment. To elucidate the underlying neural mechanisms, we built a high-throughput tracker for Drosophila melanogaster, combining real-time behaviour detection with closed-loop optogenetic and thermogenetic stimulation capabilities. We demonstrate operant conditioning in Drosophila larvae by inducing a bend direction preference through optogenetic activation of reward-encoding serotonergic neurons. Specifically, we establish that the ventral nerve cord is necessary for this memory formation. Our results extend the role of serotonergic neurons for learning in insects as well as the existence of learning circuits outside the mushroom body. This work supports future studies on the function of serotonin and the mechanisms underlying operant conditioning at both circuit and cellular levels.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.14.448333v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The Nash equilibrium concept has previously been shown to be an important tool to understand human sensorimotor interactions, where different actors vie for minimizing their respective effort while engaging in a multi-agent motor task. However, it is not clear how such equilibria are reached. Here, we compare different reinforcement learning models based on haptic feedback to human behavior in sensorimotor versions of three classic games, including the Prisoner's Dilemma, and the symmetric and asymmetric matching pennies games. We find that a discrete analysis that reduces the continuous sensorimotor interaction to binary choices as in classical matrix games does not allow to distinguish between the different learning algorithms, but that a more detailed continuous analysis with continuous formulations of the learning algorithms and the game-theoretic solutions affords different predictions. In particular, we find that Q-learning with intrinsic costs that disfavor deviations from average behavior explains the observed data best, even though all learning algorithms equally converge to admissible Nash equilibrium solutions. We therefore conclude that it is important to study different learning algorithms for understanding sensorimotor interactions, as such behavior cannot be inferred from a game-theoretic analysis alone, that simply focuses on the Nash equilibrium concept, as different learning algorithms impose preferences on the set of possible equilibrium solutions due to the inherent learning dynamics.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The mouse is widely used as an experimental model to study visual processing. To probe how the visual system detects changes in the environment, functional paradigms in freely behaving mice are strongly needed. We developed and validated the first EEG-based method to investigate visual deviance detection in freely behaving mice. Mice with EEG implants were exposed to a visual deviant detection paradigm that involved changes in light intensity as standard and deviant stimuli. By subtracting the standard from the deviant evoked waveform, deviant detection was evident as bi-phasic negativity (starting around 70 ms) in the difference waveform. Additionally, deviance-associated evoked (beta/gamma) and induced (gamma) oscillatory responses were found. We showed that the results were stimulus independent by applying a 'flip-flop' design and the results showed good repeatability in an independent measurement. Together, we put forward a validated, easy-to-use paradigm to measure visual deviance processing in freely behaving mice.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is essential for value-based learning and decision making. Understanding the attentional modulation of the representation of value in the OFC provides us key information on its functional roles and links the OFC to other cognitive processes. We examined how top-down and bottom-up attention modulates the value encoding in the OFC. Two macaque monkeys were trained to detect a luminance change at a cued location between a pair of visual stimuli, which were over-trained pictures associated with different amount of juice rewards and, thus, different salience. While the monkeys' behavior and the DLPFC neuronal activities indicated that the monkeys actively directed their attention toward the cued location during the task, the OFC neurons' value encoding, however, was dominated by the bottom-up attention based on stimulus salience and only reflected the top-down attention weakly. The disassociation between the top-down and bottom-up attention signals in the OFC indicates that the OFC occupies an early stage of value information processing in the brain.</content:encoded>

BAC226Q recapitulated a full-spectrum of age-dependent and progressive HD-like phenotypes without unwanted and erroneous phenotypes. BAC226Q mice developed normally, and gradually exhibited HD-like mood and cognitive phenotypes at 2 months. From 3-4 months, BAC226Q mice showed robust progressive motor deficits. At 11 months, BAC226Q mice showed significant reduced life span, gradual weight loss and exhibit neuropathology including significant brain atrophy specific to striatum and cortex, striatal neuronal death, widespread huntingtin inclusions and reactive pathology. Therefore, the novel BAC226Q mouse accurately recapitulating robust, age-dependent, progressive HD-like phenotypes will be a valuable tool for studying disease mechanisms, identifying biomarkers and testing gene-targeting therapeutic approaches for HD.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Understanding how specific sets of neurons fire and wire together during cognitive-relevant activity is one of the most pressing questions in neuroscience. Two-photon, single-cell resolution optogenetics based on holographic light-targeting approaches enables accurate spatio-temporal control of individual or multiple neurons. Yet, currently, the ability to drive asynchronous activity in distinct cells is critically limited to a few milliseconds and the achievable number of targets to several dozens. In order to expand the capability of single-cell optogenetics, we introduce an approach capable of ultra-fast sequential light targeting (FLiT), based on switching temporally focused beams between holograms at kHz rates. We demonstrate serial-parallel photostimulation strategies capable of multi-cell sub-millisecond temporal control and many-fold expansion of the number of activated cells. This approach will be important for experiments that require rapid and precise cell stimulation with defined spatio-temporal activity patterns and optical control of large neuronal ensembles.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.14.448305v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The majority of olfaction studies focus on orthonasal stimulation where odors enter via the front nasal cavity, while retronasal olfaction , where odors enter the rear of the nasal cavity during feeding, is understudied. The processing of retronasal odors via coordinated spiking of neurons in the olfactory bulb ( OB ) is largely unknown. To this end, we use multi -electrode array in vivo recordings of rat OB mitral cells ( MC ) in response to a food odor with both modes of stimulation, and find significant differences in evoked firing rates and spike count covariances (i.e., noise correlations). To better understand these differences, we develop a single-compartment biophysical OB model that is able to reproduce key properties of important OB cell types. Prior experiments in olfactory receptor neurons ( ORN ) showed retro stimulation yields slower and spatially smaller ORN inputs than with ortho , yet whether this is consequential for OB activity remains unknown. Indeed with these specifications for ORN inputs, our OB model captures the trends in our OB data. We also analyze how first and second order ORN input statistics dynamically transfer to MC spiking statistics with a phenomenological linear-nonlinear filter model, and find that retro inputs result in larger temporal filters than ortho inputs. Finally, our models show that the temporal profile of ORN is crucial for capturing our data and is thus a distinguishing feature between ortho and retro stimulation, even at the OB. Using data-driven modeling, we detail how ORN inputs result in differences in OB dynamics and MC spiking statistics. These differences may ultimately shape how ortho and retro odors are coded.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Normative modeling aims to quantify the degree to which an individual's brain deviates from a reference sample with respect to one or more variables, which can be used as a potential biomarker of a healthy brain and as a tool to study heterogeneity of psychiatric disorders. The application of normative models is hindered by methodological challenges and lacks standards for the usage and evaluation of normative models. In this paper, we present generalized additive models for location scale and shape (GAMLSS) for normative modeling of neuroimaging data, a flexible modeling framework that can model heteroskedasticity, non-linear effects of variables, and hierarchical structure of the data. It can model non-Gaussian distributions, and it allows for an automatic model order selection, thus improving the accuracy of normative models while mitigating problems of overfitting. Furthermore, we describe measures and diagnostic tools suitable for evaluating normative models and step-by-step examples of normative modeling, including fitting several candidate models, selecting the best models, and transferring them to new scan sites.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.14.448057v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Neonatal sensory experience shapes development of neural pathways carrying sensory information to the cortex. These pathways link to wider functional networks that coordinate activity of separate cortical regions, but it remains unknown when these broader networks emerge or how their maturation is influenced by sensory experience. By imaging activity across the cortex in neonatal mice, we have found unexpectedly early emergence of coordinated activity within a sensorimotor network that includes whisker-related somatosensory cortex and motor cortex. This network is spontaneously active but is not engaged by sensory stimulation, even though whisker deflection reliably drives cortical activity within barrel cortex. Acute silencing of the sensory periphery ablated spontaneous activity that was restricted to barrel cortex but spared this early sensorimotor network coactivity, suggesting that it is driven from elsewhere. Furthermore, perturbing sensory experience by whisker trimming did not impact emergence or early maturation of spontaneous activity in the sensorimotor network. As such, functional sensorimotor cortical networks develop early and, in contrast to development of ascending sensory pathways, their initial maturation is independent of sensory experience.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The neural substrate of willingness to pay (WTP) ultimately supports human economic exchange activities and plays a crucial role in daily life. This paper aimed to identify the neural basis of WTP for food and nonfood, as well as the brain regions related to real and hypothetical WTP choices. We found the human brain centers of WTP by performing an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis (27 experiments, 796 subjects) on the existing neuroimaging studies. The conjunction analysis revealed that WTP for food and nonfood engaged a common cluster in the paracingulate and cingulate gyrus, revealing a common reward circuit in the brain. The frontal medial cortex and paracingulate gyrus were particularly activated by WTP for nonfood. Furthermore, the left caudate, left thalamus, angular gyrus and supramarginal gyrus (subregions of inferior parietal lobule) were more convergently activated by hypothetical WTP choice. Our findings support the idea that a common currency representation in the brain and reward-specific neural basis. Results also provide evidence of neural representations of the hypothetical bias.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Developmental plasticity in male courtship in Bicyclus anynana butterflies is driven by hormone regulation of the yellow gene</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.13.448264v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The organizational role for hormones in the regulation of sexual behavior is currently poorly explored. Previous work showed that seasonal variation in levels of the steroid hormone 20- hydroxyecdysone (20E) during pupal development regulates plasticity in male courtship behavior in Bicyclus anynana butterflies. Wet season (WS) males, reared at high temperature, have high levels of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) during pupation and become active courters. Dry season (DS) males, reared at low temperatures, have lower levels of 20E and lower courtship rates. Rescue of WS courtship rates can be achieved via injection of 20E into DS male pupae, but it is still unknown whether 20E alters gene expression in the pupal brain, and if so, the identity of those targets. Using transcriptomics, qPCR, and behavioral assays with a transgenic knockout, we show that higher expression levels of the yellow gene in DS male pupal brains, relative to WS brains, represses courtship in DS males. Furthermore, injecting DS males with 20E downregulates yellow to WS levels 4 hours post-injection, revealing a hormone sensitive window that determines courtship behavior. These findings are in striking contrast to Drosophila, where yellow is required for active male courtship behavior. We conclude that 20E plays an organizational role during pupal brain development by regulating the expression of yellow, which is a repressor of the neural circuity for male courtship behavior in B. anynana. This work shows that similar to vertebrates, hormones can also play an organizational role in insect brains, leading to permanent changes in adult sexual behavior.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: miR-544-3p mediates arthritis pain through regulation of FcγRI</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.13.448256v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Chronic or episodic joint pain is a major symptom in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and its adequate treatment represents an unmet medical need. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying RA pain remain elusive. Non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of RA as negative regulators of the stability or translation of specific target mRNAs. Yet, their significance in RA pain is still not well defined. We and other groups recently identified neuronally expressed Fc{gamma}RI as a key driver of arthritis pain in mouse RA models. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that miRNAs that target and regulate neuronal Fc{gamma}RI attenuate RA pain. Here, we show that miR-544-3p was robustly downregulated whereas Fc{gamma}RI was significantly upregulated in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) in mouse RA models. Intrathecal injection of miR-544-3p mimic attenuated established mechanical and heat hyperalgesia in a mouse model of collagen II-induced arthritis (CIA). Moreover, this effect was likely mediated, at least in part, by Fc{gamma}RI since miR-544-3p mimic downregulated Fc{gamma}RI in the DRG during arthritis and genetic deletion of Fc{gamma}RI produced similar antihyperalgesic effects in the CIA model. This notion was further supported by a dual luciferase assay showing that miR-544-3p targeted Fc{gamma}RI by directly binding to its 3 UTR. In addition, Fc{gamma}RI expression in DRG neurons in vitro was downregulated by miR-544-3p mimic and upregulated by miR-544-3p inhibitor. In intact mice, miR-544-3p mimic alleviated acute joint pain hypersensitivity induced by IgG immune complex (IgG-IC), whereas miR-544-3p inhibitor potentiated the pro-nociceptive behavioral effect of IgG-IC. These findings suggest that miR-544-3p causally participates in the maintenance of arthritis pain by targeting neuronal Fc{gamma}RI, and thus define miR-544-3p as a new potential therapeutic target for treating RA pain.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is increasingly recognised as a multi-system disorder, presenting with common and impactful non-motor symptoms, such as neuropsychiatric symtpoms, cognitive and behavioural changes, pain, disordered sleep, fatigue and problematic saliva.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Aim/hypothesis&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We aimed to systematically review 25 years of ALS clinical trials data to identify if non-motor features were evaluated, in addition to the traditional measures of motor functioning and survival, and where evaluated to describe the instruments used to assess. We hypothesised that assessment of non-motor symptoms has been largely neglected in trial design and not evaluated with ALS-suitable instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We reviewed clinical trials of investigative medicinal products in ALS, since the licensing of riluzole in 1994. Trial registry databases including WHO International Trials Registry, European Clinical Trials Register, clinicaltrials.gov, and PubMed were systematically searched for Phase II, III or IV trials registered, completed or published between 01/01/1994 and 16/09/2020. No language restrictions were applied.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;237 clinical trials, including over 29,222 participants, were investigated for their use of non-motor outcome measures. These trials evaluated neuropsychiatric symptoms (75, 32%), cognitive impairment (16, 6.8%), behavioural change (34, 14%), pain (55, 23%), sleep disturbances (12, 5%) and fatigue (18, 8%). Problematic saliva was assessed as part of composite ALS-FRS(R) scores in 184 trials (78%) but with no focus on this as an isolated symptom. 31 (13%) trials including 3585 participants did not include any assessment of non-motor symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec5&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Non-motor symptoms such as neuropsychiatric, cognitive and behavioural changes, pain, disordered sleep, fatigue, and problematic saliva have not been consistently evaluated in trials for people with ALS. Where evaluated, non-symptoms were primarily assessed using instruments and impairment thresholds that are not adapted for people with ALS. Future trials should include non-motor symptom assessments to evaluate the additional potential therapeutic benefit of candidate drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Neurology: Morning light therapy in adults with Tourette’s disorder</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00415-021-10645-z</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Sleep disturbance is common among individuals with Tourette’s Disorder (TD). Given that sleep is influenced by the circadian system, this study examined circadian rhythms and sleep in adults with TD, and explored the possible benefit of short-wavelength wearable morning light therapy.
      &lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Participants were 34 adults with TD (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 14) and age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 20). Participants were screened using clinician-rated diagnostic and tic severity interviews, and procedures lasted 3 consecutive weeks. Participants completed a baseline week of actigraphy. Adults with TD completed 2 weeks of Re-Timer™ morning light therapy and continued actigraphy monitoring. Dim light melatonin-onset (DLMO) phase assessment, tic severity interview, and measures of chronotype, sleep disturbance, daytime sleepiness, disability, depression, anxiety, and stress were completed at baseline and post-intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Adults with TD reported significantly greater eveningness and sleep disturbance relative to controls. Per wrist actigraphy, adults with TD exhibited significantly longer sleep-onset latency, lower sleep efficiency, and greater sleep fragmentation than HC. Following morning light therapy, there was a significant advance in DLMO phase, but not self-report or actigraphy sleep variables. There were small, statistically significant decreases in tic severity and impairment. There were also significant reductions in daytime sleepiness, and self-reported anxiety, but not depression, stress, or disability. Participants reported minimal side effects and rated light therapy as acceptable and comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Findings showed some benefits following brief light therapy in TD; further exploration of the impact of spectral tuning the photic environment as part of treatment for TD subjects is warranted.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Multisensory contribution in visuospatial orientation: an interaction between neck and trunk proprioception</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00221-021-06146-0</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A coherent perception of spatial orientation is key in maintaining postural control. To achieve this the brain must access sensory inputs encoding both the body and the head position and integrate them with incoming visual information. Here we isolated the contribution of proprioception to verticality perception and further investigated whether changing the body position without moving the head can modulate visual dependence—the extent to which an individual relies on visual cues for spatial orientation. Spatial orientation was measured in ten healthy individuals [6 female; 25–47 years (SD 7.8 years)] using a virtual reality based subjective visual vertical (SVV) task. Individuals aligned an arrow to their perceived gravitational vertical, initially against a static black background (10 trials), and then in other conditions with clockwise and counterclockwise background rotations (each 10 trials). In all conditions, subjects were seated first in the upright position, then with trunk tilted 20° to the right, followed by 20° to the left while the head was always aligned vertically. The SVV error was modulated by the trunk position, and it was greater when the trunk was tilted to the left compared to right or upright trunk positions (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Likewise, background rotation had an effect on SVV errors as these were greater with counterclockwise visual rotation compared to static background and clockwise roll motion (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Our results show that the interaction between neck and trunk proprioception can modulate how visual inputs affect spatial orientation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Current standard treatment in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) has been proved effective, but it is poorly effective in refractory patients and unclear for anti-IgG4 antibody-associated CIDP. Rituximab is a B cell-depleting monoclonal antibody. It has been applied as one of the management strategies in CIDP, but its efficacy is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To perform a systematic review and a meta-analysis of the efficacy of rituximab treatment in CIDP patients.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Through searches in MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, BIOSOS, Web of Science, and Cochrane library on March 31st, 2021, 15 studies were identified. Patients’ characteristics, treatment regime and outcome measure were extracted.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Ninety-six patients in 15 studies were included. The pooled estimate of responsiveness was 75% (95% CI 72–78%). The standard mean difference (SMD) of Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment (INCAT) disability score improvement was 1.7 (95% CI 1.0–2.3, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; value &amp;lt; 0.0001) and the Medical Research Council (MRC) score for muscle power is 1.3 (95% CI − 2.6 to − 0.1, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; value 0.04). All of the anti-IgG4 antibody-positive patients showed excellent responses to rituximab treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec5&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Rituximab was effective in the treatment in CIDP patients, especially in anti-IgG4 antibody-positive patients. Randomized clinical trials are needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of rituximab in CIDP patients.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cognition is shaped by signals from outside and within the body. Following recent evidence of interoceptive signals modulating higher-level cognition, we examined whether breathing changes the production and perception of quantities. In Experiment 1, 22 adults verbally produced on average larger random numbers after inhaling than after exhaling. In Experiment 2, 24 further adults estimated the numerosity of dot patterns that were briefly shown after either inhaling or exhaling. Again, we obtained on average larger responses following inhalation than exhalation. These converging results extend models of situated cognition according to which higher-level cognition is sensitive to transient interoceptive states.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Impact of the apelin/APJ axis in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease with therapeutic potential</title>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
The pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains elusive. There is still no available disease‐modifying strategy against PD, whose management is mainly symptomatic. A growing amount of preclinical evidence shows that a complex interplay between autophagy dysregulation, mitochondrial impairment, endoplasmic reticulum stress, oxidative stress, and excessive neuroinflammation underlies PD pathogenesis. Identifying key molecules linking these pathological cellular processes may substantially aid in our deeper understanding of PD pathophysiology and the development of novel effective therapeutic approaches. Emerging preclinical evidence indicates that apelin, an endogenous neuropeptide acting as a ligand of the orphan G protein‐coupled receptor APJ, may play a key neuroprotective role in PD pathogenesis, via inhibition of apoptosis and dopaminergic neuronal loss, autophagy enhancement, antioxidant effects, endoplasmic reticulum stress suppression, as well as prevention of synaptic dysregulation in the striatum, excessive neuroinflammation, and glutamate‐induced excitotoxicity. Underlying signaling pathways involve phosphoinositide 3‐kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin, extracellular signal‐regulated kinase 1/2, and inositol requiring kinase 1α/XBP1/C/EBP homologous protein. Herein, we discuss the role of apelin/APJ axis and associated molecular mechanisms on the pathogenesis of PD in vitro and in vivo and provide evidence for its challenging therapeutic potential.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: 14‐3‐3ζ is crucial for the conversion of labile short‐term object recognition memory into stable long‐term memory</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24894?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>The upregulation of 14‐3‐3ζ facilitates the transformation of labile object recognition memory (ORM) into stable ORM and causes the increase in brain‐derived growth factor (BDNF) expression, which further aids in the consolidation of newly formed ORM to long‐term memory. The blockage of either 14‐3‐3ζ or BDNF expression abolishes the formation of long‐term ORM (LT‐ORM).

Abstract
The consolidation of new memories into long‐lasting memories is multistage process characterized by distinct temporal dynamics. However, our understanding on the initial stage of transformation of labile memory of recent experience into stable memory remains elusive. Here, with the use of rats and mice overexpressing a memory enhancer called regulator of G protein signaling 14 of 414 amino acids (RGS14414) as a tool, we show that the expression of RGS14414 in male rats' perirhinal cortex (PRh), which is a brain area crucial for object recognition memory (ORM), enhanced the ORM to the extent that it caused the conversion of labile short‐term ORM (ST‐ORM) expected to last for 40 min into stable long‐term ORM (LT‐ORM) traceable after a delay of 24 hr, and that the temporal window of 40 to 60 min after object exposure not only was key for this conversion but also was the time frame when a surge in 14‐3‐3ζ protein was observed. A knockdown of 14‐3‐3ζ gene abrogated both the increase in 14‐3‐3ζ protein and the formation of LT‐ORM. Furthermore, this 14‐3‐3ζ upregulation increased brain‐derived growth factor (BDNF) levels in the time frame of 60 min and 24 hr and 14‐3‐3ζ knockdown decreased the BDNF levels, and a deletion of BDNF gene produced loss in mice ability to form LT‐ORM. Thus, within 60 min of object exposure, 14‐3‐3ζ facilitated the conversion of labile ORM into stable ORM, whereas beyond the 60 min, it mediated the consolidation of the stable memory into long‐lasting ORM by regulating BDNF signaling.</content:encoded>

Abstract
Repetitive behavioral phenotypes are a trait of several neuropsychiatric disorders, including obsessive‐compulsive disorder (OCD). Such behaviors are typified by complex interactions between cognitive and neurobiological processes which most likely contribute to the suboptimal treatment responses often observed. To this end, exploration of the adenosinergic system may be useful, since adenosine‐receptor modulation has previously shown promise to restore control over voluntary behavior and improve cognition in patients presenting with motor repetition. Here, we employed the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii) model of compulsive‐like behavioral persistence, seeking to investigate possible associations between stereotypic motor behavior and cognitive flexibility as measured in the T‐maze continuous alternation task (T‐CAT). The effect of istradefylline, a selective adenosine A2A receptor antagonist at two doses (10 and 20 mg kg−1 day−1) on the expression of stereotypy and T‐CAT performance in high (H) and non‐(N) stereotypical animals, was investigated in comparison to a control intervention (six groups; n = 8 or 9 per group). No correlation between H behavior and T‐CAT performance was found. However, H but not N animals presented with istradefylline‐sensitive spontaneous alternation and stereotypy, in that istradefylline at both doses significantly improved the spontaneous alternation scores and attenuated the stereotypical expression of H animals. Thus, evidence is presented that anti‐adenosinergic drug action improves repetitive behavior and spontaneous alternation in stereotypical deer mice, putatively pointing to a shared psychobiological construct underlying naturalistic stereotypy and alterations in cognitive flexibility in deer mice.</content:encoded>

Abstract
Freshwater snails of the genus Biomphalaria serve as intermediate hosts for the digenetic trematode Schistosoma mansoni, the etiological agent for the most widespread form of intestinal schistosomiasis. As neuropeptide signaling in host snails can be altered by trematode infection, a neural transcriptomics approach was undertaken to identify peptide precursors in Biomphalaria glabrata, the major intermediate host for S. mansoni in the Western Hemisphere. Three transcripts that encode peptides belonging to the FMRF‐NH2‐related peptide (FaRP) family were identified in B. glabrata. One transcript encoded a precursor polypeptide (Bgl‐FaRP1; 292 amino acids) that included eight copies of the tetrapeptide FMRF‐NH2 and single copies of FIRF‐NH2, FLRF‐NH2, and pQFYRI‐NH2. The second transcript encoded a precursor (Bgl‐FaRP2; 347 amino acids) that comprised 14 copies of the heptapeptide GDPFLRF‐NH2 and 1 copy of SKPYMRF‐NH2. The precursor encoded by the third transcript (Bgl‐FaRP3; 287 amino acids) recapitulated Bgl‐FaRP2 but lacked the full SKPYMRF‐NH2 peptide. The three precursors shared a common signal peptide, suggesting a genomic organization described previously in gastropods. Immunohistochemical studies were performed on the nervous systems of B. glabrata and B. alexandrina, a major intermediate host for S. mansoni in Egypt. FMRF‐NH2‐like immunoreactive (FMRF‐NH2‐li) neurons were located in regions of the central nervous system associated with reproduction, feeding, and cardiorespiration. Antisera raised against non‐FMRF‐NH2 peptides present in the tetrapeptide and heptapeptide precursors labeled independent subsets of the FMRF‐NH2‐li neurons. This study supports the participation of FMRF‐NH2‐related neuropeptides in the regulation of vital physiological and behavioral systems that are altered by parasitism in Biomphalaria.</content:encoded>

&lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; is a serious human and animal pathogen threat exhibiting extraordinary capacity for acquiring new antibiotic resistance traits in the pathogen population worldwide.
The development of fast, affordable and effective diagnostic solutions capable of discriminating between antibiotic-resistant and susceptible &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; strains would be of huge benefit for effective disease detection and treatment. Here we develop a diagnostics solution that uses Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionisation–Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) and machine learning, to identify signature profiles of antibiotic resistance to either multidrug or benzylpenicillin in &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; isolates. Using ten different supervised learning techniques, we have analysed a set of 82 &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; isolates collected from 67 cows diagnosed with bovine mastitis across 24 farms. For the multidrug phenotyping analysis, LDA, linear SVM, RBF SVM, logistic regression, naïve Bayes, MLP neural network and QDA had Cohen’s kappa values over 85.00%. For the benzylpenicillin phenotyping analysis, RBF SVM, MLP neural network, naïve Bayes, logistic regression, linear SVM, QDA, LDA, and random forests had Cohen’s kappa values over 85.00%. For the benzylpenicillin the diagnostic systems achieved up to (mean result ± standard deviation over 30 runs on the test set): accuracy = 97.54% ± 1.91%, sensitivity = 99.93% ± 0.25%, specificity = 95.04% ± 3.83%, and Cohen’s kappa = 95.04% ± 3.83%. Moreover, the diagnostic platform complemented by a protein-protein network and 3D structural protein information framework allowed the identification of five molecular determinants underlying the susceptible and resistant profiles. Four proteins were able to classify multidrug-resistant and susceptible strains with 96.81% ± 0.43% accuracy. Five proteins, including the previous four, were able to classify benzylpenicillin resistant and susceptible strains with 97.54% ± 1.91% accuracy. Our approach may open up new avenues for the development of a fast, affordable and effective day-to-day diagnostic solution, which would offer new opportunities for targeting resistant bacteria.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/h7E2Q_2fGQQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Mitchell E. Gronowitz, Adam Liu, Qiang Qiu, C. Ron Yu, Thomas A. Cleland&lt;/p&gt;

We present a general physicochemical sampling model for olfaction, based on established pharmacological laws, in which arbitrary combinations of odorant ligands and receptors can be generated and their individual and collective effects on odor representations and olfactory performance measured. Individual odor ligands exhibit receptor-specific affinities and efficacies; that is, they may bind strongly or weakly to a given receptor, and can act as strong agonists, weak agonists, partial agonists, or antagonists. Ligands interacting with common receptors compete with one another for dwell time; these competitive interactions appropriately simulate the degeneracy that fundamentally defines the capacities and limitations of odorant sampling. The outcome of these competing ligand-receptor interactions yields a pattern of receptor activation levels, thereafter mapped to glomerular presynaptic activation levels based on the convergence of sensory neuron axons. The metric of greatest interest is the mean discrimination sensitivity, a measure of how effectively the olfactory system at this level is able to recognize a small change in the physicochemical quality of a stimulus. This model presents several significant outcomes, both expected and surprising. First, adding additional receptors reliably improves the system’s discrimination sensitivity. Second, in contrast, adding additional ligands to an odor scene initially can improve discrimination sensitivity, but eventually will reduce it as the number of ligands increases. Third, the presence of antagonistic ligand-receptor interactions produced clear benefits for sensory system performance, generating higher absolute discrimination sensitivities and increasing the numbers of competing ligands that could be present before discrimination sensitivity began to be impaired. Finally, the model correctly reflects and explains the modest reduction in odor discrimination sensitivity exhibited by transgenic mice in which the specificity of glomerular targeting by primary olfactory neurons is partially disrupted.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QetEW3-tyP0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Human movements with or without vision exhibit timing (i.e. speed and duration) and variability characteristics which are not well captured by existing computational models. Here, we introduce a stochastic optimal feedforward-feedback control (SFFC) model that can predict the nominal timing and trial-by-trial variability of self-paced arm reaching movements carried out with or without online visual feedback of the hand. In SFFC, movement timing results from the minimization of the intrinsic factors of effort and variance due to constant and signal-dependent motor noise, and movement variability depends on the integration of visual feedback. Reaching arm movements data are used to examine the effect of online vision on movement timing and variability, and test the model. This modelling suggests that the central nervous system predicts the effects of sensorimotor noise to generate an optimal feedforward motor command, and triggers optimal feedback corrections to task-related errors based on the available limb state estimate.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/j0tKNrqoHlE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are the leading platform for the production of biopharmaceuticals with human-like glycosylation. The standard practice for cell line generation relies on trial and error approaches such as adaptive evolution and high-throughput screening, which typically take several months. Metabolic modeling could aid in designing better producer cell lines and thus shorten development times. The genome-scale metabolic model (GSMM) of CHO can accurately predict growth rates. However, in order to predict rational engineering strategies it also needs to accurately predict intracellular fluxes. In this work we evaluated the agreement between the fluxes predicted by parsimonious flux balance analysis (pFBA) using the CHO GSMM and a wide range of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C metabolic flux data from literature. While glycolytic fluxes were predicted relatively well, the fluxes of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were vastly underestimated due to too low energy demand. Inclusion of computationally estimated maintenance energy significantly improved the overall accuracy of intracellular flux predictions. Maintenance energy was therefore determined experimentally by running continuous cultures at different growth rates and evaluating their respective energy consumption. The experimentally and computationally determined maintenance energy were in good agreement. Additionally, we compared alternative objective functions (minimization of uptake rates of seven nonessential metabolites) to the biomass objective. While the predictions of the uptake rates were quite inaccurate for most objectives, the predictions of the intracellular fluxes were comparable to the biomass objective function.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XPTg3xYZeQk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Existing software tools for topology-based pathway enrichment analysis are either computationally inefficient, have undesirable statistical power, or require expert knowledge to leverage the methods’ capabilities. To address these limitations, we have overhauled NetGSA, an existing topology-based method, to provide a computationally-efficient user-friendly tool that offers interactive visualization. Pathway enrichment analysis for thousands of genes can be performed in minutes on a personal computer without sacrificing statistical power. The new software also removes the need for expert knowledge by directly curating gene-gene interaction information from multiple external databases. Lastly, by utilizing the capabilities of Cytoscape, the new software also offers interactive and intuitive network visualization.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sI-LUVLcQJw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Efficient representations of tumor diversity with paired DNA-RNA aberrations</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/5uFgp5U90fw/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Qian Ke, Wikum Dinalankara, Laurent Younes, Donald Geman, Luigi Marchionni&lt;/p&gt;

Cancer cells display massive dysregulation of key regulatory pathways due to now well-catalogued mutations and other DNA-related aberrations. Moreover, enormous heterogeneity has been commonly observed in the identity, frequency and location of these aberrations across individuals with the same cancer type or subtype, and this variation naturally propagates to the transcriptome, resulting in myriad types of dysregulated gene expression programs. Many have argued that a more integrative and quantitative analysis of heterogeneity of DNA and RNA molecular profiles may be necessary for designing more systematic explorations of alternative therapies and improving predictive accuracy. We introduce a representation of multi-&lt;i&gt;omics&lt;/i&gt; profiles which is sufficiently rich to account for observed heterogeneity and support the construction of quantitative, integrated, metrics of variation. Starting from the network of interactions existing in Reactome, we build a library of “paired DNA-RNA aberrations” that represent prototypical and recurrent patterns of dysregulation in cancer; each two-gene “Source-Target Pair” (STP) consists of a “source” regulatory gene and a “target” gene whose expression is plausibly “controlled” by the source gene. The STP is then “aberrant” in a joint DNA-RNA profile if the source gene is DNA-aberrant (&lt;i&gt;e.g&lt;/i&gt;., mutated, deleted, or duplicated), and the downstream target gene is “RNA-aberrant”, meaning its expression level is outside the normal, baseline range. With &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt; STPs, each sample profile has exactly one of the 2&lt;sup&gt;M&lt;/sup&gt; possible configurations. We concentrate on subsets of STPs, and the corresponding reduced configurations, by selecting tissue-dependent minimal coverings, defined as the smallest family of STPs with the property that every sample in the considered population displays at least one aberrant STP within that family. These minimal coverings can be computed with integer programming. Given such a covering, a natural measure of cross-sample diversity is the extent to which the particular aberrant STPs composing a covering vary from sample to sample; this variability is captured by the entropy of the distribution over configurations. We apply this program to data from TCGA for six distinct tumor types (breast, prostate, lung, colon, liver, and kidney cancer). This enables an efficient simplification of the complex landscape observed in cancer populations, resulting in the identification of novel signatures of molecular alterations which are not detected with frequency-based criteria. Estimates of cancer heterogeneity across tumor phenotypes reveals a stable pattern: entropy increases with disease severity. This framework is then well-suited to accommodate the expanding complexity of cancer genomes and epigenomes emerging from large consortia projects.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5uFgp5U90fw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Tonic activity in the levator palpebrae superioris muscle, which holds the upper eyelid open, is interrupted during blinks. Here, we demonstrate a monosynpatic pathway from cells distributed along the rostral edge of the principal trigeminal nucleus that targets, and presumably inhibits, levator motoneurons for blinks triggered from the face.







Abstract
For normal viewing, the eyes are held open by the tonic actions of the levator palpebrae superioris (levator) muscle raising the upper eyelid. This activity is interrupted during blinks, when the eyelid sweeps down to spread the tear film or protect the cornea. We examined the circuit connecting the principal trigeminal nucleus to the levator motoneurons by use of both anterograde and retrograde tracers in macaque monkeys. Injections of anterograde tracer were made into the principal trigeminal nucleus using either a stereotaxic approach or localization following physiological characterization of trigeminal second order neurons. Anterogradely labeled axonal arbors were located both within the caudal central subdivision, which contains levator motoneurons, and in the adjacent supraoculomotor area. Labeled boutons made synaptic contacts on retrogradely labeled levator motoneurons indicating a monosynaptic connection. As the eye is also retracted through the actions of the rectus muscles during a blink, we examined whether these trigeminal injections labeled boutons contacting rectus motoneurons within the oculomotor nucleus. These were not found when the injection sites were confined to the principal trigeminal nucleus region. To identify the source of the projection to the levator motoneurons, we injected retrograde tracer into the oculomotor complex. Retrogradely labeled cells were confined to a narrow, dorsoventrally oriented cell population that lined the rostral edge of the principal trigeminal nucleus. Presumably these cells inhibit levator motoneurons, while other parts of the trigeminal sensory complex are activating orbicularis oculi motoneurons, when a blink is initiated by sensory stimuli contacting the face.</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Guillain‐Barré syndrome variant occurring after SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccination</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26144?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Whilst SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccines are very safe, we report four cases of the bifacial weakness with paraesthesias variant of Guillain‐Barré syndrome (GBS) occurring within three weeks of vaccination with the Oxford‐AstraZeneca SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccine. This rare neurological syndrome has previously been reported in association with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection itself. Our cases were given either intravenous immunoglobulin, oral steroids, or no treatment. We suggest vigilance for cases of bifacial weakness with paraesthesias variant GBS following vaccination for SARS‐CoV‐2 and that post‐vaccination surveillance programs ensure robust data capture of this outcome, to assess for causality.

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26143?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>As of April 22, 2021, around 1.5 million individuals in 3 districts of Kerala, India had been vaccinated with COVID‐19 vaccines. Over 80% of these individuals (1.2 million) received the ChAdOx1‐S/nCoV‐19 vaccine. In this population, during this period of 4 weeks (mid‐March to mid‐April 2021), we observed seven cases of Guillain‐Barre syndrome (GBS) that occurred within two weeks of the first dose of vaccination. All 7 patients developed severe GBS. The frequency of GBS was 1.4 to10 fold higher than that expected in this period for a population of this magnitude. In addition, the frequency of bilateral facial weakness, which typically occurs in &amp;lt;20% of GBS cases, suggests a pattern associated with the vaccination. While the benefits of vaccination substantially outweigh the risk of this relatively rare outcome (5.8 per million), clinicians should be alert to this possible adverse event, as six out of seven patients progressed to areflexic quadriplegia and required mechanical ventilatory support.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: A concise method for feature selection via normalized frequencies. (arXiv:2106.05814v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05814</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Feature selection is an important part of building a machine learning model.
By eliminating redundant or misleading features from data, the machine learning
model can achieve better performance while reducing the demand on com-puting
resources. Metaheuristic algorithms are mostly used to implement feature
selection such as swarm intelligence algorithms and evolutionary algorithms.
However, they suffer from the disadvantage of relative complexity and slowness.
In this paper, a concise method is proposed for universal feature selection.
The proposed method uses a fusion of the filter method and the wrapper method,
rather than a combination of them. In the method, one-hoting encoding is used
to preprocess the dataset, and random forest is utilized as the classifier. The
proposed method uses normalized frequencies to assign a value to each feature,
which will be used to find the optimal feature subset. Furthermore, we propose
a novel approach to exploit the outputs of mutual information, which allows for
a better starting point for the experiments. Two real-world dataset in the
field of intrusion detection were used to evaluate the proposed method. The
evaluation results show that the proposed method outperformed several
state-of-the-art related works in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F-score
and AUC.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05783</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Several studies with brain signals suggested that bottom-up and top-down
influences are exerted through distinct frequency bands among visual cortical
areas. It has been recently shown that theta and gamma rhythms subserve
feedforward, whereas the feedback influence is dominated by the alpha-beta
rhythm in primates. A few theoretical models for reproducing these effects have
been proposed so far. Here we show that a simple but biophysically plausible
two-network motif composed of spiking-neuron models and chemical synapses can
exhibit feedforward and feedback influences through distinct frequency bands.
Differently from previous studies, this kind of model allows us to study
directed influences not only at the population level, by using a proxy for the
local field potential, but also at the cellular level, by using the neuronal
spiking series.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05686</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Realizing the potential of mixed-signal neuromorphic processors for
ultra-low-power inference and learning requires efficient use of their
inhomogeneous analog circuitry as well as sparse, time-based information
encoding and processing. Here, we investigate spike-timing-based spatiotemporal
receptive fields of output-neurons in the Spatiotemporal Correlator (STC)
network, for which we used excitatory-inhibitory balanced disynaptic inputs
instead of dedicated axonal or neuronal delays. We present hardware-in-the-loop
experiments with a mixed-signal DYNAP-SE neuromorphic processor, in which
five-dimensional receptive fields of hardware neurons were mapped by randomly
sampling input spike-patterns from a uniform distribution. We find that, when
the balanced disynaptic elements are randomly programmed, some of the neurons
display distinct receptive fields. Furthermore, we demonstrate how a neuron was
tuned to detect a particular spatiotemporal feature, to which it initially was
non-selective, by activating a different subset of the inhomogeneous analog
synaptic circuits. The energy dissipation of the balanced synaptic elements is
one order of magnitude lower per lateral connection (0.65 nJ vs 9.3 nJ per
spike) than former delay-based neuromorphic hardware implementations. Thus, we
show how the inhomogeneous synaptic circuits could be utilized for
resource-efficient implementation of STC network layers, in a way that enables
synapse-address reprogramming as a discrete mechanism for feature tuning.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Unsupervised Behaviour Discovery with Quality-Diversity Optimisation. (arXiv:2106.05648v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05648</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Quality-Diversity algorithms refer to a class of evolutionary algorithms
designed to find a collection of diverse and high-performing solutions to a
given problem. In robotics, such algorithms can be used for generating a
collection of controllers covering most of the possible behaviours of a robot.
To do so, these algorithms associate a behavioural descriptor to each of these
behaviours. Each behavioural descriptor is used for estimating the novelty of
one behaviour compared to the others. In most existing algorithms, the
behavioural descriptor needs to be hand-coded, thus requiring prior knowledge
about the task to solve. In this paper, we introduce: Autonomous Robots
Realising their Abilities, an algorithm that uses a dimensionality reduction
technique to automatically learn behavioural descriptors based on raw sensory
data. The performance of this algorithm is assessed on three robotic tasks in
simulation. The experimental results show that it performs similarly to
traditional hand-coded approaches without the requirement to provide any
hand-coded behavioural descriptor. In the collection of diverse and
high-performing solutions, it also manages to find behaviours that are novel
with respect to more features than its hand-coded baselines. Finally, we
introduce a variant of the algorithm which is robust to the dimensionality of
the behavioural descriptor space.

	<title>Journal of Neurology: Global survey on disruption and mitigation of neurological services during COVID-19: the perspective of global international neurological patients and scientific associations</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00415-021-10641-3</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has dramatically disrupted healthcare systems. Two rapid WHO pulse surveys studied disruptions in mental health services, but did not particularly focus on neurology. Here, a global survey was conducted and addresses the impact of the pandemic on neurology services.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A cross-sectional study was carried out in which 34 international neurological associations were asked to distribute the survey to national associations. The responses represented the national situation, in November–December 2020, with regard to the main disrupted neurological services, reasons and the mitigation strategies implemented as well as the disruption on training of residents and on neurological research. A comparison with the situation in February–April 2020, first pandemic wave, was also requested.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Findings&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;54 completed surveys came from 43 countries covering all the 6 WHO regions. Overall, neurological services disruption was reported as mild by 26%, moderate by 30%, complete by 13% of associations. The most affected services were cross-sectoral neurological services (57%) and neurorehabilitation (56%). The second wave of the pandemic, however, was associated with the improvement of service provision for diagnostics services (44%) and for neurorehabilitation (41%). Governmental directives were the major cause of services’ disruption (56%). Mitigation strategies were mostly established through telemedicine (48%). Almost half of respondents reported a significant impact on neurological research (48%) and educational activities (60%). Most associations (67%) were not involved in decision making for neurological patients’ issues by their national government.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic affects neurological services and raises the universal need for the development of neurological health care at the policy, systems and services levels. A global national plan on mitigation strategies for disruption of neurological services during pandemic situations should be established and neurological scientific and patients associations should get involved in decision making.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Eye movement influences on coupled and decoupled eye-hand coordination tasks</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00221-021-06138-0</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Visually guided reaching precision and accuracy depend on the level of coupling between movements of the eyes and hand. In the present study, participants performed central fixations and either saccadic or smooth pursuit eye movements during fast and accurate reaching tasks involving eye–hand coupling and decoupling to better understand type of eye movement influence over upper limb control. Some eye–hand coupling and decoupling tasks also included hand reversals, where the hand moves away from the target to direct a cursor toward the target to account for various levels of hand–cursor and eye–cursor coupling. Regardless of eye-movement type, eye–hand–cursor coupling produced an endpoint accuracy advantage over decoupling. Use of hand reversal decreased peak speed and increased response time of the hand, whether considering fixation or a given eye movement. Use of smooth pursuit slowed hand movements relative to saccades, yet improved endpoint accuracy. Compared to central fixations, using smooth pursuit also slowed hand movements, while using saccades decreased, thus improved, hand reaction times. Data suggest an advantage, when using smooth pursuit to track the hand movement for the greatest endpoint accuracy, an advantage when using saccades for the fastest movements, and an eye–hand coupling advantage when using saccades for the shortest reactions. Researchers should provide clear eye-movement instructions for participants and/or monitor the eyes when assessing similar upper limb control to account for possible differences in eye movements used. Moreover, the type of eye movement chosen for participants should correspond to the primary goal of the task.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Perception of Social Odor and Gender-Related Differences Investigated Through the Use of Transfer Entropy and Embodied Medium</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.650528</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The perception of putative pheromones or social odors (PPSO) in humans is a widely debated topic because the published results seem ambiguous. Our research aimed to evaluate how cross-modal processing of PPSO and gender voice can affect the behavioral and psychophysiological states of the subject during a listening task with a bodily contact medium, and how these effects could be gender related. Before the experimental session, three embodied media, were exposed to volatilized estratetraenol (Estr), 5α-androst-16-en-3 α-ol (Andr), and Vaseline oil. The experimental session consisted in listening to a story that were transmitted, with a male or female voice, by the communicative medium via a Bluetooth system during a listening task, recorded through 64-active channel electroencephalography (EEG). The sense of co-presence and social presence, elicited by the medium, showed how the established relationship with the medium was gender dependent and modulated by the PPSO. In particular, Andr induced greater responses related to co-presence. The gender of the participants was related to the co-presence desire, where women imagined higher medium co-presence than men. EEG findings seemed to be more responsive to the PPSO–gender voice interaction, than behavioral results. The mismatch between female PPSO and male voice elicited the greatest cortical flow of information. In the case of the Andr–male voice condition, the trained model appeared to assign more relevance to the flow of information to the right frontotemporal regions (involved in odor recognition memory and social behavior). The Estr–male voice condition showed activation of the bilateral frontoparietal network, which is linked to cognitive control, cognitive flexibility, and auditory consciousness. The model appears to distinguish the dissonance condition linked to Andr matched with a female voice: it highlights a flow of information to the right occipital lobe and to the frontal pole. The PPSO could influence the co-presence judgements and EEG response. The results seem suggest that could be an implicit pattern linked to PPSO-related gender differences and gender voice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Gene Dosage- and Age-Dependent Differential Transcriptomic Changes in the Prefrontal Cortex of Shank2-Mutant Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.683196</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Shank2 is an abundant postsynaptic scaffolding protein that is known to regulate excitatory synapse assembly and synaptic transmission and has been implicated in various neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Previous studies on Shank2-mutant mice provided mechanistic insights into their autistic-like phenotypes, but it remains unclear how transcriptomic patterns are changed in brain regions of the mutant mice in age- and gene dosage-dependent manners. To this end, we performed RNA-Seq analyses of the transcripts from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of heterozygous and homozygous Shank2-mutant mice lacking exons 6 and 7 at juvenile (week 3) and adult (week 12) stages. Juvenile heterozygous Shank2-mutant mice showed upregulation of glutamate synapse-related genes, downregulation of ribosomal and mitochondrial genes, and transcriptomic changes that are opposite to those observed in ASD (anti-ASD) such as upregulation of ASD_down (downregulated in ASD), GABA neuron-related, and oligodendrocyte-related genes. Juvenile homozygous Shank2 mice showed upregulation of chromatin-related genes and transcriptomic changes that are in line with those occurring in ASD (pro-ASD) such as downregulation of ASD_down, GABA neuron-related, and oligodendrocyte-related genes. Adult heterozygous and homozygous Shank2-mutant mice both exhibited downregulation of ribosomal and mitochondrial genes and pro-ASD transcriptomic changes. Therefore, the gene dosage- and age-dependent effects of Shank2 deletions in mice include differential transcriptomic changes across distinct functional contexts, including synapses, chromatin, ribosomes, mitochondria, GABA neurons, and oligodendrocytes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Whole-Brain Imaging of Subvoxel T1-Diffusion Correlation Spectra in Human Subjects</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.671465</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;T1 relaxation and water mobility generate eloquent MRI tissue contrasts with great diagnostic value in many neuroradiological applications. However, conventional methods do not adequately quantify the microscopic heterogeneity of these important biophysical properties within a voxel, and therefore have limited biological specificity. We describe a new correlation spectroscopic (CS) MRI method for measuring how T1 and mean diffusivity (MD) co-vary in microscopic tissue environments. We develop a clinical pulse sequence that combines inversion recovery (IR) with single-shot isotropic diffusion encoding (IDE) to efficiently acquire whole-brain MRIs with a wide range of joint T1-MD weightings. Unlike conventional diffusion encoding, the IDE preparation ensures that all subvoxel water pools are weighted by their MDs regardless of the sizes, shapes, and orientations of their corresponding microscopic diffusion tensors. Accordingly, IR-IDE measurements are well-suited for model-free, quantitative spectroscopic analysis of microscopic water pools. Using numerical simulations, phantom experiments, and data from healthy volunteers we demonstrate how IR-IDE MRIs can be processed to reconstruct maps of two-dimensional joint probability density functions, i.e., correlation spectra, of subvoxel T1-MD values. In vivo T1-MD spectra show distinct cerebrospinal fluid and parenchymal tissue components specific to white matter, cortical gray matter, basal ganglia, and myelinated fiber pathways, suggesting the potential for improved biological specificity. The one-dimensional marginal distributions derived from the T1-MD correlation spectra agree well with results from other relaxation spectroscopic and quantitative MRI studies, validating the T1-MD contrast encoding and the spectral reconstruction. Mapping subvoxel T1-diffusion correlations in patient populations may provide a more nuanced, comprehensive, sensitive, and specific neuroradiological assessment of the non-specific changes seen on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and diffusion-weighted MRIs (DWIs) in cancer, ischemic stroke, or brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Deep Brain Stimulation Complications in Patients With Parkinson’s Disease and Surgical Modifications: A Single-Center Retrospective Analysis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.684895</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;As a complication-prone operation, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has become the first-line surgical approach for patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease (PD). This study aimed to evaluate the incidence and risk factors of DBS-associated complications.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We have reviewed a consecutive series of patients with PD undergoing DBS procedures to describe the type, severity, management, and outcome of postoperative complications from January 2011 to December 2018. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify statistically significant risk factors. We also described our surgical strategies to minimize the adverse events.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;A total of 225 patients underwent 229 DBS implantation procedures (440 electrodes), of whom 20 patients experienced 23 DBS-associated complications, including ten operation-related complications and 13 hardware-related ones. Univariate analysis elucidated that comorbid medical conditions (P = 0.024), hypertension (P = 0.003), early-stage operation (P &amp;lt; 0.001), and unilateral electrode implantation (P = 0.029) as risk factors for overall complications, or more specifically, operation-related complications demonstrated in the stratified analysis. In contrast, no risk factor for hardware-related complications was identified. Statistical significances of hypertension (OR = 3.33, 95% CI: 1.14–9.71, P = 0.027) and early-stage (OR = 11.04, 95% CI: 2.42–50.45, P = 0.002) were further validated via multivariate analysis. As the annual number of DBS procedures increased, the incidence of complications gradually decreased (R = −0.699, P &amp;lt; 0.01). Additionally, there was a strong correlation between surgical complications and unplanned readmission (R = 0.730, P &amp;lt; 0.01).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The importance of cumulative experience and relevant technique modifications should be addressed to prevent DBS-associated complications and unplanned readmission.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Intermodal Priming of Cognitive Conflict? A Failed Replication of Mager et al. (2009)</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.680885</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: The present study was conducted to verify a promising experimental setup which demonstrated an inversed Stroop-effect (much faster responses for incongruent relative to congruent Stroop trials) following a mismatching tone. In the matching condition, which was an almost exact replication of the original study, participants were required to indicate whether word color and word meaning were matching, whereas in the response conflict condition, instruction was the same as in a classical Stroop task and required the participants to respond to the word color. As in the original study, each trial was preceded by a sine tone which was deviant in pitch in 20% of the trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The main result was that the Stroop effect was not inversed after deviant tones, neither under the matching task instruction nor under the response conflict task instruction. The Stroop effect was unaffected by the previous “conceptual mismatch.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The current study failed to replicate the astonishing concept of “conflict priming” reported in previous work and does not open the doors for a new window on sequences of conflicts. Nevertheless, the failed replication is valuable for future research, since it demonstrated that “Conflict Priming” as a facilitation of processing of conflict trials following deviant tones, is not an confirmed finding.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Oscillatory Correlates of Selective Restudy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.679823</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Prior behavioral work has shown that selective restudy of some studied items leaves recall of the other studied items unaffected when lag between study and restudy is short, but improves recall of the other items when lag is prolonged. The beneficial effect has been attributed to context retrieval, assuming that selective restudy reactivates the context at study and thus provides a retrieval cue for the other items (Bäuml, 2019). Here the results of two experiments are reported, in each of which subjects studied a list of items and then, after a short 2-min or a prolonged 10-min lag, restudied some of the list items. Participants' electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded during both the study and restudy phases. In Experiment 2, but not in Experiment 1, subjects engaged in a mental context reinstatement task immediately before the restudy phase started, trying to mentally reinstate the study context. Results of Experiment 1 revealed a theta/alpha power increase from study to restudy after short lag and an alpha/beta power decrease after long lag. Engagement in the mental context reinstatement task in Experiment 2 eliminated the decrease in alpha/beta power. The results are consistent with the view that the observed alpha/beta decrease reflects context retrieval, which became obsolete when there was preceding mental context reinstatement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Not Just a Pot: Visual Episodic Memory in Cannabis Users and Polydrug Cannabis Users: ROC and ERP Preliminary Investigation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.677793</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background While research has consistently identified an association between long-term cannabis use and memory impairments, few studies have examined this relationship in a polydrug context (i.e., when combining cannabis with other substances).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aims: In this preliminary study, we used event-related potentials to examine the recognition process in a visual episodic memory task in cannabis users (CU) and cannabis polydrug users (PU). We hypothesized that CU and PU will have both–behavioral and psychophysiological–indicators of memory processes affected, compared to matched non-using controls with the PU expressing more severe changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods 29 non-using controls (CG), 24 CU and 27 PU were enrolled into the study. All participants completed a visual learning recognition task while brain electrical activity was recorded. Event-related potentials were calculated for familiar (old) and new images from a signal recorded during a subsequent recognition test. We used receiver operating characteristic curves for behavioral data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results The groups did not differ in memory performance based on receiver operating characteristic method in accuracy and discriminability indicators nor mean reaction times for old/new images. The frontal old/new effect expected from prior research was observed for all participants, while a parietal old/new effect was not observed. While, the significant differences in the late parietal component (LPC) amplitude was observed between CG and PU but not between CG and CU nor CU and PU. Linear regression analysis was used to examine the mean amplitude of the LPC component as a predictor of memory performance accuracy indicator. LPC amplitude predicts recognition accuracy only in the CG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion The results showed alterations in recognition memory processing in CU and PU groups compared to CG, which were not manifested on the behavioral level, and were the most prominent in cannabis polydrug users. We interpret it as a manifestation of the cumulative effect of multiple drug usage in the PU group.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Enhanced Visual Feedback Using Immersive VR Affects Decision Making Regarding Hand Use With a Simulated Impaired Limb</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.677578</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The long-term effects of impairment have a negative impact on the quality of life of stroke patients in terms of not using the affected limb even after some recovery (i.e., learned non-use). Immersive virtual reality (IVR) has been introduced as a new approach for the treatment of stroke rehabilitation. We propose an IVR-based therapeutic approach to incorporate positive reinforcement components in motor coordination as opposed to constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT). This study aimed to investigate the effect of IVR-reinforced physical therapy that incorporates positive reinforcement components in motor coordination. To simulate affected upper limb function loss in patients, a wrist weight was attached to the dominant hand of participant. Participants were asked to choose their right or left hand to reach toward a randomly allocated target. The movement of the virtual image of the upper limb was reinforced by visual feedback to participants, that is, the participants perceived their motor coordination as if their upper limb was moving to a greater degree than what was occurring in everyday life. We found that the use of the simulated affected limb was increased after the visual feedback enhancement intervention, and importantly, the effect was maintained even after gradual withdrawal of the visual amplification. The results suggest that positive reinforcement within the IVR could induce an effect on decision making in hand usage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Disrupted Spontaneous Neural Activity in Patients With Thyroid-Associated Ophthalmopathy: A Resting-State fMRI Study Using Amplitude of Low-Frequency Fluctuation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.676967</link>
	<content:encoded>Purpose&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the study was to investigate the brain functional alteration in patients with thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) by evaluating the spontaneous neural activity changes using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) with the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) method.&lt;/p&gt;Materials and Methods&lt;p&gt;The rs-fMRI data of 30 TAO patients (15 active and 15 inactive) and 15 healthy controls (HCs) were included for analyses. The ALFF values were calculated and compared among groups. Correlations between ALFF values and clinical metrics were assessed.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Compared with HCs, active TAOs showed significantly decreased ALFF values in the left middle occipital gyrus, superior occipital gyrus, and cuneus. Compared with inactive TAOs, active TAOs showed significantly increased ALFF values in the bilateral precuneus. Additionally, inactive TAOs showed significantly decreased ALFF values in the left middle occipital gyrus, superior occipital gyrus, cuneus, and bilateral precuneus than HCs. The ALFF value in the right precuneus of TAOs was positively correlated with clinical activity score (r = 0.583, P &amp;lt; 0.001) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score (r = 0.377, P = 0.040), and negatively correlated with disease duration (r = −0.382, P = 0.037). Moreover, the ALFF value in the left middle occipital gyrus of TAOs was positively correlated with visual acuity (r = 0.441, P = 0.015).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;TAO patients had altered spontaneous brain activities in the left occipital lobe and bilateral precuneus. The neuropsychological aspect of the disease should be noticed during clinical diagnosis and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Physical Activity as a Treatment for Social Anxiety in Clinical and Non-clinical Populations: A Systematic Review and Three Meta-Analyses for Different Study Designs</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.653108</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The fear of being in the focus of attention in social situations can develop into a social anxiety disorder (SAD). The classical treatment for SAD is cognitive behavioral therapy, which is in many cases accompanied by drug treatments. A promising alternative treatment is physical activity (PA) interventions, because regular PA has been shown to be suitable for reducing anxiety in general. We conducted a pre-registered systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO registration no. CRD42020191181) as well as two additional searches. Our aim was to investigate whether PA interventions are a suitable treatment for SAD and whether PA is suitable for reducing social anxiety (SA) in general. For studies with randomized controlled trial designs, a not statistically significant effect of medium size toward lower general SA symptomatology was found in the PA group in comparison with the control group (d = −0.24, p = 0.377). For studies with longitudinal designs, significantly lower SA symptoms were found after PA treatments (d = −0.22, p = 0.001). The effect of PA on SA was stronger for adults than for children and adolescents (p = 0.003). For cross-sectional studies, a small negative association between SA symptoms and the amount of PA was found, i.e., lower SA was found for people who were more physically active (r = −0.12, p = 0.003). We conclude that PA is a promising means for the (additional) treatment of SAD or to reduce SA in general in non-clinical samples, but more research in which high-quality studies with randomized controlled trial designs are used is needed. Furthermore, open questions with respect to moderating variables (e.g., age, sex, BMI, type of intervention, stress, amount of regular PA before the intervention, and comorbidities) remain still open.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Automatic but Flexible and Content-Dependent Nature of Syntax</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.651158</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Syntactic processing has often been considered an utmost example of unconscious automatic processing. In this line, it has been demonstrated that masked words containing syntactic anomalies are processed by our brain triggering event related potential (ERP) components similar to the ones triggered by conscious syntactic anomalies, thus supporting the automatic nature of the syntactic processing. Conversely, recent evidence also points out that regardless of the level of awareness, emotional information and other relevant extralinguistic information modulate conscious syntactic processing too. These results are also in line with suggestions that, under certain circumstances, syntactic processing could also be flexible and context-dependent. However, the study of the concomitant automatic but flexible conception of syntactic parsing is very scarce. Hence, to this aim, we examined whether and how masked emotional words (positive, negative, and neutral masked adjectives) containing morphosyntactic anomalies (half of the cases) affect linguistic comprehension of an ongoing unmasked sentence that also can contain a number agreement anomaly between the noun and the verb. ERP components were observed to emotional information (EPN), masked anomalies (LAN and a weak P600), and unmasked ones (LAN/N400 and P600). Furthermore, interactions in the processing of conscious and unconscious morphosyntactic anomalies and between unconscious emotional information and conscious anomalies were detected. The findings support, on the one hand, the automatic nature of syntax, given that syntactic components LAN and P600 were observed to unconscious anomalies. On the other hand, the flexible, permeable, and context-dependent nature of the syntactic processing is also supported, since unconscious information modulated conscious syntactic components. This double nature of syntactic processing is in line with theories of automaticity, suggesting that even unconscious/automatic, syntactic processing is flexible, adaptable, and context-dependent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Local Functional MR Change Pattern and Its Association With Cognitive Function in Objectively-Defined Subtle Cognitive Decline</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.684918</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: To identify individuals with preclinical cognitive impairment, researchers proposed the concept of objectively-defined subtle cognitive decline (Obj-SCD). However, it is not clear whether Obj-SCD has characteristic brain function changes. In this study, we aimed at exploring the changing pattern of brain function activity in Obj-SCD individuals and the similarities and differences with mild cognitive impairments (MCI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: 37 healthy control individuals, 25 Obj-SCD individuals (with the impairment in memory and language domain), and 28 aMCI individuals were included. Resting-state fMRI and neuropsychological tests were performed. fALFF was used to reflect the local functional activity and compared between groups. Finally, we analyzed the correlation between the fALFF values of significantly changed regions and neuropsychological performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We found similar functional activity enhancements in some local brain regions in the Obj-SCD and aMCI groups, including the left orbital part of the inferior frontal gyrus and the left median cingulate and paracingulate gyri. However, some changes in local functional activities of the Obj-SCD group showed different patterns from the aMCI group. Compared with healthy control (HC), the Obj-SCD group showed increased local functional activity in the right middle occipital gyrus, decreased local functional activity in the left precuneus and the left inferior temporal gyrus. In the Obj-SCD group, in normal band, the fALFF value of the right middle occipital gyrus was significantly negatively correlated with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score (r = −0.450, p = 0.024) and Animal Verbal Fluency Test (AFT) score (r = −0.402, p = 0.046); the left inferior temporal gyrus was significantly positively correlated with MMSE score (r = 0.588, p = 0.002). In slow-4 band, the fALFF value of the left precuneus was significantly positively correlated with MMSE score (r = 0.468, p = 0.018) and AFT score (r = 0.600, p = 0.002). In the aMCI group, the fALFF value of the left orbital part of the inferior frontal gyrus was significantly positively correlated with Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) long delay cued recall score (r = 0.506, p = 0.006).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The Obj-SCD group showed a unique changing pattern; the functional changes of different brain regions have a close but different correlation with cognitive impairment, indicating that there may be a complex pathological basis inside. This suggests that Obj-SCD may be a separate stage of cognitive decline before aMCI and is helpful to the study of preclinical cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Unfolded Protein Response in Immune Cells as an Emerging Regulator of Neuroinflammation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.682633</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Immune surveillance is an essential process that safeguards the homeostasis of a healthy brain. Among the increasing diversity of immune cells present in the central nervous system (CNS), microglia have emerged as a prominent leukocyte subset with key roles in the support of brain function and in the control of neuroinflammation. In fact, impaired microglial function is associated with the development of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). Interestingly, these pathologies are also typified by protein aggregation and proteostasis dysfunction at the level of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These processes trigger activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), which is a conserved signaling network that maintains the fidelity of the cellular proteome. Remarkably, beyond its role in protein folding, the UPR has also emerged as a key regulator of the development and function of immune cells. However, despite this evidence, the contribution of the UPR to immune cell homeostasis, immune surveillance, and neuro-inflammatory processes remains largely unexplored. In this review, we discuss the potential contribution of the UPR in brain-associated immune cells in the context of neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Subjective Cognitive Decline May Be Associated With Post-operative Delirium in Patients Undergoing Total Hip Replacement: The PNDABLE Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.680672</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is associated with an increased risk of clinical cognitive disorders. Post-operative delirium (POD) is a common complication after total hip replacement. We aimed to investigate the relationship between SCD and POD in patients undergoing total hip replacement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Our study recruited 214 cognitively intact individuals from the Perioperative Neurocognitive Disorder And Biomarker Lifestyle (PNDABLE) study in the final analysis. SCD was diagnosed with Subjective Cognitive Decline Scale (SCDS), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The incidence of POD was evaluated by using Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), and POD severity was measured by using the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS). Preoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ40, Aβ42, T-tau, and P-tau levels were measured by enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Overall, the incidence of POD was 26.64% (57/214), including 32.43% (36/111) in the SCD group and 20.39% (21/103) in the NC group. With the increase of age, the incidence of POD in all age groups increased (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that after adjusting for SCD, Aβ42, Aβ40, P-tau, and T-tau, SCD (OR 2.32, CI 1.18–4.55, P = 0.01) and the increased CSF level of P-tau (OR 1.04, CI 1.01–1.06, P &amp;lt; 0.001) were risk factors for POD, while the level of aβ42 (OR 0.99, CI 0.99–1.00, P &amp;lt; 0.001) was a protective factor for POD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: SCD is one of the preoperative risk factors for POD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration: This study was registered at China Clinical Trial Registry (Chictr200033439).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Analysis of Age-Dependent Alterations in Excitability Properties of CA1 Pyramidal Neurons in an APPPS1 Model of Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.668948</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Age-dependent accumulation of amyloid-β, provoking increasing brain amyloidopathy, triggers abnormal patterns of neuron activity and circuit synchronization in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) as observed in human AD patients and AD mouse models. Recent studies on AD mouse models, mimicking this age-dependent amyloidopathy, identified alterations in CA1 neuron excitability. However, these models generally also overexpress mutated amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 (PS1) and there is a lack of a clear correlation of neuronal excitability alterations with progressive amyloidopathy. The active development of computational models of AD points out the need of collecting such experimental data to build a reliable disease model exhibiting AD-like disease progression. We therefore used the feature extraction tool of the Human Brain Project (HBP) Brain Simulation Platform to systematically analyze the excitability profile of CA1 pyramidal neuron in the APPPS1 mouse model. We identified specific features of neuron excitability that best correlate either with over-expression of mutated APP and PS1 or increasing Aβ amyloidopathy. Notably, we report strong alterations in membrane time constant and action potential width and weak alterations in firing behavior. Also, using a CA1 pyramidal neuron model, we evidence amyloidopathy-dependent alterations in I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;. Finally, cluster analysis of these recordings showed that we could reliably assign a trace to its correct group, opening the door to a more refined, less variable analysis of AD-affected neurons. This inter-disciplinary analysis, bringing together experimentalists and modelers, helps to further unravel the neuronal mechanisms most affected by AD and to build a biologically plausible computational model of the AD brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.667608</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aging affects the vestibular system and may disturb the perception of verticality and lead to increased visual dependence (VD). Studies have identified that abnormal upright perception influences the risk of falling. The aim of our study was to evaluate subjective visual vertical (SVV) and VD using a mobile virtual reality-based system for SVV assessment (VIRVEST) in older adults with falls and evaluate its relationship with clinical balance assessment tools, dizziness, mental state, and depression level. This study included 37 adults &amp;gt;65 years who experienced falls and 40 non-faller age-matched controls. Three tests were performed using the VIRVEST system: a static SVV, dynamic SVV with clockwise and counter-clockwise background stimulus motion. VD was calculated as the mean of absolute values of the rod tilt from each trial of dynamic SVV minus the mean static SVV rod tilt. Older adults who experienced falls manifested significantly larger biases in static SVV (p = 0.012), dynamic SVV (p &amp;lt; 0.001), and VD (p = 0.014) than controls. The increase in static SVV (odds ratio = 1.365, p = 0.023), dynamic SVV (odds ratio = 1.623, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and VD (odds ratio = 1.460, p = 0.010) tilt by one degree significantly related to falls risk in the faller group. Fallers who had a high risk of falling according to the Tinetti test exhibited significantly higher tilts of dynamic SVV than those who had a low or medium risk (p = 0.037). In the faller group, the increase of the dynamic SVV tilt by one degree was significantly related to falls risk according to the Tinetti test (odds ratio = 1.356, p = 0.049). SVV errors, particularly with the dynamic SVV test (i.e., greater VD) were associated with an increased risk of falling in the faller group. The VIRVEST system may be applicable in clinical settings for SVV testing and predicting falls in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Cholesterol levels have been associated with age-related cognitive decline, however, such an association has not been comprehensively explored in people with Parkinson’s disease (PD). To address this uncertainty, the current cross-sectional study examined the cholesterol profile and cognitive performance in a cohort of PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Cognitive function was evaluated using two validated assessments (ACE-R and SCOPA-COG) in 182 people with PD from the Australian Parkinson’s Disease Registry. Total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and Triglyceride (TRG) levels were examined within this cohort. The influence of individual lipid subfractions on domain-specific cognitive performance was investigated using covariate-adjusted generalised linear models.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Females with PD exhibited significantly higher lipid subfraction levels (TC, HDL, and LDL) when compared to male counterparts. While accounting for covariates, HDL levels were strongly associated with poorer performance across multiple cognitive domains in females but not males. Conversely, TC and LDL levels were not associated with cognitive status in people with PD.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Higher serum HDL associates with poorer cognitive function in females with PD and presents a sex-specific biomarker for cognitive impairment in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Sleep in Older Adults and Its Possible Relations With COVID-19</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.647875</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, older adults have been found to be a highly vulnerable group, with a higher prevalence of severe cases and negative outcomes. Research has focused on the reasons why older adults are at greater risk; Sleep-related factors have been suggested as one possible explanation for this. An individual’s sleep pattern undergoes significant changes over the course of their life. In older adults a specific sleep profile can be observed, one characterized by advanced sleep timing, a morningness preference, longer sleep-onset latency, shorter overall sleep duration, increased sleep fragmentation, reduced slow-wave sleep and, increased wake time after sleep onset. Additionally, an increased prevalence of sleep disorders can be observed, such as obstructive sleep apnea and insomnia. Previous research has already linked sleep disorders (especially sleep apnea) with COVID-19, but few studies have focused specifically on the older population. We believe that the intrinsic sleep patterns of older adults, and the prevalence of sleep disorders in this population, may be important factors that could explain why they are at a greater risk of negative COVID-19 outcomes. In this review, we discuss the relationship between sleep and COVID-19 among older adults, focusing on three different aspects: (1) Sleep-related issues that might increase the likelihood of getting infected by SARS-COV-2; (2) Sleep disturbances that might increase the predisposition to worse COVID-19 prognosis and outcomes; and (3) COVID-19-related aspects affecting community-dwelling older adults, such as social isolation, quarantine, and home confinement, among others, that might impact sleep.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tinnitus can be a burdensome condition on both individual and societal levels. Many aspects of this condition remain elusive, including its underlying mechanisms, ultimately hindering the development of a cure. Interdisciplinary approaches are required to overcome long-established research challenges. This review summarizes current knowledge in various tinnitus-relevant research fields including tinnitus generating mechanisms, heterogeneity, epidemiology, assessment, and treatment development, in an effort to highlight the main challenges and provide suggestions for future research to overcome them. Four common themes across different areas were identified as future research direction: (1) Further establishment of multicenter and multidisciplinary collaborations; (2) Systematic reviews and syntheses of existing knowledge; (3) Standardization of research methods including tinnitus assessment, data acquisition, and data analysis protocols; (4) The design of studies with large sample sizes and the creation of large tinnitus-specific databases that would allow in-depth exploration of tinnitus heterogeneity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Correlation Between Gait and Near-Infrared Brain Functional Connectivity Under Cognitive Tasks in Elderly Subjects With Mild Cognitive Impairment</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.482447</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have a high risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. Gait performance is a potential clinical marker for the progression of MCI into dementia. However, the relationship between gait and brain functional connectivity (FC) in older adults with MCI remains unclear. Forty-five subjects [MCI group, n = 23; healthy control (HC) group, n = 22] were recruited. Each subject performed a walking task (Task 01), counting backward–walking task (Task 02), naming animals–walking task (Task 03), and calculating–walking task (Task 04). The gait parameters and cerebral oxygenation signals from the left prefrontal cortex (LPFC), right prefrontal cortex (RPFC), left motor cortex (LMC), right motor cortex (RMC), left occipital leaf cortex (LOL), and right occipital leaf cortex (ROL) were obtained simultaneously. Wavelet phase coherence was calculated in two frequency intervals: low frequency (interval I, 0.052–0.145 Hz) and very low frequency (interval II, 0.021–0.052 Hz). Results showed that the FC of RPFC–RMC is significantly lower in interval I in Task 03 compared with that in Task 02 in the MCI group (p = 0.001). Also, the right relative symmetry index (IDpsR) is significantly lower in Task 03 compared with that in Task 02 (p = 0.000). The IDpsR is positively correlated with the FC of RPFC–RMC in interval I in the MCI group (R = 0.205, p = 0.041). The gait symmetry such as left relative symmetry index (IDpsL) and IDpsR is significantly lower in the dual-task (DT) situation compared with the single task in the two groups (p &amp;lt; 0.05). The results suggested that the IDpsR might reflect abnormal change in FC of RPFC–RMC in interval I in the MCI population during Task 03. The gait symmetry is affected by DTs in both groups. The findings of this study may have a pivotal role in the early monitoring and intervention of brain dysfunction among older adults with MCI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Locating Macromolecular Assemblies in Cells by 2D Template Matching with cisTEM</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/68946</link>
	<content:encoded>For a more complete understanding of molecular mechanisms, it is important to study macromolecules and their assemblies in the broader context of the cell. This context can be visualized at nanometer resolution in three dimensions (3D) using electron cryo-tomography, which requires tilt series to be recorded and computationally aligned, currently limiting throughput. Additionally, the high-resolution signal preserved in the raw tomograms is currently limited by a number of technical difficulties, leading to an increased false-positive detection rate when using 3D template matching to find molecular complexes in tomograms. We have recently described a 2D template matching approach that addresses these issues by including high-resolution signal preserved in single-tilt images. A current limitation of this approach is the high computational cost that limits throughput. We describe here a GPU-accelerated implementation of 2D template matching in the image processing software &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;TEM that allows for easy scaling and improves the accessibility of this approach. We apply 2D template matching to identify ribosomes in images of frozen-hydrated &lt;i&gt;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; cells with high precision and sensitivity, demonstrating that this is a versatile tool for &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; visual proteomics and &lt;i&gt;in situ &lt;/i&gt;structure determination. We benchmark the results with 3D template matching of tomograms acquired on identical sample locations and identify strengths and weaknesses of both techniques, which offer complementary information about target localization and identity.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/68424</link>
	<content:encoded>How cells tune the size of their subcellular parts to scale with cell size is a fundamental question in cell biology. Until now, most studies on the size control of organelles and other subcellular structures have focused on scaling relationships with cell volume, which can be explained by limiting pool mechanisms. Here, we uncover a distinct scaling relationship with cell length rather than volume, revealed by mathematical modeling and quantitative imaging of yeast actin cables. The extension rate of cables decelerates as they approach the rear of the cell, until cable length matches cell length. Further, the deceleration rate scales with cell length. These observations are quantitatively explained by a 'balance-point' model, which stands in contrast to the limiting pool mechanisms and that senses the linear dimensions of the cell.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>During HIV-1 particle formation, the requisite plasma membrane curvature is thought to be solely driven by the retroviral Gag protein. Here, we reveal that the cellular I-BAR protein IRSp53 is required for the progression of HIV-1 membrane curvature to complete particle assembly. SiRNA-mediated knockdown of IRSp53 gene expression induces a decrease in viral particle production and a viral bud arrest at half completion. Single molecule localization microscopy at the cell plasma membrane shows a preferential localization of IRSp53 around HIV-1 Gag assembly sites. In addition, we observe the presence of IRSp53 in purified HIV-1 particles. Finally, HIV-1 Gag protein preferentially localizes to curved membranes induced by IRSp53 I-BAR domain on giant unilamellar vesicles. Overall, our data reveal a strong interplay between IRSp53 I-BAR and Gag at membranes during virus assembly. This highlights IRSp53 as a crucial host factor in HIV-1 membrane curvature and its requirement for full HIV-1 particle assembly.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66222</link>
	<content:encoded>Transcoelomic spread of cancer cells across the peritoneal cavity occurs in most initially diagnosed ovarian cancer (OC) patients and accounts for most cancer-related death. However, how OC cells interact with peritoneal stromal cells to evade the immune surveillance remains largely unexplored. Here, through an in vivo genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen, we identified IL20RA, which decreased dramatically in OC patients during peritoneal metastasis, as a key factor preventing the transcoelomic metastasis of OC. Reconstitution of IL20RA in highly metastatic OC cells greatly suppresses the transcoelomic metastasis. OC cells, when disseminate into the peritoneal cavity, greatly induce peritoneum mesothelial cells to express IL-20 and IL-24, which in turn activate the IL20RA downstream signaling in OC cells to produce mature IL-18, eventually resulting in the polarization of macrophages into the M1-like subtype to clear the cancer cells. Thus, we show an IL-20/IL20RA-mediated crosstalk between OC and mesothelial cells that supports a metastasis-repressing immune microenvironment.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: An in vivo reporter for tracking lipid droplet dynamics in transparent zebrafish</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64744</link>
	<content:encoded>Lipid droplets are lipid storage organelles found in nearly all cell types from adipocytes to cancer cells. Although increasingly implicated in disease, current methods to study lipid droplets in vertebrate models rely on static imaging or the use of fluorescent dyes, limiting investigation of their rapid in vivo dynamics. To address this, we created a lipid droplet transgenic reporter in whole animals and cell culture by fusing tdTOMATO to Perilipin-2 (PLIN2), a lipid droplet structural protein. Expression of this transgene in transparent &lt;i&gt;casper&lt;/i&gt; zebrafish enabled in vivo imaging of adipose depots responsive to nutrient deprivation and high-fat diet. Simultaneously, we performed a large-scale in vitro chemical screen of 1280 compounds and identified several novel regulators of lipolysis in adipocytes. Using our &lt;i&gt;Tg(-3.5ubb:plin2-tdTomato)&lt;/i&gt; zebrafish line, we validated several of these novel regulators and revealed an unexpected role for nitric oxide in modulating adipocyte lipid droplets. Similarly, we expressed the PLIN2-tdTOMATO transgene in melanoma cells and found that the nitric oxide pathway also regulated lipid droplets in cancer. This model offers a tractable imaging platform to study lipid droplets across cell types and disease contexts using chemical, dietary, or genetic perturbations.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64592</link>
	<content:encoded>Maintenance of cell size homeostasis is a property that is conserved throughout eukaryotes. Cell size homeostasis is brought about by the co-ordination of cell division with cell growth, and requires restriction of smaller cells from undergoing mitosis and cell division, whilst allowing larger cells to do so. Cyclin-CDK is the fundamental driver of mitosis and therefore ultimately ensures size homeostasis. Here we dissect determinants of CDK activity &lt;i&gt;in vivo &lt;/i&gt;to investigate how cell size information is processed by the cell cycle network in fission yeast. We develop a high-throughput single-cell assay system of CDK activity &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and show that inhibitory tyrosine phosphorylation of CDK encodes cell size information, with the phosphatase PP2A aiding to set a size threshold for division. CDK inhibitory phosphorylation works synergistically with PP2A to prevent mitosis in smaller cells. Finally, we find that diploid cells of equivalent size to haploid cells exhibit lower CDK activity in response to equal cyclin-CDK enzyme concentrations, suggesting that CDK activity is reduced by increased DNA levels. Therefore, scaling of cyclin-CDK levels with cell size, CDK inhibitory phosphorylation, PP2A, and DNA-dependent inhibition of CDK activity, all inform the cell cycle network of cell size, thus contributing to cell-size homeostasis.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>A tightly regulated innate immune response to trypanosome infections is critical to strike a balance between parasite control and inflammation-associated pathology. In this study, we make use of the recently established Trypanosoma carassii infection model in larval zebrafish to study the early response of macrophages and neutrophils to trypanosome infections in vivo. We consistently identified high- and low-infected individuals and were able to simultaneously characterize their differential innate response. Not only did macrophage and neutrophil number and distribution differ between the two groups, but also macrophage morphology and activation state. Exclusive to high-infected zebrafish, was the occurrence of foamy macrophages characterized by a strong pro-inflammatory profile and potentially associated with an exacerbated immune response as well as susceptibility to the infection. To our knowledge this is the first report of the occurrence of foamy macrophages during an extracellular trypanosome infection.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;i&gt;Clostridioides difficile&lt;/i&gt; infection (CDI) remains an urgent global One Health threat. The genetic heterogeneity seen across &lt;i&gt;C. difficile&lt;/i&gt; underscores its wide ecological versatility and has driven the significant changes in CDI epidemiology seen in the last 20 years. We analysed an international collection of over 12,000 &lt;i&gt;C. difficile&lt;/i&gt; genomes spanning the eight currently defined phylogenetic clades. Through whole-genome average nucleotide identity, and pangenomic and Bayesian analyses, we identified major taxonomic incoherence with clear species boundaries for each of the recently described cryptic clades CI-III. The emergence of these three novel genomospecies predates clades C1-5 by millions of years, rewriting the global population structure of &lt;i&gt;C. difficile&lt;/i&gt; specifically and taxonomy of the &lt;i&gt;Peptostreptococcaceae&lt;/i&gt; in general. These genomospecies all show unique and highly divergent toxin gene architecture, advancing our understanding of the evolution of &lt;i&gt;C. difficile&lt;/i&gt; and close relatives. Beyond the taxonomic ramifications, this work may impact the diagnosis of CDI.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: A putative structural mechanism underlying the antithetic effect of homologous RND1 and RhoD GTPases in mammalian plexin regulation</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64304</link>
	<content:encoded>Plexins are semaphorin receptors that play essential roles in mammalian neuronal axon guidance and in many other important mammalian biological processes. Plexin signaling depends on a semaphorin-induced dimerization mechanism, and is modulated by small GTPases of the Rho family, of which RND1 serves as a plexin activator yet its close homolog RhoD an inhibitor. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations we showed that RND1 reinforces the plexin dimerization interface whereas RhoD destabilizes it due to their differential interaction with the cell membrane. Upon binding plexin at the Rho-GTPase binding domain (RBD), RND1 and RhoD interact differently with the inner leaflet of the cell membrane, and exert opposite effects on the dimerization interface via an allosteric network involving the RBD, RBD linkers, and a buttress segment adjacent to the dimerization interface. The differential membrane interaction is attributed to the fact that, unlike RND1, RhoD features a short C-terminal tail and a positively charged membrane interface.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63880</link>
	<content:encoded>The organization of micron-sized, multi-microtubule arrays from individual microtubules is essential for diverse cellular functions. The microtubule polymer is largely viewed as a passive building block during the organization process. An exception is the ‘tubulin code’ where alterations to tubulin at the amino acid level can influence the activity of microtubule-associated proteins. Recent studies reveal that micron-scale geometrical features of individual microtubules and polymer networks, such as microtubule length, overlap length, contact angle, and lattice defects, can also regulate the activity of microtubule-associated proteins and modulate polymer dynamics. We discuss how the interplay between such geometrical properties of the microtubule lattice and the activity of associated proteins direct multiple aspects of array organization, from microtubule nucleation and coalignment to specification of array dimensions and remodeling of dynamic networks. The mechanisms reviewed here highlight micron-sized features of microtubules as critical parameters to be routinely investigated in the study of microtubule self-organization.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>In severe viral pneumonia, including Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the viral replication phase is often followed by hyperinflammation, which can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure, and death. We previously demonstrated that alpha-1 adrenergic receptor (⍺&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-AR) antagonists can prevent hyperinflammation and death in mice. Here, we conducted retrospective analyses in two cohorts of patients with acute respiratory distress (ARD, n = 18,547) and three cohorts with pneumonia (n = 400,907). Federated across two ARD cohorts, we find that patients exposed to ⍺&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-AR antagonists, as compared to unexposed patients, had a 34% relative risk reduction for mechanical ventilation and death (OR = 0.70, p = 0.021). We replicated these methods on three pneumonia cohorts, all with similar effects on both outcomes. All results were robust to sensitivity analyses. These results highlight the urgent need for prospective trials testing whether prophylactic use of ⍺&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-AR antagonists ameliorates lower respiratory tract infection-associated hyperinflammation and death, as observed in COVID-19.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Shape-invariant encoding of dynamic primate facial expressions in human perception</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61197</link>
	<content:encoded>Dynamic facial expressions are crucial for communication in primates. Due to the difficulty to control shape and dynamics of facial expressions across species, it is unknown how species-specific facial expressions are perceptually encoded and interact with the representation of facial shape. While popular neural network models predict a joint encoding of facial shape and dynamics, the neuromuscular control of faces evolved more slowly than facial shape, suggesting a separate encoding. To investigate these alternative hypotheses, we developed photo-realistic human and monkey heads that were animated with motion capture data from monkeys and humans. Exact control of expression dynamics was accomplished by a Bayesian machine-learning technique. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that human observers learned cross-species expressions very quickly, where face dynamics was represented largely independently of facial shape. This result supports the co-evolution of the visual processing and motor control of facial expressions, while it challenges appearance-based neural network theories of dynamic expression recognition.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Temporal continuity of object identity is a feature of natural visual input, and is potentially exploited -- in an unsupervised manner -- by the ventral visual stream to build the neural representation in inferior temporal (IT) cortex. Here we investigated whether plasticity of individual IT neurons underlies human core-object-recognition behavioral changes induced with unsupervised visual experience. We built a single-neuron plasticity model combined with a previously established IT population-to-recognition-behavior linking model to predict human learning effects. We found that our model, after constrained by neurophysiological data, largely predicted the mean direction, magnitude and time course of human performance changes. We also found a previously unreported dependency of the observed human performance change on the initial task difficulty. This result adds support to the hypothesis that tolerant core object recognition in human and non-human primates is instructed -- at least in part -- by naturally occurring unsupervised temporal contiguity experience.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Microtubule re-organization during female meiosis in C elegans</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58903</link>
	<content:encoded>The female meiotic spindles of most animals are acentrosomal and undergo striking morphological changes while transitioning from metaphase to anaphase. The ultra-structure of acentrosomal spindles, and how changes to this structure correlate with such dramatic spindle rearrangements remains largely unknown. To address this, we applied light microscopy, large-scale electron tomography and mathematical modeling of female meiotic &lt;i&gt;C. elegans &lt;/i&gt;spindles undergoing the transition from metaphase to anaphase. Combining these approaches, we find that meiotic spindles are dynamic arrays of short microtubules that turn over on second time scales. The results show that the transition from metaphase to anaphase correlates with an increase in the number of microtubules and a decrease in their average length. Detailed analysis of the tomographic data revealed that the length of microtubules changes significantly during the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. This effect is most pronounced for those microtubules located within 150 nm of the chromosome surface. To understand the mechanisms that drive this transition, we developed a mathematical model for the microtubule length distribution that considers microtubule growth, catastrophe, and severing. Using Bayesian inference to compare model predictions and data, we find that microtubule turn-over is the major driver of the observed large-scale reorganizations. Our data suggest that in metaphase only a minor fraction of microtubules, those that are closest to the chromosomes, are severed. The large majority of microtubules, which are not in close contact with chromosomes, do not undergo severing. Instead, their length distribution is fully explained by growth and catastrophe alone. In anaphase, even microtubules close to the chromosomes show no signs of cutting. This suggests that the most prominent drivers of spindle rearrangements from metaphase to anaphase are changes in nucleation and catastrophe rate. In addition, we provide evidence that microtubule severing is dependent on the presence of katanin.</content:encoded>

To survive, animals have to quickly modify their behaviour when the reward changes. The internal representations responsible for this are updated through synaptic weight changes, mediated by certain neuromodulators conveying feedback from the environment. In previous experiments, we discovered a form of hippocampal Spike-Timing-Dependent-Plasticity (STDP) that is sequentially modulated by acetylcholine and dopamine. Acetylcholine facilitates synaptic depression, while dopamine retroactively converts the depression into potentiation. When these experimental findings were implemented as a learning rule in a computational model, our simulations showed that cholinergic-facilitated depression is important for reversal learning. In the present study, we tested the model’s prediction by optogenetically inactivating cholinergic neurons in mice during a hippocampus-dependent spatial learning task with changing rewards. We found that reversal learning, but not initial place learning, was impaired, verifying our computational prediction that acetylcholine-modulated plasticity promotes the unlearning of old reward locations. Further, differences in neuromodulator concentrations in the model captured mouse-by-mouse performance variability in the optogenetic experiments. Our line of work sheds light on how neuromodulators enable the learning of new contingencies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/iA1twVExQEE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Recent studies have shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are critical regulators in the central nervous system (CNS). However, their roles in the cerebellum are currently unclear. In this work, we identified the isoform 204 of lncRNA &lt;i&gt;Gm2694&lt;/i&gt; (designated as &lt;i&gt;lncRNA-Promoting Methylation&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;lncRNA-PM&lt;/i&gt;)) is highly expressed in the cerebellum and derived from the antisense strand of the upstream region of &lt;i&gt;Cerebellin-1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Cbln1&lt;/i&gt;), a well-known critical cerebellar synaptic organizer. &lt;i&gt;LncRNA-PM&lt;/i&gt; exhibits similar spatiotemporal expression pattern as &lt;i&gt;Cbln1&lt;/i&gt; in the postnatal mouse cerebellum and activates the transcription of &lt;i&gt;Cbln1&lt;/i&gt; through Pax6/Mll1-mediated H3K4me3. In mouse cerebellum, &lt;i&gt;lncRNA-PM&lt;/i&gt;, Pax6/Mll1, and H3K4me3 are all associated with the regulatory regions of &lt;i&gt;Cbln1&lt;/i&gt;. Knockdown of &lt;i&gt;lncRNA-PM&lt;/i&gt; in cerebellum causes deficiencies in &lt;i&gt;Cbln1&lt;/i&gt; expression, cerebellar synaptic integrity, and motor function. Together, our work reveals an lncRNA-mediated transcriptional activation of &lt;i&gt;Cbln1&lt;/i&gt; through Pax6-Mll1-H3K4me3 and provides novel insights of the essential roles of lncRNA in the cerebellum.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/xpLhYAqbyS4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Identification of sequence changes in myosin II that adjust muscle contraction velocity</title>

The speed of muscle contraction is related to body size; muscles in larger species contract at slower rates. Since contraction speed is a property of the myosin isoform expressed in a muscle, we investigated how sequence changes in a range of muscle myosin II isoforms enable this slower rate of muscle contraction. We considered 798 sequences from 13 mammalian myosin II isoforms to identify any adaptation to increasing body mass. We identified a correlation between body mass and sequence divergence for the motor domain of the 4 major adult myosin II isoforms (β/Type I, IIa, IIb, and IIx), suggesting that these isoforms have adapted to increasing body mass. In contrast, the non-muscle and developmental isoforms show no correlation of sequence divergence with body mass. Analysis of the motor domain sequence of β-myosin (predominant myosin in Type I/slow and cardiac muscle) from 67 mammals from 2 distinct clades identifies 16 sites, out of 800, associated with body mass (p&lt;sub&gt;adj&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) but not with the clade (p&lt;sub&gt;adj&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; 0.05). Both clades change the same small set of amino acids, in the same order from small to large mammals, suggesting a limited number of ways in which contraction velocity can be successfully manipulated. To test this relationship, the 9 sites that differ between human and rat were mutated in the human β-myosin to match the rat sequence. Biochemical analysis revealed that the rat–human β-myosin chimera functioned like the native rat myosin with a 2-fold increase in both motility and in the rate of ADP release from the actin–myosin crossbridge (the step that limits contraction velocity). Thus, these sequence changes indicate adaptation of β-myosin as species mass increased to enable a reduced contraction velocity and heart rate.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/selZOH0i93g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: A multielectrode array‐based hypoxia model for the analysis of electrical activity in murine retinae</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24899?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Hypoxia has an immense effect on the retina, especially on retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). It causes cell damage and results in vision loss. In this study, the electrical RGC activity under hypoxic conditions is analyzed using a multielectrode array‐based ex vivo model.

Abstract
Several eye diseases, for example, retinal artery occlusion, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma, are associated with retinal hypoxia. The lack of oxygen in the retina, especially in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), causes cell damage up to cell degeneration and leads to blindness. Using multielectrode array recordings, an ex vivo hypoxia acute model was established to analyze the electrical activity of murine wild‐type retinae under hypoxic stress conditions. Hypoxia was induced by exchanging the perfusion with oxygen‐saturated medium by nitrogen‐saturated medium. Hypoxic periods of 0 min (control) up to 60 min were tested on the retinae of adult female C57BL/6J mice. The electrical RGC activity vanished during hypoxia, but conditionally returned after the reestablishment of conventional test conditions. With increasing duration of hypoxia, the returning RGC activity decreased. After a hypoxic period of 30 min and a subsequent recovery time of 30 min, 59.43 ± 11.35% of the initially active channels showed a restored RGC activity. The survival rate of retinal cells after hypoxic stress was analyzed by a live/dead staining assay using two‐photon laser scanning microscopy. For detailed information about molecular changes caused by hypoxia, a microarray gene expression analysis was performed. Furthermore, the effect of 2‐aminoethanesulfonic acid (taurine, 1 mM) on retinae under hypoxic stress was tested. Treatment with taurine resulted in an increase in the RGC response rate after hypoxia and also increased the survival rate of retinal cells under hypoxic stress, confirming its potential as promising candidate for neuroprotective therapies of eye diseases.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>This is the first study to demonstrate functional as well as structural plasticity of the central olfactory networks, following surgical treatment for olfactory dysfunction. Our results help to confirm the neuroanatomical corelates of olfactory function and dysfunction.

Abstract
Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is more common than hearing loss, partial blindness, or blindness and can have a significant impact on the quality of life. Moreover, unexplained OD is an early biomarker in neurodegenerative diseases and increases 5‐year mortality risk. Structural alterations in olfactory eloquent brain regions may represent the neuroanatomical correlates of OD. Previous studies have demonstrated reduced gray matter (GM) volume in areas of presumed olfactory relevance in patients with OD. However, being cross‐sectional in nature, these studies do not provide evidence of causality, for which longitudinal work is required. At present, however, longitudinal studies addressing olfactory structural plasticity are limited, both in number and methodological approach: to our knowledge, such work has not included parallel functional imaging to confirm the relevance of structural change. We therefore performed a longitudinal multimodal neuroimaging study investigating structural and functional plasticity in 24 patients undergoing surgical treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis, compared with 17 healthy controls. We demonstrated functionally significant structural plasticity within the orbitofrontal, anterior cingulate and insular cortices, and temporal poles in patients 3 months after surgery. Of interest, GM volume decreased in these regions, in association with increased psychophysical scores and BOLD signal. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate both structural and functional plasticity of the central olfactory networks, thereby confirming these areas as neuroanatomical correlates of olfactory function/dysfunction.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Functional brain network topology across the menstrual cycle is estradiol dependent and correlates with individual well‐being</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24898?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>The topology of brain networks along the menstrual cycle (MC), estimated in 24 women (N = 24), is influenced by estradiol blood levels. The betweenness centrality (BC) of the right posterior cingulate gyrus (rPCG), in the alpha frequency band, increased in the peri‐ovulatory phase (a). The estradiol levels predicted the BC variance in rPCG (b) and, accordingly, its variations during the luteal phase (expressed as the difference between the mid‐luteal and peri‐ovulatory time points of the MC) correlated positively with the variation of the BC of the rPCG (c).

Abstract
The menstrual cycle (MC) is a sex hormone‐related phenomenon that repeats itself cyclically during the woman's reproductive life. In this explorative study, we hypothesized that coordinated variations of multiple sex hormones may affect the large‐scale organization of the brain functional network and that, in turn, such changes might have psychological correlates, even in the absence of overt clinical signs of anxiety and/or depression. To test our hypothesis, we investigated longitudinally, across the MC, the relationship between the sex hormones and both brain network and psychological changes. We enrolled 24 naturally cycling women and, at the early‐follicular, peri‐ovulatory, and mid‐luteal phases of the MC, we performed: (a) sex hormone dosage, (b) magnetoencephalography recording to study the brain network topology, and (c) psychological questionnaires to quantify anxiety, depression, self‐esteem, and well‐being. We showed that during the peri‐ovulatory phase, in the alpha band, the leaf fraction and the tree hierarchy of the brain network were reduced, while the betweenness centrality (BC) of the right posterior cingulate gyrus (rPCG) was increased. Furthermore, the increase in BC was predicted by estradiol levels. Moreover, during the luteal phase, the variation of estradiol correlated positively with the variations of both the topological change and environmental mastery dimension of the well‐being test, which, in turn, was related to the increase in the BC of rPCG. Our results highlight the effects of sex hormones on the large‐scale brain network organization as well as on their possible relationship with the psychological state across the MC. Moreover, the fact that physiological changes in the brain topology occur throughout the MC has widespread implications for neuroimaging studies.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Cardiorespiratory findings in epilepsy: A recent review on outcomes and pathophysiology</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24861?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Epilepsy is a debilitating disorder of uncontrollable recurrent seizures that occurs as a result of imbalances in the brain excitatory and inhibitory neuronal signals, that could stem from a range of functional and structural neuronal impairments. Globally, nearly 70 million people are negatively impacted by epilepsy and its comorbidities. One such comorbidity is the effect epilepsy has on the autonomic nervous system (ANS), which plays a role in the control of blood circulation, respiration and gastrointestinal function. These epilepsy‐induced impairments in the circulatory and respiratory systems may contribute toward sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Although, various hypotheses have been proposed regarding the role of epilepsy on ANS, the linking pathological mechanism still remains unclear. Channelopathies and seizure‐induced damages in ANS‐control brain structures were some of the causal/pathological candidates of cardiorespiratory comorbidities in epilepsy patients, especially in those who were drug resistant. However, emerging preclinical research suggest that neurotransmitter/receptor dysfunction and synaptic changes in the ANS may also contribute to the epilepsy‐related autonomic disorders. Thus, pathological mechanisms of cardiorespiratory dysfunction should be elucidated by considering the modifications in anatomy and physiology of the autonomic system caused by seizures. In this regard, we present a comprehensive review of the current literature, both clinical and preclinical animal studies, on the cardiorespiratory findings in epilepsy and elucidate the possible pathological mechanisms of these findings, in hopes to prevent SUDEP especially in patients who are drug resistant.</content:encoded>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: The effect of acute aerobic exercise on the consolidation of motor memories</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00221-021-06148-y</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Acute aerobic exercise performed prior to training may assist with motor skill acquisition through enhancement of motor cortical plasticity. In addition, high-intensity exercise performed after training improves retention, although the mechanisms of this are unclear. We hypothesized that acute continuous moderate-intensity exercise performed post-motor training would also assist with motor skill retention and that this behavioral change would be positively correlated with neural markers of training-related cortical adaptation. Participants [&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 33; assigned to an exercise (EXE) or control (CON) group] completed a single visuomotor training session using bilateral wrist movements while movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs) were collected. After motor training, the EXE group exercised for 20 min [70% of heart rate reserve (HRR)] and the CON group read for the same amount of time. Both groups completed two post-training tests after exercise/rest: 10 min and ~ 30 min once heart rate returned to resting level in EXE. Retention and transfer tests were both completed 1 and 7 days later. MRCPs measured training-related neural adaptations during the first visit and motor performance was assessed as time and trajectory to the target. The EXE group had better performance than CON at retention (significant 7 days post-training). MRCP amplitudes increased from early to late motor training and this amplitude change was correlated with motor performance at retention. Results suggest that moderate-intensity exercise post-motor training helps motor skill retention and that there may be a relationship with motor training-related cortical adaptations that is enhanced with post-motor training exercise.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.655164</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The cerebellum plays a critical regulatory role in motor coordination, cognition, behavior, language, memory, and learning, hence overseeing a multiplicity of functions. Cerebellar development begins during early embryonic development, lasting until the first postnatal years. Particularly, the greatest increase of its volume occurs during the third trimester of pregnancy, which represents a critical period for cerebellar maturation. Preterm birth and all the related prenatal and perinatal contingencies may determine both dysmaturative and lesional events, potentially involving the developing cerebellum, and contributing to the constellation of the neuropsychiatric outcomes with several implications in setting-up clinical follow-up and early intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Cannabinoid Modulation of Dopamine Release During Motivation, Periodic Reinforcement, Exploratory Behavior, Habit Formation, and Attention</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2021.660218</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Motivational and attentional processes energize action sequences to facilitate evolutionary competition and promote behavioral fitness. Decades of neuropharmacology, electrophysiology and electrochemistry research indicate that the mesocorticolimbic DA pathway modulates both motivation and attention. More recently, it was realized that mesocorticolimbic DA function is tightly regulated by the brain’s endocannabinoid system and greatly influenced by exogenous cannabinoids—which have been harnessed by humanity for medicinal, ritualistic, and recreational uses for 12,000 years. Exogenous cannabinoids, like the primary psychoactive component of cannabis, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, produce their effects by acting at binding sites for naturally occurring endocannabinoids. The brain’s endocannabinoid system consists of two G-protein coupled receptors, endogenous lipid ligands for these receptor targets, and several synthetic and metabolic enzymes involved in their production and degradation. Emerging evidence indicates that the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol is necessary to observe concurrent increases in DA release and motivated behavior. And the historical pharmacology literature indicates a role for cannabinoid signaling in both motivational and attentional processes. While both types of behaviors have been scrutinized under manipulation by either DA or cannabinoid agents, there is considerably less insight into prospective interactions between these two important signaling systems. This review attempts to summate the relevance of cannabinoid modulation of DA release during operant tasks designed to investigate either motivational or attentional control of behavior. We first describe how cannabinoids influence DA release and goal-directed action under a variety of reinforcement contingencies. Then we consider the role that endocannabinoids might play in switching an animal’s motivation from a goal-directed action to the search for an alternative outcome, in addition to the formation of long-term habits. Finally, dissociable features of attentional behavior using both the 5-choice serial reaction time task and the attentional set-shifting task are discussed along with their distinct influences by DA and cannabinoids. We end with discussing potential targets for further research regarding DA-cannabinoid interactions within key substrates involved in motivation and attention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.677823</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;There is evidence that the T allele of rs405509 located in the apolipoprotein E (APOE) promotor region is a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the effect of the T/T allele on brain function in non-demented aging is still unclear.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We analyzed the effects of the rs405509 T/T allele on cognitive performances using multiple neuropsychological tests and local brain function using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Significant differences were found between T/T carriers and G allele carriers on general cognitive status, memory, and attention (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Rs-fMRI analyses demonstrated decreased amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) in the right middle frontal gyrus, decreased percent amplitude of fluctuation (PerAF) in the right middle frontal gyrus, increased regional homogeneity (ReHo) in the right cerebellar tonsil and decreased ReHo in the right putamen, and decreased degree centrality (DC) in the left middle frontal gyrus (p &amp;lt; 0.05, corrected). Furthermore, significant correlations were found between cognitive performance and these neuroimaging changes (p &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that T/T allele may serve as an independent risk factor that can influence brain function in different regions in non-demented aging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.671020</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Systematic reviews of neuroimaging studies confirm stimulus-induced activity in response to verbal and non-verbal self-referential processing (SRP) in cortical midline structures, temporoparietal cortex and insula. Whether SRP can be causally modulated by way of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) has also been investigated in several studies. Here we summarize the NIBS literature including 27 studies of task-based SRP comparing response between verbal and non-verbal SRP tasks. The studies differed in design, experimental tasks and stimulation parameters. Results support the role of left inferior parietal lobule (left IPL) in verbal SRP and for the medial prefrontal cortex when valenced stimuli were used. Further, results support roles for the bilateral parietal lobe (IPL, posterior cingulate cortex), the sensorimotor areas (the primary sensory and motor cortex, the premotor cortex, and the extrastriate body area) and the insula in non-verbal SRP (bodily self-consciousness). We conclude that NIBS may differentially modulate verbal and non-verbal SRP by targeting the corresponding brain areas.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.655247</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A prominent goal of neuroscience is to improve our understanding of how brain structure and activity interact to produce perception, emotion, behavior, and cognition. The brain’s network activity is inherently organized in distinct spatiotemporal patterns that span scales from nanometer-sized synapses to meter-long nerve fibers and millisecond intervals between electrical signals to decades of memory storage. There is currently no single imaging method that alone can provide all the relevant information, but intelligent combinations of complementary techniques can be effective. Here, we thus present the latest advances in biomedical and biological engineering on photoacoustic neuroimaging in the context of complementary imaging techniques. A particular focus is placed on recent advances in whole-brain photoacoustic imaging in rodent models and its influential role in bridging the gap between fluorescence microscopy and more non-invasive techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We consider current strategies to address persistent challenges, particularly in developing molecular contrast agents, and conclude with an overview of potential future directions for photoacoustic neuroimaging to provide deeper insights into healthy and pathological brain processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Large-Area Photoreceptor Degeneration Model in Rabbits by Photocoagulation and Oxidative Stress in the Retina</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.617175</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Photocoagulation is used for the treatment of retinal ischemic disease. However, due to the invasive nature of photocoagulation and variety of melanin concentrations between individuals, it is challenging to avoid damaging the adjacent photoreceptors and inducing several side effects. Previous studies indicate the role of laser power, duration, and spot size on retinal lesions, but the effect of interspot distance of the laser pulses needs to be considered in panretinal photocoagulation. In this study, we examine different parameters of photocoagulation on lesions of the retina in rabbit, finding that the lesion level of the outer nuclear layer of the retina depended on the pulse duration and laser spot size, and decreasing interspot distance could completely abolish the photoreceptor layer. The degeneration of the photoreceptor by photocoagulation occurred in 24 h and was not restored afterward. We then conducted panretinal photocoagulation in rabbit and found that oxidative stress was decreased in the inner nuclear layer of the retina, and pupillary light reflex and ERG signals were impaired. Our study could provide a rabbit model to explore the mechanism of photoreceptor degeneration and therapies for the side effects after photocoagulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Characterizing Network Search Algorithms Developed for Dynamic Causal Modeling</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.656486</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) is a widely used tool to estimate the effective connectivity of specified models of a brain network. Finding the model explaining measured data is one of the most important outstanding problems in Bayesian modeling. Using heuristic model search algorithms enables us to find an optimal model without having to define a model set a priori. However, the development of such methods is cumbersome in the case of large model-spaces. We aimed to utilize commonly used graph theoretical search algorithms for DCM to create a framework for characterizing them, and to investigate relevance of such methods for single-subject and group-level studies. Because of the enormous computational demand of DCM calculations, we separated the model estimation procedure from the search algorithm by providing a database containing the parameters of all models in a full model-space. For test data a publicly available fMRI dataset of 60 subjects was used. First, we reimplemented the deterministic bilinear DCM algorithm in the ReDCM R package, increasing computational speed during model estimation. Then, three network search algorithms have been adapted for DCM, and we demonstrated how modifications to these methods, based on DCM posterior parameter estimates, can enhance search performance. Comparison of the results are based on model evidence, structural similarities and the number of model estimations needed during search. An analytical approach using Bayesian model reduction (BMR) for efficient network discovery is already available for DCM. Comparing model search methods we found that topological algorithms often outperform analytical methods for single-subject analysis and achieve similar results for recovering common network properties of the winning model family, or set of models, obtained by multi-subject family-wise analysis. However, network search methods show their limitations in higher level statistical analysis of parametric empirical Bayes. Optimizing such linear modeling schemes the BMR methods are still considered the recommended approach. We envision the freely available database of estimated model-spaces to help further studies of the DCM model-space, and the ReDCM package to be a useful contribution for Bayesian inference within and beyond the field of neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Event-Based Update of Synapses in Voltage-Based Learning Rules</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.609147</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Due to the point-like nature of neuronal spiking, efficient neural network simulators often employ event-based simulation schemes for synapses. Yet many types of synaptic plasticity rely on the membrane potential of the postsynaptic cell as a third factor in addition to pre- and postsynaptic spike times. In some learning rules membrane potentials not only influence synaptic weight changes at the time points of spike events but in a continuous manner. In these cases, synapses therefore require information on the full time course of membrane potentials to update their strength which a priori suggests a continuous update in a time-driven manner. The latter hinders scaling of simulations to realistic cortical network sizes and relevant time scales for learning. Here, we derive two efficient algorithms for archiving postsynaptic membrane potentials, both compatible with modern simulation engines based on event-based synapse updates. We theoretically contrast the two algorithms with a time-driven synapse update scheme to analyze advantages in terms of memory and computations. We further present a reference implementation in the spiking neural network simulator NEST for two prototypical voltage-based plasticity rules: the Clopath rule and the Urbanczik-Senn rule. For both rules, the two event-based algorithms significantly outperform the time-driven scheme. Depending on the amount of data to be stored for plasticity, which heavily differs between the rules, a strong performance increase can be achieved by compressing or sampling of information on membrane potentials. Our results on computational efficiency related to archiving of information provide guidelines for the design of learning rules in order to make them practically usable in large-scale networks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Globus Pallidus Internus Deep Brain Stimulation for Dystonic Opisthotonus in Adult-Onset Dystonia: A Personalized Approach</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.683545</link>
	<content:encoded>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Dystonic opisthotonus is defined as a backward arching of the neck and trunk, which ranges in severity from mild backward jerks to life-threatening prolonged severe muscular spasms. It can be associated with generalized dystonic syndromes or, rarely, present as a form of axial truncal dystonia. The etiologies vary from idiopathic, genetic, tardive, hereditary-degenerative, or associated with parkinsonism. We report clinical cases of dystonic opisthotonus associated with adult-onset dystonic syndromes, that benefitted from globus pallidus internus (GPi) deep brain stimulation (DBS).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Clinical data from patients with dystonic syndromes who underwent comprehensive medical review, multidisciplinary assessment, and tailored medical and neurosurgical managements were prospectively analyzed. Quantification of dystonia severity pre- and postoperatively was performed using the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale and quantification of overall pain severity was performed using the Visual Analog Scale.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Three male patients, with age of onset of the dystonic symptoms ranging from 32 to 51 years old, were included. Tardive dystonia, adult-onset dystonia-parkinsonism and adult-onset idiopathic axial dystonia were the etiologies identified. Clinical investigation and management were tailored according to the complexity of the individual presentations. Although they shared common clinical features of adult-onset dystonia, disabling dystonic opisthotonus, refractory to medical management, was the main indication for GPi-DBS in all patients presented. The severity of axial dystonia ranged from disturbance of daily function to life-threatening truncal distortion. All three patients underwent bilateral GPi DBS at a mean age of 52 years (range 48–55 years), after mean duration of symptoms prior to DBS of 10.7 years (range 4–16 years). All patients showed a rapid and sustained clinical improvement of their symptoms, notably of the dystonic opisthotonos, at postoperative follow-up ranging from 20 to 175 months. In some, the ability to resume activities of daily living and reintegration into the society was remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Adult-onset dystonic syndromes predominantly presenting with dystonic opisthotonus are relatively rare. The specific nature of dystonic opisthotonus remains a treatment challenge, and thorough investigation of this highly disabling condition with varying etiologies is often necessary. Although patients may be refractory to medical management and botulinum toxin injection, Globus pallidus stimulation timed and tailored provided symptomatic control in this cohort and may be considered in other carefully selected cases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Application of High-Frequency Oscillations on Scalp EEG in Infant Spasm: A Prospective Controlled Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.682011</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;We quantitatively analyzed high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) using scalp electroencephalography (EEG) in patients with infantile spasms (IS).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We enrolled 60 children with IS hospitalized from January 2019 to August 2020. Sixty healthy age-matched children comprised the control group. Time–frequency analysis was used to quantify γ, ripple, and fast ripple (FR) oscillation energy changes.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;γ, ripple, and FR oscillations dominated in the temporal and frontal lobes. The average HFO energy of the sleep stage is lower than that of the wake stage in the same frequency bands in both the normal control (NC) and IS groups (P &amp;lt; 0.05). The average HFO energy of the IS group was significantly higher than that of the NC group in γ band during sleep stage (P &amp;lt; 0.01). The average HFO energy of S and Post-S stage were higher than that of sleep stage in γ band (P &amp;lt; 0.05). In the ripple band, the average HFO energy of Pre-S, S, and Post-S stage was higher than that of sleep stage (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Before treatment, there was no significant difference in BASED score between the effective and ineffective groups. The interaction of curative efficacy × frequency and the interaction of curative efficacy × state are statistically significant. The average HFO energy of the effective group was lower than that of the ineffective group in the sleep stage (P &amp;lt; 0.05). For the 16 children deemed “effective” in the IS group, the average HFO energy of three frequency bands was not significantly different before compared with after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;Significance&lt;p&gt;Scalp EEG can record HFOs. The energy of HFOs can distinguish physiological HFOs from pathological ones more accurately than frequency. On scalp EEG, γ oscillations can better detect susceptibility to epilepsy than ripple and FR oscillations. HFOs can trigger spasms. The analysis of average HFO energy can be used as a predictor of the effectiveness of epilepsy treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Advantage of Handwriting Over Typing on Learning Words: Evidence From an N400 Event-Related Potential Index</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.679191</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The growing implementation of digital education comes with an increased need to understand the impact of digital tools on learning. Previous behavioral studies have shown that handwriting on paper is more effective for learning than typing on a keyboard. However, the impact of writing with a digital pen on a tablet remains to be clarified. In the present study, we compared learning by handwriting with an ink pen on paper, handwriting with a digital pen on a tablet, and typing on a keyboard. Behavioral and electroencephalographic indices were measured immediately after learning with each writing tool. The moods of the subjects during the training were also assessed. The participants were divided according to their use of digital pen in their everyday lives, allowing us to take into account the effect of the familiarity with the digital pen on the learning process (familiar group vs. unfamiliar group). We performed an EEG experiment applying a repetition priming paradigm. In each trial, a learned foreign language word (prime word) and a mother tongue word (target word) were consecutively presented. The target word was either semantically identical to the prime word (repetitive condition) or different (non-repetitive condition). We assumed that a larger priming effect on N400 reflects larger learning progress. The familiar group showed a greater N400 priming effect for words learned with the digital or ink pen than those learned with the keyboard. The unfamiliar group showed the greater N400 priming effect for words learned with the ink pen compared with words learned by typing. In addition, positive mood during learning was significantly higher during handwriting than during typing, regardless of the groups. On the other hand, the behavioral indices were not influenced by the writing tool. These results suggest that the movements involved in handwriting allow a greater memorization of new words. The advantage of handwriting over typing might also be caused by a more positive mood during learning. Finally, our results show that handwriting with a digital pen and tablet can increase the ability to learn compared with keyboard typing once the individuals are accustomed to it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Effect of Prior Knowledge of Color on Behavioral Responses and Event-Related Potentials During Go/No-go Task</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.674964</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In daily life, the meaning of color plays an important role in execution and inhibition of a motor response. For example, the symbolism of traffic light can help pedestrians and drivers to control their behavior, with the color green/blue meaning go and red meaning stop. However, we don’t always stop with a red light and sometimes start a movement with it in such a situation as drivers start pressing the brake pedal when a traffic light turns red. In this regard, we investigated how the prior knowledge of traffic light signals impacts reaction times (RTs) and event-related potentials (ERPs) in a Go/No-go task. We set up Blue Go/Red No-go and Red Go/Blue No-go tasks with three different go signal (Go) probabilities (30, 50, and 70%), resulting in six different conditions. The participants were told which color to respond (Blue or Red) just before each condition session but didn’t know the Go probability. Neural responses to Go and No-go signals were recorded at Fz, Cz, and Oz (international 10–20 system). We computed RTs for Go signal and N2 and P3 amplitudes from the ERP data. We found that RT was faster when responding to blue than red light signal and also was slower with lower Go probability. Overall, N2 amplitude was larger in Red Go than Blue Go trial and in Red No-go than Blue No-go trial. Furthermore, P3 amplitude was larger in Red No-go than Blue No-go trial. Our findings of RT and N2 amplitude for Go ERPs could indicate the presence of Stroop-like interference, that is a conflict between prior knowledge about traffic light signals and the meaning of presented signal. Meanwhile, the larger N2 and P3 amplitudes in Red No-go trial as compared to Blue No-go trial may be due to years of experience in stopping an action in response to a red signal and/or attention. This study provides the better understanding of the effect of prior knowledge of color on behavioral responses and its underlying neural mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Disrupted Structural Brain Connectome Is Related to Cognitive Impairment in Patients With Ischemic Leukoaraiosis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.654750</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ischemic leukoaraiosis (ILA) is related to cognitive impairment and vascular dementia in the elderly. One possible mechanism could be the disruption of white matter (WM) tracts and network function that connect distributed brain regions involved in cognition. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between structural connectome and cognitive functions in ILA patients. A total of 89 patients with ILA (Fazekas score ≥ 3) and 90 healthy controls (HCs) underwent comprehensive neuropsychological examinations and diffusion tensor imaging scans. The tract-based spatial statistics approach was employed to investigate the WM integrity. Graph theoretical analysis was further applied to construct the topological architecture of the structural connectome in ILA patients. Partial correlation analysis was used to investigate the relationships between network measures and cognitive performances in the ILA group. Compared with HCs, the ILA patients showed widespread WM integrity disruptions. The ILA group displayed increased characteristic path length (L&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) and decreased global network efficiency at the level of the whole brain relative to HCs, and reduced nodal efficiencies, predominantly in the frontal–subcortical and limbic system regions. Furthermore, these structural connectomic alterations were associated with cognitive impairment in ILA patients. The association between WM changes (i.e., fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity measures) and cognitive function was mediated by the structural connectivity measures (i.e., local network efficiency and L&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;). In conclusion, cognitive impairment in ILA patients is related to microstructural disruption of multiple WM fibers and topological disorganization of structural networks, which have implications in understanding the relationship between ILA and the possible attendant cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Task Construal Influences Estimations of the Environment</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.625193</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;People’s characteristics can affect their perception of the physical environment, and the judgments and estimates they make about their surroundings. Estimates of the environment change based on observers’ metabolic state, physical properties, and the potential effort they would need to exert for a certain action. The functional role of such scaling is to provide agents with information on possible actions and their energetic costs. Combining actions with costs facilitates both higher-level planning (e.g., choosing an optimal running speed on a marathon) as well as planning on lower levels of an action hierarchy, such as determining the best movement trajectories for energy-efficient action. Recently, some of the findings on reported effects of effort on perception have been challenged as arising from task demands—participants guessing the purpose of the experimental manipulation and adjusting their estimates as a result. Arguably however, the failed replications used overly distracting cover stories which may have introduced task demands of their own, and masked other effects. The current study tested the generality of effects of potential effort on height and distance perception, employing effective yet not distracting cover stories. Four experiments attempted to identify conditions under which anticipated effort may systematically change perceptual estimates. Experiment 1 found that height estimates were not influenced by the effort required to place objects of different weights onto surfaces of varying heights. Experiments 2, 3 used two different effort manipulations (walking vs. hopping; and carrying an empty vs. a heavy backpack, respectively) and found that these did not influence estimates of distance (to be) traveled. Experiment 4 also used backpack weight to manipulate effort but critically, unlike Exp. 1–3 it did not employ a cover story and participants did not traverse distances after giving estimates. In contrast with the first three experiments, distances in the final experiment were estimated as longer when participants were encumbered by a backpack. Combined, these results suggest that the measured effects on the estimation of distance were due to how participants construed the task rather than being of a perceptual nature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.687257</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a cortical structure based on its cell types, connectivity features, and developmental characteristics. This part of the amygdala is considered to be the main entry site of processed and multisensory information delivered via cortical and thalamic afferents. Although GABAergic inhibitory cells in the BLA comprise only 20% of the entire neuronal population, they provide essential control over proper network operation. Previous studies have uncovered that GABAergic cells in the basolateral amygdala are as diverse as those present in other cortical regions, including the hippocampus and neocortex. To understand the role of inhibitory cells in various amygdala functions, we need to reveal the connectivity and input-output features of the different types of GABAergic cells. Here, I review the recent achievements in uncovering the diversity of GABAergic cells in the basolateral amygdala with a specific focus on the microcircuit organization of these inhibitory cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: The Complement of Projection Neurons Activated Determines the Type of Feeding Motor Program in Aplysia</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.685222</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Multiple projection neurons are often activated to initiate behavior. A question that then arises is, what is the unique functional role of each neuron activated? We address this issue in the feeding system of Aplysia. Previous experiments identified a projection neuron [cerebral buccal interneuron 2 (CBI-2)] that can trigger ingestive motor programs but only after it is repeatedly stimulated, i.e., initial programs are poorly defined. As CBI-2 stimulation continues, programs become progressively more ingestive (repetition priming occurs). This priming results, at least in part, from persistent actions of peptide cotransmitters released from CBI-2. We now show that in some preparations repetition priming does not occur. There is no clear seasonal effect; priming and non-priming preparations are encountered throughout the year. CBI-2 is electrically coupled to a second projection neuron, cerebral buccal interneuron 3 (CBI-3). In preparations in which priming does not occur, we show that ingestive activity is generated when CBI-2 and CBI-3 are coactivated. Programs are immediately ingestive, i.e., priming is not necessary, and a persistent state is not induced. Our data suggest that dynamic changes in the configuration of activity can vary and be determined by the complement of projection neurons that trigger activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.662882</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Connected networks are a fundamental structure of neurobiology. Understanding these networks will help us elucidate the neural mechanisms of computation. Mathematically speaking these networks are “graphs”—structures containing objects that are connected. In neuroscience, the objects could be regions of the brain, e.g., fMRI data, or be individual neurons, e.g., calcium imaging with fluorescence microscopy. The formal study of graphs, graph theory, can provide neuroscientists with a large bank of algorithms for exploring networks. Graph theory has already been applied in a variety of ways to fMRI data but, more recently, has begun to be applied at the scales of neurons, e.g., from functional calcium imaging. In this primer we explain the basics of graph theory and relate them to features of microscopic functional networks of neurons from calcium imaging—neuronal graphs. We explore recent examples of graph theory applied to calcium imaging and we highlight some areas where researchers new to the field could go awry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Auxiliary Subunits Control Function and Subcellular Distribution of AMPA Receptor Complexes in NG2 Glia of the Developing Hippocampus</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.669717</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Synaptic and axonal glutamatergic signaling to NG2 glia in white matter is critical for the cells’ differentiation and activity dependent myelination. However, in gray matter the impact of neuron-to-NG2 glia signaling is still elusive, because most of these cells keep their non-myelinating phenotype throughout live. Early in postnatal development, hippocampal NG2 glia express AMPA receptors with a significant Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; permeability allowing for plasticity of the neuron-glia synapses, but whether this property changes by adulthood is not known. Moreover, it is unclear whether NG2 glia express auxiliary transmembrane AMPA receptor related proteins (TARPs), which modify AMPA receptor properties, including their Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; permeability. Through combined molecular and functional analyses, here we show that hippocampal NG2 glia abundantly express TARPs γ4, γ7, and γ8 as well as cornichon (CNIH)-2. TARP γ8 undergoes profound downregulation during development. Receptors of adult NG2 glia showed an increased sensitivity to blockers of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; permeable AMPA receptors, but this increase mainly concerned receptors located close to the soma. Evoked synaptic currents of NG2 glia were also sensitive to blockers of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; permeable AMPA receptors. The presence of AMPA receptors with varying Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; permeability during postnatal maturation may be important for the cells’ ability to sense and respond to local glutamatergic activity and for regulating process motility, differentiation, and proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Mounting evidence indicates that activation of MCs releasing numerous vasoactive and inflammatory mediators has effects on the nervous system and has been involved in different pain conditions. Here, we review the latest advances made about the implication of MCs in pain. Possible cellular and molecular mechanisms regarding the crosstalk between MC and the nervous system in the initiation and maintenance of pain are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;The extent of neurodegeneration underlying essential tremor (ET) remains a matter of debate. Despite various extents of cerebellar atrophy on structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), previous studies have shown substantial heterogeneity and included a limited number of patients. Novel automated pipelines allow detailed segmentation of cerebellar lobules based on structural MRI.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;To compare the volumes of cerebellar lobules in ET patients with those in healthy controls (HCs) using an automated segmentation pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Structural MRI scans of ET patients eligible for deep brain stimulation (n = 55) and of age-matched and gender-matched HCs (n = 55, from the IXI database) were segmented using the automated CEREbellum Segmentation pipeline. Lobule-specific volume differences between the ET and HC groups were evaluated using a general linear model corrected for multiple tests.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Total brain tissue volumes did not differ between the ET and HC groups. ET patients demonstrated reduced volumes of lobules I-II, left Crus II, left VIIB, and an increased volume of right X when compared with the HC group.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;A large cohort of ET patients demonstrated subtle signs of decreased cerebellar lobule volumes. These findings oppose the hypothesis of localized atrophy in cerebellar motor areas in ET, but not the possibility of cerebellar pathophysiology in ET. Prospective investigations using alternative neuroimaging modalities may further elucidate the pathophysiology of ET and provide insights into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dementia is a global public health problem and its impact is bound to increase in the next decades, with a rapidly aging world population. Dementia is by no means an obligatory outcome of aging, although its incidence increases exponentially in old age, and its onset may be insidious. In the absence of unequivocal biomarkers, the accuracy of cognitive profiling plays a fundamental role in the diagnosis of this condition. In this Perspective article, we highlight the utility of brief global cognitive tests in the diagnostic process, from the initial detection stage for which they are designed, through the differential diagnosis of dementia. We also argue that neuropsychological training and expertise are critical in order for the information gathered from these omnibus cognitive tests to be used in an efficient and effective way, and thus, ultimately, for them to fulfill their potential.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.639795</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Normative aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) propagation alter anatomical connections among brain parcels. However, the interaction between the trajectories of age- and AD-linked alterations in the topology of the structural brain network is not well understood. In this study, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets of 139 subjects from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database were used to document their structural brain networks. The 139 participants consist of 45 normal controls (NCs), 37 with early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), 27 with late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), and 30 AD patients. All subjects were further divided into three subgroups based on their age (56–65, 66–75, and 71–85 years). After the structural connectivity networks were built using anatomically-constrained deterministic tractography, their global and nodal topological properties were estimated, including network efficiency, characteristic path length, transitivity, modularity coefficient, clustering coefficient, and betweenness. Statistical analyses were then performed on these metrics using linear regression, and one- and two-way ANOVA testing to examine group differences and interactions between aging and AD propagation. No significant interactions were found between aging and AD propagation in the global topological metrics (network efficiency, characteristic path length, transitivity, and modularity coefficient). However, nodal metrics (clustering coefficient and betweenness centrality) of some cortical parcels exhibited significant interactions between aging and AD propagation, with affected parcels including left superior temporal, right pars triangularis, and right precentral. The results collectively confirm the age-related deterioration of structural networks in MCI and AD patients, providing novel insight into the cross effects of aging and AD disorder on brain structural networks. Some early symptoms of AD may also be due to age-associated anatomic vulnerability interacting with early anatomic changes associated with AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/67123</link>
	<content:encoded>The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is the sole and selective gateway for nuclear transport and its dysfunction has been associated with many diseases. The metazoan NPC subcomplex RanBP2, which consists of RanBP2 (Nup358), RanGAP1-SUMO1 and Ubc9, regulates the assembly and function of the NPC. The roles of immune signaling in regulation of NPC remain poorly understood. Here, we show that in human and murine T cells, following TCR stimulation, protein kinase C-θ (PKC-θ) directly phosphorylates RanGAP1 to facilitate RanBP2 subcomplex assembly and nuclear import and, thus, the nuclear translocation of AP-1 transcription factor. Mechanistically, TCR stimulation induces the translocation of activated PKC-θ to the NPC, where it interacts with and phosphorylates RanGAP1 on Ser&lt;sup&gt;504&lt;/sup&gt; and Ser&lt;sup&gt;506&lt;/sup&gt;. RanGAP1 phosphorylation increases its binding affinity for Ubc9, thereby promoting sumoylation of RanGAP1 and, finally, assembly of the RanBP2 subcomplex. Our findings reveal an unexpected role of PKC-θ as a direct regulator of nuclear import and uncover a phosphorylation-dependent sumoylation of RanGAP1, delineating a novel link between TCR signaling and assembly of the RanBP2 NPC subcomplex.</content:encoded>

Abstract
Egg laying in the pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis is regulated by the photoperiod; long‐day conditions (16L8D) promote egg laying whereas medium‐day conditions (12L12D) suppress it. In this snail, a caudo‐dorsal cell hormone (CDCH) is produced by neurosecretory cells, CDCs in the cerebral ganglion (CG), and its release triggers ovulation and subsequent egg laying. However, the physiological basis for photoperiod‐dependent egg laying remains unraveled. Here, we compared electrophysiological properties of CDCs between 16L8D and 12L12D using intracellular recording, and found that CDC excitability is higher in 16L8D than in 12L12D. Striking differences are as follows: (1) a shallower resting membrane potential in 16L8D than in 12L12D, and (2) a smaller threshold voltage (minimum depolarization from rest to elicit action potentials) in 16L8D than in 12L12D. Switching of the excitability can be a physiological basis of a photoperiod‐dependent CDCH release. Simultaneous intracellular dye injection identified two morphological subtypes of CDCs, validating a previous report. Both types bear short lateral extensions in CG, some of which probably function as integration sites of photoperiodic inputs. In addition, we found two novel CDCH‐immunoreactive cell groups (CDCCOM and SCm) in the CG besides conventional CDCs and small cells expressing CDCH. The CDCCOM with cell bodies and fibers in the neurohemal commissure may be involved in triggering ovulation. Notably, the total number of CDCs is larger than that previously reported, the right CDC cluster with more cells than the left. Our findings are instructive in following the neurophysiology of photoperiodism in L. stagnalis.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Disrupting the medial prefrontal cortex with designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drug alters hippocampal sharp‐wave ripples and their associated cognitive processes</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23367?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
The hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) interact during a myriad of cognitive processes including decision‐making and long‐term memory consolidation. Exactly how the mPFC and hippocampus interact during goal‐directed decision‐making remains to be fully elucidated. During periods of rest, bursts of high‐frequency oscillations, termed sharp‐wave ripple (SWR), appear in the local field potential. Impairing SWRs on the maze or during post‐learning rest can interfere with memory‐guided decision‐making and memory consolidation. We hypothesize that the hippocampus and mPFC bidirectionally interact during SWRs to support memory consolidation and decision‐making. Rats were trained on the neuroeconomic spatial decision‐making task, Restaurant Row, to make serial stay‐skip decisions where the amount of effort (delay to reward) varied upon entry to each restaurant. Hippocampal cells and SWRs were recorded in rats with the mPFC transduced with inhibitory DREADDs. We found that disrupting the mPFC impaired consolidating SWRs in the hippocampus. Hippocampal SWR rates depended on the internalized value of the reward (derived from individual flavor preferences), a parameter important in decision‐making, and disrupting the mPFC changed this relationship. Additionally, we found a dissociation between SWRs that occurred while rats were on the maze dependent upon whether those SWRs occurred while the rat was anticipating food reward or during post‐reward consumption.</content:encoded>

Neurons rely on localized mitochondria to fulfill spatially heterogeneous metabolic demands. Mitochondrial aging occurs on timescales shorter than the neuronal lifespan, necessitating transport of fresh material from the soma. Maintaining an optimal distribution of healthy mitochondria requires an interplay between a stationary pool localized to sites of high metabolic demand and a motile pool capable of delivering new material. Interchange between these pools can occur via transient fusion / fission events or by halting and restarting entire mitochondria. Our quantitative model of neuronal mitostasis identifies key parameters that govern steady-state mitochondrial health at discrete locations. Very infrequent exchange between stationary and motile pools optimizes this system. Exchange via transient fusion allows for robust maintenance, which can be further improved by selective recycling through mitophagy. These results provide a framework for quantifying how perturbations in organelle transport and interactions affect mitochondrial homeostasis in neurons, a key aspect underlying many neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SDw2RNzxDJU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Climate drivers such as humidity and temperature may play a key role in influenza seasonal transmission dynamics. Such a relationship has been well defined for temperate regions. However, to date no models capable of capturing the diverse seasonal pattern in tropical and subtropical climates exist. In addition, multiple influenza viruses could cocirculate and shape epidemic dynamics. Here we construct seven mechanistic epidemic models to test the effect of two major climate drivers (humidity and temperature) and multi-strain co-circulation on influenza transmission in Hong Kong, an influenza epidemic center located in the subtropics. Based on model fit to long-term influenza surveillance data from 1998 to 2018, we found that a simple model incorporating the effect of both humidity and temperature best recreated the influenza epidemic patterns observed in Hong Kong. The model quantifies a bimodal effect of absolute humidity on influenza transmission where both low and very high humidity levels facilitate transmission quadratically; the model also quantifies the monotonic but nonlinear relationship with temperature. In addition, model results suggest that, at the population level, a shorter immunity period can approximate the co-circulation of influenza virus (sub)types. The basic reproductive number &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; estimated by the best-fit model is also consistent with laboratory influenza survival and transmission studies under various combinations of humidity and temperature levels. Overall, our study has developed a simple mechanistic model capable of quantifying the impact of climate drivers on influenza transmission in (sub)tropical regions. This model can be applied to improve influenza forecasting in the (sub)tropics in the future.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hlsPTASAxno&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Mechanistic basis of post-treatment control of SIV after anti-α4β7 antibody therapy</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/xrStXoZPNXw/article</link>

Treating macaques with an anti-α4β7 antibody under the umbrella of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) during early SIV infection can lead to viral remission, with viral loads maintained at &amp;lt; 50 SIV RNA copies/ml after removal of all treatment in a subset of animals. Depletion of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; lymphocytes in controllers resulted in transient recrudescence of viremia, suggesting that the combination of cART and anti-α4β7 antibody treatment led to a state where ongoing immune responses kept the virus undetectable in the absence of treatment. A previous mathematical model of HIV infection and cART incorporates immune effector cell responses and exhibits the property of two different viral load set-points. While the lower set-point could correspond to the attainment of long-term viral remission, attaining the higher set-point may be the result of viral rebound. Here we expand that model to include possible mechanisms of action of an anti-α4β7 antibody operating in these treated animals. We show that the model can fit the longitudinal viral load data from both IgG control and anti-α4β7 antibody treated macaques, suggesting explanations for the viral control associated with cART and an anti-α4β7 antibody treatment. This effective perturbation to the virus-host interaction can also explain observations in other nonhuman primate experiments in which cART and immunotherapy have led to post-treatment control or resetting of the viral load set-point. Interestingly, because the viral kinetics in the various treated animals differed—some animals exhibited large fluctuations in viral load after cART cessation—the model suggests that anti-α4β7 treatment could act by different primary mechanisms in different animals and still lead to post-treatment viral control. This outcome is nonetheless in accordance with a model with two stable viral load set-points, in which therapy can perturb the system from one set-point to a lower one through different biological mechanisms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xrStXoZPNXw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Expectancy-based rhythmic entrainment as continuous Bayesian inference</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/VrvLG3Bm1C4/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Jonathan Cannon&lt;/p&gt;

When presented with complex rhythmic auditory stimuli, humans are able to track underlying temporal structure (e.g., a “beat”), both covertly and with their movements. This capacity goes far beyond that of a simple entrained oscillator, drawing on contextual and enculturated timing expectations and adjusting rapidly to perturbations in event timing, phase, and tempo. Previous modeling work has described how entrainment to rhythms may be shaped by event timing expectations, but sheds little light on any underlying computational principles that could unify the phenomenon of expectation-based entrainment with other brain processes. Inspired by the predictive processing framework, we propose that the problem of rhythm tracking is naturally characterized as a problem of continuously estimating an underlying phase and tempo based on precise event times and their correspondence to timing expectations. We present two inference problems formalizing this insight: PIPPET (Phase Inference from Point Process Event Timing) and PATIPPET (Phase and Tempo Inference). Variational solutions to these inference problems resemble previous “Dynamic Attending” models of perceptual entrainment, but introduce new terms representing the dynamics of uncertainty and the influence of expectations in the absence of sensory events. These terms allow us to model multiple characteristics of covert and motor human rhythm tracking not addressed by other models, including sensitivity of error corrections to inter-event interval and perceived tempo changes induced by event omissions. We show that positing these novel influences in human entrainment yields a range of testable behavioral predictions. Guided by recent neurophysiological observations, we attempt to align the phase inference framework with a specific brain implementation. We also explore the potential of this normative framework to guide the interpretation of experimental data and serve as building blocks for even richer predictive processing and active inference models of timing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VrvLG3Bm1C4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Sexually dimorphic perineuronal nets in the rodent and primate reproductive circuit</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25167?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>We analyzed the expression of the perineuronal nets (PNNs) in mouse and marmoset brain. We found that in both species, its expression is present in many subcortical regions and it is strongly associated with the reproductive circuit. We showed that males show higher level of PNNs than females and in the posterior dorsal division of the medial amygdala (MeApd) the PNN is surrounding cells positive for the estrogen receptor alpha (Esr1). These data suggest a new role of PNN in controlling innate behavior circuits and sexual dimorphism.







Abstract
Perineuronal nets are extracellular glycoprotein structures that have been found on some neurons in the central nervous system and that have been shown to regulate their structural plasticity. Until now work on perineuronal nets has been focused on their role in cortical structures where they are selectively expressed on parvalbumin‐positive neurons and are reported to restrict the experience‐dependent plasticity of inhibitory afferents. Here, we examined the expression of perineuronal nets subcortically, showing that they are expressed in several discrete structures, including nuclei that comprise the brain network controlling reproductive behaviors (e.g., mounting, lordosis, aggression, and social defense). In particular, perineuronal nets were found in the posterior dorsal division of the medial amygdala, the medial preoptic nucleus, the posterior medial bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the ventrolateral ventromedial hypothalamus and adjacent tuberal nucleus, and the ventral premammillary nucleus in both the mouse and primate brain. Comparison of perineuronal nets in male and female mice revealed a significant sexually dimorphic expression, with expression found prominently on estrogen receptor expressing neurons in the medial amygdala. These findings suggest that perineuronal nets may be involved in regulating neural plasticity in the mammalian reproductive system.</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Cognitive functions in adult‐onset phenotypes of X‐linked adrenoleukodystrophy</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26141?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
X‐linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X‐ALD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive demyelination ranging from mild myelopathic forms (adrenomyeloneuropathy, AMN) to severe cerebral variants (adult cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy, ACALD). The study's aim was to compare cognitive function in adult‐onset X‐ALD phenotypes.


Methods
Cognitive function in various domains (intelligence, attention, memory, executive function, processing speed) was assessed in N = 172 adults (n = 117 AMN, n = 30 arrested ACALD, n = 25 acute ACALD) using comprehensive neuropsychological batteries. Phenotype differences were examined by analyses of variance.


Results
X‐ALD phenotypes significantly differed in non‐verbal intelligence, sustained attention, verbal encoding, non‐verbal recognition, and processing speed (ps &amp;lt; .050). No group differences emerged regarding verbal intelligence, verbal retrieval and recognition, and executive function (ps &amp;gt; .050). Specifically, patients with acute ACALD showed severe cognitive deficits compared to AMN and norm data, with largest effects on processing speed. Contrary, cognition was overall intact in AMN patients, independent of sex and corticospinal tract involvement, and those with arrested ACALD showed mild cognitive dysfunction, particularly in verbal encoding and processing speed.


Interpretation
Cerebral demyelination in X‐ALD patients causes white matter dementia, mainly characterized by an extreme slowdown in processing speed associated with deficits in attention and learning. Most AMN patients show intact cognitive function. Future prospective, longitudinal studies with more sensitive imaging techniques are required to clarify whether early mild cognitive dysfunction found in some AMN patients may be associated with subtle myelin abnormalities that do not yet appear as white matter lesions on cMRI but have the potential to serve as early predictors of later cerebral progression.

	<title>The Cerebellum: Mapping the Cerebellar Cognitive Affective Syndrome in Patients with Chronic Cerebellar Strokes</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-021-01290-3</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome (CCAS) has been consistently described in patients with acute/subacute cerebellar injuries. However, studies with chronic patients have had controversial findings that have not been explored with new cerebellar-target tests, such as the CCAS scale (CCAS-S). The objective of this research is to prove and contrast the usefulness of the CCAS-S and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test to evaluate cognitive/affective impairments in patients with chronic acquired cerebellar lesions, and to map the cerebellar areas whose lesions correlated with dysfunctions in these tests. CCAS-S and MoCA were administrated to 22 patients with isolated chronic cerebellar strokes and a matched comparison group. The neural bases underpinning both tests were explored with multivariate lesion-symptom mapping (LSM) methods. MoCA and CCAS-S had an adequate test performance with efficient discrimination between patients and healthy volunteers. However, only impairments determined by the CCAS-S resulted in significant regional localization within the cerebellum. Specifically, patients with chronic cerebellar lesions in right-lateralized posterolateral regions manifested cognitive impairments inherent to CCAS. These findings concurred with the anterior-sensorimotor/posterior-cognitive dichotomy in the human cerebellum and revealed clinically intra- and cross-lobular significant regions (portions of right lobule VI, VII, Crus I-II) for verbal tasks that overlap with the “language” functional boundaries in the cerebellum. Our findings prove the usefulness of MoCA and CCAS-S to reveal cognitive impairments in patients with chronic acquired cerebellar lesions. This study extends the understanding of long-term CCAS and introduces multivariate LSM methods to identify clinically intra- and cross-lobular significant regions underpinning chronic CCAS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Adult Age Differences in Self-Reported Pain and Anterior CSF Space in Chiari Malformation</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-021-01289-w</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Chiari malformation type I (CMI) is a neural disorder with sensory, cognitive, and motor defects, as well as headaches. Radiologically, the cerebellar tonsils extend below the foramen magnum. To date, the relationships among adult age, brain morphometry, surgical status, and symptom severity in CMI are unknown. The objective of this study was to better understand the relationships among these variables using causal modeling techniques. Adult CMI patients (80% female) who either had (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 150) or had not (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 151) undergone posterior fossa decompression surgery were assessed using morphometric measures derived from magnetic resonance images (MRI). MRI-based morphometry showed that the area of the CSF pocket anterior to the cervico-medullary junction (anterior CSF space) correlated with age at the time of MRI (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; =  − .21). Also, self-reported pain increased with age (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = .11) and decreased with anterior CSF space (r =  − .18). Age differences in self-reported pain were mediated by anterior CSF space in the cervical spine area—and this effect was particularly salient for non-decompressed CMI patients. As CMI patients age, the anterior CSF space decreases, and this is associated with increased pain—especially for non-decompressed CMI patients. It is recommended that further consideration of age-related decreases in anterior CSF space in CMI patients be given in future research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 1: One-Year Longitudinal Study to Identify Clinical and MRI Measures of Disease Progression in Patients and Presymptomatic Carriers</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Spinocerebellar ataxias type 1 (SCA1) is an autosomal dominant disease usually manifesting in adulthood. We performed a prospective 1-year longitudinal study in 14 presymptomatic mutation carriers (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;pre&lt;/em&gt;SCA1), 11 ataxic patients, and 21 healthy controls. SCA1 patients had a median disease duration of 6 years (range 2–16) and SARA score of 7 points (range 3.5–20). &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Pre&lt;/em&gt;SCA1 had an estimated time before disease onset of 9.7 years (range 4–30), and no signs of ataxia. At baseline, SCA1 patients significantly differed from controls in SARA score (Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia), cognitive tests, and structural MRI measures. Significant volume loss was found in cerebellum, brainstem, basal ganglia, and cortical thinning in frontal, temporal, and occipital regions. &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Pre&lt;/em&gt;SCA1 did not differ from controls. At 1-year follow-up, SCA1 patients showed significant increase in SARA score, and decreased volume of cerebellum (− 0.6%), pons (− 5.5%), superior cerebellar peduncles (− 10.7%), and midbrain (− 3.0%). Signs of disease progression were also observed in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;pre&lt;/em&gt;SCA1 subjects, with increased SARA score and reduced total cerebellar volume. Our exploratory study suggests that clinical scores and MRI measures provide valuable data to monitor and quantify the earliest changes associated with the preclinical and the symptomatic phases of SCA1 disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.678837</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Oxidative stress appears to be a key feature of many neurodegenerative diseases either as a cause or consequence of disease. A range of molecules are subject to oxidation, but in particular, proteins are an important target and measure of oxidative stress. Proteins are subject to a range of oxidative modifications at reactive cysteine residues, and depending on the level of oxidative stress, these modifications may be reversible or irreversible. A range of experimental approaches has been developed to characterize cysteine oxidation of proteins. In particular, mass spectrometry-based proteomic methods have emerged as a powerful means to identify and quantify cysteine oxidation sites on a proteome scale; however, their application to study neurodegenerative diseases is limited to date. Here we provide a guide to these approaches and highlight the under-exploited utility of these methods to measure oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases for biomarker discovery, target engagement and to understand disease mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.662774</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transcriptional regulation is essential for the correct functioning of cells during development and in postnatal life. The basic Helix-loop-Helix (bHLH) superfamily of transcription factors is well conserved throughout evolution and plays critical roles in tissue development and tissue maintenance. A subgroup of this family, called neural lineage bHLH factors, is critical in the development and function of the central nervous system. In this review, we will focus on the function of one subgroup of neural lineage bHLH factors, the Neurod family. The Neurod family has four members: Neurod1, Neurod2, Neurod4, and Neurod6. Available evidence shows that these four factors are key during the development of the cerebral cortex but also in other regions of the central nervous system, such as the cerebellum, the brainstem, and the spinal cord. We will also discuss recent reports that link the dysfunction of these transcription factors to neurological disorders in humans.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.656856</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Handwriting is a complex activity including motor planning and visuomotor integration and referring to some brain areas identified as “writing centers.” Although temporal features of handwriting are as important as spatial ones, to our knowledge, there is no evidence of the description of specific brain areas associated with handwriting tempo. People with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) show handwriting impairments that are mainly referred to as the temporal features of the task. The aim of this work was to assess differences in the brain activation pattern elicited by handwriting between PwMS and healthy controls (HC), with the final goal of identifying possible areas specific for handwriting tempo. Subjects were asked to write a sentence at their spontaneous speed. PwMS differed only in temporal handwriting features from HC and showed reduced activation with a subset of the clusters observed in HC. Spearman’s correlation analysis was performed between handwriting temporal parameters and the activity in the brain areas resulting from the contrast analysis, HC &amp;gt; PwMS. We found that the right inferior parietal lobule (IPL) negatively correlated with the duration of the sentence, indicating that the higher the right IPL activity, the faster the handwriting performance. We propose that the right IPL might be considered a “writing tempo center.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Disrupted Asymmetry of Inter- and Intra-Hemispheric Functional Connectivity at Rest in Medication-Free Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.634557</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Disrupted functional asymmetry of cerebral hemispheres may be altered in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, little is known about whether anomalous brain asymmetries originate from inter- and/or intra-hemispheric functional connectivity (FC) at rest in OCD. In this study, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was applied to 40 medication-free patients with OCD and 38 gender-, age-, and education-matched healthy controls (HCs). Data were analyzed using the parameter of asymmetry (PAS) and support vector machine methods. Patients with OCD showed significantly increased PAS in the left posterior cingulate cortex, left precentral gyrus/postcentral gyrus, and right inferior occipital gyrus and decreased PAS in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), bilateral middle cingulate cortex (MCC), left inferior parietal lobule, and left cerebellum Crus I. A negative correlation was found between decreased PAS in the left DLPFC and Yale–Brown Obsessive-compulsive Scale compulsive behavior scores in the patients. Furthermore, decreased PAS in the bilateral MCC could be used to distinguish OCD from HCs with a sensitivity of 87.50%, an accuracy of 88.46%, and a specificity of 89.47%. These results highlighted the contribution of disrupted asymmetry of intra-hemispheric FC within and outside the cortico-striato-thalamocortical circuits at rest in the pathophysiology of OCD, and reduced intra-hemispheric FC in the bilateral MCC may serve as a potential biomarker to classify individuals with OCD from HCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Cross-Subject EEG Emotion Recognition With Self-Organized Graph Neural Network</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.611653</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As a physiological process and high-level cognitive behavior, emotion is an important subarea in neuroscience research. Emotion recognition across subjects based on brain signals has attracted much attention. Due to individual differences across subjects and the low signal-to-noise ratio of EEG signals, the performance of conventional emotion recognition methods is relatively poor. In this paper, we propose a self-organized graph neural network (SOGNN) for cross-subject EEG emotion recognition. Unlike the previous studies based on pre-constructed and fixed graph structure, the graph structure of SOGNN are dynamically constructed by self-organized module for each signal. To evaluate the cross-subject EEG emotion recognition performance of our model, leave-one-subject-out experiments are conducted on two public emotion recognition datasets, SEED and SEED-IV. The SOGNN is able to achieve state-of-the-art emotion recognition performance. Moreover, we investigated the performance variances of the models with different graph construction techniques or features in different frequency bands. Furthermore, we visualized the graph structure learned by the proposed model and found that part of the structure coincided with previous neuroscience research. The experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model for cross-subject EEG emotion recognition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: ConvDip: A Convolutional Neural Network for Better EEG Source Imaging</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.569918</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The electroencephalography (EEG) is a well-established non-invasive method in neuroscientific research and clinical diagnostics. It provides a high temporal but low spatial resolution of brain activity. To gain insight about the spatial dynamics of the EEG, one has to solve the inverse problem, i.e., finding the neural sources that give rise to the recorded EEG activity. The inverse problem is ill-posed, which means that more than one configuration of neural sources can evoke one and the same distribution of EEG activity on the scalp. Artificial neural networks have been previously used successfully to find either one or two dipole sources. These approaches, however, have never solved the inverse problem in a distributed dipole model with more than two dipole sources. We present ConvDip, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, that solves the EEG inverse problem in a distributed dipole model based on simulated EEG data. We show that (1) ConvDip learned to produce inverse solutions from a single time point of EEG data and (2) outperforms state-of-the-art methods on all focused performance measures. (3) It is more flexible when dealing with varying number of sources, produces less ghost sources and misses less real sources than the comparison methods. It produces plausible inverse solutions for real EEG recordings from human participants. (4) The trained network needs &amp;lt;40 ms for a single prediction. Our results qualify ConvDip as an efficient and easy-to-apply novel method for source localization in EEG data, with high relevance for clinical applications, e.g., in epileptology and real-time applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Approximate Number Sense in Students With Severe Hearing Loss: A Modality-Neutral Cognitive Ability</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.688144</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Approximate Number System (ANS) allows humans and non-human animals to estimate large quantities without counting. It is most commonly studied in visual contexts (i.e., with displays containing different numbers of dots), although the ANS may operate on all approximate quantities regardless of modality (e.g., estimating the number of a series of auditory tones). Previous research has shown that there is a link between ANS and mathematics abilities, and that this link is resilient to differences in visual experience (Kanjlia et al., 2018). However, little is known about the function of the ANS and its relationship to mathematics abilities in the absence of other types of sensory input. Here, we investigated the acuity of the ANS and its relationship with mathematics abilities in a group of students from the Sichuan Province in China, half of whom were deaf. We found, consistent with previous research, that ANS acuity improves with age. We found that mathematics ability was predicted by Non-verbal IQ and Inhibitory Control, but not visual working memory capacity or Attention Network efficiencies. Even above and beyond these predictors, ANS ability still accounted for unique variance in mathematics ability. Notably, there was no interaction with hearing, which indicates that the role played by the ANS in explaining mathematics competence is not modulated by hearing capacity. Finally, we found that age, Non-verbal IQ and Visual Working Memory capacity were predictive of ANS performance when controlling for other factors. In fact, although students with hearing loss performed slightly worse than students with normal hearing on the ANS task, hearing was no longer significantly predictive of ANS performance once other factors were taken into account. These results indicate that the ANS is able to develop at a consistent pace with other cognitive abilities in the absence of auditory experience, and that its relationship with mathematics ability is not contingent on sensory input from hearing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Genome-Wide Association Study of Motor Coordination</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.669902</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The ability to finely control our movement is key to achieving many of the educational milestones and life-skills we develop throughout our lives. Despite the centrality of coordination to early development, there is a vast gap in our understanding of the underlying biology. Like most complex traits, both genetics and environment influence motor coordination, however, the specific genes, early environmental risk factors and molecular pathways are unknown. Previous studies have shown that about 5% of school-age children experience unexplained difficulties with motor coordination. These children are said to have Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD). For children with DCD, these motor coordination difficulties significantly impact their everyday life and learning. DCD is associated with poorer academic achievement, reduced quality of life, it can constrain career opportunities and increase the risk of mental health issues in adulthood. Despite the high prevalence of coordination difficulties, many children remain undiagnosed by healthcare professionals. Compounding under-diagnosis in the clinic, research into the etiology of DCD is severely underrepresented in the literature. Here we present the first genome-wide association study to examine the genetic basis of early motor coordination in the context of motor difficulties. Using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children we generate a derived measure of motor coordination from four components of the Movement Assessment Battery for Children, providing an overall measure of coordination across the full range of ability. We perform the first genome-wide association analysis focused on motor coordination (N = 4542). No single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) met the threshold for genome-wide significance, however, 59 SNPs showed suggestive associations. Three regions contained multiple suggestively associated SNPs, within five preliminary candidate genes: IQSEC1, LRCC1, SYNJ2B2, ADAM20, and ADAM21. Association to the gene IQSEC1 suggests a potential link to axon guidance and dendritic projection processes as a potential underlying mechanism of motor coordination difficulties. This represents an interesting potential mechanism, and whilst further validation is essential, it generates a direct window into the biology of motor coordination difficulties. This research has identified potential biological drivers of DCD, a first step towards understanding this common, yet neglected neurodevelopmental disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neural Entrainment Meets Behavior: The Stability Index as a Neural Outcome Measure of Auditory-Motor Coupling</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.668918</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Understanding rhythmic behavior in the context of coupled auditory and motor systems has been of interest to neurological rehabilitation, in particular, to facilitate walking. Recent work based on behavioral measures revealed an entrainment effect of auditory rhythms on motor rhythms. In this study, we propose a method to compute the neural component of such a process from an electroencephalographic (EEG) signal. A simple auditory-motor synchronization paradigm was used, where 28 healthy participants were instructed to synchronize their finger-tapping with a metronome. The computation of the neural outcome measure was carried out in two blocks. In the first block, we used Generalized Eigendecomposition (GED) to reduce the data dimensionality to the component which maximally entrained to the metronome frequency. The scalp topography pointed at brain activity over contralateral sensorimotor regions. In the second block, we computed instantaneous frequency from the analytic signal of the extracted component. This returned a time-varying measure of frequency fluctuations, whose standard deviation provided our “stability index” as a neural outcome measure of auditory-motor coupling. Finally, the proposed neural measure was validated by conducting a correlation analysis with a set of behavioral outcomes from the synchronization task: resultant vector length, relative phase angle, mean asynchrony, and tempo matching. Significant moderate negative correlations were found with the first three measures, suggesting that the stability index provided a quantifiable neural outcome measure of entrainment, with selectivity towards phase-correction mechanisms. We address further adoption of the proposed approach, especially with populations where sensorimotor abilities are compromised by an underlying pathological condition. The impact of using stability index can potentially be used as an outcome measure to assess rehabilitation protocols, and possibly provide further insight into neuropathological models of auditory-motor coupling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Bilateral Amygdala Radio-Frequency Ablation for Refractory Aggressive Behavior Alters Local Cortical Thickness to a Pattern Found in Non-refractory Patients</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.653631</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aggressive behaviors comprise verbal and/or physical aggression directed toward oneself, others, or objects and are highly prevalent among psychiatric patients, especially patients diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and severe intellectual disabilities. Some of these patients are considered refractory to treatment, and functional neurosurgery targeting the amygdala can result in widespread plastic brain changes that might reflect ceasing of some abnormal brain function, offering symptom alleviation. This study investigated cortical thickness changes in refractory aggressive behavior patients that were treated with bilateral amygdala ablation and compared to control patients presenting non-refractory aggressive behavior [three refractory and seven non-refractory patients, all males diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disabilities]. The Overt Aggression Scale (OAS) was used to quantify behavior and magnetic resonance imaging was performed to investigate cortical thickness. Before surgery, both groups presented similar total OAS score, however refractory patients presented higher physical aggression against others. After surgery the refractory group showed 88% average reduction of aggressive behavior. Imaging analysis showed that while refractory patients present an overall reduction in cortical thickness compared to non-refractory patients across both timepoints, the local pattern of thickness difference found in areas of the neurocircuitry of aggressive behavior present before surgery is diminished and no longer detected after surgery. These results corroborate the hypotheses on induction of widespread neuronal plasticity following functional neurosurgical procedures resulting in modifications in brain morphology and improvement in behavior. Further studies are necessary to determine the underlying cause of these morphological changes and to better understand and improve treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Oxytocin Regulates Synaptic Transmission in the Sensory Cortices in a Developmentally Dynamic Manner</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.673439</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The development and stabilization of neuronal circuits are critical to proper brain function. Synapses are the building blocks of neural circuits. Here we examine the effects of the neuropeptide oxytocin on synaptic transmission in L2/3 pyramidal neurons of the barrel field of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1BF). We find that perfusion of oxytocin onto acute brain slices significantly increases the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSC) of S1BF L2/3 pyramidal neurons at P10 and P14, but reduces it at the later ages of P22 and P28; the transition occurs at around P18. Since oxytocin expression is itself regulated by sensory experience, we also examine whether the effects of oxytocin on excitatory synaptic transmission correlate with that of sensory experience. We find that, indeed, the effects of sensory experience and oxytocin on excitatory synaptic transmission of L2/3 pyramidal neurons both peak at around P14 and plateau around P18, suggesting that they regulate a specific form of synaptic plasticity in L2/3 pyramidal neurons, with a sensitive/critical period ending around P18. Consistently, oxytocin receptor (Oxtr) expression in glutamatergic neurons of the upper layers of the cerebral cortex peaks around P14. By P28, however, Oxtr expression becomes more prominent in GABAergic neurons, especially somatostatin (SST) neurons. At P28, oxytocin perfusion increases inhibitory synaptic transmission and reduces excitatory synaptic transmission, effects that result in a net reduction of neuronal excitation, in contrast to increased excitation at P14. Using oxytocin knockout mice and Oxtr conditional knockout mice, we show that loss-of-function of oxytocin affects baseline excitatory synaptic transmission, while Oxtr is required for oxytocin-induced changes in excitatory synaptic transmission, at both P14 and P28. Together, these results demonstrate that oxytocin has complex and dynamic functions in regulating synaptic transmission in cortical L2/3 pyramidal neurons. These findings add to existing knowledge of the function of oxytocin in regulating neural circuit development and plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dementia describes a set of symptoms that occur in neurodegenerative disorders and that is characterized by gradual loss of cognitive and behavioral functions. Recently, non-invasive neurofeedback training has been explored as a potential complementary treatment for patients suffering from dementia or mild cognitive impairment. Here we systematically reviewed studies that explored neurofeedback training protocols based on electroencephalography or functional magnetic resonance imaging for these groups of patients. From a total of 1,912 screened studies, 10 were included in our final sample (N = 208 independent participants in experimental and N = 81 in the control groups completing the primary endpoint). We compared the clinical efficacy across studies, and evaluated their experimental designs and reporting quality. In most studies, patients showed improved scores in different cognitive tests. However, data from randomized controlled trials remains scarce, and clinical evidence based on standardized metrics is still inconclusive. In light of recent meta-research developments in the neurofeedback field and beyond, quality and reporting practices of individual studies are reviewed. We conclude with recommendations on best practices for future studies that investigate the effects of neurofeedback training in dementia and cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The amygdala is a brain area involved in emotional regulation and pain. Over the course of the last 20 years, multiple researchers have studied sensory and motor connections within the amygdala in trying to understand the ultimate role of this structure in pain perception and descending control of pain. A number of investigators have been using cell-type specific manipulations to probe the underlying circuitry of the amygdala. As data have accumulated in this research space, we recognized a critical need for a single framework to integrate these data and evaluate emergent system-level responses. In this manuscript, we present an agent-based computational model of two distinct inhibitory neuron populations in the amygdala, those that express protein kinase C delta (PKC&lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt;) and those that express somatostatin (SOM). We utilized a network of neural links to simulate connectivity and the transmission of inhibitory signals between neurons. Type-specific parameters describing the response of these neurons to noxious stimuli were estimated from published physiological and immunological data as well as our own wet-lab experiments. The model outputs an abstract measure of pain, which is calculated in terms of the cumulative pro-nociceptive and anti-nociceptive activity across neurons in both hemispheres of the amygdala. Results demonstrate the ability of the model to produce changes in pain that are consistent with published studies and highlight the importance of several model parameters. In particular, we found that the relative proportion of PKC&lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt; and SOM neurons within each hemisphere is a key parameter in predicting pain and we explored model predictions for three possible values of this parameter. We compared model predictions of pain to data from our earlier behavioral studies and found areas of similarity as well as distinctions between the data sets. These differences, in particular, suggest a number of wet-lab experiments that could be done in the future.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-Gu4XwB9cP4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Mechanism of collagen folding propagation studied by Molecular Dynamics simulations</title>

Collagen forms a characteristic triple helical structure and plays a central role for stabilizing the extra-cellular matrix. After a C-terminal nucleus formation folding proceeds to form long triple-helical fibers. The molecular details of triple helix folding process is of central importance for an understanding of several human diseases associated with misfolded or unstable collagen fibrils. However, the folding propagation is too rapid to be studied by experimental high resolution techniques. We employed multiple Molecular Dynamics simulations starting from unfolded peptides with an already formed nucleus to successfully follow the folding propagation in atomic detail. The triple helix folding was found to propagate involving first two chains forming a short transient template. Secondly, three residues of the third chain fold on this template with an overall mean propagation of ~75 ns per unit. The formation of loops with multiples of the repeating unit was found as a characteristic misfolding event especially when starting from an unstable nucleus. Central Gly→Ala or Gly→Thr substitutions resulted in reduced stability and folding rates due to structural deformations interfering with folding propagation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/BEGFFLCXFNk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Cytometry analysis has seen a considerable expansion in recent years in the maximum number of parameters that can be acquired in a single experiment. In response to this technological advance there has been an increased effort to develop new computational methodologies for handling high-dimensional single cell data acquired by flow or mass cytometry. Despite the success of numerous algorithms and published packages to replicate and outperform traditional manual analysis, widespread adoption of these techniques has yet to be realised in the field of immunology. Here we present CytoPy, a Python framework for automated analysis of cytometry data that integrates a document-based database for a data-centric and iterative analytical environment. In addition, our algorithm agnostic design provides a platform for open-source cytometry bioinformatics in the Python ecosystem. We demonstrate the ability of CytoPy to phenotype T cell subsets in whole blood samples even in the presence of significant batch effects due to technical and user variation. The complete analytical pipeline was then used to immunophenotype the local inflammatory infiltrate in individuals with and without acute bacterial infection. CytoPy is open-source and licensed under the MIT license. CytoPy is open source and available at https://github.com/burtonrj/CytoPy, with notebooks accompanying this manuscript (https://github.com/burtonrj/CytoPyManuscript) and software documentation at https://cytopy.readthedocs.io/.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8IPwo40Bi6A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Research exploring the underlying neuroanatomical correlates of early motherhood seems to suggest that the period after giving birth is marked by tissue increases in the mother's brain. While some studies point to the amygdala as one of the areas undergoing postpartum changes, existing analyses did not discriminate between the different subregions of this functionally heterogeneous structure. Thus, to further extend this understudied field of research and to better understand the potential role of the amygdala when transitioning to motherhood, we applied an advanced region‐of‐interest technique that enabled us to analyze the amygdala as a whole as well as its different subareas, specifically the left and right centromedian (CM), laterobasal (LB), and superficial (SF) regions. Comparing the brains of 14 healthy women between immediate postpartum (within 1–2 days of childbirth) and late postpartum (at 4–6 weeks after childbirth), we revealed increases of the amygdala. However, effects manifested differentially across subareas, with particularly strong effects for the SF region, moderate effects for the CM region, and no effects for the LB region. These findings might reflect region‐specific adaptations of the mother's brain tuning into the distinct and ever‐changing needs of a newborn, either as a cause for it or as a consequence thereof.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23337?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
The hippocampus is particularly susceptible to neurodegeneration. Physical activity, specifically increasing cardiorespiratory fitness via aerobic exercise, shows promise as a potential method for mitigating hippocampal decline in humans. Numerous studies have now investigated associations between the structure and function of the hippocampus and engagement in physical activity. Still, there remains continued debate and confusion about the relationship between physical activity and the human hippocampus. In this review, we describe the current state of the physical activity and exercise literature as it pertains to the structure and function of the human hippocampus, focusing on four magnetic resonance imaging measures: volume, diffusion tensor imaging, resting‐state functional connectivity, and perfusion. We conclude that, despite significant heterogeneity in study methods, populations of interest, and scope, there are consistent positive findings, suggesting a promising role for physical activity in promoting hippocampal structure and function throughout the lifespan.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Distinct patterns of hippocampal activity associated with color and spatial source memory</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23368?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
The hippocampus is known to be involved in source memory across a wide variety of stimuli and source types. Thus, source memory activity in the hippocampus is thought to be domain‐general such that different types of source information are similarly processed in the hippocampus. However, there is some evidence of domain‐specificity for spatial and temporal source information. The current fMRI study aimed to determine whether patterns of activity in the hippocampus differed for two types of visual source information: spatial location and background color. Participants completed three runs of a spatial memory task and three runs of a color memory task. During the study phase, 32 line drawings of common objects and animals were presented to either the left or right of fixation for the spatial memory task or on either a red or green background for the color memory task. During the test phase of both tasks, 48 object word labels were presented in the center of the screen and participants classified the corresponding item as old and previously on the “left”/on a “green” background, old and previously on the “right”/on a “red” background, or “new.” Two analysis methods were employed to assess whether hippocampal activity differed between the two source types: a general linear model analysis and a classification‐based searchlight multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA). The searchlight MVPA revealed that activity associated with spatial memory and color memory could be classified with above‐chance accuracy in a region of the right anterior hippocampus, and a follow‐up analysis revealed that there was a significant effect of memory accuracy. These results indicate that different types of source memory are represented by distinct patterns of activity in the hippocampus.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.682419</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recording brain activity during speech production using magnetoencephalography (MEG) can help us to understand the dynamics of speech production. However, these measurements are challenging due to the induced artifacts coming from several sources such as facial muscle activity, lower jaw and head movements. Here, we aimed to characterize speech-related artifacts, focusing on head movements, and subsequently present an approach to remove these artifacts from MEG data. We recorded MEG from 11 healthy participants while they pronounced various syllables in different loudness. Head positions/orientations were extracted during speech production to investigate its role in MEG distortions. Finally, we present an artifact rejection approach using the combination of regression analysis and signal space projection (SSP) in order to correct the induced artifact from MEG data. Our results show that louder speech leads to stronger head movements and stronger MEG distortions. Our proposed artifact rejection approach could successfully remove the speech-related artifact and retrieve the underlying neurophysiological signals. As the presented artifact rejection approach was shown to remove artifacts arising from head movements, induced by overt speech in the MEG, it will facilitate research addressing the neural basis of speech production with MEG.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.639643</link>
	<content:encoded>Aim&lt;p&gt;In PET imaging, the different types of radiotracers and accumulations, as well as the diversity of disease patterns, make the analysis of molecular imaging data acquired in vivo challenging. Here, we evaluate and validate a semi-automated MRI template-based data analysis tool that allows preclinical PET images to be aligned to a self-created PET template. Based on the user-defined volume-of-interest (VOI), image data can then be evaluated using three different semi-quantitative parameters: normalized activity, standardized uptake value, and uptake ratio.&lt;/p&gt;Materials and Methods&lt;p&gt;The nuclear medicine Data Processing Analysis tool (NU_DPA) was implemented in Matlab. Testing and validation of the tool was performed using two types of radiotracers in different kinds of stroke-related brain diseases in rat models. The radiotracers used are 2-[&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose ([&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG), a metabolic tracer with symmetrical distribution in brain, and [&lt;sup&gt;68&lt;/sup&gt;Ga]Ga-Fucoidan, a target-selective radioligand specifically binding to p-selectin. After manual image import, the NU_DPA tool automatically creates an averaged PET template out of the acquired PET images, to which all PET images are then aligned onto. The added MRI template-based information, resized to the lower PET resolution, defines the VOI and also allows a precise subdivision of the VOI into individual sub-regions. The aligned PET images can then be evaluated semi-quantitatively for all regions defined in the MRI atlas. In addition, a statistical analysis and evaluation of the semi-quantitative parameters can then be performed in the NU_DPA tool.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Using ischemic stroke data in Wistar rats as an example, the statistical analysis of the tool should be demonstrated. In this [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG-PET experiment, three different experimental states were compared: healthy control state, ischemic stroke without electrical stimulation, ischemic stroke with electrical stimulation. Thereby, statistical data evaluation using the NU_DPA tool showed that the glucose metabolism in a photothrombotic lesion can be influenced by electrical stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our NU_DPA tool allows a very flexible data evaluation of small animal PET data in vivo including statistical data evaluation. Using the radiotracers [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG and [&lt;sup&gt;68&lt;/sup&gt;Ga]Ga-Fucoidan, it was shown that the semi-automatic MRI-template based data analysis of the NU_DPA tool is potentially suitable for both metabolic radiotracers as well as target-selective radiotracers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Localization of the Epileptogenic Zone by Multimodal Neuroimaging and High-Frequency Oscillation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.677840</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Accurate localization of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) is a key factor to obtain good surgical outcome for refractory epilepsy patients. However, no technique, so far, can precisely locate the EZ, and there are barely any reports on the combined application of multiple technologies to improve the localization accuracy of the EZ. In this study, we aimed to explore the use of a multimodal method combining PET-MRI, fluid and white matter suppression (FLAWS)—a novel MRI sequence, and high-frequency oscillation (HFO) automated analysis to delineate EZ. We retrospectively collected 15 patients with refractory epilepsy who underwent surgery and used the above three methods to detect abnormal brain areas of all patients. We compared the PET-MRI, FLAWS, and HFO results with traditional methods to evaluate their diagnostic value. The sensitivities, specificities of locating the EZ, and marking extent removed versus not removed [RatioChann(ev)] of each method were compared with surgical outcome. We also tested the possibility of using different combinations to locate the EZ. The marked areas in every patient established using each method were also compared to determine the correlations among the three methods. The results showed that PET-MRI, FLAWS, and HFOs can provide more information about potential epileptic areas than traditional methods. When detecting the EZs, the sensitivities of PET-MRI, FLAWS, and HFOs were 68.75, 53.85, and 87.50%, and the specificities were 80.00, 33.33, and 100.00%. The RatioChann(ev) of HFO-marked contacts was significantly higher in patients with good outcome than those with poor outcome (p&amp;lt; 0.05). When intracranial electrodes covered all the abnormal areas indicated by neuroimaging with the overlapping EZs being completely removed referred to HFO analysis, patients could reach seizure-free (p &amp;lt; 0.01). The periphery of the lesion marked by neuroimaging may be epileptic, but not every lesion contributes to seizures. Therefore, approaches in multimodality can detect EZ more accurately, and HFO analysis may help in defining real epileptic areas that may be missed in the neuroimaging results. The implantation of intracranial electrodes guided by non-invasive PET-MRI and FLAWS findings as well as HFO analysis would be an optimized multimodal approach for locating EZ.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: MR Tractography-Based Targeting and Physiological Identification of the Cuneiform Nucleus for Directional DBS in a Parkinson’s Disease Patient With Levodopa-Resistant Freezing of Gait</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.676755</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Freezing of gait (FOG) is a debilitating motor deficit in a subset of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) patients that is poorly responsive to levodopa or deep brain stimulation (DBS) of established PD targets. The proposal of a DBS target in the midbrain, known as the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), to address FOG was based on its observed neuropathology in PD and its hypothesized involvement in locomotor control as a part of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR). Initial reports of PPN DBS were met with enthusiasm; however, subsequent studies reported mixed results. A closer review of the MLR basic science literature, suggests that the closely related cuneiform nucleus (CnF), dorsal to the PPN, may be a superior site to promote gait. Although suspected to have a conserved role in the control of gait in humans, deliberate stimulation of a homolog to the CnF in humans using directional DBS electrodes has not been attempted.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;As part of an open-label Phase 1 clinical study, one PD patient with predominantly axial symptoms and severe FOG refractory to levodopa therapy was implanted with directional DBS electrodes (Boston Science Vercise Cartesia&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;) targeting the CnF bilaterally. Since the CnF is a poorly defined reticular nucleus, targeting was guided both by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography and anatomical landmarks. Intraoperative stimulation and microelectrode recordings were performed near the targets with leg EMG surface recordings in the subject.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Post-operative imaging revealed accurate targeting of both leads to the designated CnF. Intraoperative stimulation near the target at low thresholds in the awake patient evoked involuntary electromyography (EMG) oscillations in the legs with a peak power at the stimulation frequency, similar to observations with CnF DBS in animals. Oscillopsia was the primary side effect evoked at higher currents, especially when directed posterolaterally. Directional DBS could mitigate oscillopsia.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;DTI-based targeting and intraoperative stimulation to evoke limb EMG activity may be useful methods to help target the CnF accurately and safely in patients. Long term follow-up and detailed gait testing of patients undergoing CnF stimulation will be necessary to confirm the effects on FOG.&lt;/p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration&lt;p&gt;Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT04218526.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Improved Pre-attentive Processing With Occipital rTMS Treatment in Major Depressive Disorder Patients Revealed by MMN</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.648816</link>
	<content:encoded>Objectives&lt;p&gt;To investigate the improvement effect of occipital repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) combined with escitalopram oxalate tablets on pre-attentive processing in patients with first-episode, medication-naive depression.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Patients who were hospitalized between January and December 2019 were selected. They were randomly allocated to real occipital rTMS stimulation group with 27 cases receiving intermittent theta-burst (iTBS) and sham stimulation group with 24 cases over 20 days. The rTMS treatment target is located at the Oz point of the occipital region. Both groups took escitalopram oxalate tablets, and the average daily drug dose was 15.294 ± 5.041 mg. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) was used to assess the symptoms of depression before and after treatment, and mismatch negativity (MMN) was used to assess the improvement of pre-attentive processing before and after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;After 20 days of treatment, the total score of HAMD (13.495 ± 3.700) in both groups was significantly lower than that before treatment [21.910 ± 3.841, F(1, 49) = 46, 3.690, p &amp;lt; 0.001]. After treatment, the latency of MMN in the real stimulation group (182.204 ± 31.878 ms) was significantly lower than that in the sham stimulation group (219.896 ± 42.634 ms, p &amp;lt; 0.001), and the amplitude of MMN in the real stimulation group (−7.107 ± 3.374 ms) was significantly higher than that in the sham stimulation group (−2.773 ± 3.7 32 ms, p &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Occipital rTMS treatment can enhance the early therapeutic effect and effectively improve the pre-attentive processing of patients with depression and provide a scientific basis for the new target of rTMS therapy in clinical patients with depression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Analysis of Fine Motor Skills in Essential Tremor: Combining Neuroimaging and Handwriting Biomarkers for Early Management</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.648573</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Essential tremor (ET) is a highly prevalent neurological disorder characterized by action-induced tremors involving the hand, voice, head, and/or face. Importantly, hand tremor is present in nearly all forms of ET, resulting in impaired fine motor skills and diminished quality of life. To advance early diagnostic approaches for ET, automated handwriting tasks and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offer an opportunity to develop early essential clinical biomarkers. In this study, we present a novel approach for the early clinical diagnosis and monitoring of ET based on integrating handwriting and neuroimaging analysis. We demonstrate how the analysis of fine motor skills, as measured by an automated Archimedes’ spiral task, is correlated with neuroimaging biomarkers for ET. Together, we present a novel modeling approach that can serve as a complementary and promising support tool for the clinical diagnosis of ET and a large range of tremors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Dynamics of the Auditory Continuity Illusion</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.676637</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Illusions give intriguing insights into perceptual and neural dynamics. In the auditory continuity illusion, two brief tones separated by a silent gap may be heard as one continuous tone if a noise burst with appropriate characteristics fills the gap. This illusion probes the conditions under which listeners link related sounds across time and maintain perceptual continuity in the face of sudden changes in sound mixtures. Conceptual explanations of this illusion have been proposed, but its neural basis is still being investigated. In this work we provide a dynamical systems framework, grounded in principles of neural dynamics, to explain the continuity illusion. We construct an idealized firing rate model of a neural population and analyze the conditions under which firing rate responses persist during the interruption between the two tones. First, we show that sustained inputs and hysteresis dynamics (a mismatch between tone levels needed to activate and inactivate the population) can produce continuous responses. Second, we show that transient inputs and bistable dynamics (coexistence of two stable firing rate levels) can also produce continuous responses. Finally, we combine these input types together to obtain neural dynamics consistent with two requirements for the continuity illusion as articulated in a well-known theory of auditory scene analysis: responses persist through the noise-filled gap if noise provides sufficient evidence that the tone continues and if there is no evidence of discontinuities between the tones and noise. By grounding these notions in a quantitative model that incorporates elements of neural circuits (recurrent excitation, and mutual inhibition, specifically), we identify plausible mechanisms for the continuity illusion. Our findings can help guide future studies of neural correlates of this illusion and inform development of more biophysically-based models of the auditory continuity illusion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: First Encounters: Effects of the Microbiota on Neonatal Brain Development</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.682505</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The microbiota plays important roles in host metabolism and immunity, and its disruption affects adult brain physiology and behavior. Although such findings have been attributed to altered neurodevelopment, few studies have actually examined microbiota effects on the developing brain. This review focuses on developmental effects of the earliest exposure to microbes. At birth, the mammalian fetus enters a world teeming with microbes which colonize all body sites in contact with the environment. Bacteria reach the gut within a few hours of birth and cause a measurable response in the intestinal epithelium. In adults, the gut microbiota signals to the brain via the vagus nerve, bacterial metabolites, hormones, and immune signaling, and work in perinatal rodents is beginning to elucidate which of these signaling pathways herald the very first encounter with gut microbes in the neonate. Neural effects of the microbiota during the first few days of life include changes in neuronal cell death, microglia, and brain cytokine levels. In addition to these effects of direct exposure of the newborn to microbes, accumulating evidence points to a role for the maternal microbiota in affecting brain development via bacterial molecules and metabolites while the offspring is still in utero. Hence, perturbations to microbial exposure perinatally, such as through C-section delivery or antibiotic treatment, alter microbiota colonization and may have long-term neural consequences. The perinatal period is critical for brain development and a close look at microbiota effects during this time promises to reveal the earliest, most primary effects of the microbiota on neurodevelopment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Gap Junctions Between Striatal D1 Neurons and Cholinergic Interneurons</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.674399</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The striatum participates in numerous important behaviors. Its principal projection neurons use GABA and peptides as neurotransmitters and interact extensively with interneurons, including cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) that are tonically active. Dissecting the interactions between projection neurons and ChIs is important for uncovering the role and mechanisms of the striatal microcircuits. Here, by combining several optogenetic tools with cell type-specific electrophysiological recordings, we uncovered direct electrical coupling between D1-type projection neurons and ChIs, in addition to the chemical transmission between these two major cell types. Optogenetic stimulation or inhibition led to bilateral current exchanges between D1 neurons and ChIs, which can be abolished by gap junction blockers. We further confirmed the presence of gap junctions through paired electrophysiological recordings and dye microinjections. Finally, we found that activating D1 neurons promotes basal activity of ChIs via gap junctions. Collectively, these results reveal the coexistence of the chemical synapse and gap junctions between D1 neurons and ChIs, which contributes to maintaining the tonically active firing patterns of ChIs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.605030</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke is one of the most common neurological diseases. However, the impact of ischemic stroke on human cerebral tissue remains largely unknown due to a lack of ischemic human brain samples. In this study, we applied cerebral organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells to evaluate the effect of oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R). Pathway analysis showed the relationships between vitamin digestion and absorption, fat digestion and absorption, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway, and complement and coagulation cascades. Combinational verification with transcriptome and gene expression analysis of different cell types revealed fatty acids-related PPAR signaling pathway and pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2) as key markers of neuronal cells in response to OGD/R. These findings suggest that, although there remain some limitations to be improved, our ischemic stroke model using human cerebral organoids would be a potentially useful tool when combined with other conventional two-dimensional (2D) mono-culture systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Maternal Deprivation in Rats Decreases the Expression of Interneuron Markers in the Neocortex and Hippocampus</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.670766</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Early life stress has profound effects on the development of the central nervous system. We exposed 9-day-old rat pups to a 24 h maternal deprivation (MD) and sacrificed them as young adults (60-day-old), with the aim to study the effects of early stress on forebrain circuitry. We estimated numbers of various immunohistochemically defined interneuron subpopulations in several neocortical regions and in the hippocampus. MD rats showed reduced numbers of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and in the prefrontal cortex, compared with controls. Numbers of reelin-expressing and calretinin-expressing interneurons were also reduced in the CA1 and CA3 hippocampal areas, but unaltered in the neocortex of MD rats. The number of calbinin-expressing interneurons in the neocortex was similar in the MD rats compared with controls. We analyzed cell death in 15-day-old rats after MD and found no difference compared to control rats. Thus, our results more likely reflect the downregulation of markers than the actual loss of interneurons. To investigate synaptic activity in the hippocampus we immunostained for glutamatergic and inhibitory vesicular transporters. The number of inhibitory synapses was decreased in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus in MD rats, with the normal number of excitatory synapses. Our results indicate complex, cell type-specific, and region-specific alterations in the inhibitory circuitry induced by maternal deprivation. Such alterations may underlie symptoms of MD at the behavioral level and possibly contribute to mechanisms by which early life stress causes neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.687246</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke is a severe cerebrovascular disease with high mortality and morbidity. In recent years, reperfusion treatments based on thrombolytic and thrombectomy are major managements for ischemic stroke patients, and the recanalization time window has been extended to over 24 h. However, with the extension of the time window, the risk of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury following reperfusion therapy becomes a big challenge for patient outcomes. I/R injury leads to neuronal death due to the imbalance in metabolic supply and demand, which is usually related to mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitophagy is a type of selective autophagy referring to the process of specific autophagic elimination of damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria to prevent the generation of excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the subsequent cell death. Recent advances have implicated the protective role of mitophagy in cerebral ischemia is mainly associated with its neuroprotective effects in I/R injury. This review discusses the involvement of mitochondria dynamics and mitophagy in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke and I/R injury in particular, focusing on the therapeutic potential of mitophagy regulation and the possibility of using mitophagy-related interventions as an adjunctive approach for neuroprotective time window extension after ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.658376</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by the complex interaction of multiple mechanisms. Recent studies examining the effect of high-fat diet (HFD) on the AD phenotype have demonstrated a significant influence on both inflammation and cognition. However, different studies on the effect of high-fat diet on AD pathology have reported conflicting conclusions. To explore the involvement of HFD in AD, we investigated phenotypic and metabolic changes in an AD mouse model in response to HFD. The results indicated there was no significant effect on Aβ levels or contextual memory due to HFD treatment. Of note, HFD did moderate neuroinflammation, despite spurring inflammation and increasing cholesterol levels in the periphery. In addition, diet affected gut microbiota symbiosis, altering the production of bacterial metabolites. HFD created a favorable microenvironment for bile acid alteration and arachidonic acid metabolism in APP/PS1 mice, which may be related to the observed improvement in LXR/PPAR expression. Our previous research demonstrated that Huanglian Jiedu decoction (HLJDD) significantly ameliorated impaired learning and memory. Furthermore, HLJDD may globally suppress inflammation and lipid accumulation to relieve cognitive impairment after HFD intervention. It was difficult to define the effect of HFD on AD progression because the results were influenced by confounding factors and biases. Although there was still obvious damage in AD mice treated with HFD, there was no deterioration and there was even a slight remission of neuroinflammation. Moreover, HLJDD represents a potential AD drug based on its anti-inflammatory and lipid-lowering effects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MAP2K5, a member of the MAPK family, is associated with central nervous system disorders. However, neural functional of Map2k5 from animal models were not well examined so far. Here, we established a Map2k5-targeted knockout mouse model to investigate the behavior phenotypes and its underlying molecular mechanism. Our results showed that female Map2k5 mutant mice manifested decreased circadian-dependent ambulatory locomotion, coordination, and fatigue. Male Map2k5 mutant mice displayed impairment in open field exploration and prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle response (ASR) when compared with wild-type controls. Furthermore, Map2k5 mutant mice showed a decreased dopaminergic cell survival and tyrosine hydroxylase levels in nigrostriatal pathway, indicating a crucial role of MAP2K5 in regulating dopamine system in the central nervous system.

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Effect of cellular rearrangement time delays on the rheology of vertex models for confluent tissues</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/6fEXLvSFyso/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Gonca Erdemci-Tandogan, M. Lisa Manning&lt;/p&gt;

Large-scale tissue deformation during biological processes such as morphogenesis requires cellular rearrangements. The simplest rearrangement in confluent cellular monolayers involves neighbor exchanges among four cells, called a T1 transition, in analogy to foams. But unlike foams, cells must execute a sequence of molecular processes, such as endocytosis of adhesion molecules, to complete a T1 transition. Such processes could take a long time compared to other timescales in the tissue. In this work, we incorporate this idea by augmenting vertex models to require a fixed, finite time for T1 transitions, which we call the “T1 delay time”. We study how variations in T1 delay time affect tissue mechanics, by quantifying the relaxation time of tissues in the presence of T1 delays and comparing that to the cell-shape based timescale that characterizes fluidity in the absence of any T1 delays. We show that the molecular-scale T1 delay timescale dominates over the cell shape-scale collective response timescale when the T1 delay time is the larger of the two. We extend this analysis to tissues that become anisotropic under convergent extension, finding similar results. Moreover, we find that increasing the T1 delay time increases the percentage of higher-fold coordinated vertices and rosettes, and decreases the overall number of successful T1s, contributing to a more elastic-like—and less fluid-like—tissue response. Our work suggests that molecular mechanisms that act as a brake on T1 transitions could stiffen global tissue mechanics and enhance rosette formation during morphogenesis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6fEXLvSFyso&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Divisive normalization (DN) is a prominent computational building block in the brain that has been proposed as a canonical cortical operation. Numerous experimental studies have verified its importance for capturing nonlinear neural response properties to simple, artificial stimuli, and computational studies suggest that DN is also an important component for processing natural stimuli. However, we lack quantitative models of DN that are directly informed by measurements of spiking responses in the brain and applicable to arbitrary stimuli. Here, we propose a DN model that is applicable to arbitrary input images. We test its ability to predict how neurons in macaque primary visual cortex (V1) respond to natural images, with a focus on nonlinear response properties within the classical receptive field. Our model consists of one layer of subunits followed by learned orientation-specific DN. It outperforms linear-nonlinear and wavelet-based feature representations and makes a significant step towards the performance of state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) models. Unlike deep CNNs, our compact DN model offers a direct interpretation of the nature of normalization. By inspecting the learned normalization pool of our model, we gained insights into a long-standing question about the tuning properties of DN that update the current textbook description: we found that within the receptive field oriented features were normalized preferentially by features with similar orientation rather than non-specifically as currently assumed.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YVhoXxf95tQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Adaptive cognitive-control involves a hierarchical cortico-striatal gating system that supports selective updating, maintenance, and retrieval of useful cognitive and motor information. Here, we developed a task that independently manipulates selective gating operations into working-memory (input gating), from working-memory (output gating), and of responses (motor gating) and tested the neural dynamics and computational principles that support them. Increases in gating demands, captured by gate switches, were expressed by distinct EEG correlates at each gating level that evolved dynamically in partially overlapping time windows. Further, categorical representations of specific maintained items and of motor responses could be decoded from EEG when the corresponding gate was switching, thereby linking gating operations to prioritization. Finally, gate switching at all levels was related to increases in the motor decision threshold as quantified by the drift diffusion model. Together these results support the notion that cognitive gating operations scaffold on top of mechanisms involved in motor gating.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v7U_RTY-wRA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: The P2X7 Receptor Is Involved in Diabetic Neuropathic Pain Hypersensitivity Mediated by TRPV1 in the Rat Dorsal Root Ganglion</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.663649</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The purinergic 2X&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; (P2X&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;) receptor expressed in satellite glial cells (SGCs) is involved in the inflammatory response, and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) participates in the process of neurogenic inflammation, such as that in diabetic neuropathic pain (DNP) and peripheral neuralgia. The main purpose of this study was to explore the role of the P2X&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; receptor in DNP hypersensitivity mediated by TRPV1 in the rat and its possible mechanism. A rat model of type 2 diabetes mellitus-related neuropathic pain (NPP) named the DNP rat model was established in this study. The mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT) and thermal withdrawal latency (TWL) of DNP rats were increased after intrathecal injection of the P2X&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonist A438079, and the mRNA and protein levels of TRPV1 in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) were decreased in DNP rats treated with A438079 compared to untreated DNP rats; in addition, A438079 also decreased the phosphorylation of p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in the DNP group. Based on these results, the P2X&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; receptor might be involved in DNP mediated by TRPV1.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.661856</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;With the arrival of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the challenges arising from Big Data, neuromorphic chip concepts are seen as key solutions for coping with the massive amount of unstructured data streams by moving the computation closer to the sensors, the so-called “edge computing.” Augmenting these chips with emerging memory technologies enables these edge devices with non-volatile and adaptive properties which are desirable for low power and online learning operations. However, an energy- and area-efficient realization of these systems requires disruptive hardware changes. Memristor-based solutions for these concepts are in the focus of research and industry due to their low-power and high-density online learning potential. Specifically, the filamentary-type valence change mechanism (VCM memories) have shown to be a promising candidate In consequence, physical models capturing a broad spectrum of experimentally observed features such as the pronounced cycle-to-cycle (c2c) and device-to-device (d2d) variability are required for accurate evaluation of the proposed concepts. In this study, we present an in-depth experimental analysis of d2d and c2c variability of filamentary-type bipolar switching HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/TiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; nano-sized crossbar devices and match the experimentally observed variabilities to our physically motivated JART VCM compact model. Based on this approach, we evaluate the concept of parallel operation of devices as a synapse both experimentally and theoretically. These parallel synapses form a synaptic array which is at the core of neuromorphic chips. We exploit the c2c variability of these devices for stochastic online learning which has shown to increase the effective bit precision of the devices. Finally, we demonstrate that stochastic switching features for a pattern classification task that can be employed in an online learning neural network.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Orientation of Temporal Interference for Non-invasive Deep Brain Stimulation in Epilepsy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.633988</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In patients with focal drug-resistant epilepsy, electrical stimulation from intracranial electrodes is frequently used for the localization of seizure onset zones and related pathological networks. The ability of electrically stimulated tissue to generate beta and gamma range oscillations, called rapid-discharges, is a frequent indication of an epileptogenic zone. However, a limit of intracranial stimulation is the fixed physical location and number of implanted electrodes, leaving numerous clinically and functionally relevant brain regions unexplored. Here, we demonstrate an alternative technique relying exclusively on non-penetrating surface electrodes, namely an orientation-tunable form of temporally interfering (TI) electric fields to target the CA3 of the mouse hippocampus which focally evokes seizure-like events (SLEs) having the characteristic frequencies of rapid-discharges, but without the necessity of the implanted electrodes. The orientation of the topical electrodes with respect to the orientation of the hippocampus is demonstrated to strongly control the threshold for evoking SLEs. Additionally, we demonstrate the use of Pulse-width-modulation of square waves as an alternative to sine waves for TI stimulation. An orientation-dependent analysis of classic implanted electrodes to evoke SLEs in the hippocampus is subsequently utilized to support the results of the minimally invasive temporally interfering fields. The principles of orientation-tunable TI stimulation seen here can be generally applicable in a wide range of other excitable tissues and brain regions, overcoming several limitations of fixed electrodes which penetrate tissue and overcoming several limitations of other non-invasive stimulation methods in epilepsy, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Variability and Randomness of the Instantaneous Firing Rate</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.620410</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The apparent stochastic nature of neuronal activity significantly affects the reliability of neuronal coding. To quantify the encountered fluctuations, both in neural data and simulations, the notions of variability and randomness of inter-spike intervals have been proposed and studied. In this article we focus on the concept of the instantaneous firing rate, which is also based on the spike timing. We use several classical statistical models of neuronal activity and we study the corresponding probability distributions of the instantaneous firing rate. To characterize the firing rate variability and randomness under different spiking regimes, we use different indices of statistical dispersion. We find that the relationship between the variability of interspike intervals and the instantaneous firing rate is not straightforward in general. Counter-intuitively, an increase in the randomness (based on entropy) of spike times may either decrease or increase the randomness of instantaneous firing rate, in dependence on the neuronal firing model. Finally, we apply our methods to experimental data, establishing that instantaneous rate analysis can indeed provide additional information about the spiking activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Understanding the Impact of Neural Variations and Random Connections on Inference</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.612937</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent research suggests that in vitro neural networks created from dissociated neurons may be used for computing and performing machine learning tasks. To develop a better artificial intelligent system, a hybrid bio-silicon computer is worth exploring, but its performance is still inferior to that of a silicon-based computer. One reason may be that a living neural network has many intrinsic properties, such as random network connectivity, high network sparsity, and large neural and synaptic variability. These properties may lead to new design considerations, and existing algorithms need to be adjusted for living neural network implementation. This work investigates the impact of neural variations and random connections on inference with learning algorithms. A two-layer hybrid bio-silicon platform is constructed and a five-step design method is proposed for the fast development of living neural network algorithms. Neural variations and dynamics are verified by fitting model parameters with biological experimental results. Random connections are generated under different connection probabilities to vary network sparsity. A multi-layer perceptron algorithm is tested with biological constraints on the MNIST dataset. The results show that a reasonable inference accuracy can be achieved despite the presence of neural variations and random network connections. A new adaptive pre-processing technique is proposed to ensure good learning accuracy with different living neural network sparsity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Visuomotor Adaptation Brain Changes During a Spaceflight Analog With Elevated Carbon Dioxide (CO2): A Pilot Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.659557</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Astronauts on board the International Space Station (ISS) must adapt to several environmental challenges including microgravity, elevated carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and isolation while performing highly controlled movements with complex equipment. Head down tilt bed rest (HDBR) is an analog used to study spaceflight factors including body unloading and headward fluid shifts. We recently reported how HDBR with elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (HDBR+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) affects visuomotor adaptation. Here we expand upon this work and examine the effects of HDBR+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on brain activity during visuomotor adaptation. Eleven participants (34 ± 8 years) completed six functional MRI (fMRI) sessions pre-, during, and post-HDBR+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. During fMRI, participants completed a visuomotor adaptation task, divided into baseline, early, late and de-adaptation. Additionally, we compare brain activity between this NASA campaign (30-day HDBR+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and a different campaign with a separate set of participants (60-day HDBR with normal atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels, n = 8; 34.25 ± 7.9 years) to characterize the specific effects of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Participants were included by convenience. During early adaptation across the HDBR+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intervention, participants showed decreasing activation in temporal and subcortical brain regions, followed by post- HDBR+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; recovery. During late adaptation, participants showed increasing activation in the right fusiform gyrus and right caudate nucleus during HDBR+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; this activation normalized to baseline levels after bed rest. There were no correlations between brain changes and adaptation performance changes from pre- to post HDBR+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Also, there were no statistically significant differences between the HDBR+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group and the HDBR controls, suggesting that changes in brain activity were due primarily to bed rest rather than elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Five HDBR+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; participants presented with optic disc edema, a sign of Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS). An exploratory analysis of HDBR+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; participants with and without signs of SANS revealed no group differences in brain activity during any phase of the adaptation task. Overall, these findings have implications for spaceflight missions and training, as ISS missions require individuals to adapt to altered sensory inputs over long periods in space. Further, this is the first study to verify the HDBR and elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; effects on the neural correlates of visuomotor adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The LC receives input from widespread brain regions, and projects throughout the forebrain, brainstem, cerebellum, and spinal cord. LC neurons release NE to control arousal, but also in the context of a variety of sensory-motor and behavioral functions. Despite its brain-wide effects, much about the role of LC-NE in behavior and the circuits controlling LC activity is unknown. New evidence suggests that the modular input-output organization of the LC could enable transient, task-specific modulation of distinct brain regions. Future work must further assess whether this spatial modularity coincides with functional differences in LC-NE subpopulations acting at specific times, and how such spatiotemporal specificity might influence learned behaviors. Here, we summarize the state of the field and present new ideas on the role of LC-NE in learned behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Potential and Realized Impact of Astroglia Ca2 + Dynamics on Circuit Function and Behavior</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.682888</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Astroglia display a wide range of spontaneous and behavioral state-dependent Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dynamics. During heightened vigilance, noradrenergic signaling leads to quasi-synchronous Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; elevations encompassing soma and processes across the brain-wide astroglia network. Distinct from this vigilance-associated global Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; rise are apparently spontaneous fluctuations within spatially restricted microdomains. Over the years, several strategies have been pursued to shed light on the physiological impact of these signals including deletion of endogenous ion channels or receptors and reduction of intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; through buffering, extrusion or inhibition of release. Some experiments that revealed the most compelling behavioral alterations employed chemogenetic and optogenetic manipulations to modify astroglia Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling. However, there is considerable contrast between these findings and the comparatively modest effects of inhibiting endogenous sources of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. In this review, we describe the underlying mechanisms of various forms of astroglia Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling as well as the functional consequences of their inhibition. We then discuss how the effects of exogenous astroglia Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; modification combined with our knowledge of physiological mechanisms of astroglia Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; activation could guide further refinement of behavioral paradigms that will help elucidate the natural Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent function of astroglia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Calcium Signals in Astrocyte Microdomains, a Decade of Great Advances</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.673433</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The glial cells astrocytes have long been recognized as important neuron-supporting elements in brain development, homeostasis, and metabolism. After the discovery that the reciprocal communication between astrocytes and neurons is a fundamental mechanism in the modulation of neuronal synaptic communication, over the last two decades astrocytes became a hot topic in neuroscience research. Crucial to their functional interactions with neurons are the cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; elevations that mediate gliotransmission. Large attention has been posed to the so-called Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;microdomains, dynamic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; changes spatially restricted to fine astrocytic processes including perisynaptic astrocytic processes (PAPs). With presynaptic terminals and postsynaptic neuronal membranes, PAPs compose the tripartite synapse. The distinct spatial-temporal features and functional roles of astrocyte microdomain Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; activity remain poorly defined. However, thanks to the development of genetically encoded Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; indicators (GECIs), advanced microscopy techniques, and innovative analytical approaches, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients in astrocyte microdomains were recently studied in unprecedented detail. These events have been observed to occur much more frequently (∼50–100-fold) and dynamically than somatic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; elevations with mechanisms that likely involve both IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-dependent and -independent pathways. Further progress aimed to clarify the complex, dynamic machinery responsible for astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; activity at microdomains is a crucial step in our understanding of the astrocyte role in brain function and may also reveal astrocytes as novel therapeutic targets for different brain diseases. Here, we review the most recent studies that improve our mechanistic understanding of the essential features of astrocyte Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; microdomains.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: The Ependymal Region Prevents Glioblastoma From Penetrating Into the Ventricle via a Nonmechanical Force</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.679405</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Intraventricular penetration is rare in glioblastoma (GBM). Whether the ependymal region including the ependyma and subventricular zone (SVZ) can prevent GBM invasion remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and haematoxylin–eosin (HE) staining were performed to evaluate the size and anatomical locations of GBM. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to assess the correlation between tumor-ependyma contact, ventricle penetration and clinical characteristics. Cell migration and invasion were assessed via Transwell assays and an orthotopic transplantation model.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Among 357 patients with GBM, the majority (66%) showed ependymal region contact, and 34 patients (10%) showed ventricle penetration of GBM. GBM cells were spread along the ependyma in the orthotopic transplantation model. The longest tumor diameter was an independent risk factor for GBM-ependymal region contact, as demonstrated by univariate (OR = 1.706, p &amp;lt; 0.0001) and multivariate logistic regression analyses (OR = 1.767, p &amp;lt; 0.0001), but was not associated with ventricle penetration. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) could significantly induce tumor cell migration (p &amp;lt; 0.0001), and GBM could grow in CSF. Compared with those from the cortex, cells from the ependymal region attenuated the invasion of C6 whether cocultured with C6 or mixed with Matrigel (p = 0.0054 and p = 0.0488). Immunofluorescence analysis shows a thin gap with GFAP expression delimiting the tumor and ependymal region.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The ependymal region might restrict GBM cells from entering the ventricle via a non-mechanical force. Further studies in this area may reveal mechanisms that occur in GBM patients and may enable the design of new therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Effects of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure on the Volumes of the Lateral and Medial Walls of the Intraparietal Sulcus</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.639800</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) continue to be the leading preventable cause of intellectual disability in the U.S., Europe, and in endemic areas, such as the Western Cape region of South Africa. Arithmetic is highly sensitive to prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). The intraparietal sulcus (IPS) is known to play a critical role in number processing. In this study, we investigate whether smaller IPS volumes play a role in the number-processing deficits observed in children with PAE. Participants were 52 9- to 14-year-old children from a historically disadvantaged community in Cape Town, who are participating in our ongoing studies on the effects of PAE on the brain. The IPS was manually parcellated into its medial (MIPS) and lateral (LIPS) walls on magnetic resonance images. The study aimed to examine: (1) the effects of PAE on IPS regional volumes and asymmetry, (2) whether IPS regional volumes are related to number processing performance and, if so, whether these relations are moderated by PAE and (3) potential mediation by regional IPS volumes of the relation between PAE and number processing performance. Total intracranial volume (TIV) was associated with volumes in all regions except the right LIPS. Both left MIPS and left LIPS volumes were significantly smaller in children in the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)/partial FAS (PFAS) group compared to controls. The finding in the left LIPS remained significant after controlling for potential confounders and after adjustment for the smaller overall brain size of the children in the FAS/PFAS group. Smaller left LIPS volumes in the FAS/PFAS group may account for the absence of left-right asymmetry in the LIPS in children with FAS/PFAS compared to controls and nonsyndromal heavily exposed (HE) children. Bilaterally, larger MIPS volumes were associated with better WISC IQ Arithmetic scores. These effects, however, were not moderated by the degree of PAE, and regional IPS volumes did not mediate the effect of PAE on WISC Arithmetic scores. Although we found that certain regions of the IPS were smaller in children with FAS and PFAS, these PAE-induced changes in IPS volume did not mediate the alcohol-related deficits in arithmetic.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Impaired Executive Function and Depression as Independent Risk Factors for Reported Delirium Symptoms: An Observational Cohort Study Over 8 Years</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.676734</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Acute medical illnesses, surgical interventions, or admissions to hospital in older individuals are frequently associated with a delirium. In this cohort study, we investigated the impact of specific cognitive domains and depression before the occurrence of delirium symptoms in an 8-year observation of older non-hospitalized individuals.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;In total, we included 807 participants (48–83 years). Deficits in specific cognitive domains were measured using the CERAD test battery, and depressive symptoms were measured using Beck Depression Inventory and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) before the onset of a delirium. Delirium symptoms were retrospectively assessed by a questionnaire based on the established Nursing Delirium Screening Scale.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Fifty-eight of eight hundred seven participants (7.2%) reported delirium symptoms over the 8-year course of the study. Sixty-nine percent (n = 40) of reported delirium symptoms were related to surgeries. In multivariate regression analysis, impaired executive function was an independent risk factor (p = 0.034) for the occurrence of delirium symptoms. Furthermore, age (p = 0.014), comorbidities [captured by the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)] (p &amp;lt; 0.001), and depression (p = 0.012) were significantly associated with reported delirium symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Especially prior to elective surgery or medical interventions, screening for impaired executive function and depression could be helpful to identify patients who are at risk to develop delirium symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Blood–Brain Barrier Breakdown in Relationship to Alzheimer and Vascular Disease</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26134?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Blood–brain barrier (BBB) breakdown has been suggested to be an early biomarker in human cognitive impairment. However, the relationship between BBB breakdown and brain pathology, most commonly Alzheimer disease (AD) and vascular disease, is still poorly understood. The present study measured human BBB function in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients on 2 molecular scales, specifically BBB's permeability to water and albumin molecules.


Methods
Fifty‐five elderly participants were enrolled, including 33 MCI patients and 22 controls. BBB permeability to water was measured with a new magnetic resonance imaging technique, water extraction with phase contrast arterial spin tagging. BBB permeability to albumin was determined using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/serum albumin ratio. Cognitive performance was assessed by domain‐specific composite scores. AD pathology (including CSF Aβ and ptau) and vascular risk factors were examined.


Results
Compared to cognitively normal subjects, BBB in MCI patients manifested an increased permeability to small molecules such as water but was no more permeable to large molecules such as albumin. BBB permeability to water was found to be related to AD markers of CSF Aβ and ptau. On the other hand, BBB permeability to albumin was found to be related to vascular risk factors, especially hypercholesterolemia, but was not related to AD pathology. BBB permeability to small molecules, but not to large molecules, was found to be predictive of cognitive function.


Interpretation
These findings provide early evidence that BBB breakdown is related to both AD and vascular risks, but their effects can be differentiated by spatial scales. BBB permeability to small molecules has a greater impact on cognitive performance. ANN NEUROL 2021</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Mutations in HID1 Cause Syndromic Infantile Encephalopathy and Hypopituitarism</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26127?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Precursors of peptide hormones undergo posttranslational modifications within the trans‐Golgi network (TGN). Dysfunction of proteins involved at different steps of this process cause several complex syndromes affecting the central nervous system (CNS). We aimed to clarify the genetic cause in a group of patients characterized by hypopituitarism in combination with brain atrophy, thin corpus callosum, severe developmental delay, visual impairment, and epilepsy.


Methods
Whole exome sequencing was performed in seven individuals of six unrelated families with these features. Postmortem histopathological and HID1 expression analysis of brain tissue and pituitary gland were conducted in one patient. Functional consequences of the homozygous HID1 variant p.R433W were investigated by Seahorse XF Assay in fibroblasts of two patients.


Results
Bi‐allelic variants in the gene HID1 domain‐containing protein 1 (HID1) were identified in all patients. Postmortem examination confirmed cerebral atrophy with enlarged lateral ventricles. Markedly reduced expression of pituitary hormones was found in pituitary gland tissue. Colocalization of HID1 protein with the TGN was not altered in fibroblasts of patients compared to controls, while the extracellular acidification rate upon stimulation with potassium chloride was significantly reduced in patient fibroblasts compared to controls.


Interpretation
Our findings indicate that mutations in HID1 cause an early infantile encephalopathy with hypopituitarism as the leading presentation, and expand the list of syndromic CNS diseases caused by interference of TGN function. ANN NEUROL 2021</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23364?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
The wide variety of cell types and their biophysical complexities pose a challenge in our ability to understand oscillatory activities produced by cellular‐based computational network models. This challenge stems from their high‐dimensional and multiparametric natures. To overcome this, we implement a solution by linking minimal and detailed models of CA1 microcircuits that generate intrahippocampal (3–12 Hz) theta rhythms. We leverage insights from minimal models to guide explorations of more detailed models and obtain a cellular perspective of theta generation. Our findings distinguish the pyramidal cells as the theta rhythm initiators and reveal that their activity is regularized by the inhibitory cell populations, supporting a proposed hypothesis of an “inhibition‐based tuning” mechanism. We find a strong correlation between input current to the pyramidal cells and the resulting local field potential theta frequency, indicating that intrinsic pyramidal cell properties underpin network frequency characteristics. This work provides a cellular‐based foundation from which in vivo theta activities can be explored.</content:encoded>

G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are critical regulators of cellular function acting via heterotrimeric G proteins as their primary transducers with individual GPCRs capable of pleiotropic coupling to multiple G proteins. Structural features governing G protein selectivity and promiscuity are currently unclear. Here, we used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine structures of the cholecystokinin (CCK) type 1 receptor (CCK1R) bound to the CCK peptide agonist, CCK-8 and 2 distinct transducer proteins, its primary transducer Gq, and the more weakly coupled Gs. As seen with other Gq/11–GPCR complexes, the Gq–α5 helix (αH5) bound to a relatively narrow pocket in the CCK1R core. Surprisingly, the backbone of the CCK1R and volume of the G protein binding pocket were essentially equivalent when Gs was bound, with the Gs αH5 displaying a conformation that arises from “unwinding” of the far carboxyl-terminal residues, compared to canonically Gs coupled receptors. Thus, integrated changes in the conformations of both the receptor and G protein are likely to play critical roles in the promiscuous coupling of individual GPCRs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/pYiyanK0KHY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Thalamic reticular nucleus in Alligator mississippiensis: Soma and dendritic morphology</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25194?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) complex are heterogeneous and vary in dendritic morphology, cell shape, spine and axon presence, soma size, and orientation to surrounding fibers. An example of 7, Golgi‐stained neurons with five primary dendrites and their location (inset) in this composite sagittal section illustrates a spectrum of dendritic arbors and these other features. Arrows point to the direction of fibers in the TRN. Greatest soma length (L) is indicated. Neurons in the inset, enlarged views of neurons, and enclosed boxes are coded with similar colors.







Abstract
The thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) is a critical structure influencing information transfer to the forebrain. In crocodilians, the TRN shares many features with its mammalian counterpart. One area that has not been explored is how individual neurons in the crocodilian TRN compare with those found in mammals. In mammals, TRN neurons are aligned parallel to the external border of the dorsal thalamus, have their dendrites oriented perpendicular to the fibers in the internal capsule, have fine, filamentous dendritic appendages, are either bipolar or multipolar, and are commonly considered to be a homogeneous morphological population of cells. To investigate the cellular morphology of the TRN complex, a Golgi analysis was undertaken in Alligator mississippiensis. This study examined features that have been used in mammals. In Alligator, the four TRN divisions are the dorsal peduncular nucleus, the perireticular nucleus, the interstitial nucleus, and the neurons in the medial forebrain bundle associated with the interstitial nucleus. In crocodilians, the dorsal peduncular nucleus is homologous to the TRN of mammals. From the 1787 drawn neuron profiles in the traditional three planes of section, the following were concluded. First, neurons in each part of the TRN complex in Alligator were similar in morphology. Second, each part of the TRN complex of Alligator contained a heterogenous population of cells. These variations between the cellular morphology of the dorsal peduncular nucleus of crocodilians and the TRN of mammals are speculated to partly result from differences in forebrain organization.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
Research innovation that leads to discovery in the battle against neurological disease and disorders requires diverse ideas. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, one of the National Institutes of Health's 27 institutes and centers, strives to reduce the burden of neurological disease and disorders. The National Institutes of Neurologic Disorders and Stroke is very interested in increasing the diversity of researchers by addressing the existing barriers responsible for the low numbers of underrepresented populations from traditionally minority‐serving institutions (MSIs) and non‐minority serving institutions (non‐MSIs). This commentary provides insight on the persistent underrepresentation of racial/ethnic minorities entering neuroscience research careers paths, focusing on multiples levels within the scientific academy and the supportive role that both MSIs and non‐MSIs play in increasing diversity in the biomedical research workforce.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24865?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Comparison of mitochondrial and extramitochondrial activity in neuronal membrane systems. In the last years, literature reports that the oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) machinery is expressed not only on the inner mitochondrial membrane but also on other membranous structures. In order to highlight the similarities and differences between these two entities, in this work, we compared the activity of mitochondrial OxPhos with that expressed in isolated myelin and rod outer segments.

Abstract
The nervous system displays high energy consumption, apparently not fulfilled by mitochondria, which are underrepresented therein. The oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) activity, a mitochondrial process that aerobically provides ATP, has also been reported also in the myelin sheath and the rod outer segment (OS) disks. Thus, commonalities and differences between the extra‐mitochondrial and mitochondrial aerobic metabolism were evaluated in bovine isolated myelin (IM), rod OS, and mitochondria‐enriched fractions (MIT). The subcellular fraction quality and the absence of contamination fractions have been estimated by western blot analysis. Oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis were stimulated by conventional (pyruvate + malate or succinate) and unconventional (NADH) substrates, observing that oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis by IM and rod OS are more efficient than by MIT, in the presence of both kinds of respiratory substrates. Mitochondria did not utilize NADH as a respiring substrate. When ATP synthesis by either sample was assayed in the presence of 10–100 µM ATP in the assay medium, only in IM and OS it was not inhibited, suggesting that the ATP exportation by the mitochondria is limited by extravesicular ATP concentration. Interestingly, IM and OS but not mitochondria appear able to synthesize ATP at a later time with respect to exposure to respiratory substrates, supporting the hypothesis that the proton gradient produced by the electron transport chain is buffered by membrane phospholipids. The putative transfer mode of the OxPhos molecular machinery from mitochondria to the extra‐mitochondrial structures is also discussed, opening new perspectives in the field of neurophysiology.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Dynamically Optimizing Network Structure Based on Synaptic Pruning in the Brain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.620558</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Most neural networks need to predefine the network architecture empirically, which may cause over-fitting or under-fitting. Besides, a large number of parameters in a fully connected network leads to the prohibitively expensive computational cost and storage overhead, which makes the model hard to be deployed on mobile devices. Dynamically optimizing the network architecture by pruning unused synapses is a promising technique for solving this problem. Most existing pruning methods focus on reducing the redundancy of deep convolutional neural networks by pruning unimportant filters or weights, at the cost of accuracy drop. In this paper, we propose an effective brain-inspired synaptic pruning method to dynamically modulate the network architecture and simultaneously improve network performance. The proposed model is biologically inspired as it dynamically eliminates redundant connections based on the synaptic pruning rules used during the brain's development. Connections are pruned if they are not activated or less activated multiple times consecutively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on classification tasks of different complexity with the MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets. Experimental results reveal that even for a compact network, the proposed method can also remove up to 59–90% of the connections, with relative improvement in learning speed and accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Oxaliplatin Depolarizes the IB4– Dorsal Root Ganglion Neurons to Drive the Development of Neuropathic Pain Through TRPM8 in Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.690858</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Use of chemotherapy drug oxaliplatin is associated with painful peripheral neuropathy that is exacerbated by cold. Remodeling of ion channels including TRP channels in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons contribute to the sensory hypersensitivity following oxaliplatin treatment in animal models. However, it has not been studied if TRP channels and membrane depolarization of DRG neurons serve as the initial ionic/membrane drives (such as within an hour) that contribute to the development of oxaliplatin-induced neuropathic pain. In the current study, we studied in mice (1) in vitro acute effects of oxaliplatin on the membrane excitability of IB4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and IB4&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; subpopulations of DRG neurons using a perforated patch clamping, (2) the preventative effects of a membrane-hyperpolarizing drug retigabine on oxaliplatin-induced sensory hypersensitivity, and (3) the preventative effects of TRP channel antagonists on the oxaliplatin-induced membrane hyperexcitability and sensory hypersensitivity. We found (1) IB4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and IB4&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; subpopulations of small DRG neurons displayed previously undiscovered, substantially different membrane excitability, (2) oxaliplatin selectively depolarized IB4&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; DRG neurons, (3) pretreatment of retigabine largely prevented oxaliplatin-induced sensory hypersensitivity, (4) antagonists of TRPA1 and TRPM8 channels prevented oxaliplatin-induced membrane depolarization, and (5) the antagonist of TRPM8 largely prevented oxaliplatin-induced sensory hypersensitivity. These results suggest that oxaliplatin depolarizes IB4&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; neurons through TRPM8 channels to drive the development of neuropathic pain and targeting the initial drives of TRPM8 and/or membrane depolarization may prevent oxaliplatin-induce neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.679440</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In most mammals, retinal ganglion cell axons from each retina project to both sides of the brain. The segregation of ipsi and contralateral projections into eye-specific territories in their main brain targets—the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus and the superior colliculus—is critical for the processing of visual information. The investigation of the developmental mechanisms contributing to the wiring of this binocular map in mammals identified competitive mechanisms between axons from each retina while interactions between axons from the same eye were challenging to explore. Studies in vertebrates lacking ipsilateral retinal projections demonstrated that competitive mechanisms also exist between axons from the same eye. The development of a genetic approach enabling the differential manipulation and labeling of neighboring retinal ganglion cells in a single mouse retina revealed that binocular map development does not only rely on axon competition but also involves a cooperative interplay between axons to stabilize their terminal branches. These recent insights into the developmental mechanisms shaping retinal axon connectivity in the brain will be discussed here.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.663633</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This study explored the effects of septal glutamatergic transmission on septal-hippocampal theta activity via intraseptal microinjection of antagonist at AMPA receptors (AMPAR). The current results showed that microinjection of AMPAR antagonist, NBQX (2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline-2,3-dione, 20 μg/μl, 0.5 μl), evoked a decrease in the frequency of theta activity evoked by various means in anesthetized and behaving rat. Theta wave activity was induced on: (a) intraseptal microinjection of carbachol, an agonist at cholinergic receptors, (b) reticular stimulation, (c) exploration in novel open field (OF), and (d) hind paw (HP) injection of the algogen, formalin. The effect on frequency in the formalin test was observed in an early period on injection of formalin, which was novel to the animal, but not in the later more sustained phase of the formalin test. The effect of NBQX, being seen in both anesthetized and behaving animals, suggests that the modulation of theta wave frequency, including in novelty, is a function of AMPAR in MS. The effect of the antagonist on theta power was less apparent, being observed only in anesthetized animals. In addition to theta power and frequency, intraseptal NBQX also attenuated suppression of CA1 population spike (PS) induced by intraseptal carbachol, thus suggesting that septal glutamate neurotransmission is involved in the spectrum of MS-mediated network responses. Indeed, in the context of behavior, formalin injection induced an increase in the level of septal glutamate, while NBQX attenuated nociceptive behaviors. Notably, MS is involved in the modulation of formalin nociception. These findings suggest that AMPA receptors are a key modulator of septal physiological function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Heterogeneity and Development of Fine Astrocyte Morphology Captured by Diffraction-Limited Microscopy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.669280</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The fine processes of single astrocytes can contact many thousands of synapses whose function they can modulate through bi-directional signaling. The spatial arrangement of astrocytic processes and neuronal structures is relevant for such interactions and for the support of neuronal signaling by astrocytes. At the same time, the geometry of perisynaptic astrocyte processes is variable and dynamically regulated. Studying these fine astrocyte processes represents a technical challenge, because many of them cannot be fully resolved by diffraction-limited microscopy. Therefore, we have established two indirect parameters of astrocyte morphology, which, while not fully resolving local geometry by design, provide statistical measures of astrocyte morphology: the fraction of tissue volume that astrocytes occupy and the density of resolvable astrocytic processes. Both are straightforward to obtain using widely available microscopy techniques. We here present the approach and demonstrate its robustness across various experimental conditions using mainly two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy in acute slices and in vivo as well as modeling. Using these indirect measures allowed us to analyze the morphology of relatively large populations of astrocytes. Doing so we captured the heterogeneity of astrocytes within and between the layers of the hippocampal CA1 region and the developmental profile of astrocyte morphology. This demonstrates that volume fraction (VF) and segment density are useful parameters for describing the structure of astrocytes. They are also suitable for online monitoring of astrocyte morphology with widely available microscopy techniques.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Classic reinforcement learning (RL) theories cannot explain human behavior in the absence of external reward or when the environment changes. Here, we employ a deep sequential decision-making paradigm with sparse reward and abrupt environmental changes. To explain the behavior of human participants in these environments, we show that RL theories need to include surprise and novelty, each with a distinct role. While novelty drives exploration before the first encounter of a reward, surprise increases the rate of learning of a world-model as well as of model-free action-values. Even though the world-model is available for model-based RL, we find that human decisions are dominated by model-free action choices. The world-model is only marginally used for planning, but it is important to detect surprising events. Our theory predicts human action choices with high probability and allows us to dissociate surprise, novelty, and reward in EEG signals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XynWQ8GORzc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Recently, an increasing number of studies have demonstrated that miRNAs are involved in human diseases, indicating that miRNAs might be a potential pathogenic factor for various diseases. Therefore, figuring out the relationship between miRNAs and diseases plays a critical role in not only the development of new drugs, but also the formulation of individualized diagnosis and treatment. As the prediction of miRNA-disease association via biological experiments is expensive and time-consuming, computational methods have a positive effect on revealing the association. In this study, a novel prediction model integrating GCN, CNN and Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (GCSENet) was constructed for the identification of miRNA-disease association. The model first captured features by GCN based on a heterogeneous graph including diseases, genes and miRNAs. Then, considering the different effects of genes on each type of miRNA and disease, as well as the different effects of the miRNA-gene and disease-gene relationships on miRNA-disease association, a feature weight was set and a combination of miRNA-gene and disease-gene associations was added as feature input for the convolution operation in CNN. Furthermore, the squeeze and excitation blocks of SENet were applied to determine the importance of each feature channel and enhance useful features by means of the attention mechanism, thus achieving a satisfactory prediction of miRNA-disease association. The proposed method was compared against other state-of-the-art methods. It achieved an AUROC score of 95.02% and an AUPR score of 95.55% in a 10-fold cross-validation, which led to the finding that the proposed method is superior to these popular methods on most of the performance evaluation indexes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bSi9U-j4N0Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Genomic DNA is packaged in chromatin, a dynamic fiber variable in size and compaction. In chromatin, repeating nucleosome units wrap 145–147 DNA basepairs around histone proteins. Genetic and epigenetic regulation of genes relies on structural transitions in chromatin which are driven by intra- and inter-nucleosome dynamics and modulated by chemical modifications of the unstructured terminal tails of histones. Here we demonstrate how the interplay between histone H3 and H2A tails control ample nucleosome breathing motions. We monitored large openings of two genomic nucleosomes, and only moderate breathing of an engineered nucleosome in atomistic molecular simulations amounting to 24 μs. Transitions between open and closed nucleosome conformations were mediated by the displacement and changes in compaction of the two histone tails. These motions involved changes in the DNA interaction profiles of clusters of epigenetic regulatory aminoacids in the tails. Removing the histone tails resulted in a large increase of the amplitude of nucleosome breathing but did not change the sequence dependent pattern of the motions. Histone tail modulated nucleosome breathing is a key mechanism of chromatin dynamics with important implications for epigenetic regulation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rBnNLN6ARqA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Beef is the most resource intensive of all commonly used food items. Disproportionate synthetic fertilizer use during beef production propels a vigorous one-way factory-to-ocean nutrient flux, which alternative agriculture models strive to rectify by enhancing in-farm biogeochemical cycling. Livestock, especially cattle, are central to these models, which advocates describe as the context most likely to overcome beef’s environmental liabilities. Yet the dietary potential of such models is currently poorly known. Here, I thus ask whether nitrogen-sparing agriculture (NSA) can offer a viable alternative to the current US food system. Focusing on the most common eutrophication-causing element, N, I devise a specific model of mixed-use NSA comprising numerous small farms producing human plant-based food and forage, the latter feeding a core intensive beef operation that forgoes synthetic fertilizer and relies only on locally produced manure and N fixers. Assuming the model is deployed throughout the high-quality, precipitation-rich US cropland (delimiting approximately 100 million ha, less than half of today’s agricultural land use) and neglecting potential macroeconomic obstacles to wide deployment, I find that NSA could produce a diverse, high-quality nationwide diet distinctly better than today’s mean US diet. The model also permits 70%–80% of today’s beef consumption, raises today’s protein delivery by 5%–40%, and averts approximately 60% of today’s fertilizer use and approximately 10% of today’s total greenhouse gas emissions. As defined here, NSA is thus potentially a viable, scalable environmentally superior alternative to the current US food system, but only when combined with the commitment to substantially enhance our reliance on plant food.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/YBfN0hYrX1E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Mechanisms of Ischemic Stroke in Patients with Cancer: A Prospective Study</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26129?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
The objective of this study was to examine the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke with cancer.


Methods
We conducted a prospective cross‐sectional study from 2016 to 2020 at 2 hospitals. We enrolled 3 groups of 50 adult participants each. The main group included patients with active solid tumor cancer and acute ischemic stroke. The control groups included patients with acute ischemic stroke only or active cancer only. The patients with stroke‐only and patients with cancer‐only were matched to the patients with cancer‐plus‐stroke by age, sex, and cancer type, if applicable. The outcomes were prespecified hematological biomarkers and transcranial Doppler microemboli detection. Hematological biomarkers included markers of coagulation (D‐dimer and thrombin‐antithrombin), platelet function (P‐selectin), and endothelial integrity (thrombomodulin, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule‐1 [sICAM‐1], and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule‐1 [sVCAM‐1]). Hematological biomarkers were compared between groups using the Kruskal‐Wallis and Wilcoxon Rank‐Sum tests. In multivariable linear regression models, we adjusted for race, number of stroke risk factors, smoking, stroke severity, and antithrombotic use. Transcranial Doppler microemboli presence was compared between groups using chi‐square tests.


Results
Levels of all study biomarkers were different between groups. In univariate between‐group comparisons, patients with cancer‐plus‐stroke had higher levels of D‐dimer, sICAM‐1, sVCAM‐1, and thrombomodulin than both control groups; higher levels of thrombin‐antithrombin than patients with cancer‐only; and higher levels of P‐selectin than patients with stroke‐only. Findings were similar in multivariable analyses. Transcranial Doppler microemboli were detected in 32% of patients with cancer‐plus‐stroke, 16% of patients with stroke‐only, and 6% of patients with cancer‐only (p = 0.005).


Interpretation
Patients with cancer‐related stroke have higher markers of coagulation, platelet, and endothelial dysfunction, and more circulating microemboli, than matched controls. ANN NEUROL 2021</content:encoded>
