	<title>Journal of Computational Neuroscience: Constraint-induced intervention as an emergent phenomenon from synaptic competition in biological systems</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10827-021-00782-9</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The principle of constraint-induced therapy is widely practiced in rehabilitation. In hemiplegic cerebral palsy (CP) with impaired contralateral corticospinal projection due to unilateral injury, function improves after imposing a temporary constraint on limbs from the less affected hemisphere. This type of partially-reversible impairment in motor control by early brain injury bears a resemblance to the experience-dependent plastic acquisition and modification of neuronal response selectivity in the visual cortex. Previously, such mechanism was modeled within the framework of BCM (Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro) theory, a rate-based synaptic modification theory. Here, we demonstrate a minimally complex yet sufficient neural network model which provides a fundamental explanation for inter-hemispheric competition using a simplified spike-based model of information transmission and plasticity. We emulate the restoration of function in hemiplegic CP by simulating the competition between cells of the ipsilateral and contralateral corticospinal tracts. We use a high-speed hardware neural simulation to provide realistic numbers of spikes and realistic magnitudes of synaptic modification. We demonstrate that the phenomenon of constraint-induced partial reversal of hemiplegia can be modeled by simplified neural descending tracts with 2 layers of spiking neurons and synapses with spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). We further demonstrate that persistent hemiplegia following unilateral cortical inactivation or deprivation is predicted by the STDP-based model but is inconsistent with BCM model. Although our model is a highly simplified and limited representation of the corticospinal system, it offers an explanation of how constraint as an intervention can help the system to escape from a suboptimal solution. This is a display of an emergent phenomenon from the synaptic competition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Computational Neuroscience: Predictive coding models for pain perception</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10827-021-00780-x</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Pain is a complex, multidimensional experience that involves dynamic interactions between sensory-discriminative and affective-emotional processes. Pain experiences have a high degree of variability depending on their context and prior anticipation. Viewing pain perception as a perceptual inference problem, we propose a predictive coding paradigm to characterize evoked and non-evoked pain. We record the local field potentials (LFPs) from the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of freely behaving rats—two regions known to encode the sensory-discriminative and affective-emotional aspects of pain, respectively. We further use predictive coding to investigate the temporal coordination of oscillatory activity between the S1 and ACC. Specifically, we develop a phenomenological predictive coding model to describe the macroscopic dynamics of bottom-up and top-down activity. Supported by recent experimental data, we also develop a biophysical neural mass model to describe the mesoscopic neural dynamics in the S1 and ACC populations, in both naive and chronic pain-treated animals. Our proposed predictive coding models not only replicate important experimental findings, but also provide new prediction about the impact of the model parameters on the physiological or behavioral read-out—thereby yielding mechanistic insight into the uncertainty of expectation, placebo or nocebo effect, and chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Computational Neuroscience: Malleability of gamma rhythms enhances population-level correlations</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10827-021-00779-4</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;An important problem in systems neuroscience is to understand how information is communicated among brain regions, and it has been proposed that communication is mediated by neuronal oscillations, such as rhythms in the gamma band. We sought to investigate this idea by using a network model with two components, a source (sending) and a target (receiving) component, both built to resemble local populations in the cerebral cortex. To measure the effectiveness of communication, we used population-level correlations in spike times between the source and target. We found that after correcting for a response time that is independent of initial conditions, spike-time correlations between the source and target are significant, due in large measure to the alignment of firing events in their gamma rhythms. But, we also found that regular oscillations cannot produce the results observed in our model simulations of cortical neurons. Surprisingly, it is the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;irregularity&lt;/em&gt; of gamma rhythms, the absence of internal clocks, together with the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;malleability&lt;/em&gt; of these rhythms and their tendency to align with external pulses — features that are known to be present in gamma rhythms in the real cortex — that produced the results observed. These findings and the mechanistic explanations we offered are our primary results. Our secondary result is a mathematical relationship between correlations and the sizes of the samples used for their calculation. As improving technology enables recording simultaneously from increasing numbers of neurons, this relationship could be useful for interpreting results from experimental recordings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Excitatory synaptic signaling in cortical circuits is thought to be metabolically expensive. Two fundamental brain functions, learning and memory, are associated with long-term synaptic plasticity, but we know very little about energetics of these slow biophysical processes. This study investigates the energy requirement of information storing in plastic synapses for an extended version of BCM plasticity with a decay term, stochastic noise, and nonlinear dependence of neuron’s firing rate on synaptic current (adaptation). It is shown that synaptic weights in this model exhibit bistability. In order to analyze the system analytically, it is reduced to a simple dynamic mean-field for a population averaged plastic synaptic current. Next, using the concepts of nonequilibrium thermodynamics, we derive the energy rate (entropy production rate) for plastic synapses and a corresponding Fisher information for coding presynaptic input. That energy, which is of chemical origin, is primarily used for battling fluctuations in the synaptic weights and presynaptic firing rates, and it increases steeply with synaptic weights, and more uniformly though nonlinearly with presynaptic firing. At the onset of synaptic bistability, Fisher information and memory lifetime both increase sharply, by a few orders of magnitude, but the plasticity energy rate changes only mildly. This implies that a huge gain in the precision of stored information does not have to cost large amounts of metabolic energy, which suggests that synaptic information is not directly limited by energy consumption. Interestingly, for very weak synaptic noise, such a limit on synaptic coding accuracy is imposed instead by a derivative of the plasticity energy rate with respect to the mean presynaptic firing, and this relationship has a general character that is independent of the plasticity type. An estimate for primate neocortex reveals that a relative metabolic cost of BCM type synaptic plasticity, as a fraction of neuronal cost related to fast synaptic transmission and spiking, can vary from negligible to substantial, depending on the synaptic noise level and presynaptic firing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;An inverse procedure is developed and tested to recover functional and structural information from global signals of brains activity. The method assumes a leaky-integrate and fire model with excitatory and inhibitory neurons, coupled via a directed network. Neurons are endowed with a heterogenous current value, which sets their associated dynamical regime. By making use of a heterogenous mean-field approximation, the method seeks to reconstructing from global activity patterns the distribution of in-coming degrees, for both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, as well as the distribution of the assigned currents. The proposed inverse scheme is first validated against synthetic data. Then, time-lapse acquisitions of a zebrafish larva recorded with a two-photon light sheet microscope are used as an input to the reconstruction algorithm. A power law distribution of the in-coming connectivity of the excitatory neurons is found. Local degree distributions are also computed by segmenting the whole brain in sub-regions traced from annotated atlas.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Observations of finely-timed spike relationships in population recordings have been used to support partial reconstruction of neural microcircuit diagrams. In this approach, fine-timescale components of paired spike train interactions are isolated and subsequently attributed to synaptic parameters. Recent perturbation studies strengthen the case for such an inference, yet the complete set of measurements needed to calibrate statistical models is unavailable. To address this gap, we study features of pairwise spiking in a large-scale &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; dataset where presynaptic neurons were explicitly decoupled from network activity by juxtacellular stimulation. We then construct biophysical models of paired spike trains to reproduce the observed phenomenology of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; monosynaptic interactions, including both fine-timescale spike-spike correlations and firing irregularity. A key characteristic of these models is that the paired neurons are coupled by rapidly-fluctuating background inputs. We quantify a monosynapse’s causal effect by comparing the postsynaptic train with its counterfactual, when the monosynapse is removed. Subsequently, we develop statistical techniques for estimating this causal effect from the pre- and post-synaptic spike trains. A particular focus is the justification and application of a nonparametric separation of timescale principle to implement synaptic inference. Using simulated data generated from the biophysical models, we characterize the regimes in which the estimators accurately identify the monosynaptic effect. A secondary goal is to initiate a critical exploration of neurostatistical assumptions in terms of biophysical mechanisms, particularly with regards to the challenging but arguably fundamental issue of fast, unobservable nonstationarities in background dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07445</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent enhancements in neuroscience, like the development of new and powerful
recording techniques of the brain activity combined with the increasing
anatomical knowledge provided by atlases and the growing understanding of
neuromodulation principles, allow studying the brain at a whole new level,
paving the way to the creation of extremely detailed effective network models
directly from observed data. Leveraging the advantages of this integrated
approach, we propose a method to infer models capable of reproducing the
complex spatio-temporal dynamics of the slow waves observed in the experimental
recordings of the cortical hemisphere of a mouse under anesthesia. To reliably
claim the good match between data and simulations, we implemented a versatile
ensemble of analysis tools, applicable to both experimental and simulated data
and capable to identify and quantify the spatio-temporal propagation of waves
across the cortex. In order to reproduce the observed slow wave dynamics, we
introduced an inference procedure composed of two steps: the inner and the
outer loop. In the inner loop, the parameters of a mean-field model are
optimized by likelihood maximization, exploiting the anatomical knowledge to
define connectivity priors. The outer loop explores &quot;external&quot; parameters,
seeking for an optimal match between the simulation outcome and the data,
relying on observables (speed, directions, and frequency of the waves) apt for
the characterization of cortical slow waves; the outer loop includes a periodic
neuro-modulation for better reproduction of the experimental recordings. We
show that our model is capable to reproduce most of the features of the
non-stationary and non-linear dynamics displayed by the biological network.
Also, the proposed method allows to infer which are the relevant modifications
of parameters when the brain state changes, e.g. according to anesthesia
levels.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent years have seen the proliferation of disinformation and misinformation
online, thanks to the freedom of expression on the Internet and to the rise of
social media. Two solutions were proposed to address the problem: (i) manual
fact-checking, which is accurate and credible, but slow and non-scalable, and
(ii) automatic fact-checking, which is fast and scalable, but lacks
explainability and credibility. With the accumulation of enough manually
fact-checked claims, a middle-ground approach has emerged: checking whether a
given claim has previously been fact-checked. This can be made automatically,
and thus fast, while also offering credibility and explainability, thanks to
the human fact-checking and explanations in the associated fact-checking
article. This is a relatively new and understudied research direction, and here
we focus on claims made in a political debate, where context really matters.
Thus, we study the impact of modeling the context of the claim: both on the
source side, i.e., in the debate, as well as on the target side, i.e., in the
fact-checking explanation document. We do this by modeling the local context,
the global context, as well as by means of co-reference resolution, and
reasoning over the target text using Transformer-XH. The experimental results
show that each of these represents a valuable information source, but that
modeling the source-side context is more important, and can yield 10+ points of
absolute improvement.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07381</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Benchmark suites, i.e. a collection of benchmark functions, are widely used
in the comparison of black-box optimization algorithms. Over the years,
research has identified many desired qualities for benchmark suites, such as
diverse topology, different difficulties, scalability, representativeness of
real-world problems among others. However, while the topology characteristics
have been subjected to previous studies, there is no study that has
statistically evaluated the difficulty level of benchmark functions, how well
they discriminate optimization algorithms and how suitable is a benchmark suite
for algorithm comparison. In this paper, we propose the use of an item response
theory (IRT) model, the Bayesian two-parameter logistic model for multiple
attempts, to statistically evaluate these aspects with respect to the empirical
success rate of algorithms. With this model, we can assess the difficulty level
of each benchmark, how well they discriminate different algorithms, the ability
score of an algorithm, and how much information the benchmark suite adds in the
estimation of the ability scores. We demonstrate the use of this model in two
well-known benchmark suites, the Black-Box Optimization Benchmark (BBOB) for
continuous optimization and the Pseudo Boolean Optimization (PBO) for discrete
optimization. We found that most benchmark functions of BBOB suite have high
difficulty levels (compared to the optimization algorithms) and low
discrimination. For the PBO, most functions have good discrimination parameters
but are often considered too easy. We discuss potential uses of IRT in
benchmarking, including its use to improve the design of benchmark suites, to
measure multiple aspects of the algorithms, and to design adaptive suites.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Simulating and imitating the neuronal network of humans or mammals is a
popular topic that has been explored for many years in the fields of pattern
recognition and computer vision. Inspired by neuronal conduction
characteristics in the primary visual cortex of cats, pulse-coupled neural
networks (PCNNs) can exhibit synchronous oscillation behavior, which can
process digital images without training. However, according to the study of
single cells in the cat primary visual cortex, when a neuron is stimulated by
an external periodic signal, the interspike-interval (ISI) distributions
represent a multimodal distribution. This phenomenon cannot be explained by all
PCNN models. By analyzing the working mechanism of the PCNN, we present a novel
neuron model of the primary visual cortex consisting of a continuous-coupled
neural network (CCNN). Our model inherited the threshold exponential decay and
synchronous pulse oscillation property of the original PCNN model, and it can
exhibit chaotic behavior consistent with the testing results of cat primary
visual cortex neurons. Therefore, our CCNN model is closer to real visual
neural networks. For image segmentation tasks, the algorithm based on CCNN
model has better performance than the state-of-art of visual cortex neural
network model. The strength of our approach is that it helps neurophysiologists
further understand how the primary visual cortex works and can be used to
quantitatively predict the temporal-spatial behavior of real neural networks.
CCNN may also inspire engineers to create brain-inspired deep learning networks
for artificial intelligence purposes.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have shown promising results in restoring
motor function to individuals with spinal cord injury. These systems have
traditionally focused on the restoration of upper extremity function; however,
the lower extremities have received relatively little attention. Early
feasibility studies used noninvasive electroencephalogram (EEG)-based BCIs to
restore walking function to people with paraplegia. However, the limited
spatiotemporal resolution of EEG signals restricted the application of these
BCIs to elementary gait tasks, such as the initiation and termination of
walking. To restore more complex gait functions, BCIs must accurately decode
additional degrees of freedom from brain signals. In this study, we used
subdurally recorded electrocorticogram (ECoG) signals from able-bodied subjects
to design a decoder capable of predicting the walking state and step rate
information. We recorded ECoG signals from the motor cortices of two
individuals as they walked on a treadmill at different speeds. Our offline
analysis demonstrated that the state information could be decoded from &amp;gt;16
minutes of ECoG data with an unprecedented accuracy of 99.8%. Additionally,
using a Bayesian filter approach, we achieved an average correlation
coefficient between the decoded and true step rates of 0.934. When combined,
these decoders may yield decoding accuracies sufficient to safely operate
present-day walking prostheses.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Advances in experimental neuroscience have transformed our ability to explore
the structure and function of neural circuits. At the same time, advances in
machine learning have unleashed the remarkable computational power of
artificial neural networks (ANNs). While these two fields have different tools
and applications, they present a similar challenge: namely, understanding how
information is embedded and processed through high-dimensional representations
to solve complex tasks. One approach to addressing this challenge is to utilize
mathematical and computational tools to analyze the geometry of these
high-dimensional representations, i.e., neural population geometry. We review
examples of geometrical approaches providing insight into the function of
biological and artificial neural networks: representation untangling in
perception, a geometric theory of classification capacity, disentanglement and
abstraction in cognitive systems, topological representations underlying
cognitive maps, dynamic untangling in motor systems, and a dynamical approach
to cognition. Together, these findings illustrate an exciting trend at the
intersection of machine learning, neuroscience, and geometry, in which neural
population geometry provides a useful population-level mechanistic descriptor
underlying task implementation. Importantly, geometric descriptions are
applicable across sensory modalities, brain regions, network architectures and
timescales. Thus, neural population geometry has the potential to unify our
understanding of structure and function in biological and artificial neural
networks, bridging the gap between single neurons, populations and behavior.

evaluation and so on. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a class of
distances that have built-in convexity. We investigate the relationship with
some known paradigms (sliced distances - a synonym for Radon distances -,
reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, energy distances). The distances are shown
to possess fast implementations and are included in an adapted Variational
Auto-Encoder termed Radon Sobolev Variational Auto-Encoder (RS-VAE) which

Underlying processes in the brain have been investigated using various techniques and compared between species. Functional imaging studies have shown face-selective cortical regions and their degree of correspondence across species. However, the temporal dynamics of face processing, particularly processing speed, are likely different between them. Across sensory modalities activation of primary sensory cortices in macaque monkeys occurs at about 3/5 the latency of corresponding activation in humans, though this human simian difference may diminish or disappear in higher cortical regions. We recorded scalp event-related potentials (ERPs) to presentation of faces in macaques and estimated the peak latency of ERP components. Comparisons of latencies between macaques and humans indicated that the 3:5 ratio is preserved in higher cognitive regions of face processing between those species.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.630250</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Two-photon Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging is a leading technique for recording neuronal activities in vivo with cellular or subcellular resolution. However, during experiments, the images often suffer from corruption due to complex noises. Therefore, the analysis of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging data requires preprocessing steps, such as denoising, to extract biologically relevant information. We present an approach that facilitates imaging data restoration through image denoising performed by a neural network combining spatiotemporal filtering and model blind learning. Tests with synthetic and real two-photon Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach enables efficient restoration of imaging data. In addition, we demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods by evaluating the qualities of the denoising performance of the models quantitatively. Therefore, our method provides an invaluable tool for denoising two-photon Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging data by model blind spatiotemporal processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.617221</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;An increase in blood brain barrier permeability commonly precedes neuro-inflammation and cognitive impairment in models of dementia. Common methods to estimate capillary permeability have potential confounders, or require laborious and subjective semi-manual analysis.&lt;/p&gt;New method&lt;p&gt;Here we used snap frozen mouse and rat brain sections that were double-immunofluorescent labeled for immunoglobulin G (IgG; plasma protein) and laminin-α4 (capillary basement membrane). A Machine Learning Image Analysis program (Zeiss ZEN Intellisis) was trained to recognize and segment laminin-α4 to equivocally identify blood vessels in large sets of images. An IgG subclass based on a threshold intensity was segmented and quantitated only in extravascular regions. The residual parenchymal IgG fluorescence is indicative of blood-to-brain extravasation of IgG and was accurately quantitated.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Automated machine-learning and threshold based segmentation of only parenchymal IgG extravasation accentuates otherwise indistinct capillary permeability, particularly frequent in minor BBB leakage. Comparison with Existing Methods: Large datasets can be processed and analyzed quickly and robustly to provide an overview of vascular permeability throughout the brain. All human bias or ambiguity involved in classifying and measuring leakage is removed.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Here we describe a fast and precise method of visualizing and quantitating BBB permeability in mouse and rat brain tissue, while avoiding the confounding influence of unphysiological conditions such as perfusion and eliminating any human related bias from analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Effects of Perturbation Velocity, Direction, Background Muscle Activation, and Task Instruction on Long-Latency Responses Measured From Forearm Muscles</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.639773</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The central nervous system uses feedback processes that occur at multiple time scales to control interactions with the environment. The long-latency response (LLR) is the fastest process that directly involves cortical areas, with a motoneuron response measurable 50 ms following an imposed limb displacement. Several behavioral factors concerning perturbation mechanics and the active role of muscles prior or during the perturbation can modulate the long-latency response amplitude (LLRa) in the upper limbs, but the interactions among many of these factors had not been systematically studied before. We conducted a behavioral study on thirteen healthy individuals to determine the effect and interaction of four behavioral factors – background muscle torque, perturbation direction, perturbation velocity, and task instruction – on the LLRa evoked from the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) and extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) muscles after velocity-controlled wrist displacements. The effects of the four factors were quantified using both a 0D statistical analysis on the average perturbation-evoked EMG signal in the period corresponding to an LLR, and using a timeseries analysis of EMG signals. All factors significantly modulated LLRa, and their combination nonlinearly contributed to modulating the LLRa. Specifically, all the three-way interaction terms that could be computed without including the interaction between instruction and velocity significantly modulated the LLR. Analysis of the three-way interaction terms of the 0D model indicated that for the ECU muscle, the LLRa evoked when subjects are asked to maintain their muscle activation in response to the perturbations was greater than the one observed when subjects yielded to the perturbations (p &amp;lt; 0.001), but this effect was not measured for muscles undergoing shortening or in absence of background muscle activation. Moreover, higher perturbation velocity increased the LLRa evoked from the stretched muscle in presence of a background torque (p &amp;lt; 0.001), but no effects of velocity were measured in absence of background torque. Also, our analysis identified significant modulations of LLRa in muscles shortened by the perturbation, including an interaction between torque and velocity, and an effect of both torque and velocity. The time-series analysis indicated the significance of additional transient effects in the LLR region for muscles undergoing shortening.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Generalizing Longitudinal Age Effects on Brain Structure – A Two-Study Comparison Approach</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.635687</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cross-sectional studies indicate that normal aging is accompanied by decreases in brain structure. Longitudinal studies, however, are relatively rare and inconsistent regarding their outcomes. Particularly the heterogeneity of methods, sample characteristics and the high inter-individual variability in older adults prevent the deduction of general trends. Therefore, the current study aimed to compare longitudinal age-related changes in brain structure (measured through cortical thickness) in two large independent samples of healthy older adults (n = 161 each); the Longitudinal Healthy Aging Brain (LHAB) database project at the University of Zurich, Switzerland, and 1000BRAINS at the Research Center Juelich, Germany. Annual percentage changes in the two samples revealed stable to slight decreases in cortical thickness over time. After correction for major covariates, i.e., baseline age, sex, education, and image quality, sample differences were only marginally present. Results suggest that general trends across time might be generalizable over independent samples, assuming the same methodology is used, and similar sample characteristics are present.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The functional connectome of white matter and graph theory were used to these participants. Two-sample t-test was used for the detection the abnormal graph properties in FD. Pearson correlation was used for the relationship between properties and the clinical and neuropshychological information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Patients with FD and healthy controls showed small-world properties in functional connectome of white matter. Compared with healthy controls, the FD group showed decreased global properties (Cp, S, Eglobal, and Elocal). Four pairs of fiber bundles that are connected to the frontal lobe, insula, and thalamus were affected in the FD group. Duration and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index positively correlated with the betweenness centrality of white matter regions of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: FD patients turned to a non-optimized functional organization of WM brain network.

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Dark Rearing Promotes the Recovery of Visual Cortical Responses but Not the Morphology of Geniculocortical Axons in Amblyopic Cat</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.637638</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Monocular deprivation (MD) of vision during early postnatal life induces amblyopia, and most neurons in the primary visual cortex lose their responses to the closed eye. Anatomically, the somata of neurons in the closed-eye recipient layer of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) shrink and their axons projecting to the visual cortex retract. Although it has been difficult to restore visual acuity after maturation, recent studies in rodents and cats showed that a period of exposure to complete darkness could promote recovery from amblyopia induced by prior MD. However, in cats, which have an organization of central visual pathways similar to humans, the effect of dark rearing only improves monocular vision and does not restore binocular depth perception. To determine whether dark rearing can completely restore the visual pathway, we examined its effect on the three major concomitants of MD in individual visual neurons, eye preference of visual cortical neurons and soma size and axon morphology of LGN neurons. Dark rearing improved the recovery of visual cortical responses to the closed eye compared with the recovery under binocular conditions. However, geniculocortical axons serving the closed eye remained retracted after dark rearing, whereas reopening the closed eye restored the soma size of LGN neurons. These results indicate that dark rearing incompletely restores the visual pathway, and thus exerts a limited restorative effect on visual function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.666798</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Visual information is conveyed from the eye to the brain through the axons of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that course through the optic nerve and synapse onto neurons in multiple subcortical visual relay areas. RGCs cannot regenerate their axons once they are damaged, similar to most mature neurons in the central nervous system (CNS), and soon undergo cell death. These phenomena of neurodegeneration and regenerative failure are widely viewed as being determined by cell-intrinsic mechanisms within RGCs or to be influenced by the extracellular environment, including glial or inflammatory cells. However, a new concept is emerging that the death or survival of RGCs and their ability to regenerate axons are also influenced by the complex circuitry of the retina and that the activation of a multicellular signaling cascade involving changes in inhibitory interneurons – the amacrine cells (AC) – contributes to the fate of RGCs. Here, we review our current understanding of the role that interneurons play in cell survival and axon regeneration after optic nerve injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: NF-κB-Induced Upregulation of miR-146a-5p Promoted Hippocampal Neuronal Oxidative Stress and Pyroptosis via TIGAR in a Model of Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.653881</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that places a heavy burden on patients and society. Hippocampal neuronal loss is a hallmark of AD progression. Therefore, understanding the mechanism underlying hippocampal neuronal death would be of great importance for the diagnosis and treatment of AD. This study aimed to explore the molecular mechanism via which nuclear factor kappa β (NF-κB) promotes hippocampal neuronal oxidative stress and pyroptosis in AD. We collected serum samples from 101 healthy elderly people and 112 patients with AD at the Affiliated Hospital of Kunming University of Science and Technology between January 2017 and January 2020. Commercially available human hippocampal neurons (HHNs) were used to establish an AD model (AD-HHN) following Aβ25–35 treatment. The mRNA expression levels of NF-κB and pyroptosis markers [NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3, caspase-1, interleukin (IL)-1β, and interleukin-18] mRNA and the expression level of miR-146a-5p in the serum samples of patients with AD and AD-HHNs were determined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Oxidative stress indices (reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, superoxide dismutase, glutathione, and catalase) were measured by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). The expression of proteins [NF-κB, TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR), and pyroptosis markers] was tested by western blotting. The relationship between miR-146a-5p and TIGAR was investigated using a dual luciferase reporter gene assay. We found that NF-κB and miR-146a-5p were highly expressed, while TIGAR was low expressed in patients with AD and AD-HHNs. In addition, there was a significant positive correlation between the expression levels of NF-κB and miR-146a-5p, but a negative correlation between NF-κB mRNA and TIGAR mRNA in patients with AD, as well as miR-146a-5p and TIGAR mRNA in patients with AD. In AD-HNNs, miR-146a-5p targeted and downregulated the expression of TIGAR. Knockdown of NF-κB or overexpression of TIGAR markedly attenuated oxidative stress and pyroptosis in AD-HHNs, while concurrent overexpression of miR-146a-5p inhibited these effects. In conclusion, NF-κB-induced upregulation of miR-146a-5p promoted oxidative stress and pyroptosis in AD-HNNs by targeting TIGAR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: 3D Reconstruction of the Morpho-Functional Topography of the Human Vagal Trigone</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.663399</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Vagal Trigone, often referred to as Ala Cinerea, is a triangular-shaped area of the floor of the fourth ventricle that is strictly involved in the network of chardiochronotropic, baroceptive, respiratory, and gastrointestinal control systems of the medulla oblongata. While it is frequently identified as the superficial landmark for the underlying Dorsal Motor Nucleus of the Vagus, this correspondence is not univocal in anatomical literature and is often oversimplified in neuroanatomy textbooks and neurosurgical atlases. As the structure represents an important landmark for neurosurgical procedures involving the floor of the fourth ventricle, accurate morphological characterization is required to avoid unwanted side effects (e.g., bradychardia, hypertension) during neuorphysiological monitoring and cranial nerve nuclei stimulation in intraoperative settings. The aim of this study was to address the anatomo-topographical relationships of the Vagal Trigone with the underlying nuclei. For this purpose, we have conducted an anatomo-microscopical examination of serial sections deriving from 54 Human Brainstems followed by 3D reconstruction and rendering of the specimens. Our findings indicate that the Vagal Trigone corresponds only partially with the Dorsal Motor Nucleus of the Vagus, while most of its axial profile is occupied by the dorsal regions of the Solitary Tract Nucleus. Furthermore, basing on literature and our findings we speculate that the neuroblasts of the Dorsal Motor Nucleus of the Vagus undergo neurobiotaxic migration induced by the neuroblasts of the dorsolaterally located solitary tract nucleus, giving rise to the Ala Cinerea, a topographically defined area for parasympathetic visceral control.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.649929</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Exercise has multiple beneficial effects on health including decreasing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases. Such effects are thought to be mediated (at least in part) by myokines, a collection of cytokines and other small proteins released from skeletal muscles. As an endocrine organ, skeletal muscle synthesizes and secretes a wide range of myokines which contribute to different functions in different organs, including the brain. One such myokine is the recently discovered protein Irisin, which is secreted into circulation from skeletal muscle during exercise from its membrane bound precursor Fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5). Irisin contributes to metabolic processes such as glucose homeostasis and browning of white adipose tissue. Irisin also crosses the blood brain barrier and initiates a neuroprotective genetic program in the hippocampus that culminates with increased expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Furthermore, exercise and FNDC5/Irisin have been shown to have several neuroprotective effects against injuries in ischemia and neurodegenerative disease models, including Alzheimer’s disease. In addition, Irisin has anxiolytic and antidepressant effects. In this review we present and summarize recent findings on the multiple effects of Irisin on neural function, including signaling pathways and mechanisms involved. We also discuss how exercise can positively influence brain function and mental health via the “skeletal muscle-brain axis.” While there are still many unanswered questions, we put forward the idea that Irisin is a potentially essential mediator of the skeletal muscle-brain crosstalk.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Role of mTOR-Regulated Autophagy in Synaptic Plasticity Related Proteins Downregulation and the Reference Memory Deficits Induced by Anesthesia/Surgery in Aged Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.628541</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Postoperative cognitive dysfunction increases mortality and morbidity in perioperative patients and has become a major concern for patients and caregivers. Previous studies demonstrated that synaptic plasticity is closely related to cognitive function, anesthesia and surgery inhibit synaptic function. In central nervous system, autophagy is vital to synaptic plasticity, homeostasis of synapticproteins, synapse elimination, spine pruning, proper axon guidance, and when dysregulated, is associated with behavioral and memory functions disorders. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) negatively regulates the process of autophagy. This study aimed to explore whether rapamycin can ameliorate anesthesia/surgery-induced cognitive deficits by inhibiting mTOR, activating autophagy and rising synaptic plasticity-related proteins in the hippocampus. Aged C57BL/6J mice were used to establish POCD models with exploratory laparotomy under isoflurane anesthesia. The Morris Water Maze (MWM) was used to measure reference memory after anesthesia and surgery. The levels of mTOR phosphorylation (p-mTOR), Beclin-1 and LC3-II were examined on postoperative days 1, 3 and 7 by western blotting. The levels of synaptophysin (SYN) and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) in the hippocampus were also examined by western blotting. Here we showed that anesthesia/surgery impaired reference memory and induced the activation of mTOR, decreased the expression of autophagy-related proteins such as Beclin-1 and LC3-II. A corresponding decline in the expression of neuronal/synaptic, plasticity-related proteins such as SYN and PSD-95 was also observed. Pretreating mice with rapamycin inhibited the activation of mTOR and restored autophagy function, also increased the expression of SYN and PSD-95. Furthermore, anesthesia/surgery-induced learning and memory deficits were also reversed by rapamycin pretreatment. In conclusion, anesthesia/surgery induced mTOR hyperactivation and autophagy impairments, and then reduced the levels of SYN and PSD-95 in the hippocampus. An mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, ameliorated anesthesia/surgery-related cognitive impairments by inhibiting the mTOR activity, inducing activation of autophagy, enhancing SYN and PSD-95 expression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Cardiac anatomy plays a crucial role in determining cardiac function. However, there is a poor understanding of how specific and localised anatomical changes affect different cardiac functional outputs. In this work, we test the hypothesis that in a statistical shape model (SSM), the modes that are most relevant for describing anatomy are also most important for determining the output of cardiac electromechanics simulations. We made patient-specific four-chamber heart meshes (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 20) from cardiac CT images in asymptomatic subjects and created a SSM from 19 cases. Nine modes captured 90% of the anatomical variation in the SSM. Functional simulation outputs correlated best with modes 2, 3 and 9 on average (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; = 0.49 ± 0.17, 0.37 ± 0.23 and 0.34 ± 0.17 respectively). We performed a global sensitivity analysis to identify the different modes responsible for different simulated electrical and mechanical measures of cardiac function. Modes 2 and 9 were the most important for determining simulated left ventricular mechanics and pressure-derived phenotypes. Mode 2 explained 28.56 ± 16.48% and 25.5 ± 20.85, and mode 9 explained 12.1 ± 8.74% and 13.54 ± 16.91% of the variances of mechanics and pressure-derived phenotypes, respectively. Electrophysiological biomarkers were explained by the interaction of 3 ± 1 modes. In the healthy adult human heart, shape modes that explain large portions of anatomical variance do not explain equivalent levels of electromechanical functional variation. As a result, in cardiac models, representing patient anatomy using a limited number of modes of anatomical variation can cause a loss in accuracy of simulated electromechanical function.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/eTlBJyE2pCY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Repeat proteins are abundant in eukaryotic proteomes. They are involved in many eukaryotic specific functions, including signalling. For many of these proteins, the structure is not known, as they are difficult to crystallise. Today, using direct coupling analysis and deep learning it is often possible to predict a protein’s structure. However, the unique sequence features present in repeat proteins have been a challenge to use direct coupling analysis for predicting contacts. Here, we show that deep learning-based methods (trRosetta, DeepMetaPsicov (DMP) and PconsC4) overcomes this problem and can predict intra- and inter-unit contacts in repeat proteins. In a benchmark dataset of 815 repeat proteins, about 90% can be correctly modelled. Further, among 48 PFAM families lacking a protein structure, we produce models of forty-one families with estimated high accuracy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NC-_vO_A2A8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Brain networks exhibit very variable and dynamical functional connectivity and flexible configurations of information exchange despite their overall fixed structure. Brain oscillations are hypothesized to underlie time-dependent functional connectivity by periodically changing the excitability of neural populations. In this paper, we investigate the role of the connection delay and the detuning between the natural frequencies of neural populations in the transmission of signals. Based on numerical simulations and analytical arguments, we show that the amount of information transfer between two oscillating neural populations could be determined by their connection delay and the mismatch in their oscillation frequencies. Our results highlight the role of the collective phase response curve of the oscillating neural populations for the efficacy of signal transmission and the quality of the information transfer in brain networks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rB0tSDpOfkI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When we experience an event, it feels like our previous experiences, our
interpretations of that event (e.g., aesthetics, emotions), and our current
state will determine how we will remember it. However, recent work has revealed
a strong sway of the visual world itself in influencing what we remember and
forget. Certain items -- including certain faces, words, images, and movements
-- are intrinsically memorable or forgettable across observers, regardless of
individual differences. Further, neuroimaging research has revealed that the
brain is sensitive to memorability both rapidly and automatically during late
perception. These strong consistencies in memory across people may reflect the
broad organizational principles of our sensory environment, and may reveal how
the brain prioritizes information before encoding items into memory. In this
chapter, I will discuss our current state-of-the-art understanding of
memorability for visual information, and what these findings imply about how we

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06831</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many real-world applications have the time-linkage property, and the only
theoretical analysis is recently given by Zheng, et al. (TEVC 2021) on their
proposed time-linkage OneMax problem, OneMax$_{(0,1^n)}$. However, only two
elitist algorithms (1+1)EA and ($\mu$+1)EA are analyzed, and it is unknown
whether the non-elitism mechanism could help to escape the local optima existed
in OneMax$_{(0,1^n)}$. In general, there are few theoretical results on the
benefits of the non-elitism in evolutionary algorithms. In this work, we
analyze on the influence of the non-elitism via comparing the performance of
the elitist (1+$\lambda$)EA and its non-elitist counterpart (1,$\lambda$)EA. We
prove that with probability $1-o(1)$ (1+$\lambda$)EA will get stuck in the
local optima and cannot find the global optimum, but with probability $1$,
(1,$\lambda$)EA can reach the global optimum and its expected runtime is
$O(n^{3+c}\log n)$ with $\lambda=c \log_{\frac{e}{e-1}} n$ for the constant
$c\ge 1$. Noting that a smaller offspring size is helpful for escaping from the
local optima, we further resort to the compact genetic algorithm where only two
individuals are sampled to update the probabilistic model, and prove its
expected runtime of $O(n^3\log n)$. Our computational experiments also verify
the efficiency of the two non-elitist algorithms.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06714</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Most evolutionary algorithms have multiple parameters and their values
drastically affect the performance. Due to the often complicated interplay of
the parameters, setting these values right for a particular problem (parameter
tuning) is a challenging task . This task becomes even more complicated when
the optimal parameter values change significantly during the run of the
algorithm since then a dynamic parameter choice (parameter control) is
necessary.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, we propose a lazy but effective solution, namely choosing all
parameter values (where this makes sense) in each iteration randomly from a
suitably scaled power-law distribution. To demonstrate the effectiveness of
this approach, we perform runtime analyses of the $(1+(\lambda,\lambda))$
genetic algorithm with all three parameters chosen in this manner. We show this
algorithm on the one hand can imitate simple hill-climbers like the $(1+1)$ EA,
giving the same asymptotic runtime on problems like OneMax, LeadingOnes, or
Minimum Spanning Tree. On the other hand, this algorithm is also very efficient
on jump functions, where the best static parameters are very different from
those necessary to optimize simple problems. We prove a performance guarantee
that is comparable, sometimes even better, than the best performance known for
static parameters. We complement our theoretical results with a rigorous
empirical study confirming what the asymptotic runtime results suggest.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06585</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The capacitated arc routing problem (CARP) is a challenging combinatorial
optimisation problem abstracted from typical real-world applications, like
waste collection and mail delivery. However, few studies considered dynamic
changes during the vehicles' service, which can make the original schedule
infeasible or obsolete. The few existing studies are limited by dynamic
scenarios that can suffer single types of dynamic events, and by algorithms
that rely on special operators or representations, being unable to benefit from
the wealth of contributions provided by the static CARP literature. Here, we
provide the first mathematical formulation for dynamic CARP (DCARP) and design
a simulation system to execute the CARP solutions and generate DCARP instances
with several common dynamic events. We then propose a novel framework able to
generalise all existing static CARP optimisation algorithms so that they can
cope with DCARP instances. The framework has the option to enhance optimisation
performance for DCARP instances based on a restart strategy that makes no use
of past history, and a sequence transfer strategy that benefits from past
optimisation experience. Empirical studies are conducted on a wide range of
DCARP instances. The results highlight the need for tackling dynamic changes
and show that the proposed framework significantly improves over existing
algorithms.

	<title>The Cerebellum: Contributions of Cerebellar White Matter Microstructure to Social Difficulty in Nonverbal Learning Disability</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-021-01265-4</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Emerging evidence suggests that the cerebellum may contribute to variety of cognitive capacities, including social cognition. Nonverbal learning disability (NVLD) is characterized by visual-spatial and social impairment. Recent functional neuroimaging studies have shown that children with NVLD have altered cerebellar resting-state functional connectivity, which is associated with various symptom domains. However, little is known about cerebellar white matter microstructure in NVLD and whether it contributes to social deficits. Twenty-seven children (12 with NVLD, 15 typically developing (TD)) contributed useable diffusion tensor imaging data. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) were used to quantify fractional anisotropy (FA) in the cerebellar peduncles. Parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist, providing a measure of social difficulty. Children with NVLD had greater fractional anisotropy in the left and right inferior cerebellar peduncle. Furthermore, right inferior cerebellar peduncle FA was associated with social impairment as measured by the Child Behavior Checklist Social Problems subscale. Finally, the association between NVLD diagnosis and greater social impairment was mediated by right inferior cerebellar peduncle FA. These findings provide additional evidence that the cerebellum contributes both to social cognition and to the pathophysiology of NVLD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Motility Profile of Captive-Bred Marmosets Revealed by a Long-Term In-Cage Monitoring System</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.645308</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A quantitative evaluation of motility is crucial for studies employing experimental animals. Here, we describe the development of an in-cage motility monitoring method for new world monkeys using off-the-shelf components, and demonstrate its capability for long-term operation (e.g., a year). Based on this novel system, we characterized the motility of the common marmoset over different time scales (seconds, hours, days, and weeks). Monitoring of seven young animals belonging to two different age groups (sub-adult and young-adult) over a 231-day period revealed: (1) strictly diurnal activity (97.3% of movement during daytime), (2) short-cycle (∼20 s) transition in activity, and (3) bimodal diurnal activity including a “siesta” break. Additionally, while the mean duration of short-cycle activity, net daily activity, and diurnal activity changed over the course of development, 24-h periodicity remained constant. Finally, the method allowed for detection of progressive motility deterioration in a transgenic marmoset. Motility measurement offers a convenient way to characterize developmental and pathological changes in animals, as well as an economical and labor-free means for long-term evaluation in a wide range of basic and translational studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: The Forward Model: A Unifying Theory for the Role of the Cerebellum in Motor Control and Sense of Agency</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.644059</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For more than two decades, there has been converging evidence for an essential role of the cerebellum in non-motor functions. The cerebellum is not only important in learning and sensorimotor processes, some growing evidences show its implication in conditional learning and reward, which allows building our expectations about behavioral outcomes. More recent work has demonstrated that the cerebellum is also required for the sense of agency, a cognitive process that allows recognizing an action as our own, suggesting that the cerebellum might serve as an interface between sensorimotor function and cognition. A unifying model that would explain the role of the cerebellum across these processes has not been fully established. Nonetheless, an important heritage was given by the field of motor control: the forward model theory. This theory stipulates that movements are controlled based on the constant interactions between our organism and its environment through feedforward and feedback loops. Feedforward loops predict what is going to happen, while feedback loops confront the prediction with what happened so that we can react accordingly. From an anatomical point of view, the cerebellum is at an ideal location at the interface between the motor and sensory systems, as it is connected to cerebral, striatal, and spinal entities via parallel loops, so that it can link sensory and motor systems with cognitive processes. Recent findings showing that the cerebellum participates in building the sense of agency as a predictive and comparator system will be reviewed together with past work on motor control within the context of the forward model theory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Naturalistic Spike Trains Drive State-Dependent Homeostatic Plasticity in Superficial Layers of Visual Cortex</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2021.663282</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The history of neural activity determines the synaptic plasticity mechanisms employed in the brain. Previous studies report a rapid reduction in the strength of excitatory synapses onto layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons of the primary visual cortex (V1) following two days of dark exposure and subsequent re-exposure to light. The abrupt increase in visually driven activity is predicted to drive homeostatic plasticity, however, the parameters of neural activity that trigger these changes are unknown. To determine this, we first recorded spike trains in vivo from V1 layer 4 (L4) of dark exposed (DE) mice of both sexes that were re-exposed to light through homogeneous or patterned visual stimulation. We found that delivering the spike patterns recorded in vivo to L4 of V1 slices was sufficient to reduce the amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) of V1 L2/3 neurons in DE mice, but not in slices obtained from normal reared (NR) controls. Unexpectedly, the same stimulation pattern produced an up-regulation of mEPSC amplitudes in V1 L2/3 neurons from mice that received 2 h of light re-exposure (LE). A Poisson spike train exhibiting the same average frequency as the patterns recorded in vivo was equally effective at depressing mEPSC amplitudes in L2/3 neurons in V1 slices prepared from DE mice. Collectively, our results suggest that the history of visual experience modifies the responses of V1 neurons to stimulation and that rapid homeostatic depression of excitatory synapses can be driven by non-patterned input activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Myosin V Regulates Spatial Localization of Different Forms of Neurotransmitter Release in Central Synapses</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2021.650334</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Synaptic active zone (AZ) contains multiple specialized release sites for vesicle fusion. The utilization of release sites is regulated to determine spatiotemporal organization of the two main forms of synchronous release, uni-vesicular (UVR) and multi-vesicular (MVR). We previously found that the vesicle-associated molecular motor myosin V regulates temporal utilization of release sites by controlling vesicle anchoring at release sites in an activity-dependent manner. Here we show that acute inhibition of myosin V shifts preferential location of vesicle docking away from AZ center toward periphery, and results in a corresponding spatial shift in utilization of release sites during UVR. Similarly, inhibition of myosin V also reduces preferential utilization of central release sites during MVR, leading to more spatially distributed and temporally uniform MVR that occurs farther away from the AZ center. Using a modeling approach, we provide a conceptual framework that unites spatial and temporal functions of myosin V in vesicle release by controlling the gradient of release site release probability across the AZ, which in turn determines the spatiotemporal organization of both UVR and MVR. Thus myosin V regulates both temporal and spatial utilization of release sites during two main forms of synchronous release.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Visual Outcomes in Experimental Rodent Models of Blast-Mediated Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.659576</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Blast-mediated traumatic brain injuries (bTBI) cause long-lasting physical, cognitive, and psychological disorders, including persistent visual impairment. No known therapies are currently utilized in humans to lessen the lingering and often serious symptoms. With TBI mortality decreasing due to advancements in medical and protective technologies, there is growing interest in understanding the pathology of visual dysfunction after bTBI. However, this is complicated by numerous variables, e.g., injury location, severity, and head and body shielding. This review summarizes the visual outcomes observed by various, current experimental rodent models of bTBI, and identifies data showing that bTBI activates inflammatory and apoptotic signaling leading to visual dysfunction. Pharmacologic treatments blocking inflammation and cell death pathways reported to alleviate visual deficits in post-bTBI animal models are discussed. Notably, techniques for assessing bTBI outcomes across exposure paradigms differed widely, so we urge future studies to compare multiple models of blast injury, to allow data to be directly compared.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurons have high metabolic demands that are almost exclusively met by glucose supplied from the bloodstream. Glucose is utilized in complex metabolic interactions between neurons and glia cells, described by the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle (ANLS) hypothesis. The neural retina faces similar energy demands to the rest of the brain, with additional high anabolic needs to support continuous renewal of photoreceptor outer segments. This demand is met by a fascinating variation of the ANLS in which photoreceptors are the central part of a metabolic landscape, using glucose and supplying surrounding cells with metabolic intermediates. In this review we summarize recent evidence on how neurons, in particular photoreceptors, meet their energy and biosynthetic requirements by comprising a metabolic landscape of interdependent cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.647451</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Protein–protein interaction networks and signaling complexes are essential for normal brain function and are often dysregulated in neurological disorders. Nevertheless, unraveling neuron- and synapse-specific proteins interaction networks has remained a technical challenge. New techniques, however, have allowed for high-resolution and high-throughput analyses, enabling quantification and characterization of various neuronal protein populations. Over the last decade, mass spectrometry (MS) has surfaced as the primary method for analyzing multiple protein samples in tandem, allowing for the precise quantification of proteomic data. Moreover, the development of sophisticated protein-labeling techniques has given MS a high temporal and spatial resolution, facilitating the analysis of various neuronal substructures, cell types, and subcellular compartments. Recent studies have leveraged these novel techniques to reveal the proteomic underpinnings of well-characterized neuronal processes, such as axon guidance, long-term potentiation, and homeostatic plasticity. Translational MS studies have facilitated a better understanding of complex neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Schizophrenia (SCZ), and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Proteomic investigation of these diseases has not only given researchers new insight into disease mechanisms but has also been used to validate disease models and identify new targets for research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) regulate each other and have been implicated in several neuronal mechanisms, including neuroplasticity. We have investigated the effects of BDNF on serotonergic neurons by deleting BDNF receptor TrkB from serotonergic neurons in the adult brain. The transgenic mice show increased 5-HT and Tph2 levels with abnormal behavioral phenotype. In spite of increased food intake, the transgenic mice are significantly leaner than their wildtype littermates, which may be due to increased metabolic activity. Consistent with increased 5-HT, the proliferation of hippocampal progenitors is significantly increased, however, long-term survival of newborn cells is unchanged. Our data indicates that BDNF-TrkB signaling regulates the functional phenotype of 5-HT neurons with long-term behavioral consequences.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Management and Quality Control of Large Neuroimaging Datasets: Developments From the Barcelonaβeta Brain Research Center</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.633438</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent decades have witnessed an increasing number of large to very large imaging studies, prominently in the field of neurodegenerative diseases. The datasets collected during these studies form essential resources for the research aiming at new biomarkers. Collecting, hosting, managing, processing, or reviewing those datasets is typically achieved through a local neuroinformatics infrastructure. In particular for organizations with their own imaging equipment, setting up such a system is still a hard task, and relying on cloud-based solutions, albeit promising, is not always possible. This paper proposes a practical model guided by core principles including user involvement, lightweight footprint, modularity, reusability, and facilitated data sharing. This model is based on the experience from an 8-year-old research center managing cohort research programs on Alzheimer’s disease. Such a model gave rise to an ecosystem of tools aiming at improved quality control through seamless automatic processes combined with a variety of code libraries, command line tools, graphical user interfaces, and instant messaging applets. The present ecosystem was shaped around XNAT and is composed of independently reusable modules that are freely available on GitLab/GitHub. This paradigm is scalable to the general community of researchers working with large neuroimaging datasets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The vital role of reward in guiding visual attention has been supported by previous literatures. Here, we examined the motivational impact of monetary reward feedback stimuli on visual attention selection using an event-related potential (ERP) component called stimulus-preceding negativity (SPN) and a standard contextual cueing (CC) paradigm. It has been proposed that SPN reflects affective and motivational processing. We focused on whether incidentally learned context knowledge could be affected by reward. Both behavior and brain data demonstrated that contexts followed by reward feedback not only gave rise to faster implicit learning but also obtained a larger CC effect.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Hemodynamic Signal Changes During Motor Imagery Task Performance Are Associated With the Degree of Motor Task Learning</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.603069</link>
	<content:encoded>Purpose&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to investigate whether oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) generated during a motor imagery (MI) task is associated with the motor learning level of the task.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We included 16 right-handed healthy participants who were trained to perform a ball rotation (BR) task. Hemodynamic brain activity was measured using near-infrared spectroscopy to monitor changes in oxy-Hb concentration during the BR MI task. The experimental protocol used a block design, and measurements were performed three times before and after the initial training of the BR task as well as after the final training. The BR count during training was also measured. Furthermore, subjective vividness of MI was evaluated three times after NIRS measurement using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The results showed that the number of BRs increased significantly with training (P &amp;lt; 0.001). VAS scores also improved with training (P &amp;lt; 0.001). Furthermore, oxy-Hb concentration and the region of interest (ROI) showed a main effect (P = 0.001). An interaction was confirmed (P &amp;lt; 0.001), and it was ascertained that the change in oxy-Hb concentrations due to training was different for each ROI. The most significant predictor of subjective MI vividness was supplementary motor area (SMA) oxy-Hb concentration (coefficient = 0.365).&lt;/p&gt;Discussion&lt;p&gt;Hemodynamic brain activity during MI tasks may be correlated with task motor learning levels, since significant changes in oxy-Hb concentrations were observed following initial and final training in the SMA. In particular, hemodynamic brain activity in the SMA was suggested to reflect the MI vividness of participants.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Striatal Dopamine Transporter Function Is Facilitated by Converging Biology of α-Synuclein and Cholesterol</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.658244</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Striatal dopamine transporters (DAT) powerfully regulate dopamine signaling, and can contribute risk to degeneration in Parkinson’s disease (PD). DATs can interact with the neuronal protein α-synuclein, which is associated with the etiology and molecular pathology of idiopathic and familial PD. Here, we tested whether DAT function in governing dopamine (DA) uptake and release is modified in a human-α-synuclein-overexpressing (SNCA-OVX) transgenic mouse model of early PD. Using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FCV) in ex vivo acute striatal slices to detect DA release, and biochemical assays, we show that several aspects of DAT function are promoted in SNCA-OVX mice. Compared to background control α-synuclein-null mice (Snca-null), the SNCA-OVX mice have elevated DA uptake rates, and more pronounced effects of DAT inhibitors on evoked extracellular DA concentrations ([DA]&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;) and on short-term plasticity (STP) in DA release, indicating DATs play a greater role in limiting DA release and in driving STP. We found that DAT membrane levels and radioligand binding sites correlated with α-synuclein level. Furthermore, DAT function in Snca-null and SNCA-OVX mice could also be promoted by applying cholesterol, and using Tof-SIMS we found genotype-differences in striatal lipids, with lower striatal cholesterol in SNCA-OVX mice. An inhibitor of cholesterol efflux transporter ABCA1 or a cholesterol chelator in SNCA-OVX mice reduced the effects of DAT-inhibitors on evoked [DA]&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;. Together these data indicate that human α-synuclein in a mouse model of PD promotes striatal DAT function, in a manner supported by extracellular cholesterol, suggesting converging biology of α-synuclein and cholesterol that regulates DAT function and could impact DA function and PD pathophysiology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Nasal Delivery of D-Penicillamine Hydrogel Upregulates a Disintegrin and Metalloprotease 10 Expression via Melatonin Receptor 1 in Alzheimer’s Disease Models</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a type of neurodegenerative disease that is associated with the accumulation of amyloid plaques. Increasing non-amyloidogenic processing and/or manipulating amyloid precursor protein signaling could reduce AD amyloid pathology and cognitive impairment. D-penicillamine (D-Pen) is a water-soluble metal chelator and can reduce the aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) with metals in vitro. However, the potential mechanism of D-Pen for treating neurodegenerative disorders remains unexplored. In here, a novel type of chitosan-based hydrogel to carry D-Pen was designed and the D-Pen-CS/β-glycerophosphate hydrogel were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and HPLC. Behavior tests investigated the learning and memory levels of APP/PS1 mice treated through the D-Pen hydrogel nasal delivery. In vivo and in vitro findings showed that nasal delivery of D-Pen-CS/β-GP hydrogel had properly chelated metal ions that reduced Aβ deposition. Furthermore, D-Pen mainly regulated A disintegrin and metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10) expression via melatonin receptor 1 (MTNR1α) and the downstream PKA/ERK/CREB pathway. The present data demonstrated D-Pen significantly improved the cognitive ability of APP/PS1 mice and reduced Aβ generation through activating ADAM10 and accelerating non-amyloidogenic processing. Hence, these findings indicate the potential of D-Pen as a promising agent for treating AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Neuromodulation Effect of Very Low Intensity Transcranial Ultrasound Stimulation on Multiple Nuclei in Rat Brain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.656430</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;Low-intensity transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique with high spatial resolution and feasible penetration depth. To date, the mechanisms of TUS modulated neural oscillations are not fully understood. This study designed a very low acoustic intensity (AI) TUS system that produces considerably reduced AI Ultrasound pulses (I&lt;sub&gt;SPTA&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 0.5 W/cm2) when compared to previous methods used to measure regional neural oscillation patterns under different TUS parameters.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We recorded the local field potential (LFP) of five brain nuclei under TUS with three groups of simulating parameters. Spectrum estimation, time-frequency analysis (TFA), and relative power analysis methods have been applied to investigate neural oscillation patterns under different stimulation parameters.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Under PRF, 500 Hz and 1 kHz TUS, high-amplitude LFP activity with the auto-rhythmic pattern appeared in selected nuclei when I&lt;sub&gt;SPTA&lt;/sub&gt; exceeded 12 mW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. With TFA, high-frequency energy (slow gamma and high gamma) was significantly increased during the auto-rhythmic patterns. We observed an initial plateau in nuclei response when I&lt;sub&gt;SPTA&lt;/sub&gt; reached 16.4 mW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for RPF 500 Hz and 20.8 mW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for RPF 1 kHz. The number of responding nuclei started decreasing while I&lt;sub&gt;SPTA&lt;/sub&gt; continued increasing. Under 1.5 kHz TUS, no auto-rhythmic patterns have been observed, but slow frequency power was increased during TUS. TUS inhibited most of the frequency band and generated obvious slow waves (theta and delta band) when stimulated at RPF = 1.5 kHz, I&lt;sub&gt;SPTA&lt;/sub&gt; = 8.8 mW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These results demonstrate that very low intensity Transcranial Ultrasound Stimulation (VLTUS) exerts significant neuromodulator effects under specific parameters in rat models and may be a valid tool to study neuronal physiology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Both groups received 15 min of mind-motor training followed by 45 min of either HIIT or MCT. Participants exercised in total 60 min/day, 3 days/week for 6 months. We assessed changes in global cognitive functioning (GCF), Trail-Making Test (TMT), systolic and diastolic BP, and cardiorespiratory fitness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Participants in both groups improved diastolic BP [F&lt;sub&gt;(1, 87.32)&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.392, p = 0.039], with greatest effect within the HIIT group [estimated mean change (95% CI): −2.64 mmHg, (−4.79 to −0.48), p = 0.017], but no between-group differences were noted (p = 0.17). Both groups also improved cardiorespiratory fitness [F&lt;sub&gt;(1, 69)&lt;/sub&gt; = 34.795, p &amp;lt; 0.001], and TMT A [F&lt;sub&gt;(1, 81.51)&lt;/sub&gt; = 26.871, p &amp;lt; 0.001] and B [F&lt;sub&gt;(1, 79.49)&lt;/sub&gt; = 23.107, p &amp;lt; 0.001]. There were, however, no within- or between-group differences in GCF and systolic BP at follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Despite improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness, exercise of high- or moderate-intensity, combined with mind-motor training, did not improve GCF or systolic BP in individuals with hypertension and SCD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration:ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03545958).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;There is growing evidence that testosterone may be implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We aimed to examine the relationship between plasma total testosterone levels and change in brain glucose metabolism over time among non-demented older people.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The association of plasma total testosterone levels with change in brain glucose metabolism among non-demented older people was investigated cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Given a significant difference in levels of plasma total testosterone between gender, we performed our analysis in a sex-stratified way. At baseline, 228 non-demented older people were included: 152 males and 76 females.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;In the cross-sectional analysis, no significant relationship between plasma total testosterone levels and brain glucose metabolism was found in males or females. In the longitudinal analysis, we found a significant association of plasma total testosterone levels with change in brain glucose metabolism over time in males, but not in females. More specifically, in males, higher levels of total testosterone in plasma at baseline were associated with slower decline in brain glucose metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;We found that higher levels of total testosterone in plasma at baseline were associated with slower decline in brain glucose metabolism in males without dementia, indicating that testosterone may have beneficial effects on brain function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/67552</link>
	<content:encoded>Translesion synthesis (TLS) is a highly conserved mutagenic DNA lesion tolerance pathway, which employs specialized, low-fidelity DNA polymerases to synthesize across lesions. Current models suggest that activity of these polymerases is predominantly associated with ongoing replication, functioning either at or behind the replication fork. Here we provide evidence for DNA damage-dependent function of a specialized polymerase, DnaE2, in replication-independent conditions. We develop an assay to follow lesion repair in non-replicating &lt;i&gt;Caulobacter &lt;/i&gt;and observe that components of the replication machinery localize on DNA in response to damage. These localizations persist in the absence of DnaE2 or if catalytic activity of this polymerase is mutated. Single-stranded DNA gaps for SSB binding and low-fidelity polymerase-mediated synthesis are generated by nucleotide excision repair, as replisome components fail to localize in the absence of NER. This mechanism of gap-filling facilitates cell cycle restoration when cells are released into replication-permissive conditions. Thus, such cross-talk (between activity of NER and specialized polymerases in subsequent gap-filling) helps preserve genome integrity and enhances survival in a replication-independent manner.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Channel Nuclear Pore Complex subunits are required for transposon silencing in Drosophila</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66321</link>
	<content:encoded>The Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC) is the principal gateway between nucleus and cytoplasm that enables exchange of macromolecular cargo. Composed of multiple copies of ~30 different nucleoporins (Nups), the NPC acts as a selective portal, interacting with factors which individually license passage of specific cargo classes. Here we show that two Nups of the inner channel, Nup54 and Nup58, are essential for transposon silencing via the PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; ovary. In ovarian follicle cells, loss of Nup54 and Nup58 results in compromised piRNA biogenesis exclusively from the &lt;i&gt;flamenco&lt;/i&gt; locus, whereas knockdowns of other NPC subunits have widespread consequences. This provides evidence that some nucleoporins can acquire specialised roles in tissue-specific contexts. Our findings consolidate the idea that the NPC has functions beyond simply constituting a barrier to nuclear/cytoplasmic exchange, as genomic loci subjected to strong selective pressure can exploit NPC subunits to facilitate their expression.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65487</link>
	<content:encoded>The global pathogen &lt;i&gt;Vibrio cholerae&lt;/i&gt; undergoes cycles of biofilm formation and dispersal in the environment and the human host. Little is understood about biofilm dispersal. Here, we show that MbaA, a periplasmic polyamine sensor, and PotD1, a polyamine importer, regulate &lt;i&gt;V. cholerae&lt;/i&gt; biofilm dispersal. Spermidine, a commonly produced polyamine, drives &lt;i&gt;V. cholerae&lt;/i&gt; dispersal, whereas norspermidine, an uncommon polyamine produced by vibrios, inhibits dispersal. Spermidine and norspermidine differ by one methylene group. Both polyamines control dispersal via MbaA detection in the periplasm and subsequent signal relay. Our results suggest that dispersal fails in the absence of PotD1 because endogenously produced norspermidine is not reimported, periplasmic norspermidine accumulates, and it stimulates MbaA signaling. These results suggest that &lt;i&gt;V. cholerae&lt;/i&gt; uses MbaA to monitor environmental polyamines, blends of which potentially provide information about numbers of 'self' and 'other'. This information is used to dictate whether or not to disperse from biofilms.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Neuronal complexity is attenuated in preclinical models of migraine and restored by HDAC6 inhibition</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63076</link>
	<content:encoded>Migraine is the third most prevalent disease worldwide but the mechanisms that underlie migraine chronicity are poorly understood. Cytoskeletal flexibility is fundamental to neuronal-plasticity and is dependent on dynamic microtubules. Histone-deacetylase-6 (HDAC6) decreases microtubule dynamics by deacetylating its primary substrate, α-tubulin. We use validated mouse models of migraine to show that HDAC6-inhibition is a promising migraine treatment and reveal an undiscovered cytoarchitectural basis for migraine chronicity. The human migraine trigger, nitroglycerin, produced chronic migraine-associated pain and decreased neurite growth in headache-processing regions, which were reversed by HDAC6 inhibition. Cortical spreading depression (CSD), a physiological correlate of migraine aura, also decreased cortical neurite growth, while HDAC6-inhibitor restored neuronal complexity and decreased CSD. Importantly, a calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist also restored blunted neuronal complexity induced by nitroglycerin. Our results demonstrate that disruptions in neuronal cytoarchitecture are a feature of chronic migraine, and effective migraine therapies might include agents that restore microtubule/neuronal plasticity.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61401</link>
	<content:encoded>Numerous proteins target lipid droplets (LDs) through amphipathic helices (AHs). It is generally assumed that AHs insert bulky hydrophobic residues in packing defects at the LD surface. However, this model does not explain the targeting of perilipins, the most abundant and specific amphipathic proteins of LDs, which are weakly hydrophobic. A striking example is Plin4, whose gigantic and repetitive AH lacks bulky hydrophobic residues. Using a range of complementary approaches, we show that Plin4 forms a remarkably immobile and stable protein layer at the surface of cellular or in vitro generated oil droplets, and decreases LD size. Plin4 AH stability on LDs is exquisitely sensitive to the nature and distribution of its polar residues. These results suggest that Plin4 forms stable arrangements of adjacent AHs via polar/electrostatic interactions, reminiscent of the organization of apolipoproteins in lipoprotein particles, thus pointing to a general mechanism of AH stabilization via lateral interactions.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Intranasal oxytocin modulates very early visual processing of emotional faces</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.15.440078v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Functional imaging and behavioural studies have shown that the neuropeptide oxytocin influences processing of emotional faces. However, it is not clear whether these effects reflect modulation at an early or late stage of affective processing. We investigated the effects of oxytocin administration on early and late visual evoked potentials (VEP) in response to faces with neutral, fearful and happy expressions. In addition, we measured multifocal VEP and its associated nonlinearities to ascertain whether any changes observed in electrophysiology were indicative of a generalised effect or of one tied strictly to emotional processing. In a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design, 27 healthy male participants self-administered a nasal spray of either oxytocin (24 IU) or placebo. At very early latencies (40-60ms), oxytocin reduced right-temporal responses to fearful faces (d = .51), and central responses to both fearful (d = .48) and neutral faces (d = .54). For left occipito-temporal electrode sites, oxytocin decreased P100 reactivity to fearful expressions (d = 0.72). Oxytocin also decreased the amplitudes of the vertex positive potential (140-180ms) and late positive potential (400-600ms), regardless of whether the faces had fearful, happy or neutral expressions. The mfVEP showed no signs of selective magno-or parvo-cellular peak modulation comparing OXT with placebo with either low or high contrast stimulation. These results suggest that at early stages of visual processing, nasal oxytocin modulates responses to facial emotions, whereas at later stages of visual processing, it appears to influence more general face processing mechanisms. In addition, the measurable effects of OXT appear to be not a result of generalized brain change, but systematically related to emotional processing.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Associative learning allows animals to use past experience to predict future events. The circuits underlying memory formation support immediate and sustained changes in function, often in response to a single example. Larval Drosophila is a genetic model for memory formation that can be accessed at the molecular, synaptic, cellular, and circuit levels, often simultaneously, but the standard behavioral assay for learning and memory does not address individual animals. It has also been difficult to form long lasting memories, especially those requiring synaptic reorganization. We demonstrate a new assay for learning and memory capable of tracking the changing preferences of individual larvae. We use this assay to explore how activation of a pair of reward neurons changes the response to the innately aversive gas Carbon Dioxide, CO2. We confirm that when coupled to odor presentation in appropriate temporal sequence, optogenetic reward reduces avoidance of CO2. We find that learning is quantized, all-or-nothing, and can be extinguished by repeated unrewarded exposure to CO2. We find that memories can be stabilized against extinction by repeated training or overnight consolidation. Finally, we demonstrate long-lasting protein synthesis dependent and independent memory formation.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Dendritic GABAergic inhibition controlled by Shh signaling-dependent stellate cell pool is critical for motor learning</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.15.439999v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Cerebellar inhibitory interneurons are important regulators of neural circuit activity for diverse motor and non-motor functions. The molecular layer interneurons (MLI), consisting of basket cells (BCs) and stellate cells (SCs), are generated sequentially from Pax2+ immature interneurons which migrate from the prospective white matter to the ML of the cortex. However, little is known as to how MLI subtype identities and pool sizes are determined, nor are their contributions to motor learning well-understood. Here, we show that GABAergic progenitors fated to generate BCs and SCs transiently respond to the Shh signal. Conditional abrogation of Shh signaling reduced the number of Pax2+ cells, whereas persistent Shh pathway activation increased their numbers. These changes did not affect BC numbers but selectively altered the SC pool size. Moreover, genetic depletion of GABAergic progenitors when BCs are generated resulted in a specific reduction of SCs, suggesting that the specification of MLI subtypes is independent of their birth order and occurs after Pax2+ cells settle into their final laminar positions. Mutant mice with reduced SC numbers displayed decreased dendritic inhibitory synapses and neurotransmission onto Purkinje cells, resulting in an impaired acquisition of eyeblink conditioning. These findings reveal an essential role of Shh signaling-dependent SCs in regulating inhibitory dendritic synapses and motor learning.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.15.439988v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Circumstantial evidence points to a pathological role of alpha-synuclein (aSyn; gene symbol SNCA), conferred by aSyn misfolding and aggregation, in Parkinson disease (PD) and related synucleionpathies. Several findings in experimental models implicate perturbations in the tissue homeostatic mechanisms triggered by pathological aSyn accumulation, including impaired redox homeostasis, as significant contributors in the pathogenesis of PD. The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (NRF2) is recognized as the master regulator of cellular anti-oxidant response, both under physiological as well as in pathological conditions. Using immunohistochemical analyses, we show a robust nuclear NRF2 accumulation in post-mortem PD midbrain, detected by NRF2 phosphorylation on serine residue 40 (nuclear active p-NRF2, S40). Curated gene expression analyses of four independent publicly available microarray datasets revealed considerable alterations in NRF2-responsive genes in the disease affected regions in PD, including substantia nigra, dorsal motor nucleus of vagus, locus coeruleus and globus pallidus. To further examine the putative role of pathological aSyn accumulation on nuclear NRF2 response, we employed a transgenic mouse model of synucleionopathy (M83 line, Prnp-SNCA*Ala53Thr), which manifest widespread aSyn pathology (phosphorylated aSyn; S129) in the nervous system following intramuscular inoculation of exogenous fibrillar aSyn. We observed strong immunodetection of nuclear NRF2 in neuronal populations harboring p-aSyn (S129), and found an aberrant anti-oxidant and inflammatory gene response in the affected neuraxis. Taken together, our data support the notion that pathological aSyn accumulation impairs the redox homeostasis in nervous system, and boosting neuronal anti-oxidant response is potentially a promising approach to mitigate neurodegeneration in PD and related diseases.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Simulation of large-scale networks of neurons is an important approach to understanding and interpreting experimental data from healthy and diseased brains. Owing to the rapid development of simulation software and the accumulation of quantitative data of different neuronal types, it is possible to predict both computational and dynamical properties of local microcircuits in a &quot;bottom-up&quot; manner. Simulated data from these models can be compared with experiments and &quot;top-down&quot; modelling approaches, successively bridging the scales. Here we describe an open source pipeline, using the software Snudda, for predicting microcircuit connectivity and for setting up simulations using the NEURON simulation environment in a reproducible way. We also illustrate how to further &quot;curate&quot; data on single neuron morphologies acquired from public databases. This model building pipeline was used to set up a first version of a full-scale cellular level model of mouse dorsal striatum. Model components from that work are here used to illustrate the different steps that are needed when modelling subcortical nuclei, such as the basal ganglia.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Subjective understanding of actions and emotions involves the interplay of the semantic and action observation networks in the brain</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.15.439961v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>How we subjectively generate an understanding of other people's bodily actions and emotions is not well understood. In this 7T fMRI study, we examined the representational geometry of bodily action- and emotion-understanding by mapping individual subjective reports with word embeddings, besides using conventional univariate/multivariate analyses with predefined categories. Dimensionality reduction revealed that the representations for perceived action and emotion were high dimensional, each correlated to but were not reducible to the predefined action and emotion categories. With searchlight representational similarity analysis, we found the left middle superior temporal sulcus and left dorsal premotor cortex corresponded to the subjective action and emotion representations. Furthermore using task-residual functional connectivity and hierarchical clustering, we found that areas in the action observation network and the semantic/default-mode network were functionally connected to these two seed regions and showed similar representations. Our study provides direct evidence that both networks were concurrently involved in subjective action and emotion understanding.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Excitatory-inhibitory balance modulates the formation and dynamics of neuronal assemblies in cortical networks</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.15.439946v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Repetitive activation of subpopulation of neurons in cortical networks leads to the formation of neuronal assemblies, which can guide learning and behavior. Recent technological advances have made the artificial induction of such assemblies feasible, yet how various patterns of activation can shape their emergence in different operating regimes is not clear. Here we studied this question in large-scale cortical networks composed of excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) neurons. We found that the dynamics of the network in which neuronal assemblies are embedded is important for their induction. In networks with strong E-E coupling at the border of E-I balance, increasing the number of perturbed neurons enhanced the potentiation of ensembles. This was, however, accompanied by off-target potentiation of connections from unperturbed neurons. When strong E-E connectivity was combined with dominant E-I interactions, formation of ensembles became specific. Counter-intuitively, increasing the number of perturbed neurons in this regime decreased the average potentiation of individual synapses, leading to an optimal assembly formation at intermediate sizes. This was due to potent lateral inhibition in this regime, which also slowed down the formation of neuronal assemblies, resulting in a speed-accuracy trade-off in the performance of the networks in pattern completion and behavioral discrimination. Our results therefore suggest that the two regimes might be suited for different cognitive tasks, with fast regimes enabling crude detections and slow but specific regimes favoring finer discriminations. Functional connectivity inferred from recent experiments in mouse cortical networks seems to be consistent with the latter regime, but we show that recurrent and top-down mechanisms can dynamically modulate the networks to switch between different states. Our work provides a framework to study how neuronal perturbations can lead to network-wide plasticity under biologically realistic conditions, and sheds light on the design of future experiments to optimally induce behaviorally relevant neuronal assemblies.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Drp1 SUMO/deSUMOylation by Senp5 isoforms influences ER tubulation and mitochondrial dynamics to regulate brain development</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.15.439911v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Brain development is a highly orchestrated process requiring spatiotemporally regulated mitochondrial dynamics. Drp1, a key molecule in the mitochondrial fission machinery, undergoes various post-translational modifications including conjugation to the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO). However, the functional significance of SUMOylation/deSUMOylation on Drp1 remains controversial. SUMO-specific protease 5 (Senp5L) catalyzes the deSUMOylation of Drp1. We revealed that a splicing variant of Senp5L, Senp5S, which lacks peptidase activity, prevents deSUMOylation of Drp1 by competing against other Senps. The altered SUMOylation level of Drp1 induced by Senp5L/5S affects Drp1 ubiquitination and tubulation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thereby influencing mitochondrial morphology. A dynamic SUMOylation/deSUMOylation balance controls neuronal polarization and migration during the development of the cerebral cortex. These findings suggest a novel role of post translational modification, in which a deSUMOylation enzyme isoform competitively regulates mitochondrial dynamics and ER tubulation via Drp1 SUMOylation levels in a tightly controlled process of neuronal differentiation and corticogenesis.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.15.439619v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Efficient interhemispheric integration of neural activity between left and right primary motor cortex (M1) is critical for inter-limb motor control. We employed optogenetic stimulation to establish a framework for probing transcallosal M1-M1 interactions in rats. In male rats, we optogenetically stimulated glutamatergic neurons in right M1 and recorded the transcallosally evoked potential with chronically implanted electrodes in contralateral left M1 during dexmedetomidine anesthesia. We systematically varied the stimulation intensity and duration to characterize the relationship between stimulation parameters in right M1 and the characteristics of the evoked intracortical potentials in left M1. Optogenetic stimulation of right M1 consistently evoked a transcallosal response in left M1 with a consistent negative peak (N1) that sometimes was preceded by a smaller positive peak (P1). Higher stimulation intensity or longer stimulation duration gradually increased N1 amplitude and reduced N1 variability across trials. Median N1 latencies remained stable, once stimulation elicited a reliable N1 peak and did not display a systematic shortening with increasing stimulation intensity or duration. Optogenetically stimulated glutamatergic neurons in M1 can reliably evoke a transcallosal response in anesthetized rats and can be used to characterize the relationship between &quot;stimulation dose&quot; and &quot;response magnitude&quot; (i.e., the gain function) of transcallosal M1-to-M1 glutamatergic connections. Detailed knowledge of the stimulus-response relationship is needed to optimize the efficacy of optogenetic stimulation. Since transcallosal M1-M1 interactions can also be probed non-invasively with transcranial magnetic stimulation in humans, our optogenetic stimulation approach bears translational potential for studying how unilateral M1 stimulation can induce interhemispheric plasticity.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>This study aimed at identifying the role of angiopoietin 1 (angpt1) in brain development, the mode of action of angpt1, and the main targets in the zebrafish brain. We investigated embryonic brain angiogenesis and neural development in the angpt1sa14264, itgb1bmi371, tekhu1667 mutant fish, and the effects of transgenic overexpression of angpt1 in the larval brain. Lack of angpt1 was associated with downregulation of tek and upregulation of itgb1b. We found deficiencies in the patterning of proliferation, the vascular network and reticulospinal neurons in the hindbrain, and selective deficiencies in specific neurotransmitter systems. In the angpt1sa14264 and itgb1bmi371 larval brains, using microangiography, retrograde labeling, and immunostaining, we demonstrated that the targeted destruction of angpt1sa14264 and itgb1bmi371 mutant fish caused severe irregular cerebrovascular development, aberrant hindbrain patterning, downregulation of neural proliferation, expansion of the radial glial progenitors, deficiencies of dopaminergic, histaminergic, and GABAergic populations in the larval brain. In contrast, the tekhu1667 mutants regularly grew with no such apparent phenotypes. Neurally overexpressed angpt1 promoted opposite effects by increasing the vascular branching, increasing cell proliferation, and neuronal progenitors. Notably, zebrafish angpt1 showed neurogenic activity independent of its typical receptor tek, indicating the novel role of a dual regulation by angpt1 in embryonic neurogenesis and angiogenesis in zebrafish. The results show that angpt1 and its interaction with itgb1b are crucial in zebrafish brain neuronal and vascular development and suggest that angpt1 through itgb1b can act as a neurogenic factor in the neural proliferation fate in the developing brain.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Reconstructing connectivity of neuronal networks from single cell activity is essential to understanding brain function, but the challenge of deciphering connections from populations of silent neurons has been largely unmet. We demonstrate a protocol for deriving connectivity of realistic silent neuronal networks using stimulation combined with a supervised learning algorithm, that enables inferring connection weights with high fidelity and predicting spike trains at the single-spike and single-cell level with high accuracy. These testable predictions about the number and protocol of the required stimulations is expected to enhance future efforts for deriving neuronal connectivity and drive new experiments to better understand brain function.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25150?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Mice lacking the microglial receptor CX3CR1 display several phenotypes in the auditory brainstem. They have normal pruning in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) and increased expression of mature astrocyte markers. They have normal auditory brainstem recording (ABR) thresholds, but the ABR latencies are decreased. They show increased expression of inhibitory presynaptic terminal markers, possibly reflecting impaired inhibitory pruning. Finally, CX3CR1−/− mice lack the tonotopic gradients seen for cell body size and calyx of Held size in the MNTB.







Abstract
The precise and specialized circuitry in the auditory brainstem develops through adaptations of cellular and molecular signaling. We previously showed that elimination of microglia during development impairs synaptic pruning that leads to maturation of the calyx of Held, a large encapsulating synapse that terminates on neurons of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB). Microglia depletion also led to a decrease in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker for mature astrocytes. Here, we investigated the role of signaling through the fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1), which is expressed by microglia and mediates communication with neurons. CX3CR1−/− and wild‐type mice were studied before and after hearing onset and at 9 weeks of age. Levels of GFAP were significantly increased in the MNTB in mutants at 9 weeks. Pruning was unaffected at the calyx of Held, but we found an increase in expression of glycinergic synaptic marker in mutant mice at P14, suggesting an effect on maturation of inhibitory inputs. We observed disrupted tonotopic gradients of neuron and calyx size in MNTB in mutant mice. Auditory brainstem recording (ABR) revealed that CX3CR1−/− mice had normal thresholds and amplitudes but decreased latencies and interpeak latencies, particularly for the highest frequencies. These results demonstrate that disruption of fractalkine signaling has a significant effect on auditory brainstem development. Our findings highlight the importance of neuron–microglia–astrocyte communication in pruning of inhibitory synapses and establishment of tonotopic gradients early in postnatal development.</content:encoded>

Voltage imaging enables monitoring neural activity at sub-millisecond and sub-cellular scale, unlocking the study of subthreshold activity, synchrony, and network dynamics with unprecedented spatio-temporal resolution. However, high data rates (&amp;gt;800MB/s) and low signal-to-noise ratios create bottlenecks for analyzing such datasets. Here we present &lt;i&gt;VolPy&lt;/i&gt;, an automated and scalable pipeline to pre-process voltage imaging datasets. &lt;i&gt;VolPy&lt;/i&gt; features motion correction, memory mapping, automated segmentation, denoising and spike extraction, all built on a highly parallelizable, modular, and extensible framework optimized for memory and speed. To aid automated segmentation, we introduce a corpus of 24 manually annotated datasets from different preparations, brain areas and voltage indicators. We benchmark &lt;i&gt;VolPy&lt;/i&gt; against ground truth segmentation, simulations and electrophysiology recordings, and we compare its performance with existing algorithms in detecting spikes. Our results indicate that &lt;i&gt;VolPy&lt;/i&gt;’s performance in spike extraction and scalability are state-of-the-art.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/owh1qdr10M0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Differential contributions of synaptic and intrinsic inhibitory currents to speech segmentation via flexible phase-locking in neural oscillators</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/xayrvjSozD8/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Benjamin R. Pittman-Polletta, Yangyang Wang, David A. Stanley, Charles E. Schroeder, Miles A. Whittington, Nancy J. Kopell&lt;/p&gt;

Current hypotheses suggest that speech segmentation—the initial division and grouping of the speech stream into candidate phrases, syllables, and phonemes for further linguistic processing—is executed by a hierarchy of oscillators in auditory cortex. Theta (∼3-12 Hz) rhythms play a key role by phase-locking to recurring acoustic features marking syllable boundaries. Reliable synchronization to quasi-rhythmic inputs, whose variable frequency can dip below cortical theta frequencies (down to ∼1 Hz), requires “flexible” theta oscillators whose underlying neuronal mechanisms remain unknown. Using biophysical computational models, we found that the flexibility of phase-locking in neural oscillators depended on the types of hyperpolarizing currents that paced them. Simulated cortical theta oscillators flexibly phase-locked to slow inputs when these inputs caused both (i) spiking and (ii) the subsequent buildup of outward current sufficient to delay further spiking until the next input. The greatest flexibility in phase-locking arose from a synergistic interaction between intrinsic currents that was not replicated by synaptic currents at similar timescales. Flexibility in phase-locking enabled improved entrainment to speech input, optimal at mid-vocalic channels, which in turn supported syllabic-timescale segmentation through identification of vocalic nuclei. Our results suggest that synaptic and intrinsic inhibition contribute to frequency-restricted and -flexible phase-locking in neural oscillators, respectively. Their differential deployment may enable neural oscillators to play diverse roles, from reliable internal clocking to adaptive segmentation of quasi-regular sensory inputs like speech.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xayrvjSozD8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we present Co-scale conv-attentional image Transformers
(CoaT), a Transformer-based image classifier equipped with co-scale and
conv-attentional mechanisms. First, the co-scale mechanism maintains the
integrity of Transformers' encoder branches at individual scales, while
allowing representations learned at different scales to effectively communicate
with each other; we design a series of serial and parallel blocks to realize
the co-scale attention mechanism. Second, we devise a conv-attentional
mechanism by realizing a relative position embedding formulation in the
factorized attention module with an efficient convolution-like implementation.
CoaT empowers image Transformers with enriched multi-scale and contextual
modeling capabilities. On ImageNet, relatively small CoaT models attain
superior classification results compared with the similar-sized convolutional
neural networks and image/vision Transformers. The effectiveness of CoaT's
backbone is also illustrated on object detection and instance segmentation,
demonstrating its applicability to the downstream computer vision tasks.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Variational autoencoders employ an encoding neural network to generate a
probabilistic representation of a data set within a low-dimensional space of
latent variables followed by a decoding stage that maps the latent variables
back to the original variable space. Once trained, a statistical ensemble of
simulated data realizations can be obtained by randomly assigning values to the
latent variables that are subsequently processed by the decoding section of the
network. To determine the accuracy of such a procedure when applied to lattice
models, an autoencoder is here trained on a thermal equilibrium distribution of
Ising spin realizations. When the output of the decoder for synthetic data is
interpreted probabilistically, spin realizations can be generated by randomly
assigning spin values according to the computed likelihood. The resulting state
distribution in energy-magnetization space then qualitatively resembles that of
the training samples. However, because correlations between spins are
suppressed, the computed energies are unphysically large for low-dimensional
latent variable spaces. The features of the learned distributions as a function
of temperature, however, provide a qualitative indication of the presence of a

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many decisions involve choosing an uncertain course of actions in deep and
wide decision trees, as when we plan to visit an exotic country for vacation.
In these cases, exhaustive search for the best sequence of actions is not
tractable due to the large number of possibilities and limited time or
computational resources available to make the decision. Therefore, planning
agents need to balance breadth (exploring many actions at each level of the
tree) and depth (exploring many levels in the tree) to allocate optimally their
finite search capacity. We provide efficient analytical solutions and numerical
analysis to the problem of allocating finite sampling capacity in one shot to
large decision trees. We find that in general the optimal policy is to allocate
few samples per level so that deep levels can be reached, thus favoring depth
over breadth search. In contrast, in poor environments and at low capacity, it
is best to broadly sample branches at the cost of not sampling deeply, although
this policy is marginally better than deep allocations. Our results provide a
theoretical foundation for the optimality of deep imagination for planning and
show that it is a generally valid heuristic that could have evolved from the
finite constraints of cognitive systems.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There is significant need for principled uncertainty reasoning in machine
learning systems as they are increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains.
A new approach with uncertainty-aware neural networks shows promise over
traditional deterministic methods, yet several important gaps in the theory and
implementation of these networks remain. We discuss three issues with a
proposed solution to extract aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties from
regression-based neural networks. The aforementioned proposal derives a
technique by placing evidential priors over the original Gaussian likelihood
function and training the neural network to infer the hyperparemters of the
evidential distribution. Doing so allows for the simultaneous extraction of
both uncertainties without sampling or utilization of out-of-distribution data
for univariate regression tasks. We describe the outstanding issues in detail,
provide a possible solution, and generalize the technique for the multivariate
case.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06060</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;High-stakes applications require AI-generated models to be interpretable.
Current algorithms for the synthesis of potentially interpretable models rely
on objectives or regularization terms that represent interpretability only
coarsely (e.g., model size) and are not designed for a specific user. Yet,
interpretability is intrinsically subjective. In this paper, we propose an
approach for the synthesis of models that are tailored to the user by enabling
the user to steer the model synthesis process according to her or his
preferences. We use a bi-objective evolutionary algorithm to synthesize models
with trade-offs between accuracy and a user-specific notion of
interpretability. The latter is estimated by a neural network that is trained
concurrently to the evolution using the feedback of the user, which is
collected using uncertainty-based active learning. To maximize usability, the
user is only asked to tell, given two models at the time, which one is less
complex. With experiments on two real-world datasets involving 61 participants,
we find that our approach is capable of learning estimations of
interpretability that can be very different for different users. Moreover, the
users tend to prefer models found using the proposed approach over models found
using non-personalized interpretability indices.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Data-driven modeling of spatiotemporal physical processes with general deep
learning methods is a highly challenging task. It is further exacerbated by the
limited availability of data, leading to poor generalizations in standard
neural network models. To tackle this issue, we introduce a new approach called
the Finite Volume Neural Network (FINN). The FINN method adopts the numerical
structure of the well-known Finite Volume Method for handling partial
differential equations, so that each quantity of interest follows its own
adaptable conservation law, while it concurrently accommodates learnable
parameters. As a result, FINN enables better handling of fluxes between control
volumes and therefore proper treatment of different types of numerical boundary
conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with a subsurface
contaminant transport problem, which is governed by a non-linear
diffusion-sorption process. FINN does not only generalize better to differing
boundary conditions compared to other methods, it is also capable to explicitly
extract and learn the constitutive relationships (expressed by the retardation
factor). More importantly, FINN shows excellent generalization ability when
applied to both synthetic datasets and real, sparse experimental data, thus
underlining its relevance as a data-driven modeling tool.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05991</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electroencephalography signals allow to explore the functional activity of
the brain cortex in a non-invasive way. However, the analysis of these signals
is not straightforward due to the presence of different artifacts and the very
low signal-to-noise ratio. Cross-Frequency Coupling (CFC) methods provide a way
to extract information from EEG, related to the synchronization among frequency
bands. However, CFC methods are usually applied in a local way, computing the
interaction between phase and amplitude at the same electrode. In this work we
show a method to compute PAC features among electrodes to study the functional
connectivity. Moreover, this has been applied jointly with Principal Component
Analysis to explore patterns related to Dyslexia in 7-years-old children. The
developed methodology reveals the temporal evolution of PAC-based connectivity.
Directions of greatest variance computed by PCA are called eigenPACs here,
since they resemble the classical \textit{eigenfaces} representation. The
projection of PAC data onto the eigenPACs provide a set of features that has
demonstrates their discriminative capability, specifically in the Beta-Gamma
bands.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Bayesian Optimisation for a Biologically Inspired Population Neural Network. (arXiv:2104.05989v1 [q-bio.QM])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05989</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We have used Bayesian Optimisation (BO) to find hyper-parameters in an
existing biologically plausible population neural network. The 8-dimensional
optimal hyper-parameter combination should be such that the network dynamics
simulate the resting state alpha rhythm (8 - 13 Hz rhythms in brain signals).
Each combination of these eight hyper-parameters constitutes a 'datapoint' in
the parameter space. The best combination of these parameters leads to the
neural network's output power spectral peak being constraint within the alpha
band. Further, constraints were introduced to the BO algorithm based on
qualitative observation of the network output time series, so that high
amplitude pseudo-periodic oscillations are removed. Upon successful
implementation for alpha band, we further optimised the network to oscillate
within the theta (4 - 8 Hz) and beta (13 - 30 Hz) bands. The changing rhythms
in the model can now be studied using the identified optimal hyper-parameters
for the respective frequency bands. We have previously tuned parameters in the
existing neural network by the trial-and-error approach; however, due to time
and computational constraints, we could not vary more than three parameters at
once. The approach detailed here, allows an automatic hyper-parameter search,
producing reliable parameter sets for the network.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Multiple regression techniques for modeling dates of first performances of Shakespeare-era plays. (arXiv:2104.05929v2 [cs.NE] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05929</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The date of the first performance of a play of Shakespeare's time must
usually be guessed with reference to multiple indirect external sources, or to
some aspect of the content or style of the play. Identifying these dates is
important to literary history and to accounts of developing authorial styles,
such as Shakespeare's. In this study, we took a set of Shakespeare-era plays
(181 plays from the period 1585--1610), added the best-guess dates for them
from a standard reference work as metadata, and calculated a set of
probabilities of individual words in these samples. We applied 11 regression
methods to predict the dates of the plays at an 80/20 training/test split. We
withdrew one play at a time, used the best-guess date metadata with the
probabilities and weightings to infer its date, and thus built a model of
date-probabilities interaction. We introduced a memetic algorithm-based
Continued Fraction Regression (CFR) which delivered models using a small number
of variables, leading to an interpretable model and reduced dimensionality. An
in-depth analysis of the most commonly occurring 20 words in the CFR models in
100 independent runs helps explain the trends in linguistic and stylistic
terms. The analysis with the subset of words revealed an interesting
correlation of signature words with the Shakespeare-era play's genre.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05926</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this paper we present a synaptic array that uses dynamical states to
implement an analog memory for energy-efficient training of machine learning
(ML) systems. Each of the analog memory elements is a micro-dynamical system
that is driven by the physics of Fowler-Nordheim (FN) quantum tunneling,
whereas the system level learning modulates the state trajectory of the memory
ensembles towards the optimal solution. We show that the extrinsic energy
required for modulation can be matched to the dynamics of learning and weight
decay leading to a significant reduction in the energy-dissipated during ML
training. With the energy-dissipation as low as 5 fJ per memory update and a
programming resolution up to 14 bits, the proposed synapse array could be used
to address the energy-efficiency imbalance between the training and the
inference phases observed in artificial intelligence (AI) systems.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: A coevolutionary approach to deep multi-agent reinforcement learning. (arXiv:2104.05610v2 [cs.NE] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05610</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, Deep Artificial Neural Networks (DNN's) are trained through
gradient descent. Recent research shows that Deep Neuroevolution (DNE) is also
capable of evolving multi-million-parameter DNN's, which proved to be
particularly useful in the field of Reinforcement Learning (RL). This is mainly
due to its excellent scalability and simplicity compared to the traditional
MDP-based RL methods. So far, DNE has only been applied to complex single-agent
problems. As evolutionary methods are a natural choice for multi-agent
problems, the question arises whether DNE can also be applied in a complex
multi-agent setting. In this paper, we describe and validate a new approach
based on Coevolution. To validate our approach, we benchmark two Deep
Coevolutionary Algorithms on a range of multi-agent Atari games and compare our
results against the results of Ape-X DQN. Our results show that these Deep
Coevolutionary algorithms (1) can be successfully trained to play various
games, (2) outperform Ape-X DQN in some of them, and therefore (3) show that
Coevolution can be a viable approach to solving complex multi-agent
decision-making problems.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Bio-Inspired Modality Fusion for Active Speaker Detection. (arXiv:2003.00063v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00063</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human beings have developed fantastic abilities to integrate information from
various sensory sources exploring their inherent complementarity. Perceptual
capabilities are therefore heightened, enabling, for instance, the well-known
&quot;cocktail party&quot; and McGurk effects, i.e., speech disambiguation from a panoply
of sound signals. This fusion ability is also key in refining the perception of
sound source location, as in distinguishing whose voice is being heard in a
group conversation. Furthermore, neuroscience has successfully identified the
superior colliculus region in the brain as the one responsible for this
modality fusion, with a handful of biological models having been proposed to
approach its underlying neurophysiological process. Deriving inspiration from
one of these models, this paper presents a methodology for effectively fusing
correlated auditory and visual information for active speaker detection. Such
an ability can have a wide range of applications, from teleconferencing systems
to social robotics. The detection approach initially routes auditory and visual
information through two specialized neural network structures. The resulting
embeddings are fused via a novel layer based on the superior colliculus, whose
topological structure emulates spatial neuron cross-mapping of unimodal
perceptual fields. The validation process employed two publicly available
datasets, with achieved results confirming and greatly surpassing initial
expectations.

	<title>The Cerebellum: Instrumented Objective Clinical Examination of Cerebellar Ataxia: the Upper and Lower Limb—a Review</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-021-01253-8</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cerebellar dysfunction results in impairments in co-ordination or ‘ataxia’. Bedside examination of cerebellar function has changed little since the early nineteenth century with the exception being the oculomotor examination which has become instrumented. Otherwise, competence and confidence in performing the clinical assessment relies heavily on the skill and experience of the clinician. Potentially, instrumented objective measurement will more accurately assess the severity of ataxia and the changes brought about by advancing therapies in pharmaceutical trials and in rehabilitation intervention. This study describes instrumented versions of several bedside tests of cerebellar function, including rhythmic tapping of the hand (RTH), finger-nose test (FNT), dysdiadochokinesia (DDK), ramp tracking (RMT), ballistic tracking (BT), rhythmic tapping of the foot (RTF) and the heel shin (HST) examination which were validated against scores from Ataxia Rating Scales (ARS) such as the Scale of Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA). While all of the instrumented tests accurately distinguished between ataxic subjects and controls, there was a difference in performance, with the best four performing upper limb tests being RTH, FNT, DDK and BT. A combination of BT plus RTH provided the best correlation with the SARA and outperformed a combination of all the bedside tests (Spearman 0.8; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001 compared to 0.68; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001 for the combined set) in identifying the presence and severity of ataxia. This indicates that there is redundancy in the information provided by the bedside tests and that adding other tests to BT plus RTH does not add accuracy to the assessment of ataxia. This analysis highlighted the need for metrics that could be generalised to each of the assessments of ataxia, so, in turn, domains of stability, timing, accuracy and rhythmicity (STAR domains) were developed and compared to the SARA. The STAR criteria could potentially influence the future of instrumented assessment in CA and pave the way for further research into the objective measurement of the cerebellar examination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Neuroinformatics: A Measure of Concurrent Neural Firing Activity Based on Mutual Information</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12021-021-09515-w</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Multiple methods have been developed in an attempt to quantify stimulus-induced neural coordination and to understand internal coordination of neuronal responses by examining the synchronization phenomena in neural discharge patterns. In this work we propose a novel approach to estimate the degree of concomitant firing between two neural units, based on a modified form of mutual information (MI) applied to a two-state representation of the firing activity. The binary profile of each single unit unfolds its discharge activity in time by decomposition into the state of neural quiescence/low activity and state of moderate firing/bursting. Then, the MI computed between the two binary streams is normalized by their minimum entropy and is taken as positive or negative depending on the prevalence of identical or opposite concomitant states. The resulting measure, denoted as Concurrent Firing Index based on MI (CFI&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;MI&lt;/sub&gt;), relies on a single input parameter and is otherwise assumption-free and symmetric. Exhaustive validation was carried out through controlled experiments in three simulation scenarios, showing that CFI&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;MI&lt;/sub&gt; is independent on firing rate and recording duration, and is sensitive to correlated and anti-correlated firing patterns. Its ability to detect non-correlated activity was assessed using ad-hoc surrogate data. Moreover, the evaluation of CFI&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;MI&lt;/sub&gt; on experimental recordings of spiking activity in retinal ganglion cells brought insights into the changes of neural synchrony over time. The proposed measure offers a novel perspective on the estimation of neural synchrony, providing information on the co-occurrence of firing states in the two analyzed trains over longer temporal scales compared to existing measures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neurology: Atrioventricular block after fingolimod resumption: a consequence of sphingosine-1-phosphate axis alteration due to COVID-19?</title>

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;During the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns raised regarding the use of immunosuppressants in multiple sclerosis, even if current data do not support an increased risk of infection. Although fingolimod can be temporarily suspended during COVID-19, the benefit-risk balance of suspension can be challenging. Till now, no adverse events have been described after the resumption of fingolimod, following a previous discontinuation. We report the occurrence of atrioventricular block following fingolimod restart. Fingolimod acts on sphingosine-1-phosphate-axis, a pathway that is altered with COVID-19 and hypoxic conditions. Herein we discuss how these metabolic changes may have influenced fingolimod pharmacology leading to a cardiac event.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Abnormal Intrinsic Functional Interactions Within Pain Network in Cervical Discogenic Pain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.671280</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cervical discogenic pain (CDP) is mainly induced by cervical disc degeneration. However, how CDP modulates the functional interactions within the pain network remains unclear. In the current study, we studied the changed resting-state functional connectivities of pain network with 40 CDP patients and 40 age-, gender-matched healthy controls. We first defined the pain network with the seeds of the posterior insula (PI). Then, whole brain and seed-to-target functional connectivity analyses were performed to identify the differences in functional connectivity between CDP and healthy controls. Finally, correlation analyses were applied to reveal the associations between functional connectivities and clinical measures. Whole-brain functional connectivity analyses of PI identified increased functional connectivity between PI and thalamus (THA) and decreased functional connectivity between PI and middle cingulate cortex (MCC) in CDP patients. Functional connectivity analyses within the pain network further revealed increased functional connectivities between bilateral PI and bilateral THA, and decreased functional connectivities between left PI and MCC, between left postcentral gyrus (PoCG) and MCC in CDP patients. Moreover, we found that the functional connectivities between right PI and left THA, between left PoCG and MCC were negatively and positively correlated with the visual analog scale, respectively. Our findings provide direct evidence of how CDP modulates the pain network, which may facilitate understanding of the neural basis of CDP.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Effect of Low Intensity Transcranial Ultrasound Stimulation on Neuromodulation in Animals and Humans: An Updated Systematic Review</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.620863</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Although low-intensity transcranial ultrasound stimulation (LI-TUS) has received more recognition for its neuromodulation potential, there remains a crucial knowledge gap regarding the neuromodulatory effects of LI-TUS and its potential for translation as a therapeutic tool in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: In this review, we summarized the findings reported by recently published studies regarding the effect of LI-TUS on neuromodulation in both animals and humans. We also aim to identify challenges and opportunities for the translation process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A literature search of PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, and Web of Science was performed from January 2019 to June 2020 with the following keywords and Boolean operators: [transcranial ultrasound OR transcranial focused ultrasound OR ultrasound stimulation] AND [neuromodulation]. The methodological quality of the animal studies was assessed by the SYRCLE's risk of bias tool, and the quality of human studies was evaluated by the PEDro score and the NIH quality assessment tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 26 manuscripts (24 animal studies and two human studies) out of 508 reports were included in this systematic review. Although both inhibitory (10 studies) and excitatory (16 studies) effects of LI-TUS were observed in animal studies, only inhibitory effects have been reported in primates (five studies) and human subjects (two studies). The ultrasonic parameters used in animal and human studies are different. The SYRCLE quality score ranged from 25 to 43%, with a majority of the low scores related to performance and detection bias. The two human studies received high PEDro scores (9/10).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: LI-TUS appears to be capable of targeting both superficial and deep cerebral structures to modulate cognitive or motor behavior in both animals and humans. Further human studies are needed to more precisely define the effective modulation parameters and thereby translate this brain modulatory tool into the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Spatial-Temporal Functional Mapping Combined With Cortico-Cortical Evoked Potentials in Predicting Cortical Stimulation Results</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.661976</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Functional human brain mapping is commonly performed during invasive monitoring with intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) electrodes prior to resective surgery for drug­ resistant epilepsy. The current gold standard, electrocortical stimulation mapping (ESM), is time ­consuming, sometimes elicits pain, and often induces after discharges or seizures. Moreover, there is a risk of overestimating eloquent areas due to propagation of the effects of stimulation to a broader network of language cortex. Passive iEEG spatial-temporal functional mapping (STFM) has recently emerged as a potential alternative to ESM. However, investigators have observed less correspondence between STFM and ESM maps of language than between their maps of motor function. We hypothesized that incongruities between ESM and STFM of language function may arise due to propagation of the effects of ESM to cortical areas having strong effective connectivity with the site of stimulation. We evaluated five patients who underwent invasive monitoring for seizure localization, whose language areas were identified using ESM. All patients performed a battery of language tasks during passive iEEG recordings. To estimate the effective connectivity of stimulation sites with a broader network of task-activated cortical sites, we measured cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs) elicited across all recording sites by single-pulse electrical stimulation at sites where ESM was performed at other times. With the combination of high gamma power as well as CCEPs results, we trained a logistic regression model to predict ESM results at individual electrode pairs. The average accuracy of the classifier using both STFM and CCEPs results combined was 87.7%, significantly higher than the one using STFM alone (71.8%), indicating that the correspondence between STFM and ESM results is greater when effective connectivity between ESM stimulation sites and task-activated sites is taken into consideration. These findings, though based on a small number of subjects to date, provide preliminary support for the hypothesis that incongruities between ESM and STFM may arise in part from propagation of stimulation effects to a broader network of cortical language sites activated by language tasks, and suggest that more studies, with larger numbers of patients, are needed to understand the utility of both mapping techniques in clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: A P300 Brain-Computer Interface Paradigm Based on Electric and Vibration Simple Command Tactile Stimulation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.641357</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This paper proposed a novel tactile-stimuli P300 paradigm for Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), which potentially targeted at people with less learning ability or difficulty in maintaining attention. The new paradigm using only two types of stimuli was designed, and different targets were distinguished by frequency and spatial information. The classification algorithm was developed by introducing filters for frequency bands selection and conducting optimization with common spatial pattern (CSP) on the tactile evoked EEG signals. It features a combination of spatial and frequency information, with the spatial information distinguishing the sites of stimuli and frequency information identifying target stimuli and disturbances. We investigated both electrical stimuli and vibration stimuli, in which only one target site was stimulated in each block. The results demonstrated an average accuracy of 94.88% for electrical stimuli and 95.21% for vibration stimuli, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Magnetoencephalography Responses to Unpredictable and Predictable Rare Somatosensory Stimuli in Healthy Adult Humans</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.641273</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mismatch brain responses to unpredicted rare stimuli are suggested to be a neural indicator of prediction error, but this has rarely been studied in the somatosensory modality. Here, we investigated how the brain responds to unpredictable and predictable rare events. Magnetoencephalography responses were measured in adults frequently presented with somatosensory stimuli (FRE) that were occasionally replaced by two consecutively presented rare stimuli [unpredictable rare stimulus (UR) and predictable rare stimulus (PR); p = 0.1 for each]. The FRE and PR were electrical stimulations administered to either the little finger or the forefinger in a counterbalanced manner between the two conditions. The UR was a simultaneous electrical stimulation to both the forefinger and the little finger (for a smaller subgroup, the UR and FRE were counterbalanced for the stimulus properties). The grand-averaged responses were characterized by two main components: one at 30–100 ms (M55) and the other at 130–230 ms (M150) latency. Source-level analysis was conducted for the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) and the secondary somatosensory cortex (SII). The M55 responses were larger for the UR and PR than for the FRE in both the SI and the SII areas and were larger for the UR than for the PR. For M150, both investigated areas showed increased activity for the UR and the PR compared to the FRE. Interestingly, although the UR was larger in stimulus energy (stimulation of two fingers at the same time) and had a larger prediction error potential than the PR, the M150 responses to these two rare stimuli did not differ in source strength in either the SI or the SII area. The results suggest that M55, but not M150, can possibly be associated with prediction error signals. These findings highlight the need for disentangling prediction error and rareness-related effects in future studies investigating prediction error signals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Working Memory Training Effects on White Matter Integrity in Young and Older Adults</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.605213</link>
	<content:encoded>Objectives&lt;p&gt;Working memory is essential for daily life skills like reading comprehension, reasoning, and problem-solving. Healthy aging of the brain goes along with working memory decline that can affect older people’s independence in everyday life. Interventions in the form of cognitive training are a promising tool for delaying age-related working memory decline, yet the underlying structural plasticity of white matter is hardly studied.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We conducted a longitudinal diffusion tensor imaging study to investigate the effects of an intensive four-week adaptive working memory training on white matter integrity quantified by global and tract-wise mean diffusivity. We compared diffusivity measures of fiber tracts that are associated with working memory of 32 young and 20 older participants that were randomly assigned to a working memory training group or an active control group.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The behavioral analysis showed an increase in working memory performance after the four-week adaptive working memory training. The neuroanatomical analysis revealed a decrease in mean diffusivity in the working memory training group after the training intervention in the right inferior longitudinal fasciculus for the older adults. There was also a decrease in mean diffusivity in the working memory training group in the right superior longitudinal fasciculus for the older and young participants after the intervention.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This study shows that older people can benefit from working memory training by improving their working memory performance that is also reflected in terms of improved white matter integrity in the superior longitudinal fasciculus and the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, where the first is an essential component of the frontoparietal network known to be essential in working memory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: A Computational Framework for Controlling the Self-Restorative Brain Based on the Free Energy and Degeneracy Principles</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.590019</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The brain is a non-linear dynamical system with a self-restoration process, which protects itself from external damage but is often a bottleneck for clinical treatment. To treat the brain to induce the desired functionality, formulation of a self-restoration process is necessary for optimal brain control. This study proposes a computational model for the brain's self-restoration process following the free-energy and degeneracy principles. Based on this model, a computational framework for brain control is established. We posited that the pre-treatment brain circuit has long been configured in response to the environmental (the other neural populations') demands on the circuit. Since the demands persist even after treatment, the treated circuit's response to the demand may gradually approximate the pre-treatment functionality. In this framework, an energy landscape of regional activities, estimated from resting-state endogenous activities by a pairwise maximum entropy model, is used to represent the pre-treatment functionality. The approximation of the pre-treatment functionality occurs via reconfiguration of interactions among neural populations within the treated circuit. To establish the current framework's construct validity, we conducted various simulations. The simulations suggested that brain control should include the self-restoration process, without which the treatment was not optimal. We also presented simulations for optimizing repetitive treatments and optimal timing of the treatment. These results suggest a plausibility of the current framework in controlling the non-linear dynamical brain with a self-restoration process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The CA1, an important subregion of the hippocampus, is anatomically and functionally heterogeneous in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus. Here, to dissect the distinctions between the dorsal (dCA1) and ventral CA1 (vCA1) in anatomical connections, we systematically analyzed the direct inputs to dCA1 and vCA1 projection neurons (PNs) with the rabies virus-mediated retrograde trans-monosynaptic tracing system in Thy1-Cre mice. Our mapping results revealed that the input proportions and distributions of dCA1 and vCA1 PNs varied significantly. Inside the hippocampal region, dCA1 and vCA1 PNs shared the same upstream brain regions, but with distinctive distribution patterns along the rostrocaudal axis. The intrahippocampal inputs to the dCA1 and vCA1 exhibited opposite trends, decreasing and increasing gradually along the dorsoventral axis, respectively. For extrahippocampal inputs, dCA1 and vCA1 shared some monosynaptic projections from certain regions such as pallidum, striatum, hypothalamus, and thalamus. However, vCA1, not dCA1, received innervations from the subregions of olfactory areas and amygdala nuclei. Characterization of the direct input networks of dCA1 and vCA1 PNs may provide a structural basis to understand the differential functions of dCA1 and vCA1.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.648570</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural crest development involves a series of dynamic, carefully coordinated events that result in human disease when not properly orchestrated. Cranial neural crest cells acquire unique multipotent developmental potential upon specification to generate a broad variety of cell types. Studies of early mammalian neural crest and nervous system development often use the Cre-loxP system to lineage trace and mark cells for further investigation. Here, we carefully profile the activity of two common neural crest Cre-drivers at the end of neurulation in mice. RNA sequencing of labeled cells at E9.5 reveals that Wnt1-Cre2 marks cells with neuronal characteristics consistent with neuroepithelial expression, whereas Sox10-Cre predominantly labels the migratory neural crest. We used single-cell mRNA and single-cell ATAC sequencing to profile the expression of Wnt1 and Sox10 and identify transcription factors that may regulate the expression of Wnt1-Cre2 in the neuroepithelium and Sox10-Cre in the migratory neural crest. Our data identify cellular heterogeneity during cranial neural crest development and identify specific populations labeled by two Cre-drivers in the developing nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.633735</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most frequently diagnosed neurodegenerative disorders worldwide and poses a major challenge for both affected individuals and their caregivers. AD is a progressive neurological disorder associated with high rates of brain atrophy. Despite its durable influence on human health, understanding AD has been complicated by its enigmatic and multifactorial nature. Neurofibrillary tangles and the deposition of amyloid-beta (Aβ) protein are typical pathological features and fundamental causes of cognitive impairment in AD patients. Dysbiosis of oral and gut microbiota has been reported to induce and accelerate the formation of Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. For instance, some oral microbes can spread to the brain through cranial nerves or cellular infections, which has been suggested to increase the risk of developing AD. Importantly, the interaction between intestinal microbiota and brain cells has been recognized as influencing the development of AD as well as other neurodegenerative diseases. In particular, the metabolites produced by certain intestinal microorganisms can affect the activity of microglia and further mediate neuroinflammation, which is a leading cause of neuronal necrosis and AD pathogenesis. Which pathogens and associated pathways are involved in the development and progression of AD remains to be elucidated; however, it is well-known that gut microbiota and their metabolites can affect the brain by both direct and indirect means. Understanding the specific mechanisms involved in the interaction between these pathogens and the nervous system is vital for the early intervention in AD. In this review, we aim to comprehensively discuss the possible mechanistic pathways underlying the oral-brain, the gut-brain and the oral-gut-brain associations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Stem cell transplantation offers promise in the treatment of ischemic stroke. Here we utilized systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression to study the biological effect of stem cell treatments in animal models of ischemic stroke. A total of 98 eligible publications were included by searching PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science from inception to August 1, 2020. There are about 141 comparisons, involving 5,200 animals, that examined the effect of stem cell transplantation on neurological function and infarct volume as primary outcome measures in animal models for stroke. Stem cell-based therapy can improve both neurological function (effect size, −3.37; 95% confidence interval, −3.83 to −2.90) and infarct volume (effect size, −11.37; 95% confidence interval, −12.89 to −9.85) compared with controls. These results suggest that stem cell therapy could improve neurological function deficits and infarct volume, exerting potential neuroprotective effect for experimental ischemic stroke, but further clinical studies are still needed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Myelin Repair: From Animal Models to Humans</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.604865</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It is widely thought that brain repair does not occur, but myelin regeneration provides clear evidence to the contrary. Spontaneous remyelination may occur after injury or in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the efficiency of remyelination varies considerably between MS patients and between the lesions of each patient. Myelin repair is essential for optimal functional recovery, so a profound understanding of the cells and mechanisms involved in this process is required for the development of new therapeutic strategies. In this review, we describe how animal models and modern cell tracing and imaging methods have helped to identify the cell types involved in myelin regeneration. In addition to the oligodendrocyte progenitor cells identified in the 1990s as the principal source of remyelinating cells in the central nervous system (CNS), other cell populations, including subventricular zone-derived neural progenitors, Schwann cells, and even spared mature oligodendrocytes, have more recently emerged as potential contributors to CNS remyelination. We will also highlight the conditions known to limit endogenous repair, such as aging, chronic inflammation, and the production of extracellular matrix proteins, and the role of astrocytes and microglia in these processes. Finally, we will present the discrepancies between observations in humans and in rodents, discussing the relationship of findings in experimental models to myelin repair in humans. These considerations are particularly important from a therapeutic standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Exercise Training-Increased FBXO32 and FOXO1 in a Gender-Dependent Manner in Mild Cognitively Impaired African Americans: GEMS-1 Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.641758</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) and FOXOs transcription factors play a pivotal role in cellular clearance and minimizing the accumulation of Aβ in neurodegeneration (ND). In African Americans (AAs) with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the role of components of UPS and FOXOs; and whether they are amenable to exercise effects is unknown. We hypothesized that exercise can enhance cellular clearance systems during aging and ND by increasing expressions of FBXO32 and FOXO1. To test this hypothesis, we used TaqMan gene expression analysis in peripheral blood (PB) to investigate the component of UPS and FOXOs; and provide mechanistic insight at baseline, during exercise, and in both genders. At baseline, levels of FBXO32 were higher in women than in men. In our attempt to discern gender-specific exercise-related changes, we observed that levels of FBXO32 increased in men but not in women. Similarly, levels of FOXO1 increased in men only. These data suggest that a graded dose of FBXO32 and FOXO1 may be beneficial when PB cells carrying FBXO32 and FOXO1 summon into the brain in response to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) perturbation (docking station PB cells). Our observation is consistent with emerging studies that exercise allows the trafficking of blood factors. Given the significance of FBXO32 and FOXO1 to ND and associated muscle integrity, our findings may explain, at least in part, the benefits of exercise on memory, associated gait, and balance perturbation acknowledged to herald the emergence of MCI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Investigating Neuroimaging Correlates of Early Frailty in Patients With Behavioral Variant Frontotemporal Dementia: A MRI and FDG-PET Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.637796</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Frailty is a dynamic clinical condition characterized by the reduction of interconnections among different psychobiological domains, which leads to a homeostatic vulnerability. The association between physical frailty and cognitive dysfunctions is a possible predictor of poor prognosis in patients with neurodegenerative disorders. However, this construct has not been fully analyzed by a multidimensional neuropsychogeriatric assessment matched with multimodal neuroimaging methods in patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). We have investigated cognitive dysfunctions and frailty status, assessed by both a neuropsychological evaluation and the Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI), in a sample of 18 bvFTD patients and compared to matched healthy controls. Gray matter (GM) volume (as assessed by voxel-based morphometry) and metabolism (on &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography) were first separately compared between groups, then voxelwise compared and correlated to each other within patients. Linear regression of the MPI was performed on those voxels presenting a significant correlation between altered GM volume and metabolism. The neuropsychological assessment reflected the diagnoses and the functional–anatomical alterations documented by neuroimaging analyses. In particular, the majority of patients presented significant executive dysfunction and mood changes in terms of apathy, depression, and anxiety. In the overall MPI score, the patients fell in the lower range (indicating an early frailty status). On imaging, they exhibited a bilateral decrease of GM density and hypometabolism involving the frontal pole, the anterior opercular region, and the anterior cingulate cortex. Greater atrophy than hypometabolism was observed in the bilateral orbitofrontal cortex, the triangular part of the inferior frontal gyrus, and the ventral striatum, whereas the contrary was detected in the bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and pre-supplementary motor area. MPI scores significantly correlated only with the co-occurrence of a decrease of GM density and hypometabolism in the right anterior insular cortex, but not with the separate pathological phenomena. Our results show a correlation between a specific pattern of co-occurring GM atrophy and hypometabolism with early frailty in bvFTD patients. These aspects, combined with executive dysfunction and mood changes, may lead to an increased risk of poor prognosis, highlighting a potentially critical and precocious role of the insula in the pathogenesis of frailty.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Nomogram to Predict Cognitive Dysfunction After a Minor Ischemic Stroke in Hospitalized-Population</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.637363</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An easily scoring system to predict the risk of cognitive impairment after minor ischemic stroke has not been available. We aimed to develop and externally validate a nomogram for predicting the probability of post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) among hospitalized population with minor stroke. Moreover, the association of Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) with PSCI is also investigated. We prospectively conducted a developed cohort on collected data in stroke center from June 2017 to February 2018, as well as an external validation cohort between June 2018 and February 2019. The main outcome is cognitive impairment defined as &amp;lt;22 Montreal Cognition Assessment (MoCA) score points 6 – 12 months following a minor stroke onset. Based on multivariate logistic models, the nomogram model was generated. Plasma TMAO levels were assessed at admission using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. A total of 228 participants completed the follow-up data for generating the nomogram. After multivariate logistic regression, seven variables remained independent predictors of PSCI to compose the nomogram included age, female, Fazekas score, educational level, number of intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS), HbA1c, and cortical infarction. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AUC-ROC) curve of model was 0.829, C index was good (0.810), and the AUC-ROC of the model applied in validation cohort was 0.812. Plasma TMAO levels were higher in patients with cognitive impairment than in them without cognitive dysfunction (median 4.56 vs. 3.22 μmol/L; p ≤ 0.001). In conclusion, this scoring system is the first nomogram developed and validated in a stroke center cohort for individualized prediction of cognitive impairment after minor stroke. Higher plasma TMAO level at admission suggests a potential marker of PSCI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Iron Deposition Characteristics of Deep Gray Matter in Elderly Individuals in the Community Revealed by Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping and Multiple Factor Analysis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.611891</link>
	<content:encoded>Purpose&lt;p&gt;The objective of this study was to determine which factors influence brain iron concentrations in deep gray matter in elderly individuals and how these factors influence regional brain iron concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A total of 105 elderly individuals were enrolled in this study. All participants underwent detailed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations from October 2018 to August 2019. Among them, 44 individuals had undergone a previous MRI examination from July 2010 to August 2011. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) was utilized as an indirect quantitative marker of brain iron, and the susceptibility values of deep gray matter structures were obtained. Univariate analysis and multiple linear regression analysis were used to investigate 11 possible determinants for cerebral iron deposition.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Our results showed no sex- or hemisphere-related differences in susceptibility values in any of the regions studied. Aging was significantly correlated with increased insusceptibility values in almost all analyzed brain regions (except for the thalamus) when we compared the susceptibility values at the two time points. In a cross-sectional analysis, the relationship between gray matter nucleus susceptibility values and age was conducted using Pearson’s linear regression. Aging was significantly correlated with the susceptibility values of the globus pallidus (GP), putamen (Put), and caudate nucleus (CN), with the Put having the strongest correlations. In multiple linear regression models, associations with increased susceptibility values were found in the CN, Put, red nucleus, and dentate nucleus for individuals with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the patients with hypertension showed significantly reduced susceptibility values in the red nucleus and dentate nucleus. Our data suggested that smokers had increased susceptibility values in the thalamus. No significant associations were found for individuals with a history of hypercholesterolemia and Apolipoprotein E4 carrier status.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our data revealed that aging, T2DM, and smoking could increase iron deposition in some deep gray matter structures. However, hypertension had the opposite effects in the red nuclei and dentate nuclei. Brain iron metabolism could be influenced by many factors in different modes. In future studies, we should strictly control for confounding factors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Circuit organization of the excitatory sensorimotor loop through hand/forelimb S1 and M1</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66836</link>
	<content:encoded>Sensory-guided limb control relies on communication across sensorimotor loops. For active touch with the hand, the longest loop is the transcortical continuation of ascending pathways, particularly the lemnisco-cortical and corticocortical pathways carrying tactile signals via the cuneate nucleus, ventral posterior lateral (VPL) thalamus, and primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortices to reach corticospinal neurons and influence descending activity. We characterized excitatory connectivity along this pathway in the mouse. In the lemnisco-cortical leg, disynaptic cuneate→VPL→S1 connections excited mainly layer (L) 4 neurons. In the corticocortical leg, S1→M1 connections from L2/3 and L5A neurons mainly excited downstream L2/3 neurons, which excite corticospinal neurons. The findings provide a detailed new wiring diagram for the hand/forelimb-related transcortical circuit, delineating a basic but complex set of cell-type-specific feedforward excitatory connections that selectively and extensively engage diverse intratelencephalic projection neurons, thereby polysynaptically linking subcortical somatosensory input to cortical motor output to spinal cord.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.14.439910v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Processing auditory human speech requires both detection (early and transient) and analysis (sustained). We analyzed high gamma (70-110Hz) activity of intracranial electroencephalography waveforms acquired during an auditory task that paired forward speech, reverse speech, and signal correlated noise. We identified widespread superior temporal sites with sustained activity responding only to forward and reverse speech regardless of paired order. More localized superior temporal auditory onset sites responded to all stimulus types when presented first in a pair and responded in recurrent fashion to the second paired stimulus in select conditions even in the absence of interstimulus silence; a novel finding. Auditory onset activity to a second paired sound recurred according to relative salience, with evidence of partial suppression during linguistic processing. We propose that temporal lobe auditory onset sites facilitate a salience detector function with hysteresis of 200ms and are influenced by cortico-cortical feedback loops involving linguistic processing and articulation.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.14.439877v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The uniqueness and stability of the adolescent and adult functional connectome has been demonstrated to be high (80-95% identification) using connectome-based identification (ID) or fingerprinting. However, it is unclear to what extent individuals exhibit similar distinctiveness and stability in infancy, a developmental period of rapid and unparalleled brain development. In this study, we examined connectome-based ID rates within and across the first year of life using a longitudinal infant dataset at 1 month and 9 months of age. We also calculated the test-retest reliability of individual connections across the first year of life using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Overall, we found substantially lower infant ID rates than have been reported in adult and adolescent populations. Within-session ID rates were moderate and significant (ID = 48.94-70.83%). Between-session ID rates were very low and not significant, with task-to-task connectomes resulting in the highest between-session ID rate (ID = 26.6%). Similarly, average edge-level test-retest reliability was higher within-session than between-session. These findings suggest a lack of uniqueness and stability in functional connectomes across the first year of life consistent with the unparalleled changes in brain functional organization during this critical period.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Recurrent connectivity underlies lateralized temporal processing differences in Auditory Cortex</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.14.439872v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Brain asymmetry in the sensitivity to spectrotemporal modulation is an established functional feature that underlies the perception of speech and music. Recent studies in humans suggest separable neural mechanisms must underlie these cognitively complex functions. The left Auditory Cortex (ACx) is believed to specialize in processing fast temporal components of speech sounds, and the right ACx slower components. However, the circuit features and neural computations behind these lateralized spectrotemporal processes are poorly understood. To answer these mechanistic questions we use mice, an animal model that captures some relevant features of human communication systems. In this study, we screened for circuit features that could subserve temporal integration differences between the left and right ACx. We mapped excitatory input to principal neurons in all cortical layers and found significantly stronger recurrent connections in the superficial layers of the right ACx compared to the left. We hypothesized that the underlying recurrent neural dynamics would exhibit differential characteristic timescales corresponding to their hemispheric specialization. To investigate, we recorded spike trains from awake mice and estimated the network time constants using a quasi-Bayesian method to combine evidence from multiple weak signal-to-noise ratio neurons. We found longer temporal integration windows in the right ACx compared to the left as predicted by stronger recurrent excitation. Our study shows direct evidence that stronger recurrent synaptic connections lead to longer network time scales. These findings support speech processing theories that purport asymmetric integration time constants is a crucial feature of lateralization in auditory processing.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.14.439865v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The brain exhibits distinct patterns of recurrent activity closely related to behavioral. The neural mechanisms that underlie state-dependent activity in the awake animal are incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that two types of state-dependent activity - rapid arousal/movement related signals and a 3-5 Hz alpha-like rhythm - in the primary visual cortex (V1) of mice strongly correlate with activity in the visual thalamus. Inactivation of V1 does not interrupt arousal/movement related signals in most visual thalamic neurons, but it abolishes the 3-5 Hz oscillation. Silencing of the visual thalamus similarly eradicates the alpha-like rhythm and perturbs arousal/movement-related activation in V1. Finally, we observed that whisker movement or locomotion is not required for rapid increases in cortical activation. Our results indicate that thalamocortical interactions together with cell-intrinsic properties of thalamocortical cells play a crucial role in shaping state-dependent activity in V1 of the awake animal.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Inhibition of Heat Shock Protein 90 in the Spinal Cord Improves the Therapeutic Index of Morphine</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.14.439852v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Opioid drugs are the gold standard for treating acute and chronic pain, but are limited by negative side effects, including tolerance, constipation, and addiction. New approaches are thus greatly needed to improve opioid therapy and decrease side effects. Our investigations have revealed Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) as a critical regulator of opioid receptor signaling, and that inhibition of spinal cord Hsp90 boosts opioid anti-nociception. These findings led us to hypothesize that spinal Hsp90 inhibitor treatment could improve the therapeutic index of opioids, boosting anti-nociception while improving or not altering side effects, enabling a dose-reduction strategy. To test this hypothesis, we injected the Hsp90 inhibitor KU-32 by the intrathecal route into male and female CD-1 mice. We then tested these mice for their response to morphine in a battery of anti-nociception and side effect models. We found that spinal KU-32 treatment increased the anti-nociceptive potency of morphine by 2-4 fold in the tail flick, post-surgical paw incision, and HIV peripheral neuropathy pain models. At the same time, morphine anti-nociceptive tolerance was reduced from 21 fold to 2.9 fold by KU-32 treatment, and established morphine tolerance could be rescued by KU-32 injection. Reward as measured by conditioned place preference and constipation were both unchanged. These results support our hypothesis, and suggest that Hsp90 inhibitors could be a novel approach to improve the therapeutic index of opioids, enable a dose-reduction strategy, and lead to fewer side effects during pain therapy.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: DENTATE GRANULE CELLS ARE HYPEREXCITABLE IN THE TGF344-AD RAT MODEL OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.14.439848v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The dentate gyrus is both a critical gatekeeper for hippocampal signal processing and one of the first regions to dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Accordingly, the appropriate balance of excitation and inhibition through the dentate is a compelling target for mechanistic investigation and therapeutic intervention of early AD. Previously, we reported increased LTP magnitude at medial perforant path-dentate granule cell (MPP-DGC) synapses in slices from TgF344-AD rats compared to Wt as early as 6 months. We next determined that the enhanced LTP magnitude was due to heightened function of {beta}-ARs leading us to ask if dentate granule cells (DGCs) also have modified passive or active membrane properties which may also contribute to hyperexcitability or aberrant hippocampal processing. Although there was no detectable difference in spine density and presynaptic release probability, dentate granule cells (DGCs) themselves might have increased electrical response to synaptic input during LTP induction, which was measured as a significant increase in charge transfer during high-frequency stimulation. In this study, we found passive membrane properties and active membrane properties are altered, leading to increased TgF344-AD DGC excitability. Specifically, TgF344-AD DGCs have an increased input resistance and decreased rheobase, decreased sag, and increased action potential (AP) spike accommodation. Importantly, we find that the voltage response increased in DGCs from TgF344-AD compared to Wt accompanied by decreased delay to fire the first AP, indicating that for the same amount of depolarizing current injection TgF344-AD DGCs membranes are more excitable. Taken together, DGCs of TgF344-AD rats are more excitable, but due to heightened accommodation, may be unable to discharge at high frequency for longer durations of time, compared to their Wt littermates.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Human fixational eye movements are so small and precise that they require high-speed, accurate tools to fully reveal their properties and functional roles. Where the fixated image lands on the retina and how it moves for different levels of visually demanding tasks is the subject of the current study. An Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope (AOSLO) was used to image, track and present Maltese cross, disk, concentric circles, Vernier and tumbling-E letter fixation targets to healthy subjects. During these different passive (static) or active (discriminating) fixation tasks under natural eye motion, the landing position of the target on the retina was tracked in space and time over the retinal image directly. We computed both the eye motion and the exact trajectory of the fixated target's motion over the retina. We confirmed that compared to passive fixation, active tasks elicited a partial inhibition of microsaccades, leading to longer drifts periods compensated by larger corrective saccades. Consequently the fixation stability during active tasks was larger overall than during passive tasks. The preferred retinal locus of fixation was the same for each task and did not coincide with the location of the peak cone density.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.14.439823v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Fluent reading is an important milestone in education, but we lack a clear understanding of why children vary so widely in attaining this milestone. Language-related factors such as rapid automatized naming (RAN) and phonological awareness have been identified as important factors that influence reading fluency. Of theoretical interest is also, however, whether aspects of visual processing influence reading fluency. To investigate this issue, we tested primary school children (n = 68) on four tasks: two reading fluency tasks (word reading and passage reading), a RAN task to measure naming speed, and a visual search task using letters and bigrams to measure visual processing. As expected, the RAN score was strongly correlated with reading fluency. In addition, visual processing of bigrams was correlated with reading fluency. Importantly, this association was specific to upright but not inverted bigrams, and to bigrams with normal but not large letter spacing. Thus, reading fluency in children is accompanied by specialized changes in upright bigram processing. We propose that bigram processing during visual search could complement existing measures of language processing to understand individual differences in reading fluency.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.14.439812v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a promising non-invasive method for obtaining information relating to the oxygen metabolism. However, the optimal acquisition sequence and QSM reconstruction method for reliable venous susceptibility measurements are unknown. Full flow compensation is generally recommended to correct for the influence of venous blood flow, although the effect of flow compensation on the accuracy of venous susceptibility values has not been systematically evaluated. In this study, we investigated the effect of different acquisition sequences, including different flow compensation schemes, and different QSM reconstruction methods on venous susceptibilities. Ten healthy subjects were scanned with five or six distinct QSM sequence designs implementing different flow compensation schemes. All data sets were processed using six different QSM pipelines and venous blood susceptibility was evaluated in whole-brain segmentations of the venous vasculature and single veins. The quality of vein segmentations and the accuracy of venous susceptibility values were analyzed and compared between all combinations of sequences and QSM methods. The influence of the QSM method on average venous susceptibility values was found to be 2.7 - 11.6 times greater than the influence of the acquisition sequence, including flow compensation. The majority of the investigated QSM reconstruction methods tended to underestimate venous susceptibility values in the vein segmentations that were obtained. Using multi-echo gradient-echo acquisitions with monopolar readout gradients, we found that sequences without full flow compensation yielded venous susceptibility values comparable to sequences with full flow compensation. However, the QSM method had a great influence on susceptibility values and thus needs to be considered carefully for accurate venous QSM.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: AAV-delivery of diacylglycerol kinase kappa achieves long-term rescue of Fmr1-KO mouse model deficits of fragile X syndrome</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.14.439810v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most frequent form of familial intellectual disability. It results from the lack of the RNA binding protein FMRP and is associated with the overactivation of signaling pathways downstream of mGluRI receptors and upstream of mRNA translation. We previously found that diacylglycerol kinase kappa (DGKk) is a main mRNA target of FMRP in cortical neurons. Here we show that diacylglycerol kinase kappa (DGKk), when modified as to become FMRP-independent and delivered into the brain of adolescent mice using adeno-associated viral vectors, corrects brain diacylglycerol and phosphatidic acid homeostasis and the main phenotypic behaviors of the Fmr1-KO mouse model of FXS. Thus, DGKk appears as a key triggering factor of FXS pathomechanism while providing a possible means of intervention for FXS gene therapy.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Remembering the gist of an event over a lifetime depends on the hippocampus</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.14.439803v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>A well-accepted view in memory research is that retrieving the gist of a memory over time depends on the cortex, typically the prefrontal cortex, while retrieving its precision relies on the hippocampus. More recent advances indicate that the hippocampal subfield CA1, as opposed to CA3, remains engaged even for retrieving very remote memories and that this engagement coincides with a maximal recruitment of parahippocampal cortical areas (LEC, MEC, PER and POR)1. Using a time-window comparable to that used in human long-term memory studies, here we show that CA1 is necessary for retrieving the gist of a memory independently of its age while memory precision specifically depends on CA3 in a time-dependent manner. The precision for the memory of a context-footshock association was tested in mice after one day or very remotely (i.e. after 6 months or one year) allowing for the natural fading of the memory trace. Retrieving recent memories engaged both CA1 and CA3 in control mice as revealed by high levels of RNA of the immediate-early gene Arc, strongly tied to synaptic plasticity and memory function. Optogenetic inhibition of CA3 cell firing led to the loss of memory precision, i.e. the retrieval of the gist memory selectively supported by CA1. In contrast, CA1 inhibition abolished memory retrieval and reduced both CA1 and CA3's activity. At very remote tests, controls retrieved only the gist of the event by recruiting CA1 and parahippocampal areas. Retrieving this gist was selectively abrogated upon CA1 optogenetic inactivation that dramatically reduced parahippocampal activity. Our findings indicate that the hippocampus, specifically CA1, is required for gist memory retrieval even for very remote memories that were previously reported to be hippocampal-independent, while CA3 is necessary for recalling precise memories in a time-dependent manner.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.14.439787v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Navigation through space involves learning and representing relationships between past, current and future locations. In mammals, this might rely on the hippocampal theta phase code, where in each cycle of the theta oscillation, spatial representations start behind the animal's location and then sweep forward. However, the exact relationship between phase and represented and true positions remains unclear and even paradoxical. Here, we formalize previous notions as `spatial' or `temporal' sweeps, analyze single-cell and population variables in recordings from rat CA1 place cells, and compare them to model simulations. We show that neither sweep type quantitatively accounts for all relevant variables. Thus we introduce `behavior-dependent' sweeps, which fit our key observation that sweep length, and hence place field properties, such as size and phase precession, vary across the environment depending on the running speed characteristic of each location. This structured heterogeneity is essential for understanding the hippocampal code.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Towards a causal role of Broca's area in language: A TMS-EEG study on syntactic prediction</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.14.439631v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Categorical predictions have been proposed as the key mechanism supporting the fast pace of syntactic composition in human language. Accordingly, grammar-based expectations facilitate the analysis of incoming syntactic information - e.g., hearing the determiner 'the' enhances the prediction of a noun - which is then checked against a single or few other word categories. Previous functional neuroimaging studies point towards Broca's area in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) as one fundamental cortical region involved in categorical prediction during on-line language processing. Causal evidence for this hypothesis is however still missing. In this study, we combined Electroencephalography (EEG) and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) to test whether Broca's area is functionally relevant in predictive mechanisms for language. Specifically, we transiently perturbed Broca's area during the categorical prediction phase in two-word constructions, while simultaneously measuring the Event-Related Potential (ERP) correlates of syntactic composition. We reasoned that if Broca's area is involved in predictive mechanisms for syntax, disruptive TMS during the processing of the first word (determiner/pronoun) would mitigate the difference in ERP responses for predicted and unpredicted categories when composing basic phrases and sentences. Contrary to our hypothesis, perturbation of Broca's area at the predictive stage did not affect the ERP correlates of basic composition. The correlation strength between the electrical field induced by TMS and the magnitude of the EEG response on the scalp further confirmed this pattern. We discuss the present results in light of an alternative account of the role of Broca's area in syntactic composition, namely the bottom-up integration of words into constituents.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Joint ex vivo MRI and histology detect iron-rich cortical gliosis in Tau and TDP-43 proteinopathies</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.14.439064v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is a heterogeneous spectrum of age-associated neurodegenerative diseases that include two main pathologic categories of tau (FTLD-Tau) and TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP) proteinopathies. These distinct proteinopathies are often clinically indistinguishable during life, posing a major obstacle for diagnosis and emerging therapeutic trials tailored to disease-specific mechanisms. Moreover, MRI-derived measures have had limited success to date discriminating between FTLD-Tau or FTLD-TDP. T2*-weighted (T2*w) ex vivo MRI has previously been shown to be sensitive to non-heme iron in healthy intracortical lamination and myelin, and to pathological iron deposits in amyloid-beta plaques and activated microglia in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, an integrated, ex vivo MRI and histopathology approach is understudied in FTLD. We apply joint, whole-hemisphere ex vivo MRI at 7T and histopathology to the study autopsy-confirmed FTLD-Tau (n=3) and FTLD-TDP (n=2), relative to an AD disease-control brain with antemortem clinical symptoms of frontotemporal dementia and an age-matched healthy control. We detect distinct laminar patterns of novel iron-laden glial pathology in both FTLD-Tau and FTLD-TDP brains. We find iron-positive ameboid and hypertrophic microglia and astrocytes largely in deeper GM and adjacent WM in FTLD-Tau. In contrast, FTLD-TDP presents prominent superficial cortical layer iron reactivity in astrocytic processes enveloping small blood vessels with limited involvement of adjacent WM, as well as more diffuse distribution of punctate iron-rich dystrophic microglial processes across all GM lamina. This integrated MRI/histopathology approach reveals ex vivo MRI features that are consistent with these pathological observations distinguishing FTLD-Tau and FTLD-TDP, including prominent irregular hypointense signal in deeper cortex in FTLD-Tau whereas FTLD-TDP showed upper cortical layer hypointense bands and diffuse cortical speckling. Moreover, differences in adjacent WM degeneration and iron-rich gliosis on histology between FTLD-Tau and FTLD-TDP were also readily apparent on MRI as hyperintense signal and irregular areas of hypointensity, respectively that were more prominent in FTLD-Tau compared to FTLD-TDP. These unique histopathological and radiographic features were distinct from HC and AD brains, suggesting that iron-sensitive T2*w MRI, adapted to in vivo application at sufficient resolution, may offer an opportunity to improve antemortem diagnosis of FTLD proteinopathies using tissue-validated methods.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: A Paradigm Free Regularization Approach to Recover Brain Activation from Functional MRI Data</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.14.438942v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Context: Functional MRI is a non-invasive imaging technique that provides an indirect view into brain activity, via the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) response. In particular, resting-state fMRI poses challenges to the recovery of brain activity without prior knowledge on the experimental paradigm, as it is the case for task-fMRI. Conventional methods to infer brain activity from the fMRI signals, for example the general linear model (GLM), require the knowledge of the experimental paradigm to define regressors and estimate the contribution of each voxel's time course to the task. To overcome this limitation, approaches to deconvolve the BOLD response and recover the underlying neural activation without a priori information on the task have been proposed. State-of-the-art techniques, and in particular the Total Activation (TA), formulates the deconvolution as an optimization problem with decoupled spatial and temporal regularization terms. This increases the number of hyperparameters to be set and requires an optimization strategy that alternates between the constraints. Approach: In this work, we propose a paradigm-free regularization algorithm named Paradigm-Free fMRI (PF-fMRI) that is applied on the 4-D fMRI image, acting simultaneously in the 3-D space and 1-D time dimensions. Based on the idea that large image variations should be preserved as they occur during brain activation, whereas small variations considered as noise should be removed, the PF-fMRI applies an anisotropic regularization, thus recovering the location and the duration of brain activation. Results. Using the experimental paradigm as ground truth, the PF-fMRI is validated on synthetic and real task-fMRI data from 51 subjets, and its performance is compared to the TA. Results show higher correlations of the recovered time-courses with the ground truth compared to the TA and lower computational times. In addition, we show that the PF-fMRI recovers activity that agrees with the GLM, without requiring or using any knowledge of the experimental paradigm.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.13.439749v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The age- and time-dependent effects of binge-drinking on adolescent brain development have not been well characterized even though binge drinking is a health crisis among adolescents. The impact of binge drinking on gray matter volume development was examined using longitudinal data from the National Consortium on Alcohol and NeuroDevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA). Non-binge drinkers (n=177) were matched to binge drinkers (n=164) on potential confounders. Number of binge drinking episodes in the past year was linked to decreased volumes for total gray matter, frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes (ps&amp;lt;.001). Interactions of binge drinking episodes and age demonstrated stronger effects in younger subjects for total gray matter, frontal, temporal, and occipital lobes (ps&amp;lt;.001). Subsequent models included binge drinking coded in multiple ways. Models sensitive to number of episodes and temporal proximity to outcomes provided the best fits. Declines in gray matter volume association with binge drinking are potentially related to changes in cognition frequently reported among binge drinking adolescents. Results underscore the potential importance of delaying initiation of binge drinking and provide evidence for a dose-response relationship of binge drinking to gray matter decline. Temporally proximal binge drinking was associated more strongly with gray matter decline, suggesting the potential for recovery.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Despite the emerging evidence implying early vascular contributions to neurogenerative syndromes, the role of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease is still not well understood. Herein, we show that VSMCs in brains of AD patients and the animal model of the disease, are deficient in multiple VSMC-contractile markers which correlated with Tau accumulation in brain arterioles. Ex vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that VSMCs undergo dramatic phenotypic transitions under AD-like conditions, adopting pro-inflammatory and synthetic phenotypes. Notably, these changes coincided with Tau hyperphosphorylation at residues Y18, T205 and S262. We also observed that loss of VSMC markers occurred in an age-dependent manner, and that expression of Sm22-a and a-Sma proteins were inversely correlated with CD68 and Tau accumulation in brain arterioles of 3xTg-AD mice. Together, these findings further support the contribution of VSMCs in AD pathogenesis, and nominate VSMCs as potential novel therapeutic target in AD.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.13.439732v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Auditory attention detection (AAD) seeks to detect the attended speech from EEG signals in a multi-talker scenario, i.e. cocktail party. As the EEG channels reflect the activities of different brain areas, a task-oriented channel selection technique improves the performance of brain-computer interface applications. In this study, we propose a soft channel attention mechanism, instead of hard channel selection, that derives an EEG channel mask by optimizing the auditory attention detection task. The neural AAD system consists of a neural channel attention mechanism and a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier. We evaluate the proposed framework on a publicly available database. We achieve 88.3% and 77.2% for 2-second and 0.1-second decision windows with 64-channel EEG; and 86.1% and 83.9% for 2-second decision windows with 32-channel and 16-channel EEG, respectively. The proposed framework outperforms other competitive models by a large margin in all test cases.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The age at onset of motor symptoms in Huntington disease (HD) is driven by HTT CAG repeat length but modified by other genes. We used exome sequencing of 683 HD patients with extremes of onset or phenotype relative to CAG length to identify rare variants associated with clinical effect. We identified damaging coding variants in candidate modifier genes from prior genome-wide association studies associated with altered HD onset or severity. Variants in FAN1 clustered in its DNA-binding and nuclease domains and were associated predominantly with earlier onset HD. Nuclease activities of these variants correlated with residual age at motor onset of HD. Mutating endogenous FAN1 to a nuclease-inactive form in an induced pluripotent stem cell model of HD led to rates of CAG expansion comparable to those observed with complete FAN1 knock out. Together, these data implicate FAN1 nuclease activity in slowing somatic repeat expansion and hence onset of HD.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24843?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Using fast‐scan cyclic voltammetry in rat brain slices in vitro, we showed an attenuation of electrically‐stimulated dopamine release by agonists at both GABA‐A (muscimol) and GABA‐B (baclofen) receptors. The attenuation by the baclofen was abolished in slices from animals pretreated with phencyclidine, modelling schizophrenia. 

Abstract
Dopamine signaling in nucleus accumbens (NAc) is modulated by γ‐aminobutyric acid (GABA), acting through GABA‐A and GABA‐B receptors: dysregulation of GABAergic control of dopamine function may be important in behavioral deficits in schizophrenia. We investigated the effect of GABA‐A (muscimol) and GABA‐B (baclofen) receptor agonists on electrically stimulated dopamine release. Furthermore, we explored whether drug‐induced changes were disrupted by pretreatment with phencyclidine, which provides a well‐validated model of schizophrenia. Using brain slices from female rats, fast‐scan cyclic voltammetry was used to measure electrically stimulated dopamine release in NAc shell. Both muscimol and baclofen caused concentration‐dependent attenuation of evoked dopamine release: neither effect was changed by dihydro‐β‐erythroidine, a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, or the α‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)‐type glutamate receptor antagonist, 6‐cyano‐7‐nitroquinoxaline‐2,3‐dione (CNQX), precluding indirect mechanisms using these transmitter systems in the GABAergic actions. In slices taken from rats pretreated with phencyclidine, the attenuation of evoked dopamine release by baclofen was abolished, but the attenuation by muscimol was unaffected. Since phencyclidine pretreatment was followed by drug‐free washout period of at least a week, the drug was not present during recording. Therefore, disruption of GABA‐B modulation of dopamine is due to long‐term functional changes resulting from the treatment, rather than transient changes due to the drug's presence at test. This enduring dysregulation of GABA‐B modulation of accumbal dopamine release provides a plausible mechanism through which GABA dysfunction influences accumbal dopamine leading to behavioral changes seen in schizophrenia and may provide a route for novel therapeutic strategies to treat the condition.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Neurocognitive processing efficiency for discriminating human non-alarm rather than alarm scream calls</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/yAAgcDOmmTs/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Sascha Frühholz, Joris Dietziker, Matthias Staib, Wiebke Trost&lt;/p&gt;

Across many species, scream calls signal the affective significance of events to other agents. Scream calls were often thought to be of generic alarming and fearful nature, to signal potential threats, with instantaneous, involuntary, and accurate recognition by perceivers. However, scream calls are more diverse in their affective signaling nature than being limited to fearfully alarming a threat, and thus the broader sociobiological relevance of various scream types is unclear. Here we used 4 different psychoacoustic, perceptual decision-making, and neuroimaging experiments in humans to demonstrate the existence of at least 6 psychoacoustically distinctive types of scream calls of both alarming and non-alarming nature, rather than there being only screams caused by fear or aggression. Second, based on perceptual and processing sensitivity measures for decision-making during scream recognition, we found that alarm screams (with some exceptions) were overall discriminated the worst, were responded to the slowest, and were associated with a lower perceptual sensitivity for their recognition compared with non-alarm screams. Third, the neural processing of alarm compared with non-alarm screams during an implicit processing task elicited only minimal neural signal and connectivity in perceivers, contrary to the frequent assumption of a threat processing bias of the primate neural system. These findings show that scream calls are more diverse in their signaling and communicative nature in humans than previously assumed, and, in contrast to a commonly observed threat processing bias in perceptual discriminations and neural processes, we found that especially non-alarm screams, and positive screams in particular, seem to have higher efficiency in speeded discriminations and the implicit neural processing of various scream types in humans.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/yAAgcDOmmTs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Unravelling the Neural Basis of Spatial Delusions After Stroke</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26079?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Knowing explicitly where we are is an interpretation of our spatial representations. Reduplicative paramnesia is a disrupting syndrome in which patients present a firm belief of spatial mislocation. Here, we studied the largest sample of patients with delusional misidentifications of space (ie, reduplicative paramnesia) after stroke to shed light on their neurobiology.


Methods
In a prospective, cumulative, case‐control study, we screened 400 patients with acute right‐hemispheric stroke. We included 64 cases and 233 controls. First, lesions were delimited and normalized. Then, we computed structural and functional disconnection maps using methods of lesion‐track and network‐mapping. The maps were compared, controlling for confounders. Second, we built a multivariate logistic model, including clinical, behavioral, and neuroimaging data. Finally, we performed a nested cross‐validation of the model with a support‐vector machine analysis.


Results
The most frequent misidentification subtype was confabulatory mislocation (56%), followed by place reduplication (19%), and chimeric assimilation (13%). Our results indicate that structural disconnection is the strongest predictor of the syndrome and included 2 distinct streams, connecting right fronto‐thalamic and right occipitotemporal structures. In the multivariate model, the independent predictors of reduplicative paramnesia were the structural disconnection map, lesion sparing of right dorsal fronto‐parietal regions, age, and anosognosia. Good discrimination accuracy was demonstrated (area under the curve = 0.80 [0.75–0.85]).


Interpretation
Our results localize the anatomic circuits that may have a role in the abnormal spatial‐emotional binding and in the defective updating of spatial representations underlying reduplicative paramnesia.

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24839?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>In the present study, the effects of electrical field stimulation (EFS) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) were determined in the compression model of ex vivo spinal cords by using a double sucrose gap recording chamber (DSGRC). The effects of the combination therapy are better than those of the individual treatments of PEG and EFS. The methods of establishing ex vivo spinal cord compression model in the DSGRC can be useful in the fundamental and the clinical applications of the spinal cord injury in future.

Abstract
The application of electric field stimulation (EFS) can reduce the cation influx after spinal cord injury. However, regenerated cation influx and reestablished injury potential are observed after EFS. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is popular as an effective cell membrane fusion agent. This study aims to determine the effects of the combination therapy of EFS and PEG in the ex vivo spinal cord after compression. The ex vivo spinal cords of female rats with compression injury were incubated in a double sucrose gap recording chamber (DSGRC) and randomly divided into the following four groups: (1) compression group: compression only, (2) EFS group: EFS for 15 min, (3) PEG group: PEG treatment for 4 min, and (4) EFS + PEG group: EFS for 15 min and PEG treatment for 4 min. The hematoxylin–eosin staining was performed to measure the necrotic area of the spinal cords. The gap potential was detected, and the area under the curve of the gap potential was calculated. The intracellular cation concentration, membrane permeability, and compound action potential were measured and quantified. Results revealed no significant difference in the necrotic areas among different groups, and the compression model of the ex vivo spinal cord in the DSGRC had high consistency and stability. The combination therapy could attenuate cation inflow, promote cell membrane restoration, and promote the functional recovery of the spinal cord conduction after compression in ex vivo spinal cords.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Sex differences in synaptic plasticity underlying learning</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24844?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Although sex differences in learning behaviors are well documented, sexual dimorphism in the synaptic processes of encoding is only recently appreciated. Studies in male rodents have built upon the discovery of long‐term potentiation (LTP), and acceptance of this activity‐dependent increase in synaptic strength as a mechanism of encoding, to identify synaptic receptors and signaling activities that coordinate the activity‐dependent remodeling of the subsynaptic actin cytoskeleton that is critical for enduring potentiation and memory. These molecular substrates together with other features of LTP, as characterized in males, have provided an explanation for a range of memory phenomena including multiple stages of consolidation, the efficacy of spaced training, and the location of engrams at the level of individual synapses. In the present report, we summarize these findings and describe more recent results from our laboratories showing that in females the same actin regulatory mechanisms are required for hippocampal LTP and memory but, in females only, the engagement of both modulatory receptors such as TrkB and synaptic signaling intermediaries including Src and ERK1/2 requires neuron‐derived estrogen and signaling through membrane‐associated estrogen receptor α (ERα). Moreover, in association with the additional ERα involvement, females exhibit a higher threshold for hippocampal LTP and spatial learning. We propose that the distinct LTP threshold in females contributes to as yet unappreciated sex differences in information processing and features of learning and memory.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05575</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transformer attention architectures, similar to those developed for natural
language processing, have recently proved efficient also in vision, either in
conjunction with or as a replacement for convolutional layers. Typically,
visual attention is inserted in the network architecture as a (series of)
feedforward self-attention module(s), with mutual key-query agreement as the
main selection and routing operation. However efficient, this strategy is only
vaguely compatible with the way that attention is implemented in biological
brains: as a separate and unified network of attentional selection regions,
receiving inputs from and exerting modulatory influence on the entire hierarchy
of visual regions. Here, we report experiments with a simple such attention
system that can improve the performance of standard convolutional networks,
with relatively few additional parameters. Each spatial position in each layer
of the network produces a key-query vector pair; all queries are then pooled
into a global attention query. On the next iteration, the match between each
key and the global attention query modulates the network's activations --
emphasizing or silencing the locations that agree or disagree (respectively)
with the global attention system. We demonstrate the usefulness of this
brain-inspired Global Attention Agreement network (GAttANet) for various
convolutional backbones (from a simple 5-layer toy model to a standard ResNet50
architecture) and datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Imagenet-1k). Each time, our
global attention system improves accuracy over the corresponding baseline.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05497</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Several methods have been developed to extract information from
electroencephalograms (EEG). One of them is Phase-Amplitude Coupling (PAC)
which is a type of Cross-Frequency Coupling (CFC) method, consisting in measure
the synchronization of phase and amplitude for the different EEG bands and
electrodes. This provides information regarding brain areas that are
synchronously activated, and eventually, a marker of functional connectivity
between these areas. In this work, intra and inter electrode PAC is computed
obtaining the relationship among different electrodes used in EEG. The
connectivity information is then treated as a graph in which the different
nodes are the electrodes and the edges PAC values between them. These
structures are embedded to create a feature vector that can be further used to
classify multichannel EEG samples. The proposed method has been applied to
classified EEG samples acquired using specific auditory stimuli in a task
designed for dyslexia disorder diagnosis in seven years old children EEG's. The
proposed method provides AUC values up to 0.73 and allows selecting the most
discriminant electrodes and EEG bands.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep learning-based models have recently outperformed state-of-the-art
seasonal forecasting models, such as for predicting El Ni\~no-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO). However, current deep learning models are based on
convolutional neural networks which are difficult to interpret and can fail to
model large-scale atmospheric patterns. In comparison, graph neural networks
(GNNs) are capable of modeling large-scale spatial dependencies and are more
interpretable due to the explicit modeling of information flow through edge
connections. We propose the first application of graph neural networks to
seasonal forecasting. We design a novel graph connectivity learning module that
enables our GNN model to learn large-scale spatial interactions jointly with
the actual ENSO forecasting task. Our model, \graphino, outperforms
state-of-the-art deep learning-based models for forecasts up to six months
ahead. Additionally, we show that our model is more interpretable as it learns
sensible connectivity structures that correlate with the ENSO anomaly pattern.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05048</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An increasing number of emerging applications in data science and engineering
are based on multidimensional and structurally rich data. The irregularities,
however, of high-dimensional data often compromise the effectiveness of
standard machine learning algorithms. We hereby propose the Rank-R Feedforward
Neural Network (FNN), a tensor-based nonlinear learning model that imposes
Canonical/Polyadic decomposition on its parameters, thereby offering two core
advantages compared to typical machine learning methods. First, it handles
inputs as multilinear arrays, bypassing the need for vectorization, and can
thus fully exploit the structural information along every data dimension.
Moreover, the number of the model's trainable parameters is substantially
reduced, making it very efficient for small sample setting problems. We
establish the universal approximation and learnability properties of Rank-R
FNN, and we validate its performance on real-world hyperspectral datasets.
Experimental evaluations show that Rank-R FNN is a computationally inexpensive
alternative of ordinary FNN that achieves state-of-the-art performance on
higher-order tensor data.

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The occurrence of ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury leads to dysfunction as well as high rates of morbidity and mortality in stroke, and new effective therapeutic strategies for I/R are still needed. We investigated the effect of IL-27 on I/R injury-induced neurological function impairment, cerebral infarction volume and variation in levels of inflammatory factors in mice with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), as well as concentration of LDH and neuronal apoptosis in a neuron oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R) model mediated by gp130/STAT3 signaling in vitro. Our results indicated that IL-27 could bind to its receptor of gp130 to attenuate the I/R injury-induced impairment function and cerebral infarction volume, and decrease inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β and MCP-1 but increase anti-inflammatory factors IL-10 and TGF-β in vivo, while inhibiting LDH leakage and neuronal apoptosis through activation of STAT3 to antagonize I/R induction. Our results suggest that IL-27 may protect the brain from I/R injury through the gp130/STAT3 signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neurology: Clinical efficacy of the enzyme replacement therapy in patients with late-onset Pompe disease: a systematic review and a meta-analysis</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In patients with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD), the efficacy of the enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human alpha-glucosidase (rhGAA) is difficult to evaluate, due to the clinical heterogeneity and the small sample sizes in published studies. Therefore, we conduct a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of the literature to evaluate the efficacy of ERT in LOPD patients considering the walking distance, respiratory function and muscle strength. Particularly, six-minute walk test (6MWT), forced vital capacity (FVC), medical research council (MRC) grading, quantitative muscle testing (QMT), and quick motor function test (QMFT) were outcomes of interest. Overall, 619 studies were identified in PubMed, EMBASE and by manual search on July 18th, 2020. After an initial assessment, 16 studies were included in the meta-analysis, containing clinical data from 589 patients with LOPD. For the 6MWT, 419 patients were analyzed. Walking distance improved on average, 32.2 m greater during the observed period (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.0003), compared to the distance at the baseline. The meta-analysis did not show any improvement in FVC and only a tendency towards better muscle strength after treatment with ERT, but the difference was not statistically significant. In conclusion, the available data showed that ERT has a significant beneficial efficacy in the improvement of walking distance in LOPD patients and a non-significant improvement of muscle strength. No improvement in respiratory capacity was found. More prospective and controlled trials are needed to demonstrate a clear clinical benefit of ERT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Validation of Olfactory Network Based on Brain Structural Connectivity and Its Association With Olfactory Test Scores</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.638053</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Olfactory perception is a complicated process involving multiple cortical and subcortical regions, of which the underlying brain dynamics are still not adequately mapped. Even in the definition of the olfactory primary cortex, there is a large degree of variation in parcellation templates used for investigating olfaction in neuroimaging studies. This complicates comparison between human olfactory neuroimaging studies. The present study aims to validate an olfactory parcellation template derived from both functional and anatomical data that applies structural connectivity (SC) to ensure robust connectivity to key secondary olfactory regions. Furthermore, exploratory analyses investigate if different olfactory parameters are associated with differences in the strength of connectivity of this structural olfactory fingerprint. By combining diffusion data with an anatomical atlas and advanced probabilistic tractography, we found that the olfactory parcellation had a robust SC network to key secondary olfactory regions. Furthermore, the study indicates that higher ratings of olfactory significance were associated with increased intra- and inter-hemispheric SC of the primary olfactory cortex. Taken together, these results suggest that the patterns of SC between the primary olfactory cortex and key secondary olfactory regions has potential to be used for investigating the nature of olfactory significance, hence strengthening the theory that individual differences in olfactory behaviour are encoded in the structural network fingerprint of the olfactory cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Ocular Health of Octodon degus as a Clinical Marker for Age-Related and Age-Independent Neurodegeneration</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2021.665467</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The aging process and age-related diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), are very heterogeneous and multifactorial, making it challenging to diagnose the disease based solely on genetic, behavioral tests, or clinical history. It is yet to be explained what ophthalmological tests relate specifically to aging and AD. To this end, we have selected the common degu (Octodon degus) as a model for aging which develops AD-like signs to conduct ophthalmological screening methods that could be clinical markers of aging and AD. We investigated ocular health using ophthalmoscopy, fundus photography, intraocular pressure (IOP), and pupillary light reflex (PLR). The results showed significant presence of cataracts in adult degus and IOP was also found to increase significantly with advancing age. Age had a significant effect on the maximum pupil constriction but other pupil parameters changed in an age-independent manner (PIPR retention index, resting pupil size, constriction velocity, redilation plateau). We concluded that degus have underlying factors at play that regulate PLR and may be connected to sympathetic, parasympathetic, and melanopsin retinal ganglion cell (ipRGC) deterioration. This study provides the basis for the use of ocular tests as screening methods for the aging process and monitoring of neurodegeneration in non-invasive ways.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Optimized Parameters for Transducing the Locus Coeruleus Using Canine Adenovirus Type 2 (CAV2) Vector in Rats for Chemogenetic Modulation Research</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.663337</link>
	<content:encoded>Introduction&lt;p&gt;The locus coeruleus noradrenergic (LC-NA) system is studied for its role in various neurological and psychiatric disorders such as epilepsy and Major Depression Dissorder. Chemogenetics is a powerful technique for specific manipulation of the LC to investigate its functioning. Local injection of AAV2/7 viral vectors has limitations with regards to efficiency and specificity of the transduction, potentially due to low tropism of AAV2/7 for LC neurons. In this study we used a canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV2) vector with different volumes and viral particle numbers to achieve high and selective expression of hM3Dq, an excitatory Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD), for chemogenetic modulation of LC neurons.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected in the LC with different absolute numbers of CAV2-PRSx8-hM3Dq-mCherry physical particles (0.1E9, 1E9, 5E9,10E9, or 20E9 pp) using different volumes (LowV = 3 nl × 300 nl, MediumV = 3 × 600 nl, HighV = 3 × 1200 nl). Two weeks post-injection, double-labeling immunohistochemistry for dopamine β hydroxylase (DBH) and mCherry was performed to determine hM3Dq expression and its specificity for LC neurons. The size of the transduced LC was compared to the contralateral LC to identify signs of toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Administration of Medium volume (3 × 600 nl) and 1E9 particles resulted in high expression levels with 87.3 ± 9.8% of LC neurons expressing hM3Dq, but low specificity with 36.2 ± 17.3% of hM3Dq expression in non-LC neurons. The most diluted conditions (Low volume_0.1E pp and Medium Volume_0.1E pp) presented similar high transduction of LC neurons (70.9 ± 12.7 and 77.2 ± 9.8%) with lower aspecificity (5.5 ± 3.5 and 4.0 ± 1.9%, respectively). Signs of toxicity were observed in all undiluted conditions as evidenced by a decreased size of the transduced LC.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This study identified optimal conditions (Low and Medium Volume with 0.1E9 particles of CAV2-PRSx8-hM3Dq-mCherry) for safe and specific transduction of LC neurons with excitatory DREADDs to study the role of the LC-NA system in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Multiparametric Analysis of Cerebral Development in Preterm Infants Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.658002</link>
	<content:encoded>Objectives&lt;p&gt;The severity of neurocognitive impairment increases with prematurity. However, its mechanisms remain poorly understood. Our aim was firstly to identify multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers that differ according to the degree of prematurity, and secondly to evaluate the impact of clinical complications on these markers.&lt;/p&gt;Materials and Methods&lt;p&gt;We prospectively enrolled preterm infants who were divided into two groups according to their degree of prematurity: extremely preterm (&amp;lt;28 weeks’ gestational age) and very preterm (28–32 weeks’ gestational age). They underwent a multiparametric brain MRI scan at term-equivalent age including morphological, diffusion tensor and arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion sequences. We quantified overall and regional volumes, diffusion parameters, and cerebral blood flow (CBF). We then compared the parameters for the two groups. We also assessed the effects of clinical data and potential MRI morphological abnormalities on those parameters.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Thirty-four preterm infants were included. Extremely preterm infants (n = 13) had significantly higher frontal relative volumes (p = 0.04), frontal GM relative volumes (p = 0.03), and regional CBF than very preterm infants, but they had lower brainstem and insular relative volumes (respectively p = 0.008 and 0.04). Preterm infants with WM lesions on MRI had significantly lower overall GM CBF (13.3 ± 2 ml/100 g/min versus 17.7 ± 2.5, &amp;lt; ml/100 g/min p = 0.03).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging brain scans performed at term-equivalent age in preterm infants provide quantitative imaging parameters that differ with respect to the degree of prematurity, related to brain maturation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: A Real-Time Stability Control Method Through sEMG Interface for Lower Extremity Rehabilitation Exoskeletons</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.645374</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Herein, we propose a real-time stable control gait switching method for the exoskeleton rehabilitation robot. Exoskeleton rehabilitation robots have been extensively developed during the past decade and are able to offer valuable motor ability to paraplegics. However, achieving stable states of the human-exoskeleton system while conserving wearer strength remains challenging. The constant switching of gaits during walking may affect the center of gravity, resulting in imbalance of human–exoskeleton system. In this study, it was determined that forming an equilateral triangle with two crutch-supporting points and a supporting leg has a positive impact on walking stability and ergonomic interaction. First, the gaits planning and stability analysis based on human kinematics model and zero moment point method for the lower limb exoskeleton are demonstrated. Second, a neural interface based on surface electromyography (sEMG), which realizes the intention recognition and muscle fatigue estimation, is constructed. Third, the stability of human–exoskeleton system and ergonomic effects are tested through different gaits with planned and unplanned gait switching strategy on the SIAT lower limb rehabilitation exoskeleton. The intention recognition based on long short-term memory (LSTM) model can achieve an accuracy of nearly 99%. The experimental results verified the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed gait switching method for enhancing stability and ergonomic effects of lower limb rehabilitation exoskeleton.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Brain Density Clustering Analysis: A New Approach to Brain Functional Dynamics</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.621716</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;A number of studies in recent years have explored whole-brain dynamic connectivity using pairwise approaches. There has been less focus on trying to analyze brain dynamics in higher dimensions over time.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We introduce a new approach that analyzes time series trajectories to identify high traffic nodes in a high dimensional space. First, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data are decomposed using spatial ICA to a set of maps and their associated time series. Next, density is calculated for each time point and high-density points are clustered to identify a small set of high traffic nodes. We validated our method using simulations and then implemented it on a real data set.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;We present a novel approach that captures dynamics within a high dimensional space and also does not use any windowing in contrast to many existing approaches. The approach enables one to characterize and study the time series in a potentially high dimensional space, rather than looking at each component pair separately. Our results show that schizophrenia patients have a lower dynamism compared to healthy controls. In addition, we find patients spend more time in nodes associated with the default mode network and less time in components strongly correlated with auditory and sensorimotor regions. Interestingly, we also found that subjects oscillate between state pairs that show opposite spatial maps, suggesting an oscillatory pattern.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our proposed method provides a novel approach to analyze the data in its native high dimensional space and can possibly provide new information that is undetectable using other methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurotransmitter transporters limit spillover between synapses and maintain the extracellular neurotransmitter concentration at low yet physiologically meaningful levels. They also exert a key role in providing precursors for neurotransmitter biosynthesis. In many cases, neurons and astrocytes contain a large intracellular pool of transporters that can be redistributed and stabilized in the plasma membrane following activation of different signaling pathways. This means that the uptake capacity of the brain neuropil for different neurotransmitters can be dynamically regulated over the course of minutes, as an indirect consequence of changes in neuronal activity, blood flow, cell-to-cell interactions, etc. Here we discuss recent advances in the mechanisms that control the cell membrane trafficking and biophysical properties of transporters for the excitatory, inhibitory and modulatory neurotransmitters glutamate, GABA, and dopamine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Predicting Dementia With Prefrontal Electroencephalography and Event-Related Potential</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.659817</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: To examine whether prefrontal electroencephalography (EEG) can be used for screening dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We estimated the global cognitive decline using the results of Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), measurements of brain activity from resting-state EEG, responses elicited by auditory stimulation [sensory event-related potential (ERP)], and selective attention tasks (selective-attention ERP) from 122 elderly participants (dementia, 35; control, 87). We investigated that the association between MMSE and each EEG/ERP variable by using Pearson’s correlation coefficient and performing univariate linear regression analysis. Kernel density estimation was used to examine the distribution of each EEG/ERP variable in the dementia and non-dementia groups. Both Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses with the estimated odds ratios were conducted to assess the associations between the EEG/ERP variables and dementia prevalence. To develop the predictive models, five-fold cross-validation was applied to multiple classification algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Most prefrontal EEG/ERP variables, previously known to be associated with cognitive decline, show correlations with the MMSE score (strongest correlation has |r| = 0.68). Although variables such as the frontal asymmetry of the resting-state EEG are not well correlated with the MMSE score, they indicate risk factors for dementia. The selective-attention ERP and resting-state EEG variables outperform the MMSE scores in dementia prediction (areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.891, 0.824, and 0.803, respectively). In addition, combining EEG/ERP variables and MMSE scores improves the model predictive performance, whereas adding demographic risk factors do not improve the prediction accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Prefrontal EEG markers outperform MMSE scores in predicting dementia, and additional prediction accuracy is expected when combining them with MMSE scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significance: Prefrontal EEG is effective for screening dementia when used independently or in combination with MMSE.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.656750</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Purpose: Imaging of the choroid may detect the microvascular changes associated with early-onset dementia (EOD) and may represent an indicator for detection of the disease. We aimed to analyze the in vivo choriocapillaris (CC) flow density in EOD patients using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) and evaluate the association with its clinical measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: This cross-sectional study used the OCTA to image and analyze the choriocapillaris (CC) of 25 EOD patients and 20 healthy controls. Choriocapillaris flow density in the 3 mm area and 6 mm area was measured by an inbuilt algorithm in the OCT tool. Brain volume using magnetic resonance imaging and cognitive assessment was done and recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Significantly reduced capillary flow density of the choriocapillaris was seen in EOD patients when compared to healthy controls in the 3.0 mm (P = 0.001) and 6.0 mm (P &amp;lt; 0.001) area respectively. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores in EOD patients positively correlated with choriocapillaris flow density in the 3 mm area (Rho = 0.466, P = 0.021). Disease duration of EOD patients also negatively correlated with choriocapillaris density in the 3 mm area (Rho = −0.497, P = 0.008).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: Our report suggests that choriocapillaris damage may be a potential indicator of early-onset dementia. Microvascular impairment may be involved in the early phase of dementia without aging playing a role in its impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration: www.ClinicalTrials.gov, ChiCTR2000041386.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.632054</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most fatal subtype of stroke with high disability and high mortality rates, and there is no effective treatment. The predilection site of ICH is in the area of the basal ganglia and internal capsule (IC), where exist abundant white matter (WM) fiber tracts, such as the corticospinal tract (CST) in the IC. Proximal or distal white matter injury (WMI) caused by intracerebral parenchymal hemorrhage is closely associated with poor prognosis after ICH, especially motor and sensory dysfunction. The pathophysiological mechanisms involved in WMI are quite complex and still far from clear. In recent years, the neuroprotection and repairment capacity of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has been widely investigated after ICH. MSCs exert many unique biological effects, including self-recovery by producing growth factors and cytokines, regenerative repair, immunomodulation, and neuroprotection against oxidative stress, providing a promising cellular therapeutic approach for the treatment of WMI. Taken together, our goal is to discuss the characteristics of WMI following ICH, including the mechanism and potential promising therapeutic targets of MSCs, aiming at providing new clues for future therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.628336</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Currently there is a shortage of biomarkers for stroke, one of the leading causes of death and disability in aging populations. Retinal vessels offer a unique and accessible “window” to study the microvasculature in vivo. However, the relationship between the retinal microvasculature and stroke is not entirely clear. To investigate the retinal microvascular characteristics in stroke, we recruited patients with stroke and age-matched control subjects from a tertiary hospital in China. The macular vessel density (VD) in the superficial capillary plexus (SCP) and deep capillary plexus (DCP), foveal avascular zone (FAZ) metrics, and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) measured optic disc VD were recorded for analysis. A total of 189 patients with stroke and 195 control subjects were included. After adjusting for sex, visual acuity, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, a history of smoking, levels of hemoglobulin (HbA1c), cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), the macular VD of SCP and DCP in all sectors was decreased in patients with stroke. In the stroke group, the VD around the FAZ and the VD of the optic disk were lower. Logistic regression found the parafovea-superior-hemi VD of DCP &amp;gt; 54.53% [odds ratio (OR): 0.169] as a protective factor of stroke. Using the integration of all OCTA parameters and traditional risk factors, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curve of distinguishing patients with stroke was 0.962, with a sensitivity of 0.944 and a specificity of 0.871. Our study demonstrates that the retinal VD is decreased in patients with stroke independently of the traditional risk factors of stroke, which may shed light on the monitoring of stroke using the retinal microvascular parameters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.623930</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: There has been an increasing interest in studying electroencephalogram (EEG) as a biomarker of Alzheimer’s disease but the association between EEG signals and patients’ neuropsychiatric symptoms remains unclear. We studied EEG signals of patients with Alzheimer’s disease to explore the associations between patients’ neuropsychiatric symptoms and clusters of patients based on their EEG powers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A total of 69 patients with mild Alzheimer’s disease (the Clinical Dementia Rating = 1) were enrolled and their EEG signals from 19 channels/electrodes were recorded in three sessions for each patient. The EEG power was calculated by Fourier transform for the four frequency bands (beta: 13–40 Hz, alpha: 8–13 Hz, theta: 4–8 Hz, and delta: &amp;lt;4 Hz). We performed K-means cluster analysis to classify the 69 patients into two distinct groups by the log-transformed EEG powers (4 frequency bands × 19 channels) for the three EEG sessions. In each session, both clusters were compared with each other to assess the differences in their behavioral/psychological symptoms in terms of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: While EEG band powers were highly consistent across all three sessions before clustering, EEG band powers were different between the two clusters in each session, especially for the delta waves. The delta band powers differed significantly between the two clusters in most channels across the three sessions. Patients’ demographics and cognitive function were not different between both clusters. However, their behavioral/psychological symptoms were different between the two clusters classified based on EEG powers. A higher NPI score was associated with the clustering of higher EEG powers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The present study suggests that EEG power correlates to behavioral and psychological symptoms among patients with mild Alzheimer’s disease. The clustering approach of EEG signals may provide a novel and cost-effective method to differentiate the severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms and/or predict the prognosis for Alzheimer’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Lipoprotein DolP supports proper folding of BamA in the bacterial outer membrane, promoting fitness upon envelope stress</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/67817</link>
	<content:encoded>Integral outer membrane proteins (OMPs) are crucial for the maintenance of the proteobacterial envelope permeability barrier to some antibiotics and detergents. In Enterobacteria, envelope stress caused by unfolded OM proteins (OMPs) activates the sigmaE (σ&lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt;) transcriptional response. σ&lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt; upregulates OMP-biogenesis factors, including the b-barrel assembly machinery (BAM) that catalyzes OMP folding. Here we report that DolP (formerly YraP), a σ&lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt;-upregulated and poorly understood OM lipoprotein, is crucial for fitness in cells that undergo envelope stress. We demonstrate that DolP interacts with the BAM complex by associating to OM-assembled BamA. We provide evidence that DolP is important for proper folding of BamA that overaccumulates in the OM, thus supporting OMP biogenesis and OM integrity. Notably, mid-cell recruitment of DolP had been linked to regulation of septal peptidoglycan remodelling by an unknown mechanism. We now reveal that, during envelope stress, DolP loses its association with the mid-cell, thereby suggesting a mechanistic link between envelope stress caused by impaired OMP biogenesis and the regulation of a late step of cell division.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>A previous report found an association of topic choice with race-based funding disparities among R01 applications submitted to the National Institutes of Health ('NIH') between 2011-2015. Applications submitted by African American or Black ('AAB') Principal Investigators ('PIs') skewed toward a small number of topics that were less likely to be funded (or 'awarded'). It was suggested that lower award rates may be related to topic-related biases of peer reviewers. However, the report did not account for differential funding ecologies among NIH Institutes and Centers ('ICs'). In a re-analysis, we find that 10% of 148 topics account for 50% of applications submitted by AAB PIs. These applications on 'AAB Preferred' topics were funded at lower rates, but peer review outcomes were similar. The lower rate of funding for these topics was primarily due to their assignment to ICs with lower award rates, not to peer-reviewer preferences.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66240</link>
	<content:encoded>Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited retinal disease, affecting &amp;gt;20 million people worldwide. Loss of daylight vision typically occurs due to the dysfunction/loss of cone photoreceptors, the cell type that initiates our color and high acuity vision. Currently, there is no effective treatment for RP, other than gene therapy for a limited number of specific disease genes. To develop a disease gene-agnostic therapy, we screened 20 genes for their ability to prolong cone photoreceptor survival &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we report an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector expressing Txnip, which prolongs the survival of cone photoreceptors and improves visual acuity in RP mouse models. A &lt;i&gt;Txnip&lt;/i&gt; allele, C247S, which blocks the association of Txnip with thioredoxin, provides an even greater benefit. Additionally, the rescue effect of Txnip depends on lactate dehydrogenase b (Ldhb), and correlates with the presence of healthier mitochondria, suggesting that Txnip saves RP cones by enhancing their lactate catabolism.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66181</link>
	<content:encoded>Clamp loaders are AAA+ ATPases that load sliding clamps onto DNA. We mapped the mutational sensitivity of the T4 bacteriophage sliding clamp and clamp loader by deep mutagenesis, and found that residues not involved in catalysis or binding display remarkable tolerance to mutation. An exception is a glutamine residue in the AAA+ module (Gln 118) that is not located at a catalytic or interfacial site. Gln 118 forms a hydrogen-bonded junction in a helical unit that we term the central coupler, because it connects the catalytic centers to DNA and the sliding clamp. A suppressor mutation indicates that hydrogen bonding in the junction is important, and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that it maintains rigidity in the central coupler. The glutamine-mediated junction is preserved in diverse AAA+ ATPases, suggesting that a connected network of hydrogen bonds that links ATP molecules is an essential aspect of allosteric communication in these proteins.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65266</link>
	<content:encoded>Despite the high burden of pain experienced by hospitalised neonates there are few analgesics with proven efficacy. Testing analgesics in neonates is experimentally and ethically challenging and minimising the number of neonates required to demonstrate efficacy is essential. EEG-derived measures of noxious-evoked brain activity can be used to assess analgesic efficacy, however, as variability exists in neonate's responses to painful procedures, large sample sizes are often required. Here we present a novel experimental paradigm to account for individual differences in noxious-evoked baseline sensitivity which can be used to improve the design of analgesic trials in neonates. The paradigm is developed and tested across four observational studies using clinical, experimental and simulated data (92 neonates). We provide evidence of the efficacy of gentle brushing and paracetamol, substantiating the need for randomised controlled trials of these interventions. This work provides an important step towards safe, cost-effective clinical trials of analgesics in neonates.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63349</link>
	<content:encoded>Septins are conserved cytoskeletal proteins that regulate cell cortex mechanics. The mechanisms of their interactions with the plasma membrane remain poorly understood. Here we show by cell-free reconstitution that binding to flat lipid membranes requires electrostatic interactions of septins with anionic lipids and promotes the ordered self-assembly of fly septins into filamentous meshworks. Transmission electron microscopy reveals that both fly and mammalian septin hexamers form arrays of single and paired filaments. Atomic force microscopy and quartz crystal microbalance demonstrate that the fly filaments form mechanically rigid, 12 to 18 nm thick, double layers of septins. By contrast, C-terminally truncated septin mutants form 4 nm thin monolayers, indicating that stacking requires the C-terminal coiled coils on DSep2 and Pnut subunits. Our work shows that membrane binding is required for fly septins to form ordered arrays of single and paired filaments and provides new insights into the mechanisms by which septins may regulate cell surface mechanics.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/62653</link>
	<content:encoded>Somatic cells age and die, but the germ-cell lineage is immortal. In &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;, germline immortality involves proteostasis renewal at the beginning of each new generation, when oocyte maturation signals from sperm trigger the clearance of carbonylated proteins and protein aggregates. Here, we explore the cell biology of this proteostasis renewal in the context of a whole-genome RNAi screen. Oocyte maturation signals are known to trigger protein-aggregate removal via lysosome acidification. Our findings suggest that lysosomes are acidified as a consequence of changes in endoplasmic reticulum activity that permit assembly of the lysosomal V-ATPase, which in turn allows lysosomes to clear the aggregates via microautophagy. We define two functions for mitochondria, both of which appear to be independent of ATP generation. Many genes from the screen also regulate lysosome acidification and age-dependent protein aggregation in the soma, suggesting a fundamental mechanistic link between proteostasis renewal in the germline and somatic longevity.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Aging is associated with complex molecular and cellular processes that are poorly understood. Here we leveraged the Tabula Muris Senis single-cell RNA-seq data set to systematically characterize gene expression changes during aging across diverse cell types in the mouse. We identified aging-dependent genes in 76 tissue-cell types from 23 tissues and characterized both shared and tissue-cell-specific aging behaviors. We found that the aging-related genes shared by multiple tissue-cell types also change their expression congruently in the same direction during aging in most tissue-cell types, suggesting a coordinated global aging behavior at the organismal level. Scoring cells based on these shared aging genes allowed us to contrast the aging status of different tissues and cell types from a transcriptomic perspective. In addition, we identified genes that exhibit age-related expression changes specific to each functional category of tissue-cell types. Altogether, our analyses provide one of the most comprehensive and systematic characterizations of the molecular signatures of aging across diverse tissue-cell types in a mammalian system.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61172</link>
	<content:encoded>Aneuploidy causes birth defects and miscarriages, occurs in nearly all cancers and is a hallmark of aging. Individual aneuploid cells can be eliminated from developing tissues by unknown mechanisms. Cells with ribosomal protein (&lt;i&gt;Rp&lt;/i&gt;) gene mutations are also eliminated, by cell competition with normal cells. Because &lt;i&gt;Rp&lt;/i&gt; genes are spread across the genome, their copy number is a potential marker for aneuploidy. We found that elimination of imaginal disc cells with irradiation-induced genome damage often required cell competition genes. Segmentally aneuploid cells derived from targeted chromosome excisions were eliminated by the RpS12-Xrp1 cell competition pathway if they differed from neighboring cells in &lt;i&gt;Rp&lt;/i&gt; gene dose, whereas cells with normal doses of the &lt;i&gt;Rp&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;eIF2γ&lt;/i&gt; genes survived and differentiated adult tissues. Thus, cell competition, triggered by differences in &lt;i&gt;Rp&lt;/i&gt; gene dose between cells, is a significant mechanism for the elimination of aneuploid somatic cells, likely to contribute to preventing cancer.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59826</link>
	<content:encoded>Previous studies have identified a crucial role of the gut microbiome in modifying Alzheimer’s disease (AD) progression. However, the mechanisms of microbiome–brain interaction in AD were so far unknown. Here, we identify microbiota-derived short chain fatty acids (SCFA) as microbial metabolites which promote Aβ deposition. Germ-free (GF) AD mice exhibit a substantially reduced Aβ plaque load and markedly reduced SCFA plasma concentrations; conversely, SCFA supplementation to GF AD mice increased the Aβ plaque load to levels of conventionally colonized (specific pathogen-free [SPF]) animals and SCFA supplementation to SPF mice even further exacerbated plaque load. This was accompanied by the pronounced alterations in microglial transcriptomic profile, including upregulation of ApoE. Despite increased microglial recruitment to Aβ plaques upon SCFA supplementation, microglia contained less intracellular Aβ. Taken together, our results demonstrate that microbiota-derived SCFA are critical mediators along the gut-brain axis which promote Aβ deposition likely via modulation of the microglial phenotype.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58791</link>
	<content:encoded>Gene drives for mosquito population replacement are promising tools for malaria control. However, there is currently no clear pathway for safely testing such tools in endemic countries. The lack of well-characterized promoters for infection-relevant tissues and regulatory hurdles are further obstacles for their design and use. Here we explore how minimal genetic modifications of endogenous mosquito genes can convert them directly into non-autonomous gene drives without disrupting their expression. We co-opted the native regulatory sequences of three midgut-specific loci of the malaria vector &lt;i&gt;Anopheles gambiae&lt;/i&gt; to host a prototypical antimalarial molecule and guide-RNAs encoded within artificial introns that support efficient gene drive. We assess the propensity of these modifications to interfere with the development of &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; and their effect on fitness. Because of their inherent simplicity and passive mode of drive such traits could form part of an acceptable testing pathway of gene drives for malaria eradication.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Chemogenetic manipulation of astrocytic signaling in the basolateral amygdala reduces binge‐like alcohol consumption in male mice</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24841?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Binge ethanol activates astrocytes resulting in an increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity (red) in the basolateral amygdala. When astrocytic receptor signaling was activated using GFAP‐Gq‐GPCR designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs, it decreased ethanol consumption and ameliorated alcohol‐induced depression of glutamate in the amygdala.

Abstract
Binge drinking is a common occurrence in the United States, but a high concentration of alcohol in the blood has been shown to have reinforcing and reciprocal effects on the neuroimmune system in both dependent and non‐dependent scenarios. The first part of this study examined alcohol's effects on the astrocytic response in the central amygdala and basolateral amygdala (BLA) in a non‐dependent model. C57BL/6J mice were given access to either ethanol, water, or sucrose during a “drinking in the dark” paradigm, and astrocyte number and astrogliosis were measured using immunohistochemistry. Results indicate that non‐dependent consumption increased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) density but not the number of GFAP+ cells, suggesting that non‐dependent ethanol is sufficient to elicit astrocyte activation. The second part of this study examined how astrocytes impacted behaviors and the neurochemistry related to alcohol using the chemogenetic tool, DREADDs (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs). Transgenic GFAP‐hM3Dq mice were administered clozapine N‐oxide both peripherally, affecting the entire central nervous system (CNS), or directly into the BLA. In both instances, GFAP‐Gq‐signaling activation significantly reduced ethanol consumption and correlating blood ethanol concentrations. However, GFAP‐Gq‐DREADD activation throughout the CNS had more broad effects resulting in decreased locomotor activity and sucrose consumption. More targeted GFAP‐Gq‐signaling activation in the BLA only impacted ethanol consumption. Finally, a glutamate assay revealed that after GFAP‐Gq‐signaling activation glutamate concentrations in the amygdala were partially normalized to control levels. Altogether, these studies support the theory that astrocytes represent a viable target for alcohol use disorder therapies.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Structural differences in the hippocampus and amygdala of behaviorally inhibited macaque monkeys</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23329?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Behavioral inhibition is a temperamental disposition to react warily when confronted by unfamiliar people, objects, or events. Behaviorally inhibited children are at greater risk of developing anxiety disorders later in life. Previous studies reported that individuals with a history of childhood behavioral inhibition exhibit abnormal activity in the hippocampus and amygdala. However, few studies have investigated the structural differences that may underlie these functional abnormalities. In this exploratory study, we evaluated rhesus monkeys exhibiting a phenotype consistent with human behavioral inhibition. We performed quantitative neuroanatomical analyses that cannot be performed in humans including estimates of the volume and neuron number of distinct hippocampal regions and amygdala nuclei in behaviorally inhibited and control rhesus monkeys. Behaviorally inhibited monkeys had larger volumes of the rostral third of the hippocampal field CA3, smaller volumes of the rostral third of CA2, and smaller volumes of the accessory basal nucleus of the amygdala. Furthermore, behaviorally inhibited monkeys had fewer neurons in the rostral third of CA2. These structural differences may contribute to the functional abnormalities in the hippocampus and amygdala of behaviorally inhibited individuals. These structural findings in monkeys are consistent with a reduced modulation of amygdala activity via prefrontal cortex projections to the accessory basal nucleus. Given the putative roles of the amygdala in affective processing, CA3 in associative learning and CA2 in social memory, increased amygdala and CA3 activity, and diminished CA2 structure and function, may be associated with increased social anxiety and the heritability of behavioral inhibition. The findings from this exploratory study compel follow‐up investigations with larger sample sizes and additional analyses to provide greater insight and more definitive answers regarding the neurobiological bases of behavioral inhibition.</content:encoded>

Sperm of marine invertebrates have to find eggs cells in the ocean. Turbulent flows mix sperm and egg cells up to the millimeter scale; below this, active swimming and chemotaxis become important. Previous work addressed either turbulent mixing or chemotaxis in still water. Here, we present a general theory of sperm chemotaxis inside the smallest eddies of turbulent flow, where signaling molecules released by egg cells are spread into thin concentration filaments. Sperm cells ‘surf’ along these filaments towards the egg. External flows make filaments longer, but also thinner. These opposing effects set an optimal flow strength. The optimum predicted by our theory matches flow measurements in shallow coastal waters. Our theory quantitatively agrees with two previous fertilization experiments in Taylor-Couette chambers and provides a mechanistic understanding of these early experiments. ‘Surfing along concentration filaments’ could be a paradigm for navigation in complex environments in the presence of turbulent flow.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fSpDhUKA9NQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

A game of rock-paper-scissors is an interesting example of an interaction where none of the pure strategies strictly dominates all others, leading to a cyclic pattern. In this work, we consider an unstable version of rock-paper-scissors dynamics and allow individuals to make behavioural mistakes during the strategy execution. We show that such an assumption can break a cyclic relationship leading to a stable equilibrium emerging with only one strategy surviving. We consider two cases: completely random mistakes when individuals have no bias towards any strategy and a general form of mistakes. Then, we determine conditions for a strategy to dominate all other strategies. However, given that individuals who adopt a dominating strategy are still prone to behavioural mistakes in the observed behaviour, we may still observe extinct strategies. That is, behavioural mistakes in strategy execution stabilise evolutionary dynamics leading to an evolutionary stable and, potentially, mixed co-existence equilibrium.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wMx6qU8nMMc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Chemical insecticides have been heavily employed as the most effective measure for control of agricultural and medical pests, but evolution of resistance by pests threatens the sustainability of this approach. Resistance-conferring mutations sometimes impose fitness costs, which may drive subsequent evolution of compensatory modifier mutations alleviating the costs of resistance. However, how modifier mutations evolve and function to overcome the fitness cost of resistance still remains unknown. Here we show that overexpression of P450s not only confers imidacloprid resistance in the brown planthopper, &lt;i&gt;Nilaparvata lugens&lt;/i&gt;, the most voracious pest of rice, but also leads to elevated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through metabolism of imidacloprid and host plant compounds. The inevitable production of ROS incurs a fitness cost to the pest, which drives the increase or fixation of the compensatory modifier allele T65549 within the promoter region of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;lugens peroxiredoxin&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;NlPrx&lt;/i&gt;) in the pest populations. T65549 allele in turn upregulates the expression of &lt;i&gt;NlPrx&lt;/i&gt; and thus increases resistant individuals’ ability to clear the cost-incurring ROS of any source. The frequent involvement of P450s in insecticide resistance and their capacity to produce ROS while metabolizing their substrates suggest that peroxiredoxin or other ROS-scavenging genes may be among the common modifier genes for alleviating the fitness cost of insecticide resistance.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/7kTY1Rr0DG4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Sarcomeres, the basic contractile units of striated muscle cells, contain arrays of thin (actin) and thick (myosin) filaments that slide past each other during contraction. The Ig-like domain-containing protein myotilin provides structural integrity to Z-discs—the boundaries between adjacent sarcomeres. Myotilin binds to Z-disc components, including F-actin and α-actinin-2, but the molecular mechanism of binding and implications of these interactions on Z-disc integrity are still elusive. To illuminate them, we used a combination of small-angle X-ray scattering, cross-linking mass spectrometry, and biochemical and molecular biophysics approaches. We discovered that myotilin displays conformational ensembles in solution. We generated a structural model of the F-actin:myotilin complex that revealed how myotilin interacts with and stabilizes F-actin via its Ig-like domains and flanking regions. Mutant myotilin designed with impaired F-actin binding showed increased dynamics in cells. Structural analyses and competition assays uncovered that myotilin displaces tropomyosin from F-actin. Our findings suggest a novel role of myotilin as a co-organizer of Z-disc assembly and advance our mechanistic understanding of myotilin’s structural role in Z-discs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Z5geBhqQbs4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Characterization of the Insular Role in Cardiac Function through Intracranial Electrical Stimulation of the Human Insula</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26074?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
The link between brain function and cardiovascular dynamics is an important issue yet to be elucidated completely. The insula is a neocortical brain area that is thought to have a cardiac chronotropic regulatory function, but its role in cardiac contractility is unknown. We aimed to analyze the variability in heart rate and cardiac contractility after functional activation of different insular regions through direct electrical stimulation (E‐stim) in humans.


Methods
This was an observational, prospective study, including patients admitted for stereo‐electroencephalographic recording because of refractory epilepsy, in whom the insular cortex was implanted. Patients with anatomical or electrophysiological insular abnormalities and those in whom E‐stim produced subjective symptoms were excluded. Variations in heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV), and cardiac output (CO) were analyzed during insular E‐stim and compared with control E‐stim of non‐eloquent brain regions and sham stimulations.


Results
Ten patients were included, 5 implanted in the right insula (52 E‐stim) and 5 in the left (37 E‐stim). Demographic and clinical characteristics of both groups were similar. E‐stim of both right and left insulas induced a significant decrease of the CO and HR, and an increase of the SV. E‐stim of control electrodes and sham stimulations were not associated with variations in cardiac function. Blood pressure and respiratory rate remained unaltered.


Interpretation
Our results suggest a direct chronotropic and inotropic cardiac depressor function of the right and left insulas. The evidence of an insular direct cardiac regulatory function might open a path in the prevention or treatment of heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy.

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Synaptic inputs to broad thorny ganglion cells in macaque retina</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25156?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>These are the identified wide‐field and medium‐field amacrine cells that made synapses onto a broad thorny ganglion cell (purple) in central macaque retina. The wide field amacrine cells included three wiry amacrine cells (green), a semilunar cell (aqua) and a stellate wavy cell (yellow). The medium‐field cells included a starburst amacrine cell (red) and a spiny amacrine cell (orange). These amacrine cell inputs are expected to mediate the responses of the broad thorny ganglion cells to stimuli outside their classical receptive fields.







Abstract
In primates, broad thorny retinal ganglion cells are highly sensitive to small, moving stimuli. They have tortuous, fine dendrites with many short, spine‐like branches that occupy three contiguous strata in the middle of the inner plexiform layer. The neural circuits that generate their responses to moving stimuli are not well‐understood, and that was the goal of this study. A connectome from central macaque retina was generated by serial block‐face scanning electron microscopy, a broad thorny cell was reconstructed, and its synaptic inputs were analyzed. It received fewer than 2% of its inputs from both ON and OFF types of bipolar cells; the vast majority of its inputs were from amacrine cells. The presynaptic amacrine cells were reconstructed, and seven types were identified based on their characteristic morphology. Two types of narrow‐field cells, knotty bistratified type 1 and wavy multistratified type 2, were identified. Two types of medium‐field amacrine cells, ON starburst and spiny, were also presynaptic to the broad thorny cell. Three types of wide‐field amacrine cells, wiry type 2, stellate wavy and semilunar type 2, also made synapses onto the broad thorny cell. Physiological experiments using a macaque retinal preparation in vitro confirmed that broad thorny cells received robust excitatory input from both the ON and the OFF pathways. Given the paucity of bipolar cell inputs, it is likely that amacrine cells provided much of the excitatory input, in addition to inhibitory input.

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Changes in concentrations of NMDA receptor subunit GluN2B, Arc and syntaxin‐1 in dorsal hippocampus Schaffer collateral synapses in a rat learned helplessness model of depression</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25155?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Long‐term stress is linked to depression in humans. We used a rat learned helplessness model of depression to study the effects on synaptic proteins important for plasticity. With quantitative immunogold EM we show an increase in NMDA receptor subunit GluN2B in the PSD of excitatory synapses in CA1 area of hippocampus.






Abstract
Major depressive disorder involves changes in synaptic structure and function, but the molecular underpinnings of these changes are still not established. In an initial pilot experiment, whole‐brain synaptosome screening with quantitative western blotting was performed to identify synaptic proteins that may show concentration changes in a congenital rat learned helplessness model of depression. We found that the N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subunits GluN2A/GluN2B, activity‐regulated cytoskeleton‐associated protein (Arc) and syntaxin‐1 showed significant concentration differences between congenitally learned helpless (LH) and non‐learned helpless (NLH) rats. Having identified these three proteins, we then performed more elaborate quantitative immunogold electron microscopic analyses of the proteins in a specific synapse type in the dorsal hippocampus: the Schaffer collateral synapse in the CA1 region. We expanded the setup to include also un‐stressed wild‐type (WT) rats. The concentrations of the proteins in the LH and NLH groups were compared to WT animals. In this specific synapse, we found that the concentration of NMDARs was increased in postsynaptic spines in both LH and NLH rats. The concentration of Arc was significantly increased in postsynaptic densities in LH animals as well as in presynaptic cytoplasm of NLH rats. The concentration of syntaxin‐1 was significantly increased in both presynaptic terminals and postsynaptic spines in LH animals, while pre‐ and postsynaptic syntaxin‐1 concentrations were significantly decreased in NLH animals. These protein changes suggest pathways by which synaptic plasticity may be increased in dorsal hippocampal Schaffer collateral synapses during depression, corresponding to decreased synaptic stability.

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Suppression head impulse test paradigm (SHIMP) characteristics in people with Parkinson’s disease compared to healthy controls</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00221-021-06107-7</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The suppression head impulse test paradigm (SHIMP) is a newly described indicator of vestibular function which yields two measures: vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) gain and a saccadic response. It is an alternative and complementary test to the head impulse test paradigm (HIMP). Parkinson’s disease (PD) has known saccadic and central vestibular pathway dysfunction. This paper is the first description of SHIMP VOR gain and saccade characteristic in this population. This prospective observational study measured the SHIMP VOR gain and saccade characteristics in 39 participants with idiopathic PD and compared this to 40 healthy controls (HC). The effect of group, demographic variables and SHIMP characteristics were evaluated. SHIMP VOR gains were not significantly different between groups (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.10). Compared to HC, the PD group mean SHIMP peak saccade velocity was significantly reduced by an average of 77.07°/sec (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), and SHIMP saccade response latency was longer, with an average delay of 23.5 ms (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.003). SHIMP saccade peak velocity was also associated with both head impulse velocity (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.002) and SHIMP VOR gain (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.004) variables, but there was no significant influence of these variables when SHIMP saccade peak velocity was considered as a predictor of PD (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.52–0.91). VOR gains were unaffected by PD. PD-specific saccadic dysfunction, namely reduced peak saccade velocities and prolonged response latencies, were observed in the SHIMP-induced saccade responses. VOR gain using slow phase eye velocity is preferred as the indicator of vestibular function in the SHIMPs paradigm as non-vestibular factors affected saccade peak velocity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Identification of Two Novel Peptides That Inhibit α-Synuclein Toxicity and Aggregation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.659926</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aggregation of α-synuclein (αSyn) into proteinaceous deposits is a pathological hallmark of a range of neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson’s disease (PD). Numerous lines of evidence indicate that the accumulation of toxic oligomeric and prefibrillar αSyn species may underpin the cellular toxicity and spread of pathology between cells. Therefore, aggregation of αSyn is considered a priority target for drug development, as aggregation inhibitors are expected to reduce αSyn toxicity and serve as therapeutic agents. Here, we used the budding yeast S. cerevisiae as a platform for the identification of short peptides that inhibit αSyn aggregation and toxicity. A library consisting of approximately one million peptide variants was utilized in two high-throughput screening approaches for isolation of library representatives that reduce αSyn-associated toxicity and aggregation. Seven peptides were isolated that were able to suppress specifically αSyn toxicity and aggregation in living cells. Expression of the peptides in yeast reduced the accumulation of αSyn-induced reactive oxygen species and increased cell viability. Next, the peptides were chemically synthesized and probed for their ability to modulate αSyn aggregation in vitro. Two synthetic peptides, K84s and K102s, of 25 and 19 amino acids, respectively, significantly inhibited αSyn oligomerization and aggregation at sub-stoichiometric molar ratios. Importantly, K84s reduced αSyn aggregation in human cells. These peptides represent promising αSyn aggregation antagonists for the development of future therapeutic interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Artemin Is Upregulated by TrkB Agonist and Protects the Immature Retina Against Hypoxic-Ischemic Injury by Suppressing Neuroinflammation and Astrogliosis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.645000</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hypoxic-ischemia (HI) is a major cause of acquired visual impairment in children from developed countries. Previous studies have shown that systemic administration of 7,8-dihydroxyavone (DHF), a selective tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) agonist, provides long-term neuroprotection against HI injury in an immature retina. However, the target genes and the mechanisms of the neuroprotective effects of TrkB signaling are not known. In the present study, we induced an HI retinal injury through unilateral common carotid artery ligation followed by 8% oxygen for 2 h in P7 rat pups. DHF was administered intraperitoneally 2 h before and 18 h after the HI injury. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array was used to identify the target genes upregulated after the DHF treatment, which was then confirmed with quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR and a western blot. Effects of the downstream mediator of DHF were assessed using an intravitreal injection of neutralizing antibody 4 h after DHF administration (24 h after HI). Meanwhile, the target protein was injected into the vitreous 24 h after HI to validate its protective effect when exogenously supplemented. We found that systemic DHF treatment after HI significantly increased the expression of the artemin (ARTN) gene and protein at P8 and P10, respectively. The neuroprotective effects of DHF were inhibited after the ARTN protein blockade, with an increase in neuroinflammation and astrogliosis. ARTN treatment showed long-term protection against HI injury at both the histopathological and functional levels. The neuroprotective effects of ARTN were related to a decrease in microglial activation at P17 and attenuation of astrogliosis at P29. ARTN enhances phosphorylation of RET, ERK, and JNK, but not AKT or p38 in the immature retina. Altogether, these results suggest that the neuroprotective effect of a TrkB agonist is partially exerted through a mechanism that involves ARTN because the protective effect is ameliorated by ARTN sequestration. ARTN treatment after HI injury protects the immature retina by attenuating late neuroinflammation and astrogliosis in the immature retina relating to the ARTN/RET/JNK/ERK signaling pathway. ARTN may be a strategy by which to provide long-term protection in the immature retina against HI injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Daytime Restricted Feeding Affects Day–Night Variations in Mouse Cerebellar Proteome</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.613161</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The cerebellum harbors a circadian clock that can be shifted by scheduled mealtime and participates in behavioral anticipation of food access. Large-scale two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) combined with mass spectrometry was used to identify day–night variations in the cerebellar proteome of mice fed either during daytime or nighttime. Experimental conditions led to modified expression of 89 cerebellar proteins contained in 63 protein spots. Five and 33 spots were changed respectively by time-of-day or feeding conditions. Strikingly, several proteins of the heat-shock protein family (i.e., Hsp90aa1, 90ab1, 90b1, and Hspa2, 4, 5, 8, 9) were down-regulated in the cerebellum of daytime food-restricted mice. This was also the case for brain fatty acid protein (Fabp7) and enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (Ndufs1) or folate metabolism (Aldh1l1). In contrast, aldolase C (Aldoc or zebrin II) and pyruvate carboxylase (Pc), two enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, and vesicle-fusing ATPase (Nsf) were up-regulated during daytime restricted feeding, possibly reflecting increased neuronal activity. Significant feeding × time-of-day interactions were found for changes in the intensity of 20 spots. Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(o) subunit alpha (Gnao1) was more expressed in the cerebellum before food access. Neuronal calcium-sensor proteins [i.e., parvalbumin (Pvalb) and visinin-like protein 1 (Vsnl1)] were inversely regulated in daytime food-restricted mice, compared to control mice fed at night. Furthermore, expression of three enzymes modulating the circadian clockwork, namely heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (Hnrnpk), serine/threonine-protein phosphatases 1 (Ppp1cc and Ppp1cb subunits) and 5 (Ppp5), was differentially altered by daytime restricted feeding. Besides cerebellar proteins affected only by feeding conditions or daily cues, specific changes in in protein abundance before food access may be related to behavioral anticipation of food access and/or feeding-induced shift of the cerebellar clockwork.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Altered Relationship Between Parvalbumin and Perineuronal Nets in an Autism Model</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.597812</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Altered function or presence of inhibitory neurons is documented in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), but the mechanism underlying this alternation is poorly understood. One major subtype of inhibitory neurons altered is the parvalbumin (PV)-containing neurons with reduced density and intensity in ASD patients and model mice. A subpopulation of PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons expresses perineuronal nets (PNN). To better understand whether the relationship between PV and PNN is altered in ASD, we measured quantitatively the intensities of PV and PNN in single PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons in the prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PrL-PFC) of a valproic acid (VPA) model of ASD at different ages. We found a decreased PV intensity but increased PNN intensity in VPA mice. The relationship between PV and PNN intensities is altered in VPA mice, likely due to an “abnormal” subpopulation of neurons with an altered PV-PNN relationship. Furthermore, reducing PNN level using in vivo injection of chondroitinase ABC corrects the PV expression in adult VPA mice. We suggest that the interaction between PV and PNN is disrupted in PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons in VPA mice which may contribute to the pathology in ASD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: The Neuroprotective Beta Amyloid Hexapeptide Core Reverses Deficits in Synaptic Plasticity in the 5xFAD APP/PS1 Mouse Model</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.576038</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the aging population. Evidence implicates elevated soluble oligomeric Aβ as one of the primary triggers during the prodromic phase leading to AD, effected largely via hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau. At low, physiological levels (pM-nM), however, oligomeric Aβ has been found to regulate synaptic plasticity as a neuromodulator. Through mutational analysis, we found a core hexapeptide sequence within the N-terminal domain of Aβ (N-Aβcore) accounting for its physiological activity, and subsequently found that the N-Aβcore peptide is neuroprotective. Here, we characterized the neuroprotective potential of the N-Aβcore against dysfunction of synaptic plasticity assessed in ex vivo hippocampal slices from 5xFAD APP/PS1 mice, specifically hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). The N-Aβcore was shown to reverse impairment in synaptic plasticity in hippocampal slices from 5xFAD APP/PS1 model mice, both for LTP and LTD. The reversal by the N-Aβcore correlated with alleviation of downregulation of hippocampal AMPA-type glutamate receptors in preparations from 5xFAD mice. The action of the N-Aβcore depended upon a critical di-histidine sequence and involved the phosphoinositide-3 (PI3) kinase pathway via mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). Together, the present findings indicate that the non-toxic N-Aβcore hexapeptide is not only neuroprotective at the cellular level but is able to reverse synaptic dysfunction in AD-like models, specifically alterations in synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural interfacing devices using penetrating microelectrode arrays have emerged as an important tool in both neuroscience research and medical applications. These implantable microelectrode arrays enable communication between man-made devices and the nervous system by detecting and/or evoking neuronal activities.

Compared to electrodes fabricated using rigid materials and larger cross-sections, these microfiber electrodes have been shown to reduce foreign body responses after implantation, with improved signal-to-noise ratio for neural recording and enhanced resolution for neural stimulation. Here, we review recent progress of carbon-based microfiber electrodes in terms of material composition and fabrication technology. The remaining challenges and future directions for development of these arrays will also be discussed. Overall, these microfiber electrodes are expected to improve the longevity and reliability of neural interfacing devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In neurodegenerative diseases, neurodegeneration has been related to several mitochondrial dynamics imbalances such as excessive fragmentation of mitochondria, impaired mitophagy, and blocked mitochondria mitochondrial transport in axons. Mitochondria are dynamic organelles, and essential for energy conversion, neuron survival, and cell death. As mitochondrial dynamics have a significant influence on homeostasis, in this review, we mainly discuss the role of mitochondrial dynamics in several neurodegenerative diseases. There is evidence that several mitochondrial dynamics-associated proteins, as well as related pathways, have roles in the pathological process of neurodegenerative diseases with an impact on mitochondrial functions and metabolism. However, specific pathological mechanisms need to be better understood in order to propose new therapeutic strategies targeting mitochondrial dynamics that have shown promise in recent studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Boosting Multilabel Semantic Segmentation for Somata and Vessels in Mouse Brain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.610122</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) are widely utilized for the semantic segmentation of dense nerve tissues from light and electron microscopy (EM) image data; the goal of this technique is to achieve efficient and accurate three-dimensional reconstruction of the vasculature and neural networks in the brain. The success of these tasks heavily depends on the amount, and especially the quality, of the human-annotated labels fed into DCNNs. However, it is often difficult to acquire the gold standard of human-annotated labels for dense nerve tissues; human annotations inevitably contain discrepancies or even errors, which substantially impact the performance of DCNNs. Thus, a novel boosting framework consisting of a DCNN for multilabel semantic segmentation with a customized Dice-logarithmic loss function, a fusion module combining the annotated labels and the corresponding predictions from the DCNN, and a boosting algorithm to sequentially update the sample weights during network training iterations was proposed to systematically improve the quality of the annotated labels; this framework eventually resulted in improved segmentation task performance. The microoptical sectioning tomography (MOST) dataset was then employed to assess the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The result indicated that the framework, even trained with a dataset including some poor-quality human-annotated labels, achieved state-of-the-art performance in the segmentation of somata and vessels in the mouse brain. Thus, the proposed technique of artificial intelligence could advance neuroscience research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Baseline Cerebral Ischemic Core Quantified by Different Automatic Software and Its Predictive Value for Clinical Outcome</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.608799</link>
	<content:encoded>Purpose&lt;p&gt;This study aims to investigate the agreement of three software packages in measuring baseline ischemic core volume (ICV) and penumbra volume (PV), and determine their predictive values for unfavorable clinical outcome in patients with endovascular thrombectomy (EVT).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Patients with acute ischemic stroke who underwent computed tomographic perfusion (CTP) were recruited. Baseline CTP measurements including ICV and PV were calculated by three software packages of IntelliSpace Portal (ISP), Rapid Processing of Perfusion and Diffusion (RAPID), and fast-processing of ischemic stroke (F-STROKE). All patients received EVT, and the modified Rankin scale (mRS) at 90 days after EVT was assessed to determine the clinical outcomes (favorable: mRS = 0–2; unfavorable: mRS = 3–6). The agreement of CTP measurements among three software packages was determined using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The associations between CTP measurements and unfavorable clinical outcome were analyzed using logistic regression. Receiver operating characteristic curves were conducted to calculate the area under the curve (AUC) of CTP measurements in predicting unfavorable clinical outcome.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Of 223 recruited patients (68.2 ± 11.3 years old; 145 males), 17.0% had unfavorable clinical outcome after EVT. Excellent agreement between F-STROKE and RAPID was found in measuring ICV (ICC 0.965; 95% CI 0.956–0.973) and PV (ICC 0.966; 95% CI 0.956–0.973). ICVs measured by three software packages were significantly associated with unfavorable clinical outcome before (odds ratios 1.012–1.018, all P &amp;lt; 0.01) and after (odds ratios 1.003–1.014, all P &amp;lt; 0.05) adjusted for confounding factors (age, gender, TOAST classification, and NIHSS on admission). In predicting unfavorable clinical outcome, ICV measured by F-STROKE showed similar performance to that measured by RAPID (AUC 0.701 vs. 0.717) but higher performance than that measured by ISP (AUC 0.629).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusions&lt;p&gt;The software of F-STROKE has excellent agreement with the widely used analysis tool of RAPID in measuring ICV and PV. The ischemic core volume measured by both F-STROKE and RAPID is a stronger predictor for unfavorable clinical outcome after EVT compared to ISP.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Prevalence and Therapy Rates for Stuttering, Cluttering, and Developmental Disorders of Speech and Language: Evaluation of German Health Insurance Data</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.645292</link>
	<content:encoded>Purpose&lt;p&gt;To evaluate the prevalence and treatment patterns of speech and language disorders in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A retrospective analysis of data collected from 32% of the German population, insured by the statutory German health insurance (AOK, Local Health Care Funds). We used The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th revision, German Modification (ICD-10 GM) codes for stuttering (F98.5), cluttering (F98.6), and developmental disorders of speech and language (F80) to identify prevalent and newly diagnosed cases each year. Prescription and speech therapy reimbursement data were used to evaluate treatment patterns.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;In 2017, 27,977 patients of all ages were diagnosed with stuttering (21,045 males, 75% and 6,932 females, 25%). Stuttering prevalence peaks at age 5 years (boys, 0.89% and girls, 0.40%). Cluttering was diagnosed in 1,800 patients of all ages (1,287 males, 71.5% and 513 females, 28.5%). Developmental disorders of speech and language were identified in 555,774 AOK-insurants (61.2% males and 38.8% females). Treatment data indicate a substantial proportion newly diagnosed stuttering individuals receive treatment (up to 45% of 6-year-old patients), with slightly fewer than 20 sessions per year, on average. We confirmed a previous study showing increased rates of atopic disorders and neurological and psychiatric comorbidities in individuals with stuttering, cluttering, and developmental disorders of speech and language.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This is the first nationwide study using health insurance data to analyze the prevalence and newly diagnosed cases of a speech and language disorder. Prevalence and gender ratio data were consistent with the international literature. The crude prevalence of developmental disorders of speech and language increased from 2015 to 2018, whereas the crude prevalence for stuttering remained stable. For cluttering, the numbers were too low to draw reliable conclusions. Proportional treatment allocation for stuttering peaked at 6 years of age, which is the school entrance year, and is later than the prevalence peak of stuttering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Alteration in Resting-State EEG Microstates Following 24 Hours of Total Sleep Deprivation in Healthy Young Male Subjects</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.636252</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Purpose: The cognitive effects of total sleep deprivation (TSD) on the brain remain poorly understood. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a very useful tool for detecting spontaneous brain activity in the resting state. Quasi-stable electrical distributions, known as microstates, carry useful information about the dynamics of large-scale brain networks. In this study, microstate analysis was used to study changes in brain activity after 24 h of total sleep deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants and Methods: Twenty-seven healthy volunteers were recruited and underwent EEG scans before and after 24 h of TSD. Microstate analysis was applied, and six microstate classes (A–F) were identified. Topographies and temporal parameters of the microstates were compared between the rested wakefulness (RW) and TSD conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Microstate class A (a right-anterior to left-posterior orientation of the mapped field) showed lower global explained variance (GEV), frequency of occurrence, and time coverage in TSD than RW, whereas microstate class D (a fronto-central extreme location of the mapped field) displayed higher GEV, frequency of occurrence, and time coverage in TSD compared to RW. Moreover, subjective sleepiness was significantly negatively correlated with the microstate parameters of class A and positively correlated with the microstate parameters of class D. Transition analysis revealed that class B exhibited a higher probability of transition than did classes D and F in TSD compared to RW.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The observation suggests alterations of the dynamic brain-state properties of TSD in healthy young male subjects, which may serve as system-level neural underpinnings for cognitive declines in sleep-deprived subjects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Supervised Learning With First-to-Spike Decoding in Multilayer Spiking Neural Networks</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.617862</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Experimental studies support the notion of spike-based neuronal information processing in the brain, with neural circuits exhibiting a wide range of temporally-based coding strategies to rapidly and efficiently represent sensory stimuli. Accordingly, it would be desirable to apply spike-based computation to tackling real-world challenges, and in particular transferring such theory to neuromorphic systems for low-power embedded applications. Motivated by this, we propose a new supervised learning method that can train multilayer spiking neural networks to solve classification problems based on a rapid, first-to-spike decoding strategy. The proposed learning rule supports multiple spikes fired by stochastic hidden neurons, and yet is stable by relying on first-spike responses generated by a deterministic output layer. In addition to this, we also explore several distinct, spike-based encoding strategies in order to form compact representations of presented input data. We demonstrate the classification performance of the learning rule as applied to several benchmark datasets, including MNIST. The learning rule is capable of generalizing from the data, and is successful even when used with constrained network architectures containing few input and hidden layer neurons. Furthermore, we highlight a novel encoding strategy, termed “scanline encoding,” that can transform image data into compact spatiotemporal patterns for subsequent network processing. Designing constrained, but optimized, network structures and performing input dimensionality reduction has strong implications for neuromorphic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Automated in vivo Tracking of Cortical Oligodendrocytes</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.667595</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Oligodendrocytes exert a profound influence on neural circuits by accelerating action potential conduction, altering excitability, and providing metabolic support. As oligodendrogenesis continues in the adult brain and is essential for myelin repair, uncovering the factors that control their dynamics is necessary to understand the consequences of adaptive myelination and develop new strategies to enhance remyelination in diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Unfortunately, few methods exist for analysis of oligodendrocyte dynamics, and even fewer are suitable for in vivo investigation. Here, we describe the development of a fully automated cell tracking pipeline using convolutional neural networks (Oligo-Track) that provides rapid volumetric segmentation and tracking of thousands of cells over weeks in vivo. This system reliably replicated human analysis, outperformed traditional analytic approaches, and extracted injury and repair dynamics at multiple cortical depths, establishing that oligodendrogenesis after cuprizone-mediated demyelination is suppressed in deeper cortical layers. Volumetric data provided by this analysis revealed that oligodendrocyte soma size progressively decreases after their generation, and declines further prior to death, providing a means to predict cell age and eventual cell death from individual time points. This new CNN-based analysis pipeline offers a rapid, robust method to quantitatively analyze oligodendrocyte dynamics in vivo, which will aid in understanding how changes in these myelinating cells influence circuit function and recovery from injury and disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Cellular Prion Protein—ROCK Connection: Contribution to Neuronal Homeostasis and Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.660683</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Amyloid-based neurodegenerative diseases such as prion, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's diseases have distinct etiologies and clinical manifestations, but they share common pathological events. These diseases are caused by abnormally folded proteins (pathogenic prions PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt; in prion diseases, β-amyloids/Aβ and Tau in Alzheimer's disease, α-synuclein in Parkinson's disease) that display β-sheet-enriched structures, propagate and accumulate in the nervous central system, and trigger neuronal death. In prion diseases, PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt;-induced corruption of the physiological functions exerted by normal cellular prion proteins (PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;) present at the cell surface of neurons is at the root of neuronal death. For a decade, PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; emerges as a common cell surface receptor for other amyloids such as Aβ and α-synuclein, which relays, at least in part, their toxicity. In lipid-rafts of the plasma membrane, PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; exerts a signaling function and controls a set of effectors involved in neuronal homeostasis, among which are the RhoA-associated coiled-coil containing kinases (ROCKs). Here we review (i) how PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; controls ROCKs, (ii) how PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;-ROCK coupling contributes to neuronal homeostasis, and (iii) how the deregulation of the PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;-ROCK connection in amyloid-based neurodegenerative diseases triggers a loss of neuronal polarity, affects neurotransmitter-associated functions, contributes to the endoplasmic reticulum stress cascade, renders diseased neurons highly sensitive to neuroinflammation, and amplifies the production of neurotoxic amyloids.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Nucleolin Rescues TDP-43 Toxicity in Yeast and Human Cell Models</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.625665</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;TDP-43 is a nuclear protein involved in pivotal processes, extensively studied for its implication in neurodegenerative disorders. TDP-43 cytosolic inclusions are a common neuropathologic hallmark in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and related diseases, and it is now established that TDP-43 misfolding and aggregation play a key role in their etiopathology. TDP-43 neurotoxic mechanisms are not yet clarified, but the identification of proteins able to modulate TDP-43-mediated damage may be promising therapeutic targets for TDP-43 proteinopathies. Here we show by the use of refined yeast models that the nucleolar protein nucleolin (NCL) acts as a potent suppressor of TDP-43 toxicity, restoring cell viability. We provide evidence that NCL co-expression is able to alleviate TDP-43-induced damage also in human cells, further supporting its beneficial effects in a more consistent pathophysiological context. Presented data suggest that NCL could promote TDP-43 nuclear retention, reducing the formation of toxic cytosolic TDP-43 inclusions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Colonic Dopaminergic Neurons Changed Reversely With Those in the Midbrain via Gut Microbiota-Mediated Autophagy in a Chronic Parkinson’s Disease Mice Model</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.649627</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The role of gut-brain axis in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) have become a research hotspot, appropriate animal model to study gut-brain axis in PD is yet to be confirmed. Our study employed a classical PD mice model achieved by chronic MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) injection to study concurrent changes of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain and the colon of mice. Our results showed such a PD model exhibited apparent locomotor deficits but not gastrointestinal dysfunction. Tyrosine hydroxylase expressions and dopamine content reduced greatly in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) or striatum, but increased in the colon of PD mice. Mechanism investigation indicated autophagy activity and apoptosis were stimulated in the SNpc, but inhibited in the colon of PD mice. Interplay of gut microbiota (GM) and autophagy in response to chronic MPTP injection led to GM dysbiosis and defective autophagy in mice colon. Meanwhile, fecal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), acetate and propionate in particular, declined greatly in PD mice, which could be attributed to the decreased bacteria abundance of phylum Bacteroidetes, but increased abundance of phylum Firmicutes. GM dysbiosis derived fecal SCFAs might be one of the mediators of downregulated autophagy in the colon of PD mice. In conclusion, colonic dopaminergic neurons changed in the opposition direction with those in the midbrain via GM dysbiosis-mediated autophagy inhibition followed by suppressed apoptosis in response to chronic MPTP injection. Such a chronic PD mice model might not be an ideal model to study role of gut-brain axis in PD progression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Wearable Devices for Assessing Function in Alzheimer's Disease: A European Public Involvement Activity About the Features and Preferences of Patients and Caregivers</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.643135</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) impairs the ability to carry out daily activities, reduces independence and quality of life and increases caregiver burden. Our understanding of functional decline has traditionally relied on reports by family and caregivers, which are subjective and vulnerable to recall bias. The Internet of Things (IoT) and wearable sensor technologies promise to provide objective, affordable, and reliable means for monitoring and understanding function. However, human factors for its acceptance are relatively unexplored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: The Public Involvement (PI) activity presented in this paper aims to capture the preferences, priorities and concerns of people with AD and their caregivers for using monitoring wearables. Their feedback will drive device selection for clinical research, starting with the study of the RADAR-AD project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: The PI activity involved the Patient Advisory Board (PAB) of the RADAR-AD project, comprised of people with dementia across Europe and their caregivers (11 and 10, respectively). A set of four devices that optimally represent various combinations of aspects and features from the variety of currently available wearables (e.g., weight, size, comfort, battery life, screen types, water-resistance, and metrics) was presented and experienced hands-on. Afterwards, sets of cards were used to rate and rank devices and features and freely discuss preferences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Overall, the PAB was willing to accept and incorporate devices into their daily lives. For the presented devices, the aspects most important to them included comfort, convenience and affordability. For devices in general, the features they prioritized were appearance/style, battery life and water resistance, followed by price, having an emergency button and a screen with metrics. The metrics valuable to them included activity levels and heart rate, followed by respiration rate, sleep quality and distance. Some concerns were the potential complexity, forgetting to charge the device, the potential stigma and data privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The PI activity explored the preferences, priorities and concerns of the PAB, a group of people with dementia and caregivers across Europe, regarding devices for monitoring function and decline, after a hands-on experience and explanation. They highlighted some expected aspects, metrics and features (e.g., comfort and convenience), but also some less expected (e.g., screen with metrics).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Older Adults Show Reduced Spatial Precision but Preserved Strategy-Use During Spatial Navigation Involving Body-Based Cues</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.640188</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Older adults typically perform worse on spatial navigation tasks, although whether this is due to degradation of memory or an impairment in using specific strategies has yet to be determined. An issue with some past studies is that older adults are tested on desktop-based virtual reality: a technology many report lacking familiarity with. Even when controlling for familiarity, these paradigms reduce the information-rich, three-dimensional experience of navigating to a simple two-dimensional task that utilizes a mouse and keyboard (or joystick) as means for ambulation. Here, we utilize a wireless head-mounted display and free ambulation to create a fully immersive virtual Morris water maze in which we compare the navigation of older and younger adults. Older and younger adults learned the locations of hidden targets from same and different start points. Across different conditions tested, older adults remembered target locations less precisely compared to younger adults. Importantly, however, they performed comparably from the same viewpoint as a switched viewpoint, suggesting that they could generalize their memory for the location of a hidden target given a new point of view. When we implicitly moved one of the distal cues to determine whether older adults used an allocentric (multiple landmarks) or beaconing (single landmark) strategy to remember the hidden target, both older and younger adults showed comparable degrees of reliance on allocentric and beacon cues. These findings support the hypothesis that while older adults have less precise spatial memories, they maintain the ability to utilize various strategies when navigating.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and whether synthetic MRI can benefit diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials and Methods: Eighteen patients and eighteen age-matched normal controls (NCs) underwent MR examination. The mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores were obtained from all patients. The whole brain volumetric characteristics, T1, T2, and proton density (PD) values of different cortical and subcortical regions were obtained. The volumetric characteristics and brain regional relaxation values between AD patients and NCs were compared using independent-samples t-test. The correlations between these quantitative parameters and MMSE score were assessed by the Pearson correlation in AD patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Although the larger volume of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), lower brain parenchymal volume (BPV), and the ratio of brain parenchymal volume to intracranial volume (BPV/ICV) were found in AD patients compared with NCs, there were no significant differences (p &amp;gt; 0.05). T1 values of right insula cortex and T2 values of left hippocampus and right insula cortex were significantly higher in AD patients than in NCs, but T1 values of left caudate showed a reverse trend (p &amp;lt; 0.05). As the MMSE score decreased in AD patients, the BPV and BPV/ICV decreased, while the volume of CSF and T1 values of bilateral insula cortex and bilateral hippocampus as well as T2 values of bilateral hippocampus increased (p &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Synthetic MRI not only provides more information to differentiate AD patients from normal controls, but also reflects the disease severity of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.621619</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Olfactory impairment (OI) refers to decreased (hyposmia) or absent (anosmia) ability to smell. We sought to estimate the prevalence and correlates of OI among rural-dwelling Chinese older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: This population-based cross-sectional analysis included 4,514 participants (age ≥65 years; 56.7% women) from the Multidomain Interventions to Delay Dementia and Disability in Rural China (MIND-China). The 16-item Sniffin' Sticks identification test (SSIT) was used to assess olfactory function. Olfactory impairment was defined as the SSIT score ≤10, hyposmia as SSIT score of 8–10, and anosmia as SSIT score &amp;lt;8. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine factors associated with OI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The overall prevalence was 67.7% for OI, 35.3% for hyposmia, and 32.5% for anosmia. The prevalence increased with age for OI and anosmia, but not for hyposmia. The multivariable-adjusted odds ratio (OR) of OI was 2.10 (95% CI 1.69–2.61) for illiteracy and 1.41 (1.18–1.70) for elementary school (vs. middle school or above), 1.30 (1.01–1.67) for current smoking (vs. never smoking), 0.86 (0.74–0.99) for overweight and 0.73 (0.61–0.87) for obesity (vs. normal weight), 4.21 (2.23–7.94) for dementia, 1.68 (1.23–2.30) for head injury, and 1.44 (1.14–1.83) for sinonasal disease. Illiteracy in combination with either male sex or diabetes was significantly associated with an over two-fold increased OR of OI (p for interactions &amp;lt;0.05).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Olfactory impairment is highly prevalent that affects over two-thirds of rural-dwelling older adults in China. OI is correlated with illiteracy, current smoking, dementia, head injury, and sinonasal disease, but negatively associated with overweight or obesity. Olfactory impairment as a potential clinical marker of neurodegenerative disorders among older adults deserves further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Morphological and genomic shifts in mole-rat 'queens' increase fecundity but reduce skeletal integrity</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65760</link>
	<content:encoded>In some mammals and many social insects, highly cooperative societies are characterized by reproductive division of labor, in which breeders and nonbreeders become behaviorally and morphologically distinct. While differences in behavior and growth between breeders and nonbreeders have been extensively described, little is known of their molecular underpinnings. Here, we investigate the consequences of breeding for skeletal morphology and gene regulation in highly cooperative Damaraland mole-rats. By experimentally assigning breeding 'queen' status versus nonbreeder status to age-matched littermates, we confirm that queens experience vertebral growth that likely confers advantages to fecundity. However, they also up-regulate bone resorption pathways and show reductions in femoral mass, which predicts increased vulnerability to fracture. Together, our results show that, as in eusocial insects, reproductive division of labor in mole-rats leads to gene regulatory rewiring and extensive morphological plasticity. However, in mole-rats, concentrated reproduction is also accompanied by costs to bone strength.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Robo recruitment of the Wave Regulatory Complex plays an essential and conserved role in midline repulsion</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64474</link>
	<content:encoded>The Roundabout (Robo) guidance receptor family induces axon repulsion in response to its ligand Slit by inducing local cytoskeletal changes; however, the link to the cytoskeleton and the nature of these cytoskeletal changes are poorly understood. Here, we show that the heteropentameric Scar/Wave Regulatory Complex (WRC) which drives Arp2/3-induced branched actin polymerization, is a direct effector of Robo signaling. Biochemical evidence shows that Slit triggers WRC recruitment to the Robo receptor's WIRS motif. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; embryos, mutants of the WRC enhance Robo1-dependent midline crossing defects. Additionally, mutating Robo1's WIRS motif significantly reduces receptor activity in rescue assays &lt;i&gt;in vivo,&lt;/i&gt; and CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis shows that the WIRS motif is essential for endogenous Robo1 function. Finally, axon guidance assays in mouse dorsal spinal commissural axons and gain-of-function experiments in chick embryos demonstrate that the WIRS motif is also required for Robo1 repulsion in mammals. Together, our data support an essential conserved role for the WIRS-WRC interaction in Robo1-mediated axon repulsion.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Molecular tracking devices quantify antigen distribution and archiving in the murine lymph node</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/62781</link>
	<content:encoded>The detection of foreign antigens &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; has relied on fluorescent conjugation or indirect read-outs such as antigen presentation. In our studies, we found that these widely used techniques had several technical limitations that have precluded a complete picture of antigen trafficking or retention across lymph node cell types. To address these limitations, we developed a 'molecular tracking device' to follow the distribution, acquisition, and retention of antigen in the lymph node. Utilizing an antigen conjugated to a nuclease-resistant DNA tag, acting as a combined antigen-adjuvant conjugate, and single-cell mRNA sequencing we quantified antigen abundance in lymph node. Variable antigen levels enabled the identification of caveolar endocytosis as a mechanism of antigen acquisition or retention in lymphatic endothelial cells. Thus, these molecular tracking devices enable new approaches to study dynamic tissue dissemination of antigen-adjuvant conjugates and identify new mechanisms of antigen acquisition and retention at cellular resolution &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Distinct clonal evolution of B-cells in HIV controllers with neutralizing antibody breadth</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/62648</link>
	<content:encoded>A minor subset of individuals infected with HIV-1 develop antibody neutralization breadth during the natural course of the infection, often linked to chronic, high-level viremia. Despite significant efforts, vaccination strategies have been unable to induce similar neutralization breadth and the mechanisms underlying neutralizing antibody induction remain largely elusive. Broadly neutralizing antibody responses can also be found in individuals who control HIV to low and even undetectable plasma levels in the absence of antiretroviral therapy, suggesting that high antigen exposure is not a strict requirement for neutralization breadth. We therefore performed an analysis of paired heavy and light chain B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoires in 12,591 HIV-1 envelope-specific single memory B-cells to determine alterations in the BCR immunoglobulin gene repertoire and B-cell clonal expansions that associate with neutralizing antibody breadth in 22 HIV controllers. We found that the frequency of genomic mutations in IGHV and IGLV was directly correlated with serum neutralization breadth. The repertoire of the most mutated antibodies was dominated by a small number of large clones with evolutionary signatures suggesting that these clones had reached peak affinity maturation. These data demonstrate that even in the setting of low plasma HIV antigenemia, similar to what a vaccine can potentially achieve, BCR selection for extended somatic hypermutation and clonal evolution can occur in some individuals suggesting that host-specific factors might be involved that could be targeted with future vaccine strategies.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/62202</link>
	<content:encoded>Given the importance of DNA methylation in protection of the genome against transposable elements and transcriptional regulation in other taxonomic groups, the diversity in both levels and patterns of DNA methylation in the insects raises questions about its function and evolution. We show that the maintenance DNA methyltransferase, DNMT1, affects meiosis and is essential to fertility in milkweed bugs, &lt;i&gt;Oncopeltus fasciatus&lt;/i&gt;, while DNA methylation is not required in somatic cells. Our results support the hypothesis that &lt;i&gt;Dnmt1&lt;/i&gt; is required for the transition of germ cells to gametes in &lt;i&gt;O. fasciatus&lt;/i&gt; and that this function is conserved in male and female gametogenesis. They further suggest that DNMT1 has a function independent of DNA methylation in germ cells. Our results raise the question of how a gene so critical in fitness across multiple insect species can have diverged widely across the insect tree of life.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61437</link>
	<content:encoded>Visual perception in natural environments depends on the ability to focus on salient stimuli while ignoring distractions. This kind of selective visual attention is associated with gamma activity in the visual cortex. While the nucleus reticularis thalami (nRT) has been implicated in selective attention, its role in modulating gamma activity in the visual cortex remains unknown. Here we show that somatostatin- (SST) but not parvalbumin-expressing (PV) neurons in the visual sector of the nRT preferentially project to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), and modulate visual information transmission and gamma activity in primary visual cortex (V1). These findings pinpoint the SST neurons in nRT as powerful modulators of the visual information encoding accuracy in V1, and represent a novel circuit through which the nRT can influence representation of visual information.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56491</link>
	<content:encoded>Trace conditioning and extinction learning depend on the hippocampus, but it remains unclear how neural activity in the hippocampus is modulated during these two different behavioral processes. To explore this question, we performed calcium imaging from a large number of individual CA1 neurons during both trace eye-blink conditioning and subsequent extinction learning in mice. Our findings reveal that distinct populations of CA1 cells contribute to trace conditioned learning versus extinction learning, as learning emerges. Furthermore, we examined network connectivity by calculating co-activity between CA1 neuron pairs and found that CA1 network connectivity patterns also differ between conditioning and extinction, even though the overall connectivity density remains constant. Together, our results demonstrate that distinct populations of hippocampal CA1 neurons, forming different sub-networks with unique connectivity patterns, encode different aspects of learning.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background and purpose&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The diagnostic value of non-contrast CT (NCCT) in acute stroke imaging remains indispensable, especially under emergency conditions with limited resources. The radiological conjugate eye deviation (RCED) has been demonstrated as a NCCT sign to predict acute ischemic stroke (AIS) or AIS secondary to large vessel occlusion (LVO) in recent studies. We performed a meta-analysis to gain a better understanding into the predictive role of RCED for AISs and LVO-AISs.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We conducted a systematic literature search using PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane. The search focused on studies published between January 2000 and August 2020 that reported the predictive value of RCED for the diagnosis of AIS or LVO-AIS. Principal measurements of the meta-analysis were the overall sensitivity, specificity, the positive likelihood ratio (PLR), and the negative likelihood ratio (NLR) of RCED in predicting AIS and LVO-AIS.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We included 11 studies (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 2304). For AIS, RCED had a sensitivity of 0.37 (95% CI 0.27–0.47), a specificity of 0.86 (95% CI 0.73–0.93), the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.58 (95% CI 0.53–0.62), PLR was 2.5 (95% CI 1.5–4.4), and NLR was 0.74 (95% CI 0.65–0.84). For LVO-AIS, RCED had a sensitivity of 0.63 (95% CI 0.46–0.77), a specificity of 0.77 (95% CI 0.71–0.82), AUC was 0.63 (95% CI 0.46–0.77), PLR was 2.7 (95% CI 1.7–4.3), and NLR was 0.49 (95% CI 0.3–0.78).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;RCED can be used to predict LVO-AIS. It is expected that this method will be extensively used and validated in acute stroke imaging, especially under emergency conditions with limited resources.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Voluntary rapid eye movements (saccades) redirect the fovea toward objects of visual interest. The saccadic system can be considered as a dual-mode system: in one mode the eye is fixating, in the other it is making a saccade. In this review, we consider two examples of dysfunctional saccades, interrupted saccades in late-onset Tay-Sachs disease and gaze-position dependent opsoclonus after concussion, which fail to properly shift between fixation and saccade modes. Insights and benefits gained from bi-directional collaborative exchange between clinical and basic scientists are emphasized. In the case of interrupted saccades, existing mathematical models were sufficiently detailed to provide support for the cause of interrupted saccades. In the case of gaze-position dependent opsoclonus, existing models could not explain the behavior, but further development provided a reasonable hypothesis for the mechanism underlying the behavior. Collaboration between clinical and basic science is a rich source of progress for developing biologically plausible models and understanding neurological disease. Approaching a clinical problem with a specific hypothesis (model) in mind often prompts new experimental tests and provides insights into basic mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Neuroblastoma (NB) is one of the most common extracranial solid tumors in children. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been shown to be involved in the development of NB. However, the function of circ_0132817 in NB is currently unclear. In this paper, the levels of circ_0132817 and NOL4L were induced in NB tissues and cells, and miR-432-5p expression was on the contrary. MiR-432-5p was verified as a target of circ_0132817 and miR-432-5p could bind to NOL4L. The inhibitory effects of miR-432-5p overexpression on cell proliferation, migration, invasion and glycolysis could be reversed by circ_0132817 facilitation. The suppression of NOL4L knockdown on NB cells progression could be rescued by miR-432-5p inhibition. Besides, knockdown of circ_0132817 repressed tumor growth in vivo. Thus, we came to a conclusion that circ_0132817 promoted the tumorigenesis of NB cells by up-regulating NOL4L and acting as a sponge for miR-432-5p.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>There is an accumulating volume of research into neurological manifestations of COVID‐19. However, inconsistent study designs, inadequate controls, poorly‐validated tests, and differing settings, interventions, and cultural norms weaken study quality, comparability, and thus the understanding of the spectrum, burden and pathophysiology of these complications. Therefore, a global COVID‐19 Neuro Research Coalition, together with the WHO, has reviewed reports of COVID‐19 neurological complications and harmonised clinical measures for future research. This will facilitate well‐designed studies using precise, consistent case definitions of SARS‐CoV2 infection and neurological complications, with standardised forms for pooled data analyses that non‐specialists can use, including in low‐income settings.

	<title>Hippocampus: APOE moderates the effect of hippocampal blood flow on memory pattern separation in clinically normal older adults</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23327?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Pattern separation, the ability to differentiate new information from previously experienced similar information, is highly sensitive to hippocampal structure and function and declines with age. Functional MRI studies have demonstrated hippocampal hyperactivation in older adults compared to young, with greater task‐related activation associated with worse pattern separation performance. The current study was designed to determine whether pattern separation was sensitive to differences in task‐free hippocampal cerebral blood flow (CBF) in 130 functionally intact older adults. Given prior evidence that apolipoprotein E e4 (APOE e4) status moderates the relationship between CBF and episodic memory, we predicted a stronger negative relationship between hippocampal CBF and pattern separation in APOE e4 carriers. An interaction between APOE group and right hippocampal CBF was present, such that greater right hippocampal CBF was related to better lure discrimination in noncarriers, whereas the effect reversed directionality in e4 carriers. These findings suggest that neurovascular changes in the medial temporal lobe may underlie memory deficits in cognitively normal older adults who are APOE e4 carriers.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
Research has reported that repeatedly retrieving a novel or imagined event representation reduces activity within brain regions critical for constructing mental scenarios, namely the anterior hippocampus and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). The primary aim of this investigation was to test if this pattern reported for imagined events would be found when repeatedly recollecting autobiographical memories. Twenty‐four participants retrieved 12 pre‐selected autobiographical memories four times while undergoing an fMRI scan. We used a region of interest approach to investigate how the anterior and posterior hippocampus as well as cortical regions critical for memory retrieval—the vmPFC and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)—are affected by repeated retrievals. This analysis revealed an effect in the bilateral anterior hippocampi and vmPFC, but not the posterior hippocampus nor the PCC, with activity decreasing in these regions as a function of repeated retrievals. A multivariate analytic approach (Partial Least Squares) was used to assess whole‐brain patterns of neural activity associated with repeated retrievals. This analysis revealed one pattern of neural activity associated with the initial retrieval of a memory (e.g., inferior frontal and temporal lobe regions) and a separate pattern of activity associated with later retrievals that was distributed primarily across the lateral parietal cortices. These findings suggest that the anterior hippocampus and the vmPFC support the episodic construction of an autobiographical memory the first time it is retrieved and that alternate nonconstructive processes support its subsequent retrieval shortly thereafter.</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: How Can an Na+ Channel Inhibitor Ameliorate Seizures in Lennox–Gastaut Syndrome?</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26068?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is an epileptic encephalopathy frequently associated with multiple types of seizures. The classical Na+ channel inhibitors are in general ineffective against the seizures in LGS. Rufinamide is a new Na+ channel inhibitor, but approved for the treatment of LGS. This is not consistent with a choice of antiseizure drugs (ASDs) according to simplistic categorical grouping.


Methods
The effect of rufinamide on the Na+ channel, cellular discharges, and seizure behaviors was quantitatively characterized in native neurons and mammalian models of epilepsy, and compared with the other Na+ channel inhibitors.


Results
With a much faster binding rate to the inactivated Na+ channel than phenytoin, rufinamide is distinctively effective if the seizure discharges chiefly involve short bursts interspersed with hyperpolarized interburst intervals, exemplified by spike and wave discharges (SWDs) on electroencephalograms. Consistently, rufinamide, but not phenytoin, suppresses SWD‐associated seizures in pentylenetetrazol or AY‐9944 models, which recapitulate the major electrophysiological and behavioral manifestations in typical and atypical absence seizures, including LGS.


Interpretation
Na+ channel inhibitors shall have sufficiently fast binding to exert an action during the short bursts and then suppress SWDs, in which cases rufinamide is superior. For the epileptiform discharges where the interburst intervals are not so hyperpolarized, phenytoin could be better because of the higher affinity. Na+ channel inhibitors with different binding kinetics and affinity to the inactivated channels may have different antiseizure scope. A rational choice of ASDs according to in‐depth molecular pharmacology and the attributes of ictal discharges is advisable. ANN NEUROL 2021</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: A novel yeast hybrid modeling framework integrating Boolean and enzyme-constrained networks enables exploration of the interplay between signaling and metabolism</title>

The interplay between nutrient-induced signaling and metabolism plays an important role in maintaining homeostasis and its malfunction has been implicated in many different human diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, cancer, and neurological disorders. Therefore, unraveling the role of nutrients as signaling molecules and metabolites together with their interconnectivity may provide a deeper understanding of how these conditions occur. Both signaling and metabolism have been extensively studied using various systems biology approaches. However, they are mainly studied individually and in addition, current models lack both the complexity of the dynamics and the effects of the crosstalk in the signaling system. To gain a better understanding of the interconnectivity between nutrient signaling and metabolism in yeast cells, we developed a hybrid model, combining a Boolean module, describing the main pathways of glucose and nitrogen signaling, and an enzyme-constrained model accounting for the central carbon metabolism of &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, using a regulatory network as a link. The resulting hybrid model was able to capture a diverse utalization of isoenzymes and to our knowledge outperforms constraint-based models in the prediction of individual enzymes for both respiratory and mixed metabolism. The model showed that during fermentation, enzyme utilization has a major contribution in governing protein allocation, while in low glucose conditions robustness and control are prioritized. In addition, the model was capable of reproducing the regulatory effects that are associated with the Crabtree effect and glucose repression, as well as regulatory effects associated with lifespan increase during caloric restriction. Overall, we show that our hybrid model provides a comprehensive framework for the study of the non-trivial effects of the interplay between signaling and metabolism, suggesting connections between the Snf1 signaling pathways and processes that have been related to chronological lifespan of yeast cells.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_Dbq8MMfdOM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The COVID-19 pandemic is posing an unprecedented threat to the whole world. In this regard, it is absolutely imperative to understand the mechanism of metabolic reprogramming of host human cells by SARS-CoV-2. A better understanding of the metabolic alterations would aid in design of better therapeutics to deal with COVID-19 pandemic. We developed an integrated genome-scale metabolic model of normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) infected with SARS-CoV-2 using gene-expression and macromolecular make-up of the virus. The reconstructed model predicts growth rates of the virus in high agreement with the experimental measured values. Furthermore, we report a method for conducting genome-scale differential flux analysis (GS-DFA) in context-specific metabolic models. We apply the method to the context-specific model and identify severely affected metabolic modules predominantly comprising of lipid metabolism. We conduct an integrated analysis of the flux-altered reactions, host-virus protein-protein interaction network and phospho-proteomics data to understand the mechanism of flux alteration in host cells. We show that several enzymes driving the altered reactions inferred by our method to be directly interacting with viral proteins and also undergoing differential phosphorylation under diseased state. In case of SARS-CoV-2 infection, lipid metabolism particularly fatty acid oxidation, cholesterol biosynthesis and beta-oxidation cycle along with arachidonic acid metabolism are predicted to be most affected which confirms with clinical metabolomics studies. GS-DFA can be applied to existing repertoire of high-throughput proteomic or transcriptomic data in diseased condition to understand metabolic deregulation at the level of flux.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GHLqZEvY94w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
In the vertebrate retina, amacrine and ganglion cells represent the most diverse cell classes. They can be classified into different cell types by several features, such as morphology, light responses, and gene expression profile. Although birds possess high visual acuity (similar to primates which we used here for comparison) and tetrachromatic color vision, data on the expression of transcription factors in retinal ganglion cells of birds is largely missing. In this study, we tested various transcription factors, known to label subpopulations of cells in mammalian retinae, in two avian species: the common buzzard (Buteo buteo), a raptor with exceptional acuity, and the domestic pigeon (Columba livia domestica), a good navigator and widely used model for visual cognition. Staining for the transcription factors Foxp2, Satb1 and Satb2 labelled most ganglion cells in the avian ganglion cell layer. CtBP2 was established as marker for displaced amacrine cells which allowed us to reliably distinguish ganglion cells from displaced amacrine cells and assess their densities in buzzard and pigeon. When we additionally compared the temporal and central fovea of the buzzard with the fovea of primates, we found that the cellular organization in the pits was different in primates and raptors. In summary, we demonstrate that the expression of transcription factors is a defining feature of cell types not only in the retina of mammals but also of birds. The markers, which we have established, may provide useful tools for more detailed studies on the retinal circuitry of these highly visual animals.

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26080?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Brain mosaic mutations are a major cause of refractory focal epilepsies with cortical malformations such as focal cortical dysplasia, hemimegalencephaly, malformation of cortical development with oligodendroglial hyperplasia in epilepsy, or ganglioglioma. Here, we collected 1‐6 mL of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during epilepsy surgery to search for somatic variants in cell‐free DNA (cfDNA) using targeted droplet digital PCR. In 3/12 epileptic patients with known somatic mutations previously identified in brain tissue, we here provide evidence that brain mosaicism can be detected in the CSF‐derived cfDNA. These findings suggest future opportunities for detecting the mutant allele driving epilepsy in CSF.

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Plasticity of the cerebral cortex following a modification of the sensorimotor experience takes place in several steps that can last from few hours to several months. Among the mechanisms involved in the dynamic modulation of the cerebral cortex in adults, it is commonly proposed that short-term plasticity reflects changes in synaptic connections. Here, we were interested in the time-course of synaptic plasticity taking place in the somatosensory primary cortex all along a 14-day period of sensorimotor perturbation (SMP), as well as during a recovery phase up to 24 h. Activation and expression level of pre- (synapsin 1, synaptophysin, synaptotagmin 1) and postsynaptic (AMPA and NMDA receptors) proteins, postsynaptic density scaffold proteins (PSD-95 and Shank2), and cytoskeletal proteins (neurofilaments-L and M, β3-tubulin, synaptopodin, N-cadherin) were determined in cortical tissue enriched in synaptic proteins. During the SMP period, most changes were observed as soon as D7 in the presynaptic compartment and were followed, at D14, by changes in the postsynaptic compartment. These changes persisted at least until 24 h of recovery. Proteins involved in synapse structure (scaffolding, adhesion, cytoskeletal) were mildly affected and almost exclusively at D14. We concluded that experience-dependent reorganization of somatotopic cortical maps is accompanied by changes in synaptic transmission with a very close time-course.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have key roles in a variety of neurological diseases, including epilepsy. This objective of this study was to perform the functional exploration and mechanism investigation of circRNA Ubiquilin1 (circUBQLN1) in epilepsy. Epilepsy cell model was established by the treatment of Mg&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-free in human neurons-hippocampal (HN-h) cells. The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used for the expression analysis of circUBQLN1, linear-UBQLN1, microRNA-155 (miR-155), and sex-determining region Y-box 7 (SOX7). Proliferation detection was completed using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Apoptosis analysis was conducted by flow cytometry and caspase-3 assay. Oxidative stress was assessed through determining the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA). Target analysis was performed by dual-luciferase reporter and RNA pull-down assays. SOX7 protein level was examined by Western blot. CircUBQLN1 was downregulated in epilepsy samples and Mg&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-free-induced cell model. Functional analysis in vitro suggested that circUBQLN1 overexpression facilitated proliferation but reduced apoptosis and oxidative stress in Mg&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-free-treated HN-h cells. Target analysis showed that circUBQLN1 acted as a miR-155 sponge and miR-155-targeted SOX7. Moreover, circUBQLN1 could combine with miR-155 to regulate the SOX7 expression. Reverted assays indicated that circUBQLN1 overexpression alleviated the Mg&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-free-induced nerve injury by sponging miR-155, and knockdown of SOX7 abrogated the protective function of in-miR-155 or circUBQLN1 in the Mg&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-free-treated HN-h cells. Our data revealed that circUBQLN1 prevented nerve injury in Mg&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-free-treated HN-h cells by regulating the miR-155/SOX7 axis, showing that circUBQLN1 might be used as a biomolecular target for the treatment of epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: A Focus on the Cerebellum: From Embryogenesis to an Age-Related Clinical Perspective</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.646052</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The cerebellum and its functional multiplicity and heterogeneity have been objects of curiosity and interest since ancient times, giving rise to the urge to reveal its complexity. Since the first hypothesis of cerebellar mere role in motor tuning and coordination, much more has been continuously discovered about the cerebellum’s circuitry and functioning throughout centuries, leading to the currently accepted knowledge of its prominent involvement in cognitive, social, and behavioral areas. Particularly in childhood, the cerebellum may subserve several age-dependent functions, which might be compromised in several Central Nervous System pathologies. Overall, cerebellar damage may produce numerous signs and symptoms and determine a wide variety of neuropsychiatric impairments already during the evolutive age. Therefore, an early assessment in children would be desirable to address a prompt diagnosis and a proper intervention since the first months of life. Here we provide an overview of the cerebellum, retracing its morphology, histogenesis, and physiological functions, and finally outlining its involvement in typical and atypical development and the age-dependent patterns of cerebellar dysfunctions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.657693</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Early adversity (EA) impairs myelin development in a manner that persists later in life across diverse mammalian species including humans, non-human primates, and rodents. These observations, coupled with the highly conserved nature of myelin development suggest that animal models can provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms by which EA impairs myelin development later in life and the impact of these changes on network connectivity, cognition, and behavior. However, this area of translational research has received relatively little attention and no comprehensive review is currently available to address these issues. This is particularly important given some recent mechanistic studies in rodents and the availability of new agents to increase myelination. The goals of this review are to highlight the need for additional pre-clinical work in this area and to provide specific examples that demonstrate the potential of this work to generate novel therapeutic interventions that are highly needed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Effects of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Combined With Physical Training on the Excitability of the Motor Cortex, Physical Performance, and Motor Learning: A Systematic Review</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.648354</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Purpose: This systematic review aims to examine the efficacy of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) combined with physical training on the excitability of the motor cortex, physical performance, and motor learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A systematic search was performed on PubMed, Web of Science, and EBSCO databases for relevant research published from inception to August 2020. Eligible studies included those that used a randomized controlled design and reported the effects of tDCS combined with physical training to improve motor-evoked potential (MEP), dynamic posture stability index (DPSI), reaction time, and error rate on participants without nervous system diseases. The risk of bias was assessed by the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Twenty-four of an initial yield of 768 studies met the eligibility criteria. The risk of bias was considered low. Results showed that anodal tDCS combined with physical training can significantly increase MEP amplitude, decrease DPSI, increase muscle strength, and decrease reaction time and error rate in motor learning tasks. Moreover, the gain effect is significantly greater than sham tDCS combined with physical training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: tDCS combined with physical training can effectively improve the excitability of the motor cortex, physical performance, and motor learning. The reported results encourage further research to understand further the synergistic effects of tDCS combined with physical training.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Bidirectional Mapping of Brain MRI and PET With 3D Reversible GAN for the Diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.646013</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Combining multi-modality data for brain disease diagnosis such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) commonly leads to improved performance than those using a single modality. However, it is still challenging to train a multi-modality model since it is difficult in clinical practice to obtain complete data that includes all modality data. Generally speaking, it is difficult to obtain both magnetic resonance images (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) images of a single patient. PET is expensive and requires the injection of radioactive substances into the patient’s body, while MR images are cheaper, safer, and more widely used in practice. Discarding samples without PET data is a common method in previous studies, but the reduction in the number of samples will result in a decrease in model performance. To take advantage of multi-modal complementary information, we first adopt the Reversible Generative Adversarial Network (RevGAN) model to reconstruct the missing data. After that, a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) classification model with multi-modality input was proposed to perform AD diagnosis. We have evaluated our method on the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, and compared the performance of the proposed method with those using state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show that the structural and functional information of brain tissue can be mapped well and that the image synthesized by our method is close to the real image. In addition, the use of synthetic data is beneficial for the diagnosis and prediction of Alzheimer’s disease, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Optogenetic Neuronal Stimulation Promotes Functional Recovery After Spinal Cord Injury</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.640255</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Although spinal cord injury (SCI) is the main cause of disability worldwide, there is still no definite and effective treatment method for this condition. Our previous clinical trials confirmed that the increased excitability of the motor cortex was related to the functional prognosis of patients with SCI. However, it remains unclear which cell types in the motor cortex lead to the later functional recovery. Herein, we applied optogenetic technology to selectively activate glutamate neurons in the primary motor cortex and explore whether activation of glutamate neurons in the primary motor cortex can promote functional recovery after SCI in rats and the preliminary neural mechanisms involved. Our results showed that the activation of glutamate neurons in the motor cortex could significantly improve the motor function scores in rats, effectively shorten the incubation period of motor evoked potentials and increase motor potentials’ amplitude. In addition, hematoxylin-eosin staining and nerve fiber staining at the injured site showed that accurate activation of the primary motor cortex could effectively promote tissue recovery and neurofilament growth (GAP-43, NF) at the injured site of the spinal cord, while the content of some growth-related proteins (BDNF, NGF) at the injured site increased. These results suggested that selective activation of glutamate neurons in the primary motor cortex can promote functional recovery after SCI and may be of great significance for understanding the neural cell mechanism underlying functional recovery induced by motor cortex stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neural Representation of the English Vowel Feature [High]: Evidence From /ε/ vs. /ɪ/</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.629517</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many studies have observed modulation of the amplitude of the neural index mismatch negativity (MMN) related to which member of a phoneme contrast [phoneme A, phoneme B] serves as the frequent (standard) and which serves as the infrequent (deviant) stimulus (i.e., AAAB vs. BBBA) in an oddball paradigm. Explanations for this amplitude modulation range from acoustic to linguistic factors. We tested whether exchanging the role of the mid vowel /ε/ vs. high vowel /ɪ/ of English modulated MMN amplitude and whether the pattern of modulation was compatible with an underspecification account, in which the underspecified height values are [−high] and [−low]. MMN was larger for /ε/ as the deviant, but only when compared across conditions to itself as the standard. For the within-condition comparison, MMN was larger to /ɪ/ deviant minus /ε/ standard than to the reverse. A condition order effect was also observed. MMN amplitude was smaller to the deviant stimulus if it had previously served as the standard. In addition, the amplitudes of late discriminative negativity (LDN) showed similar asymmetry. LDN was larger for deviant /ε/ than deviant /ɪ/ when compared to themselves as the standard. These findings were compatible with an underspecification account, but also with other accounts, such as the Natural Referent Vowel model and a prototype model; we also suggest that non-linguistic factors need to be carefully considered as additional sources of speech processing asymmetries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Early Rearing Conditions Affect Monoamine Metabolite Levels During Baseline and Periods of Social Separation Stress: A Non-human Primate Model (Macaca mulatta)</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.624676</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A variety of studies show that parental absence early in life leads to deleterious effects on the developing CNS. This is thought to be largely because evolutionary-dependent stimuli are necessary for the appropriate postnatal development of the young brain, an effect sometimes termed the “experience-expectant brain,” with parents providing the necessary input for normative synaptic connections to develop and appropriate neuronal survival to occur. Principal among CNS systems affected by parental input are the monoamine systems. In the present study, N = 434 rhesus monkeys (233 males, 201 females) were reared in one of two conditions: as mother-reared controls (MR; n = 269) or without adults with 24-h access to same-aged peers (PR; n = 165). When subjects were six-months-old, they underwent a separation paradigm involving 4, sequential, four-day social separations from their mothers or peers, with each separation followed by three-day reunions with their mothers or their peers. Prior to the separation paradigm, baseline cisternal CSF samples were obtained, as well as at the end of each the four social separations, and after final separation, during a recovery period. CSF was assayed for concentrations of monoamine metabolites and a blood sample was genotyped for the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) genotype. Replicating earlier landmark findings, PR subjects with the s allele exhibited lower baseline concentrations of the serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), when compared to PR subjects homozygous for the L allele. MR subjects were undifferentiated by genotype. PR subjects exhibited lower CSF 5-HIAA concentrations during baseline, but higher CSF 5-HIAA during social separations, when compared to MR subjects. There were rearing effects for the dopamine metabolite homovanillic acid (HVA) and for the norepinephrine metabolite 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), with PR subjects showing higher HVA and lower MHPG when compared to MR subjects. These findings indicate that there are long-term deficits in the response of monoamines following early maternal absence. The results of this study confirm and extend earlier findings that early parental absence has deleterious consequences for the development of the monoamine systems, and that these consequences are modulated by the 5-HTT genotype.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: A Dynamic Systems Framework for Gender/Sex Development: From Sensory Input in Infancy to Subjective Certainty in Toddlerhood</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.613789</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;From birth to 15 months infants and caregivers form a fundamentally intersubjective, dyadic unit within which the infant’s ability to recognize gender/sex in the world develops. Between about 18 and 36 months the infant accumulates an increasingly clear and subjective sense of self as female or male. We know little about how the precursors to gender/sex identity form during the intersubjective period, nor how they transform into an independent sense of self by 3 years of age. In this Theory and Hypothesis article I offer a general framework for thinking about this problem. I propose that through repetition and patterning, the dyadic interactions in which infants and caregivers engage imbue the infant with an embodied, i.e., sensori-motor understanding of gender/sex. During this developmental period (which I label Phase 1) gender/sex is primarily an intersubjective project. From 15 to 18 months (which I label Phase 2) there are few reports of newly appearing gender/sex behavioral differences, and I hypothesize that this absence reflects a period of developmental instability during which there is a transition from gender/sex as primarily inter-subjective to gender/sex as primarily subjective. Beginning at 18 months (i.e., the start of Phase 3), a toddler’s subjective sense of self as having a gender/sex emerges, and it solidifies by 3 years of age. I propose a dynamic systems perspective to track how infants first assimilate gender/sex information during the intersubjective period (birth to 15 months); then explore what changes might occur during a hypothesized phase transition (15 to 18 months), and finally, review the emergence and initial stabilization of individual subjectivity-the period from 18 to 36 months. The critical questions explored focus on how to model and translate data from very different experimental disciplines, especially neuroscience, physiology, developmental psychology and cognitive development. I close by proposing the formation of a research consortium on gender/sex development during the first 3 years after birth.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Electroencephalography as a Biomarker for Functional Recovery in Spinal Cord Injury Patients</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.548558</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Functional changes after spinal cord injury (SCI) are related to changes in cortical plasticity. These changes can be measured with electroencephalography (EEG) and has potential to be used as a clinical biomarker.&lt;/p&gt;Method&lt;p&gt;In this longitudinal study participants underwent a total of 30 sessions of robotic-assisted gait training (RAGT) over a course of 6 weeks. The duration of each session was 30 min. Resting state EEG was recorded before and after 30-session rehabilitation therapy. To measure gait, we used the Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury Scale, 10-Meter- Walking Test, Timed-Up-and-Go, and 6-Min-Walking Test. Balance was measured using Berg Balance Scale.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Fifteen participants with incomplete SCI who had AIS C or D injuries based on American Spinal Cord Injury Association Impairment Scale classification were included in this study. Mean age was 35.7 years (range 17–51) and the mean time since injury was 17.08 (range 4–37) months. All participants showed clinical improvement with the rehabilitation program. EEG data revealed that high beta EEG activity in the central area had a negative correlation with gait (p = 0.049; β coefficient: −0.351; and adj-R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;: 0.23) and balance (p = 0.043; β coefficient: −0.158; and adj-R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:0.24) measured at baseline, in a way that greater high beta EEG power was related to worse clinical function at baseline. Moreover, improvement in gait and balance had negative correlations with the change in alpha/theta ratio in the parietal area (Gait: p = 0.049; β coefficient: −0.351; adj-R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;: 0.23; Balance: p = 0.043; β coefficient: −0.158; and adj-R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;: 0.24).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;In SCI, functional impairment and subsequent improvement following rehabilitation therapy with RAGT correlated with the change in cortical activity measured by EEG. Our results suggest that EEG alpha/theta ratio may be a potential surrogate marker of functional improvement during rehabilitation. Future studies are necessary to improve and validate these findings as a neurophysiological biomarker for SCI rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Blockade of Motor Cortical Long-Term Potentiation Induction by Glutamatergic Dysfunction Causes Abnormal Neurobehavior in an Experimental Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Model</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.670189</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a life-threatening condition that can also lead to permanent paralysis. However, the mechanisms that underlying neurobehavioral deficits after SAH have not been fully elucidated. As theta burst stimulation (TBS) can induce long-term potentiation (LTP) in the motor cortex, we tested its potential as a functional evaluation tool after experimentally induced SAH. Motor cortical inter-neuronal excitability was evaluated in anesthetized rats after 200 Hz-quadripulse TBS (QTS5), 200 Hz-quadripulse stimulation (QPS5), and 400 Hz-octapulse stimulation (OPS2.5). Furthermore, correlation between motor cortical LTP and N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor activation was evaluated using MK-801, a NMDA-receptor antagonist. We evaluated inhibition-facilitation configurations [interstimulus interval: 3 ms; short-latency intracortical inhibition (SICI) and 11 ms; intracortical facilitation (ICF)] with paired electrical stimulation protocols and the effect of TBS paradigm on continuous recording of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) for quantitative parameters. SAH and MK-801 completely blocked ICF, while SICI was preserved. QTS5, QPS5, and OPS2.5 facilitated continuous MEPs, persisting for 180 min. Both SAH and MK-801 completely blocked MEP facilitations after QPS5 and OPS2.5, while MEP facilitations after QTS5 were preserved. Significant correlations were found among neurological scores and 3 ms-SICI rates, 11 ms-ICF rates, and MEP facilitation rates after 200 Hz-QTS5, 7 days after SAH (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.6236; r = −0.79, R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.6053; r = −0.77 and R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.9071; r = 0.95, p &amp;lt; 0.05, respectively). Although these findings need to be verified in humans, our study demonstrates that the neurophysiological parameters 3 ms-SICI, 11 ms-ICF, and 200 Hz-QTS5-MEPs may be useful surrogate quantitative biomarkers for assessing inter-neuronal function after SAH.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Freely Behaving Mice Can Brake and Turn During Optogenetic Stimulation of the Mesencephalic Locomotor Region</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.639900</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A key function of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) is to control the speed of forward symmetrical locomotor movements. However, the ability of freely moving mammals to integrate environmental cues to brake and turn during MLR stimulation is poorly documented. Here, we investigated whether freely behaving mice could brake or turn, based on environmental cues during MLR stimulation. We photostimulated the cuneiform nucleus (part of the MLR) in mice expressing channelrhodopsin in Vglut2-positive neurons in a Cre-dependent manner (Vglut2-ChR2-EYFP) using optogenetics. We detected locomotor movements using deep learning. We used patch-clamp recordings to validate the functional expression of channelrhodopsin and neuroanatomy to visualize the stimulation sites. In the linear corridor, gait diagram and limb kinematics were similar during spontaneous and optogenetic-evoked locomotion. In the open-field arena, optogenetic stimulation of the MLR evoked locomotion, and increasing laser power increased locomotor speed. Mice could brake and make sharp turns (~90°) when approaching a corner during MLR stimulation in the open-field arena. The speed during the turn was scaled with the speed before the turn, and with the turn angle. Patch-clamp recordings in Vglut2-ChR2-EYFP mice show that blue light evoked short-latency spiking in MLR neurons. Our results strengthen the idea that different brainstem neurons convey braking/turning and MLR speed commands in mammals. Our study also shows that Vglut2-positive neurons of the cuneiform nucleus are a relevant target to increase locomotor activity without impeding the ability to brake and turn when approaching obstacles, thus ensuring smooth and adaptable navigation. Our observations may have clinical relevance since cuneiform nucleus stimulation is increasingly considered to improve locomotion function in pathological states such as Parkinson’s disease, spinal cord injury, or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Functions and Mechanisms of the Voltage-Gated Proton Channel Hv1 in Brain and Spinal Cord Injury</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.662971</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The voltage-gated proton channel Hv1 is a newly discovered ion channel that is highly conserved among species. It is known that Hv1 is not only expressed in peripheral immune cells but also one of the major ion channels expressed in tissue-resident microglia of the central nervous systems (CNS). One key role for Hv1 is its interaction with NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) to regulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cytosolic pH. Emerging data suggest that excessive ROS production increases and requires proton currents through Hv1 in the injured CNS, and manipulations that ablate Hv1 expression or induce loss of function may provide neuroprotection in CNS injury models including stroke, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury. Recent data demonstrating microglial Hv1-mediated signaling in the pathophysiology of the CNS injury further supports the idea that Hv1 channel may function as a key mechanism in posttraumatic neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. In this review, we summarize the main findings of Hv1, including its expression pattern, cellular mechanism, role in aging, and animal models of CNS injury and disease pathology. We also discuss the potential of Hv1 as a therapeutic target for CNS injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was discovered in China, causing a new coronavirus disease, termed COVID-19 by the WHO on February 11, 2020. At the time of this paper (January 31, 2021), more than 100 million cases have been recorded, which have claimed over 2 million lives worldwide. The most important clinical presentation of COVID-19 is severe pneumonia; however, many patients present various neurological symptoms, ranging from loss of olfaction, nausea, dizziness, and headache to encephalopathy and stroke, with a high prevalence of inflammatory central nervous system (CNS) syndromes. SARS-CoV-2 may also target the respiratory center in the brainstem and cause silent hypoxemia. However, the neurotropic mechanism(s) by which SARS-CoV-2 affects the CNS remain(s) unclear. In this paper, we first address the involvement of astrocytes in COVID-19 and then elucidate the present knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 as a neurotropic virus as well as several other neurotropic flaviviruses (with a particular emphasis on the West Nile virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, and Zika virus) to highlight the neurotropic mechanisms that target astroglial cells in the CNS. These key homeostasis-providing cells in the CNS exhibit many functions that act as a favorable milieu for virus replication and possibly a favorable environment for SARS-CoV-2 as well. The role of astrocytes in COVID-19 pathology, related to aging and neurodegenerative disorders, and environmental factors, is discussed. Understanding these mechanisms is key to better understanding the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and for developing new strategies to mitigate the neurotropic manifestations of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Acetylcholine Receptor Stimulation Activates Protein Kinase C Mediated Internalization of the Dopamine Transporter</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.662216</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The dopamine transporter (DAT) clears neurotransmitters from the extracellular space and serves as an important regulator of signal amplitude and duration at sites of dopamine release. Several different intracellular signaling pathways have been observed to modulate DAT activity through the regulation of the trafficking of the carriers to and from the cell surface. Acute activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by phorbol esters facilitates clathrin-dependent internalization of the DAT in a variety of model systems; however, the physiological stimuli and cell-surface receptor systems that activate PKC and regulate the DAT in dopamine neurons remain elusive. We report here that stimulation of M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; muscarinic receptors in midbrain cultures decreases the ability of dopamine neurons to transport dopamine through DAT. Application of the cholinomimetic drug carbachol leads to a decrease in DAT activity in primary cultures while the M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-specific antagonist, pirenzepine, blocks these effects. The M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; antagonist, DAU 5884, does not affect, but a positive modulator of M&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, VU 0238429, enhances the loss of DAT function in response to carbachol and acetylcholine. These data implicate M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; receptors on dopamine neurons in the modulation of DAT function. Bisindolylmaleimide, a PKC inhibitor, blocks the effects of carbachol stimulation on dopamine uptake, supporting a role for PKC in muscarinic receptor-mediated DAT internalization. Furthermore, as shown previously for PKC-induced internalization, downregulation of the DAT is dependent on both clathrin and dynamin. A G&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;-specific inhibitor peptide also blocks the effects of carbachol on DAT in primary cultures, confirming G&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; as the G-protein that couples M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; receptors to PKC activation in these cells. In acute midbrain slices, biotinylation of cell-surface proteins revealed the loss of dopamine transport mediated by muscarinic receptor stimulation was, indeed, due to loss of membrane expression of the DAT in endogenous tissue. These data indicate that stimulation of cholinergic pathways can lead to modulation of dopamine through internalization of the DAT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Tonic Control of Secretory Acid Sphingomyelinase Over Ventral Hippocampal Synaptic Transmission and Neuron Excitability</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.660561</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) converts sphingomyelin into ceramide. Recent work has advanced the ASM/ceramide system as a major player in the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD). Indeed, ASM activity is enhanced in MDD patients and antidepressant drugs like fluoxetine act as functional inhibitors of ASM. Here, we employed the specific ASM inhibitor ARC39 to explore the acute effects of the enzyme on hippocampal synaptic transmission and cell excitability in adult mouse brain slice preparations. In both field potential and whole-cell recordings, ARC39 (1–3 μM) enhanced excitatory synaptic input onto ventral hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells. The specificity of drug action was demonstrated by its lacking effect in slices from ASM knockout mice. In control condition, ARC39 strongly reduced firing in most CA1 pyramidal cells, together with membrane hyperpolarization. Such pronounced inhibitory action of ARC39 on soma excitability was largely reversed when GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors were blocked. The idea that ARC39 recruits GABAergic inhibition to dampen cell excitability was further reinforced by the drug’s ability to enhance the inhibitory synaptic drive onto pyramidal cells. In pyramidal cells that were pharmacologically isolated from synaptic input, the overall effect of ARC39 on cell firing was inhibitory, but some neurons displayed a biphasic response with a transient increase in firing, suggesting that ARC39 might alter intrinsic firing properties in a cell-specific fashion. Because ARC39 is charged at physiological pH and exerted all its effects within minutes of application, we propose that the neurophysiological actions reported here are due to the inhibition of secretory rather than lysosomal ASM. In summary, the ASM inhibitor ARC39 reveals a tonic control of the enzyme over ventral hippocampal excitability, which involves the intrinsic excitability of CA1 pyramidal cells as well as their excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Structural Refinement of the Auditory Brainstem Neurons in Baboons During Perinatal Development</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.648562</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Children born prematurely suffer from learning disabilities and exhibit reading, speech, and cognitive difficulties, which are associated with an auditory processing disorder. However, it is unknown whether gestational age at delivery and the unnatural auditory environment in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) collectively affect proper auditory development and neuronal circuitry in premature newborns. We morphologically characterized fetal development of the medial superior olivary nucleus (MSO), an area important for binaural hearing and sound localization, in the auditory brainstem of baboon neonates at different gestational ages. Axonal and synaptic structures and the tonotopic differentiation of ion channels in the MSO underwent profound refinements after hearing onset in the uterus. These developmental refinements of the MSO were significantly altered in preterm baboon neonates in the NICU. Thus, the maternal environment in uterus is critical for auditory nervous system development during the last trimester of pregnancy and critically affects the anatomic and functional formation of synapses and neural circuitry in the preterm newborn brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Human Cord Blood Derived Unrestricted Somatic Stem Cells Restore Aquaporin Channel Expression, Reduce Inflammation and Inhibit the Development of Hydrocephalus After Experimentally Induced Perinatal Intraventricular Hemorrhage</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.633185</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a severe complication of preterm birth associated with cerebral palsy, intellectual disability, and commonly, accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Histologically, IVH leads to subependymal gliosis, fibrosis, and disruption of the ependymal wall. Importantly, expression of aquaporin channels 1 and 4 (AQP1 and AQP4) regulating respectively, secretion and absorption of cerebrospinal fluids is altered with IVH and are associated with development of post hemorrhagic hydrocephalus. Human cord blood derived unrestricted somatic stem cells (USSCs), which we previously demonstrated to reduce the magnitude of hydrocephalus, as having anti-inflammatory, and beneficial behavioral effects, were injected into the cerebral ventricles of rabbit pups 18 h after glycerol-induced IVH. USSC treated IVH pups showed a reduction in ventricular size when compared to control pups at 7 and 14 days (both, P &amp;lt; 0.05). Histologically, USSC treatment reduced cellular infiltration and ependymal wall disruption. In the region of the choroid plexus, immuno-reactivity for AQP1 and ependymal wall AQP4 expression were suppressed after IVH but were restored following USSC administration. Effects were confirmed by analysis of mRNA from dissected choroid plexus and ependymal tissue. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) isoforms, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) mRNA, as well as protein levels, were significantly increased following IVH and restored towards normal with USSC treatment (P &amp;lt; 0.05). The anti-inflammatory cytokine Interleukin-10 (IL-10) mRNA was reduced in IVH, but significantly recovered after USSC injection (P &amp;lt; 0.05). In conclusion, USSCs exerted anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing both TGF-β specific isoforms, CTGF and MMP-9, recovered IL-10, restored aquaporins expression towards baseline, and reduced hydrocephalus. These results support the possibility of the use of USSCs to reduce IVH consequences in prematurity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Validation of Induced Microglia-Like Cells (iMG Cells) for Future Studies of Brain Diseases</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.629279</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microglia are the primary resident immune cells of the central nervous system that maintain physiological homeostasis in the brain and contribute to the pathogenesis of many psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Due to the lack of appropriate human cellular models, it is difficult to study the basic pathophysiological processes linking microglia to brain diseases. In this study, we adopted a microglia-like cellular model derived from peripheral blood monocytes with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-34 (IL-34). We characterized and validated this in vitro cellular model by morphology, immunocytochemistry, gene expression profiles, and functional study. Our results indicated that the iMG cells developed typical microglial ramified morphology, expressed microglial specific surface markers (P2RY12 and TMEM119), and possessed phagocytic activity. Principal component analyses and multidimensional scaling analyses of RNA-seq data showed that iMG cells were distinct from monocytes and induced macrophages (iMacs) but clustered closer to human microglia and hiPSC-induced microglia. Heatmap analyses also found that iMG cells, but not monocytes, were closely clustered with human primary microglia. Further pathway and relative expression analysis indicated that unique genes from iMG cells were involved in the regulation of the complement system, especially in the synapse and ion transport. Overall, our data demonstrated that the iMG model mimicked many features of the brain resident microglia, highlighting its utility in the study of microglial function in many brain diseases, such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease (AD).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hyperactivation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) due to mutations in genes along the PI3K-mTOR pathway and the GATOR1 complex causes a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders (termed mTORopathies) associated with malformation of cortical development and intractable epilepsy. Despite these gene variants’ converging impact on mTORC1 activity, emerging findings suggest that these variants contribute to epilepsy through both mTORC1-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Here, we review the literature on in utero electroporation-based animal models of mTORopathies, which recapitulate the brain mosaic pattern of mTORC1 hyperactivity, and compare the effects of distinct PI3K-mTOR pathway and GATOR1 complex gene variants on cortical development and epilepsy. We report the outcomes on cortical pyramidal neuronal placement, morphology, and electrophysiological phenotypes, and discuss some of the converging and diverging mechanisms responsible for these alterations and their contribution to epileptogenesis. We also discuss potential therapeutic strategies for epilepsy, beyond mTORC1 inhibition with rapamycin or everolimus, that could offer personalized medicine based on the gene variant.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Sex Differences in the Relationship of Serum Vitamin B1 and B12 to Dementia Among Memory Clinic Outpatients in Japan</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.667215</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dementia and cognitive impairment are considered to be one of the biggest social and medical problems. While there is a definite relationship between vitamin B and cognitive decline, this has yet to be fully assessed with regard to sex differences. Thus, the present study investigated the relationship of vitamin B1 or vitamin B12 with dementia in accordance with the sex in 188 patients who visited the Memory Clinic at Showa University Hospital in Japan from March 2016 to March 2019. Cognitive function was tested by the Japanese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Hasegawa Dementia Scale-Revised (HDS-R). Blood tests were performed to measure the vitamin levels. Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) for dementia and the 95% confidence interval (CI). Compared to the highest vitamin group (third tertile), the lowest vitamin group (first tertile) exhibited a significantly increased OR for dementia defined by MMSE for vitamin B1 (OR:3.73, 95% CI:1.52–9.16) and vitamin B12 (2.97, 1.22–7.28) among women. In contrast, vitamin levels were not significantly associated with dementia determined by MMSE in men. These findings were similar even when dementia was defined by HDS-R. The present study suggests that vitamin B1 plays a role in preventing development of dementia in women. Future longitudinal studies will need to be undertaken in order to examine whether decreasing vitamin levels occur before or after cognitive impairment, and whether maintaining a higher vitamin level can prevent a worsening of cognitive function and the development of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.662474</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), are typically characterized by progressive neuronal loss and neurological dysfunctions in the nervous system, affecting both memory and motor functions. Neuregulins (NRGs) belong to the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like family of extracellular ligands and they play an important role in the development, maintenance, and repair of both the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) through the ErbB signaling pathway. They also regulate multiple intercellular signal transduction and participate in a wide range of biological processes, such as differentiation, migration, and myelination. In this review article, we summarized research on the changes and roles of NRGs in neurodegenerative diseases, especially in AD. We elaborated on the structural features of each NRG subtype and roles of NRG/ErbB signaling networks in neurodegenerative diseases. We also discussed the therapeutic potential of NRGs in the symptom remission of neurodegenerative diseases, which may offer hope for advancing related treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Age-Related Memory Impairment and Sex-Specific Alterations in Phosphorylation of the Rpt6 Proteasome Subunit and Polyubiquitination in the Basolateral Amygdala and Medial Prefrontal Cortex</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.656944</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aging is marked by an accumulation of damaged and modified brain proteins, and the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is important for cellular protein degradation. Recent work has established a critical role for the UPS in memory and synaptic plasticity, but the role of the UPS in age-related cognitive decline remains poorly understood. We trained young, middle-aged, and aged male and female rats using trace fear conditioning (TFC) to investigate the effects of age and sex on memory. We then measured markers of UPS-related protein degradation (phosphorylation of the Rpt6 proteasome regulatory subunit and K48-linked polyubiquitination) using western blots. We found that aged males, but not aged females, showed behavioral deficits at memory retrieval. Aged males also displayed reduced phosphorylation of the Rpt6 proteasome subunit and accumulation of K48 in the basolateral amygdala, while aged females displayed a similar pattern in the medial prefrontal cortex. These findings suggest that markers of UPS function are differentially affected by age and sex in a brain region-dependent manner. Together these results provide an important step toward understanding the UPS and circuit-level differences in aging males and females.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Predictive Coding Over the Lifespan: Increased Reliance on Perceptual Priors in Older Adults—A Magnetoencephalography and Dynamic Causal Modeling Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.631599</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aging is accompanied by unisensory decline. To compensate for this, two complementary strategies are potentially relied upon increasingly: first, older adults integrate more information from different sensory organs. Second, according to the predictive coding (PC) model, we form “templates” (internal models or “priors”) of the environment through our experiences. It is through increased life experience that older adults may rely more on these templates compared to younger adults. Multisensory integration and predictive coding would be effective strategies for the perception of near-threshold stimuli, which may however come at the cost of integrating irrelevant information. Both strategies can be studied in multisensory illusions because these require the integration of different sensory information, as well as an internal model of the world that can take precedence over sensory input. Here, we elicited a classic multisensory illusion, the sound-induced flash illusion, in younger (mean: 27 years, N = 25) and older (mean: 67 years, N = 28) adult participants while recording the magnetoencephalogram. Older adults perceived more illusions than younger adults. Older adults had increased pre-stimulus beta-band activity compared to younger adults as predicted by microcircuit theories of predictive coding, which suggest priors and predictions are linked to beta-band activity. Transfer entropy analysis and dynamic causal modeling of pre-stimulus magnetoencephalography data revealed a stronger illusion-related modulation of cross-modal connectivity from auditory to visual cortices in older compared to younger adults. We interpret this as the neural correlate of increased reliance on a cross-modal predictive template in older adults leading to the illusory percept.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: This cross-sectional study aimed to distinguish patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from patients with normal controls (NCs) by measuring the levels of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), total creatinine (tCr), and choline (Cho) in their hippocampus (HIP) and their posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG) by using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and to predict the cutoff value on the ratios of metabolites. We further aimed to provide a reference for the diagnosis of MCI in elderly patients in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: About 69 patients who underwent a clinical diagnosis of the MCI group and 67 patients with NCs, the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score, and MRS of the bilateral HIP and bilateral PCG were considered. The ratio of NAA/tCr and Cho/tCr in the bilateral HIP and bilateral PCG was calculated. The relationship between the ratios of metabolites and the scores of MMSE and MoCA was analyzed, and the possible brain metabolite cutoff point for the diagnosis of MCI was evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Compared with the NC group, the scores of MMSE and MoCA in the MCI group decreased significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.05); the ratio of NAA/tCr in the bilateral HIP and bilateral PCG and the ratio of Cho/tCr at the right HIP in the MCI group decreased significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.05); however, there was no significant difference in the ratio of Cho/tCr in the left HIP and bilateral PCG between the two groups (p &amp;gt; 0.05). The correlation coefficient between MMSE/MoCA and the ratio of NAA/tCr was 0.49–0.56 in the bilateral HIP (p &amp;lt; 0.01). The best cutoff value of NAA/creatine (Cr) in the left HIP and the right HIP was 1.195 and 1.19. Sensitivity, specificity, and the Youden index (YDI) in the left HIP and the right HIP were (0.725, 0.803, 0.528) and (0.754, 0.803, 0.557), respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The level of metabolites in the HIP and the PCG of patients with MCI and of those with normal subjects has a certain correlation with the score of their MMSE and MoCA. When the value of NAA/tCr in the left HIP and right HIP is &amp;lt;1.19, it suggests that MCI may have occurred. According to this cutoff point, elderly patients with MCI in China could be screened.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Virus propagation methods generally use transformed cell lines to grow viruses from clinical specimens, which may force viruses to rapidly adapt to cell culture conditions, a process facilitated by high viral mutation rates. Upon propagation in VeroE6 cells, SARS-CoV-2 may mutate or delete the multibasic cleavage site (MBCS) in the spike protein. Previously, we showed that the MBCS facilitates serine protease-mediated entry into human airway cells (Mykytyn et al., 2021). Here, we report that propagating SARS-CoV-2 on the human airway cell line Calu-3 - that expresses serine proteases - prevents cell culture adaptations in the MBCS and directly adjacent to the MBCS (S686G). Similar results were obtained using a human airway organoid-based culture system for SARS-CoV-2 propagation. Thus, in-depth knowledge on the biology of a virus can be used to establish methods to prevent cell culture adaptation.</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Staufen1 in Human Neurodegeneration</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26069?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Mutations in the ATXN2 gene (CAG expansions ≥32 repeats) can be a rare cause of Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We recently reported that the stress granule (SG) protein Staufen1 (STAU1) was overabundant in neurodegenerative disorder spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) patient cells, animal models, and ALS‐TDP‐43 fibroblasts, and provided a link between SG formation and autophagy. We aimed to test if STAU1 overabundance has a role in the pathogenesis of other neurodegenerative diseases.


Methods
With multiple neurodegenerative patient‐derived cell models, animal models, and human postmortem ALS tissue, we evaluate STAU1 function using biochemical and immunohistological analyses.


Results
We demonstrate STAU1 overabundance and increased total and phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in fibroblast cells from patients with ALS with mutations in TDP‐43, patients with dementia with PSEN1 mutations, a patient with parkinsonism with MAPT mutation, Huntington's disease (HD) mutations, and SCA2 mutations. Increased STAU1 levels and mTOR activity were seen in human ALS spinal cord tissues as well as in animal models. Changes in STAU1 and mTOR protein levels were post‐transcriptional. Exogenous expression of STAU1 in wildtype cells was sufficient to activate mTOR and downstream targets and form SGs. Targeting STAU1 by RNAi normalized mTOR, suggesting a potential role for therapy in diseases associated with STAU1 overabundance.


Interpretation

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Amylin Analog Pramlintide Induces Migraine‐like Attacks in Patients</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26072?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Migraine is a prevalent and disabling neurological disease. Its genesis is poorly understood, and there remains unmet clinical need. We aimed to identify mechanisms and thus novel therapeutic targets for migraine using human models of migraine and translational models in animals, with emphasis on amylin, a close relative of calcitonin gene‐related peptide (CGRP).


Methods
Thirty‐six migraine without aura patients were enrolled in a randomized, double‐blind, 2‐way, crossover, positive‐controlled clinical trial study to receive infusion of an amylin analogue pramlintide or human αCGRP on 2 different experimental days. Furthermore, translational studies in cells and mouse models, and rat, mouse and human tissue samples were conducted.


Results
Thirty patients (88%) developed headache after pramlintide infusion, compared to 33 (97%) after CGRP (p = 0.375). Fourteen patients (41%) developed migraine‐like attacks after pramlintide infusion, compared to 19 patients (56%) after CGRP (p = 0.180). The pramlintide‐induced migraine‐like attacks had similar clinical characteristics to those induced by CGRP. There were differences between treatments in vascular parameters. Human receptor pharmacology studies showed that an amylin receptor likely mediates these pramlintide‐provoked effects, rather than the canonical CGRP receptor. Supporting this, preclinical experiments investigating symptoms associated with migraine showed that amylin treatment, like CGRP, caused cutaneous hypersensitivity and light aversion in mice.


Interpretation
Our findings propose amylin receptor agonism as a novel contributor to migraine pathogenesis. Greater therapeutic gains could therefore be made for migraine patients through dual amylin and CGRP receptor antagonism, rather than selectively targeting the canonical CGRP receptor.

The brain is a network system in which excitatory and inhibitory neurons keep activity balanced in the highly non-random connectivity pattern of the microconnectome. It is well known that the relative percentage of inhibitory neurons is much smaller than excitatory neurons in the cortex. So, in general, how inhibitory neurons can keep the balance with the surrounding excitatory neurons is an important question. There is much accumulated knowledge about this fundamental question. This study quantitatively evaluated the relatively higher functional contribution of inhibitory neurons in terms of not only properties of individual neurons, such as firing rate, but also in terms of topological mechanisms and controlling ability on other excitatory neurons. We combined simultaneous electrical recording (~2.5 hours) of ~1000 neurons in vitro, and quantitative evaluation of neuronal interactions including excitatory-inhibitory categorization. This study accurately defined recording brain anatomical targets, such as brain regions and cortical layers, by inter-referring MRI and immunostaining recordings. The interaction networks enabled us to quantify topological influence of individual neurons, in terms of controlling ability to other neurons. Especially, the result indicated that highly influential inhibitory neurons show higher controlling ability of other neurons than excitatory neurons, and are relatively often distributed in deeper layers of the cortex. Furthermore, the neurons having high controlling ability are more effectively limited in number than central nodes of k-cores, and these neurons also participate in more clustered motifs. In summary, this study suggested that the high controlling ability of inhibitory neurons is a key mechanism to keep balance with a large number of other excitatory neurons beyond simple higher firing rate. Application of the selection method of limited important neurons would be also applicable for the ability to effectively and selectively stimulate E/I imbalanced disease states.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/08xK9fPbAeM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Variation in the acoustic structure of vocal signals is important to communicate social information. However, relatively little is known about the features that receivers extract to decipher relevant social information. Here, we took an expansive, bottom-up approach to delineate the feature space that could be important for processing social information in zebra finch song. Using operant techniques, we discovered that female zebra finches can consistently discriminate brief song phrases (“motifs”) from different social contexts. We then applied machine learning algorithms to classify motifs based on thousands of time-series features and to uncover acoustic features for motif discrimination. In addition to highlighting classic acoustic features, the resulting algorithm revealed novel features for song discrimination, for example, measures of time irreversibility (i.e., the degree to which the statistical properties of the actual and time-reversed signal differ). Moreover, the algorithm accurately predicted female performance on individual motif exemplars. These data underscore and expand the promise of broad time-series phenotyping to acoustic analyses and social decision-making.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KiTCUWTx8Pk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: The Lbx1 lineage differentially contributes to inhibitory cell types of the dorsal cochlear nucleus, a cerebellum‐like structure, and the cerebellum</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25147?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Pancreatic transcription factor 1a (Ptf1a) expressing serial sister cell types of the mammalian cerebellum and dorsal cochlear nucleus are supposed to share genetic programs. We show that two out of three Ptf1a lineal cell types differ with respect to their Ladybird homeobox protein homolog 1 expression. Our results uncover an unexpected genetic incongruence.







Abstract
The dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) is a mammalian‐specific nucleus of the auditory system. Anatomically, it is classified as a cerebellum‐like structure. These structures are proposed to share genetic programs with the cerebellum. Previous analyses demonstrated that inhibitory serial sister cell types (SCTs) of the DCN and cerebellum are derived from the pancreatic transcription factor 1a (Ptf1a) lineage. Postmitotic neurons of the Ptf1a lineage often express the transcription factor Ladybird homeobox protein homolog 1 (Lbx1) which is involved in neuronal cell fate determination. Lbx1 is therefore an attractive candidate for a further component of the genetic program shared between the DCN and cerebellum. Here, we used cell‐type specific marker analysis in combination with an Lbx1 reporter mouse line to analyze in both tissues which cell types of the Ptf1a lineage express Lbx1. In the DCN, stellate cells and Purkinje‐like cartwheel cells were part of the Lbx1 lineage and Golgi cells were not, as determined by cell counts. In contrast, in the cerebellum, stellate cells and Golgi cells were part of the Lbx1 lineage and Purkinje cells were not. Hence, two out of three phenotypically similar cell types differed with respect to their Lbx1 expression. Our study demonstrates that Lbx1 is differentially recruited to the developmental genetic program of inhibitory neurons both within a given tissue and between the DCN and cerebellum. The differential expression of Lbx1 within the DCN and the cerebellum might contribute to the genetic individuation of the inhibitory SCTs to adapt to circuit specific tasks.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Using monosynaptic rabies virus tracing, we have identified the distribution of input cells to basolateral amygdala (BLA) neuronal subtypes defined by axonal projection patterns. Overall, central nucleus of amygdala‐, nucleus accumbens‐, ventral hippocampus‐projecting BLA neurons receive similar monosynaptic input from various brain regions. However, there are some preferential input patterns among the subtypes, which are likely to be attributed to the differential localization of the starter cells.







Abstract
The basolateral amygdala (BLA), a region critical for emotional processing, is the limbic hub that is connected with various brain regions. BLA neurons are classified into different subtypes that exhibit differential projection patterns and mediate distinct emotional behaviors; however, little is known about their presynaptic input patterns. In this study, we employed projection‐specific monosynaptic rabies virus tracing to identify the direct monosynaptic inputs to BLA subtypes. We found that each neuronal subtype receives long‐range projection input from specific brain regions. In contrast to their specific axonal projection patterns, all BLA neuronal subtypes exhibited relatively similar input patterns. This anatomical organization supports the idea that the BLA is a central integrator that associates sensory information in different modalities with valence and sends associative information to behaviorally relevant brain regions.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.642225</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Anatomical tracing, human clinical data, and stimulation functional imaging have firmly established the major role of the (neo-)cerebellum in cognition and emotion. Telencephalization characterized by the great expansion of associative cortices, especially the prefrontal one, has been associated with parallel expansion of the neocerebellar cortex, especially the lobule VII, and by an increased number of interconnections between these two cortical structures. These anatomical modifications underlie the implication of the neocerebellum in cognitive control of complex motor and non-motor tasks. In humans, resting state functional connectivity has been used to determine a thorough anatomo-functional parcellation of the neocerebellum. This technique has identified central networks involving the neocerebellum and subserving its cognitive function. Neocerebellum participates in all intrinsic connected networks such as central executive, default mode, salience, dorsal and ventral attentional, and language-dedicated networks. The central executive network constitutes the main circuit represented within the neocerebellar cortex. Cerebellar zones devoted to these intrinsic networks appear multiple, interdigitated, and spatially ordered in three gradients. Such complex neocerebellar organization enables the neocerebellum to monitor and synchronize the main networks involved in cognition and emotion, likely by computing internal models.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Mushroom bodies and reniform bodies coexisting in crabs cannot both be homologues of the insect mushroom body</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25152?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>The lateral protocerebrum of a shore crab possesses a stalked center, adjacent to the optic lobe, that supports long‐term visual habituation. The center has been claimed as the homologue of the insect mushroom body. However, the discovery of an inverted mushroom body (MB) equipped with the canonical features of columns (Clm) and calyces (Ca) supplied by thousands of globuli cells (gc) dismisses that claim. Comparisons across malacostracan crustaceans confirm that the habituation center is a reniform body (RB), first described by Bellonci in 1882.






Abstract
In one species of shore crab (Brachyura, Varunidae) a center that supports long‐term visual habituation and that matches the reniform body’s morphology has been claimed as a homologue of the insect mushroom body despite lacking traits that define it as such. The discovery in a related species of shore crab of a mushroom body possessing those defining traits renders that interpretation unsound. Two phenotypically distinct, coexisting centers cannot both be homologues of the insect mushroom body. The present commentary outlines the history of research leading to misidentification of the reniform body as a mushroom body. One conclusion is that if both centers support learning and memory, this would be viewed as a novel and fascinating attribute of the pancrustacean brain.

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Dichotomic Hippocampal Transcriptome After Glutamatergic vs. GABAergic Deletion of the Cannabinoid CB1 Receptor</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2021.660718</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain homeostasis is the dynamic equilibrium whereby physiological parameters are kept actively within a specific range. The homeostatic range is not fixed and may change throughout the individual's lifespan, or may be transiently modified in the presence of severe perturbations. The endocannabinoid system has emerged as a safeguard of homeostasis, e.g., it modulates neurotransmission and protects neurons from prolonged or excessively strong activation. We used genetically engineered mouse lines that lack the cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1) either in dorsal telencephalic glutamatergic or in forebrain GABAergic neurons to create new allostatic states, resulting from alterations in the excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance. Previous studies with these two mouse lines have shown dichotomic results in the context of behavior, neuronal morphology, and electrophysiology. Thus, we aimed at analyzing the transcriptomic profile of the hippocampal CA region from these mice in the basal condition and after a mild behavioral stimulation (open field). Our results provide insights into the gene networks that compensate chronic E/I imbalances. Among these, there are differentially expressed genes involved in neuronal and synaptic functions, synaptic plasticity, and the regulation of behavior. Interestingly, some of these genes, e.g., Rab3b, Crhbp, and Kcnn2, and related pathways showed a dichotomic expression, i.e., they are up-regulated in one mutant line and down-regulated in the other one. Subsequent interrogation on the source of the alterations at transcript level were applied using exon-intron split analysis. However, no strong directions toward transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation comparing both mouse lines were observed. Altogether, the dichotomic gene expression observed and their involved signaling pathways are of interest because they may act as “switches” to modulate the directionality of neural homeostasis, which then is relevant for pathologies, such as stress-related disorders and epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Suicidality Associated With Deep Brain Stimulation in Extrapyramidal Diseases: A Critical Review and Hypotheses on Neuroanatomical and Neuroimmune Mechanisms</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2021.632249</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a very well-established and effective treatment for patients with extrapyramidal diseases. Despite its generally favorable clinical efficacy, some undesirable outcomes associated with DBS have been reported. Among such complications are incidences of suicidal ideation (SI) and behavior (SB) in patients undergoing this neurosurgical procedure. However, causal associations between DBS and increased suicide risk are not demonstrated and they constitute a debated issue. In light of these observations, the main objective of this work is to provide a comprehensive and unbiased overview of the literature on suicide risk in patients who received subthalamic nucleus (STN) and internal part of globus pallidum (GPi) DBS treatment. Additionally, putative mechanisms that might be involved in the development of SI and SB in these patients as well as caveats associated with these hypotheses are introduced. Finally, we briefly propose some clinical implications, including therapeutic strategies addressing these potential disease mechanisms. While a mechanistic connection between DBS and suicidality remains a controversial topic that requires further investigation, it is of critical importance to consider suicide risk as an integral component of candidate selection and post-operative care in DBS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Adaptive Neural Decoder for Prosthetic Hand Control</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.590775</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The overarching goal was to resolve a major barrier to real-life prosthesis usability—the rapid degradation of prosthesis control systems, which require frequent recalibrations. Specifically, we sought to develop and test a motor decoder that provides (1) highly accurate, real-time movement response, and (2) unprecedented adaptability to dynamic changes in the amputee’s biological state, thereby supporting long-term integrity of control performance with few recalibrations. To achieve that, an adaptive motor decoder was designed to auto-switch between algorithms in real-time. The decoder detects the initial aggregate motoneuron spiking activity from the motor pool, then engages the optimal parameter settings for decoding the motoneuron spiking activity in that particular state. “Clear-box” testing of decoder performance under varied physiological conditions and post-amputation complications was conducted by comparing the movement output of a simulated prosthetic hand as driven by the decoded signal vs. as driven by the actual signal. Pearson’s correlation coefficient and Normalized Root Mean Square Error were used to quantify the accuracy of the decoder’s output. Our results show that the decoder algorithm extracted the features of the intended movement and drove the simulated prosthetic hand accurately with real-time performance (&amp;lt;10 ms) (Pearson’s correlation coefficient &amp;gt;0.98 to &amp;gt;0.99 and Normalized Root Mean Square Error &amp;lt;13–5%). Further, the decoder robustly decoded the spiking activity of multi-speed inputs, inputs generated from reversed motoneuron recruitment, and inputs reflecting substantial biological heterogeneity of motoneuron properties, also in real-time. As the amputee’s neuromodulatory state changes throughout the day and the electrical properties and ratio of slower vs. faster motoneurons shift over time post-amputation, the motor decoder presented here adapts to such changes in real-time and is thus expected to greatly enhance and extend the usability of prostheses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Aim&lt;p&gt;The objective of this work was to demonstrate the usefulness of a novel statistical method to study the impact of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on brain connectivity in patients with depression using different stimulation protocols, i.e., 1 Hz repetitive TMS over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (protocol G1), 10 Hz repetitive TMS over the left DLPFC (G2), and intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) consisting of three 50 Hz burst bundle repeated at 5 Hz frequency (G3).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Electroencephalography (EEG) connectivity analysis was performed using Directed Transfer Function (DTF) and a set of 21 indices based on graph theory. The statistical analysis of graph-theoretic indices consisted of a combination of the k-NN rule, the leave-one-out method, and a statistical test using a 2 × 2 contingency table.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Our new statistical approach allowed for selection of the best set of graph-based indices derived from DTF, and for differentiation between conditions (i.e., before and after TMS) and between TMS protocols. The effects of TMS was found to differ based on frequency band.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;A set of four brain asymmetry measures were particularly useful to study protocol- and frequency-dependent effects of TMS on brain connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;Significance&lt;p&gt;The new approach would allow for better evaluation of the therapeutic effects of TMS and choice of the most appropriate stimulation protocol.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: ASD-SAENet: A Sparse Autoencoder, and Deep-Neural Network Model for Detecting Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Using fMRI Data</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.654315</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogenous neurodevelopmental disorder which is characterized by impaired communication, and limited social interactions. The shortcomings of current clinical approaches which are based exclusively on behavioral observation of symptomology, and poor understanding of the neurological mechanisms underlying ASD necessitates the identification of new biomarkers that can aid in study of brain development, and functioning, and can lead to accurate and early detection of ASD. In this paper, we developed a deep-learning model called ASD-SAENet for classifying patients with ASD from typical control subjects using fMRI data. We designed and implemented a sparse autoencoder (SAE) which results in optimized extraction of features that can be used for classification. These features are then fed into a deep neural network (DNN) which results in superior classification of fMRI brain scans more prone to ASD. Our proposed model is trained to optimize the classifier while improving extracted features based on both reconstructed data error and the classifier error. We evaluated our proposed deep-learning model using publicly available Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) dataset collected from 17 different research centers, and include more than 1,035 subjects. Our extensive experimentation demonstrate that ASD-SAENet exhibits comparable accuracy (70.8%), and superior specificity (79.1%) for the whole dataset as compared to other methods. Further, our experiments demonstrate superior results as compared to other state-of-the-art methods on 12 out of the 17 imaging centers exhibiting superior generalizability across different data acquisition sites and protocols. The implemented code is available on GitHub portal of our lab at: https://github.com/pcdslab/ASD-SAENet.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: A Deep Learning Approach for Automatic Seizure Detection in Children With Epilepsy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.650050</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Over the last few decades, electroencephalogram (EEG) has become one of the most vital tools used by physicians to diagnose several neurological disorders of the human brain and, in particular, to detect seizures. Because of its peculiar nature, the consequent impact of epileptic seizures on the quality of life of patients made the precise diagnosis of epilepsy extremely essential. Therefore, this article proposes a novel deep-learning approach for detecting seizures in pediatric patients based on the classification of raw multichannel EEG signal recordings that are minimally pre-processed. The new approach takes advantage of the automatic feature learning capabilities of a two-dimensional deep convolution autoencoder (2D-DCAE) linked to a neural network-based classifier to form a unified system that is trained in a supervised way to achieve the best classification accuracy between the ictal and interictal brain state signals. For testing and evaluating our approach, two models were designed and assessed using three different EEG data segment lengths and a 10-fold cross-validation scheme. Based on five evaluation metrics, the best performing model was a supervised deep convolutional autoencoder (SDCAE) model that uses a bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) – based classifier, and EEG segment length of 4 s. Using the public dataset collected from the Children’s Hospital Boston (CHB) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), this model has obtained 98.79 ± 0.53% accuracy, 98.72 ± 0.77% sensitivity, 98.86 ± 0.53% specificity, 98.86 ± 0.53% precision, and an F1-score of 98.79 ± 0.53%, respectively. Based on these results, our new approach was able to present one of the most effective seizure detection methods compared to other existing state-of-the-art methods applied to the same dataset.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Persistent cohomology is a powerful technique for discovering topological structure in data. Strategies for its use in neuroscience are still undergoing development. We comprehensively and rigorously assess its performance in simulated neural recordings of the brain's spatial representation system. Grid, head direction, and conjunctive cell populations each span low-dimensional topological structures embedded in high-dimensional neural activity space. We evaluate the ability for persistent cohomology to discover these structures for different dataset dimensions, variations in spatial tuning, and forms of noise. We quantify its ability to decode simulated animal trajectories contained within these topological structures. We also identify regimes under which mixtures of populations form product topologies that can be detected. Our results reveal how dataset parameters affect the success of topological discovery and suggest principles for applying persistent cohomology, as well as persistent homology, to experimental neural recordings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.673205</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Keap1-Nrf2 signaling axis is a validated and promising target for cellular defense and survival pathways. This minireview discusses the potential off-target effects and their impact on future drug development originating from Keap1-targeting small molecules that function as displacement activators of the redox-sensitive transcription factor Nrf2. We argue that small-molecule displacement activators, similarly to electrophiles, will release both Nrf2 and other Keap1 client proteins from the ubiquitin ligase complex. This non-specificity is likely unavoidable and may result in off-target effects during Nrf2 activation by targeting Keap1. The small molecule displacement activators may also target Kelch domains in proteins other than Keap1, causing additional off-target effects unless designed to ensure specificity for the Kelch domain only in Keap1. A potentially promising and alternative therapeutic approach to overcome this non-specificity emerging from targeting Keap1 is to inhibit the Nrf2 repressor Bach1 for constitutive activation of the Nrf2 pathway and bypass the Keap1-Nrf2 complex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 pandemic has already produced great impacts on global health security and social-economy. Elderly, particularly those with underlying diseases, are suffering from higher fatality rate. Neurodegenerative diseases are a group of incurable neurological disorders of loss of neuron and/or myelin sheath, which affect hundreds of millions of elderly populations and usually need long-term care. Older population is one of the most vulnerable to COVID-19 pandemic. In this report, we reviewed the current status of COVID-19 on the patients with several neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, prion disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Meanwhile, the potential mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases were also summarized.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Exercise Training-Related Changes in Cortical Gray Matter Diffusivity and Cognitive Function in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Healthy Older Adults</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.645258</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) are at an elevated risk of dementia and exhibit deficits in cognition and cortical gray matter (GM) volume, thickness, and microstructure. Meanwhile, exercise training appears to preserve brain function and macrostructure may help delay or prevent the onset of dementia in individuals with MCI. Yet, our understanding of the neurophysiological effects of exercise training in individuals with MCI remains limited. Recent work suggests that the measures of gray matter microstructure using diffusion imaging may be sensitive to early cognitive and neurophysiological changes in the aging brain. Therefore, this study is aimed to determine the effects of exercise training in cognition and cortical gray matter microstructure in individuals with MCI vs. cognitively healthy older adults. Fifteen MCI participants and 17 cognitively intact controls (HC) volunteered for a 12-week supervised walking intervention. Following the intervention, MCI and HC saw improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness, performance on Trial 1 of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), a measure of verbal memory, and the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT), a measure of verbal fluency. After controlling for age, a voxel-wise analysis of cortical gray matter diffusivity showed individuals with MCI exhibited greater increases in mean diffusivity (MD) in the left insular cortex than HC. This increase in MD was positively associated with improvements in COWAT performance. Additionally, after controlling for age, the voxel-wise analysis indicated a main effect of Time with both groups experiencing an increase in left insular and left and right cerebellar MD. Increases in left insular diffusivity were similarly found to be positively associated with improvements in COWAT performance in both groups, while increases in cerebellar MD were related to gains in episodic memory performance. These findings suggest that exercise training may be related to improvements in neural circuits that govern verbal fluency performance in older adults through the microstructural remodeling of cortical gray matter. Furthermore, changes in left insular cortex microstructure may be particularly relevant to improvements in verbal fluency among individuals diagnosed with MCI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Interplay Between Microglia and Alzheimer’s Disease—Focus on the Most Relevant Risks: APOE Genotype, Sex and Age</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.631827</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As the main immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), microglia regulates normal development, homeostasis and general brain physiology. These functions put microglia at the forefront of CNS repair and recovery. Uncontrolled activation of microglia is related to the course of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease. It is clear that the classic pathologies of amyloid β (Aβ) and Tau are usually accompanied by the activation of microglia, and the activation of microglia also serves as an early event in the pathogenesis of AD. Therefore, during the occurrence and development of AD, the key susceptibility factors for AD—apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, sex and age—may further interact with microglia to exacerbate neurodegeneration. In this review, we discuss the role of microglia in the progression of AD related to the three risk factors for AD: APOE genotype, sex and aging. APOE-expressing microglia accumulates around Aβ plaques, and the presence of APOE4 may disrupt the phagocytosis of Aβ aggregates and aggravate neurodegeneration in Tau disease models. In addition, females have a high incidence of AD, and normal female microglia and estrogen have protective effects under normal conditions. However, under the influence of AD, female microglia seem to lose their protective effect and instead accelerate the course of AD. Aging, another major risk factor, may increase the sensitivity of microglia, leading to the exacerbation of microglial dysfunction in elderly AD. Obviously, in the role of microglia in AD, the three main risk factors of APOE, sex, and aging are not independent and have synergistic effects that contribute to the risk of AD. Moreover, new microglia can replace dysfunctional microglia after microglial depletion, which is a new promising strategy for AD treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Can egalitarian norms or conventions survive the presence of dominant individuals who are ensured of victory in conflicts? We investigate the interaction of power asymmetry and partner choice in games of conflict over a contested resource. Previous models of cooperation do not include both power inequality and partner choice. Furthermore, models that do include power inequalities assume a static game where a bully’s advantage does not change. They have therefore not attempted to model complex and realistic properties of social interaction. Here, we introduce three models to study the emergence and resilience of cooperation among unequals when interaction is random, when individuals can choose their partners, and where power asymmetries dynamically depend on accumulated payoffs. We find that the ability to avoid bullies with higher competitive ability afforded by partner choice mostly restores cooperative conventions and that the competitive hierarchy never forms. Partner choice counteracts the hyper dominance of bullies who are isolated in the network and eliminates the need for others to coordinate in a coalition. When competitive ability dynamically depends on cumulative payoffs, complex cycles of coupled network-strategy-rank changes emerge. Effective collaborators gain popularity (and thus power), adopt aggressive behavior, get isolated, and ultimately lose power. Neither the network nor behavior converge to a stable equilibrium. Despite the instability of power dynamics, the cooperative convention in the population remains stable overall and long-term inequality is completely eliminated. The interaction between partner choice and dynamic power asymmetry is crucial for these results: without partner choice, bullies cannot be isolated, and without dynamic power asymmetry, bullies do not lose their power even when isolated. We analytically identify a single critical point that marks a phase transition in all three iterations of our models. This critical point is where the first individual breaks from the convention and cycles start to emerge.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/q802JuLBljY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: An extended catalogue of tandem alternative splice sites in human tissue transcriptomes</title>

Tandem alternative splice sites (TASS) is a special class of alternative splicing events that are characterized by a close tandem arrangement of splice sites. Most TASS lack functional characterization and are believed to arise from splicing noise. Based on the RNA-seq data from the Genotype Tissue Expression project, we present an extended catalogue of TASS in healthy human tissues and analyze their tissue-specific expression. The expression of TASS is usually dominated by one major splice site (maSS), while the expression of minor splice sites (miSS) is at least an order of magnitude lower. Among 46k miSS with sufficient read support, 9k (20%) are significantly expressed above the expected noise level, and among them 2.5k are expressed tissue-specifically. We found significant correlations between tissue-specific expression of RNA-binding proteins (RBP), tissue-specific expression of miSS, and miSS response to RBP inactivation by shRNA. In combination with RBP profiling by eCLIP, this allowed prediction of novel cases of tissue-specific splicing regulation including a miSS in &lt;i&gt;QKI&lt;/i&gt; mRNA that is likely regulated by &lt;i&gt;PTBP1&lt;/i&gt;. The analysis of human primary cell transcriptomes suggested that both tissue-specific and cell-type-specific factors contribute to the regulation of miSS expression. More than 20% of tissue-specific miSS affect structured protein regions and may adjust protein-protein interactions or modify the stability of the protein core. The significantly expressed miSS evolve under the same selection pressure as maSS, while other miSS lack signatures of evolutionary selection and conservation. Using mixture models, we estimated that not more than 15% of maSS and not more than 54% of tissue-specific miSS are noisy, while the proportion of noisy splice sites among non-significantly expressed miSS is above 63%.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ApT8i7YI2tk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

High-throughput spatial-transcriptomics RNA sequencing (sptRNA-seq) based on in-situ capturing technologies has recently been developed to spatially resolve transcriptome-wide mRNA expressions mapped to the captured locations in a tissue sample. Due to the low RNA capture efficiency by in-situ capturing and the complication of tissue section preparation, sptRNA-seq data often only provides an incomplete profiling of the gene expressions over the spatial regions of the tissue. In this paper, we introduce a graph-regularized tensor completion model for imputing the missing mRNA expressions in sptRNA-seq data, namely FIST, Fast Imputation of Spatially-resolved transcriptomes by graph-regularized Tensor completion. We first model sptRNA-seq data as a 3-way sparse tensor in genes (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-mode) and the (&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;) spatial coordinates (&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;-mode and &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;-mode) of the observed gene expressions, and then consider the imputation of the unobserved entries or fibers as a tensor completion problem in Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD) form. To improve the imputation of highly sparse sptRNA-seq data, we also introduce a protein-protein interaction network to add prior knowledge of gene functions, and a spatial graph to capture the the spatial relations among the capture spots. The tensor completion model is then regularized by a Cartesian product graph of protein-protein interaction network and the spatial graph to capture the high-order relations in the tensor. In the experiments, FIST was tested on ten 10x Genomics Visium spatial transcriptomic datasets of different tissue sections with cross-validation among the known entries in the imputation. FIST significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art methods for single-cell RNAseq data imputation. We also demonstrate that both the spatial graph and PPI network play an important role in improving the imputation. In a case study, we further analyzed the gene clusters obtained from the imputed gene expressions to show that the imputations by FIST indeed capture the spatial characteristics in the gene expressions and reveal functions that are highly relevant to three different kinds of tissues in mouse kidney.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4Mfo7VVeeZs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation induces recovery in animal models of central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Although the replacement of lost endogenous cells was originally proposed as the primary healing mechanism of NSC grafts, it is now clear that transplanted NSCs operate via multiple mechanisms, including the horizontal exchange of therapeutic cargoes to host cells via extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs are membrane particles trafficking nucleic acids, proteins, metabolites and metabolic enzymes, lipids, and entire organelles. However, the function and the contribution of these cargoes to the broad therapeutic effects of NSCs are yet to be fully understood. Mitochondrial dysfunction is an established feature of several inflammatory and degenerative CNS disorders, most of which are potentially treatable with exogenous stem cell therapeutics. Herein, we investigated the hypothesis that NSCs release and traffic functional mitochondria via EVs to restore mitochondrial function in target cells. Untargeted proteomics revealed a significant enrichment of mitochondrial proteins spontaneously released by NSCs in EVs. Morphological and functional analyses confirmed the presence of ultrastructurally intact mitochondria within EVs with conserved membrane potential and respiration. We found that the transfer of these mitochondria from EVs to mtDNA-deficient L929 Rho&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; cells rescued mitochondrial function and increased Rho&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; cell survival. Furthermore, the incorporation of mitochondria from EVs into inflammatory mononuclear phagocytes restored normal mitochondrial dynamics and cellular metabolism and reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory markers in target cells. When transplanted in an animal model of multiple sclerosis, exogenous NSCs actively transferred mitochondria to mononuclear phagocytes and induced a significant amelioration of clinical deficits. Our data provide the first evidence that NSCs deliver functional mitochondria to target cells via EVs, paving the way for the development of novel (a)cellular approaches aimed at restoring mitochondrial dysfunction not only in multiple sclerosis, but also in degenerative neurological diseases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/AYPHUFuFydY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Here, the ultraviolet (short‐wavelength sensitive 1, sws1) opsin of rainbow trout was partially knocked out using the CRISPR/Cas9 editing system. Knockouts showed a disrupted outer retina consisting of diminished opsin expression, absent or stunted outer segments, photoreceptor degeneration, and loss of mosaic regularity. These findings indicate developmental roles of visual opsins beyond phototransduction.







Abstract
Visual opsins are proteins expressed by retinal photoreceptors that capture light to begin the process of phototransduction. In vertebrates, the two types of photoreceptors (rods and cones) express one or multiple opsins and are distributed in variable patterns across the retina. Some cones form opsin retinal gradients, as in the mouse, whereas others form more demarcated opsin domains, as in the lattice‐like mosaic retinas of teleost fishes. Reduced rod opsin (rh1) expression in mouse, zebrafish, and African clawed frog results in lack of photoreceptor outer segments (i.e., the cilium that houses the opsins) and, in the case of the mouse, to retinal degeneration. The effects of diminished cone opsin expression have only been studied in the mouse where knockout of the short‐wavelength sensitive 1 (sws1) opsin leads to ventral retinal cones lacking outer segments, but no retinal degeneration. Here we show that, following CRISPR/Cas9 injections that targeted knockout of the sws1 opsin in rainbow trout, fish with diminished sws1 opsin expression exhibited a variety of developmental defects including head and eye malformations, underdeveloped outer retina, mislocalized opsin expression, cone degeneration, and mosaic irregularity. All photoreceptor types were affected even though sws1 is only expressed in the single cones of wild fish. Our results reveal unprecedented developmental defects associated with diminished cone opsin expression and suggest that visual opsin genes are involved in regulatory processes that precede photoreceptor differentiation.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: ABCA7 Regulates Brain Fatty Acid Metabolism During LPS-Induced Acute Inflammation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.647974</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 7 (ABCA7) gene is one of the significant susceptibility loci for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Furthermore, ABCA7 loss of function variants resulting from premature termination codon in the gene are associated with increased risk for AD. ABCA7 belongs to the ABC transporter family, which mediates the transport of diverse metabolites across the cell membrane. ABCA7 is also involved in modulating immune responses. Because the immune system and lipid metabolism causatively engage in the pathogenesis of AD, we investigated how ABCA7 haplodeficiency modulates the metabolic profile in mouse brains during acute immune response using a metabolomics approach through LC/Q-TOF-MS. Peripheral lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation substantially influenced the metabolite content in the cortex, however, the effect on metabolic profiles in Abca7 heterozygous knockout mice (Abca7&lt;sup&gt;±&lt;/sup&gt;) was modest compared to that in the control wild-type mice. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) of the metabolomics dataset identified two modules influenced by LPS administration and ABCA7 haplodeficiency, in which glycerophospholipid metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism, and α-linolenic acid metabolism were identified as major pathways. Consistent with these findings, we also found that LPS stimulation increased the brain levels of eicosapentaenoic acid, oleic acid, and palmitic acid in Abca7&lt;sup&gt;±&lt;/sup&gt; mice, but not control mice. Together, our results indicate that ABCA7 is involved in the crosstalk between fatty acid metabolism and inflammation in the brain, and disturbances in these pathways may contribute to the risk for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Adaptive Filtering for Improved EEG-Based Mental Workload Assessment of Ambulant Users</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.611962</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recently, due to the emergence of mobile electroencephalography (EEG) devices, assessment of mental workload in highly ecological settings has gained popularity. In such settings, however, motion and other common artifacts have been shown to severely hamper signal quality and to degrade mental workload assessment performance. Here, we show that classical EEG enhancement algorithms, conventionally developed to remove ocular and muscle artifacts, are not optimal in settings where participant movement (e.g., walking or running) is expected. As such, an adaptive filter is proposed that relies on an accelerometer-based referential signal. We show that when combined with classical algorithms, accurate mental workload assessment is achieved. To test the proposed algorithm, data from 48 participants was collected as they performed the Revised Multi-Attribute Task Battery-II (MATB-II) under a low and a high workload setting, either while walking/jogging on a treadmill, or using a stationary exercise bicycle. Accuracy as high as 95% could be achieved with a random forest based mental workload classifier with ambulant users. Moreover, an increase in gamma activity was found in the parietal cortex, suggesting a connection between sensorimotor integration, attention, and workload in ambulant users.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.583678</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a major neurodegenerative disease characterized by massive degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, α-synuclein-containing Lewy bodies, and neuroinflammation. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression and treatment. A variety of MR methods are available to characterize neurodegeneration and other disease features such as iron accumulation and metabolic changes in animal models of PD. This review aims at giving an overview of how those physiopathological features of PD have been investigated using various MR methods in rodent models. Toxin-based and genetic-based models of PD are first described. MR methods for neurodegeneration evaluation, iron load, and metabolism alterations are then detailed, and the main findings are provided in those models. Ultimately, future directions are suggested for neuroinflammation and neuromelanin evaluations in new animal models.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Effects of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) on Cognitive Performance and Cerebral Oxygen Hemodynamics: A Systematic Review</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.623315</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: There is increasing evidence to support the efficacy of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applications in cognitive augmentation and rehabilitation. Neuromodulation achieved with tDCS may further regulate regional cerebral perfusion affiliated through the neurovascular unit; however, components of cerebral perfusion decrease across aging. A novel neuroimaging approach, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), can aid in quantifying these regional perfusional changes. To date, the interaction of the effects of tDCS on cognitive performance across the lifespan and obtained fNIRS hemodynamic responses remain unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: This review aims to examine the effects of tDCS on cognitive performance and fNIRS hemodynamic responses within the context of cognitive aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Six databases were searched for studies. Quality appraisal and data extraction were conducted by two independent reviewers. Meta-analysis was carried out to determine overall and subgroup effect sizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Eight studies met inclusion criteria. The overall effect size demonstrates that tDCS can alter cognitive performance and fNIRS signals, with aging being a potential intermediary in tDCS efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: From the studies included, the effects of tDCS on cognitive performance and fNIRS metrics are most prominent in young healthy adults and appear to become less robust with increasing age. Given the small number of studies included in this review further investigation is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: A Neuroscience Levels of Explanation Approach to the Mind and the Brain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.649679</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The relation between mental states and brain states is important in computational neuroscience, and in psychiatry in which interventions with medication are made on brain states to alter mental states. The relation between the brain and the mind has puzzled philosophers for centuries. Here a neuroscience approach is proposed in which events at the sub-neuronal, neuronal, and neuronal network levels take place simultaneously to perform a computation that can be described at a high level as a mental state, with content about the world. It is argued that as the processes at the different levels of explanation take place at the same time, they are linked by a non-causal supervenient relationship: causality can best be described in brains as operating within but not between levels. This allows the supervenient (e.g., mental) properties to be emergent, though once understood at the mechanistic levels they may seem less emergent, and expected. This mind-brain theory allows mental events to be different in kind from the mechanistic events that underlie them; but does not lead one to argue that mental events cause brain events, or vice versa: they are different levels of explanation of the operation of the computational system. This approach may provide a way of thinking about brains and minds that is different from dualism and from reductive physicalism, and which is rooted in the computational processes that are fundamental to understanding brain and mental events, and that mean that the mental and mechanistic levels are linked by the computational process being performed. Explanations at the different levels of operation may be useful in different ways. For example, if we wish to understand how arithmetic is performed in the brain, description at the mental level of the algorithm being computed will be useful. But if the brain operates to result in mental disorders, then understanding the mechanism at the neural processing level may be more useful, in for example, the treatment of psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Effects of Locomotion in Auditory Cortex Are Not Mediated by the VIP Network</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.618881</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Movement has a prominent impact on activity in sensory cortex, but has opposing effects on visual and auditory cortex. Both cortical areas feature a vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing (VIP) disinhibitory circuit, which in visual cortex contributes to the effect of running. In auditory cortex, however, the role of VIP circuitry in running effects remains poorly understood. Running and optogenetic VIP activation are known to differentially modulate sound-evoked activity in auditory cortex, but it is unknown how these effects vary across cortical layers, and whether laminar differences in the roles of VIP circuitry could contribute to the substantial diversity that has been observed in the effects of both movement and VIP activation. Here we asked whether VIP neurons contribute to the effects of running, across the layers of auditory cortex. We found that both running and optogenetic activation of VIP neurons produced diverse changes in the firing rates of auditory cortical neurons, but with distinct effects on spontaneous and evoked activity and with different patterns across cortical layers. On average, running increased spontaneous firing rates but decreased evoked firing rates, resulting in a reduction of the neuronal encoding of sound. This reduction in sound encoding was observed in all cortical layers, but was most pronounced in layer 2/3. In contrast, VIP activation increased both spontaneous and evoked firing rates, and had no net population-wide effect on sound encoding, but strongly suppressed sound encoding in layer 4 narrow-spiking neurons. These results suggest that VIP activation and running act independently, which we then tested by comparing the arithmetic sum of the two effects measured separately to the actual combined effect of running and VIP activation, which were closely matched. We conclude that the effects of locomotion in auditory cortex are not mediated by the VIP network.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Rapamycin Added to Diet in Late Mid-Life Delays Age-Related Hearing Loss in UMHET4 Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.658972</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Our previous study demonstrated rapamycin added to diet at 4 months of age had significantly less age-related outer hair cell loss in the basal half of the cochlea at 22 months of age compared to mice without rapamycin. The present study tested adding rapamycin to diet later in life, at 14 months of age, and added a longitudinal assessment of auditory brain stem response (ABR). The present study used UMHET4 mice, a 4 way cross in which all grandparental strains lack the Cdh23&lt;sup&gt;753A&lt;/sup&gt; allele that predisposes to early onset, progressive hearing loss. UMHET4 mice typically have normal hearing until 16–17 months, then exhibit threshold shifts at low frequencies/apical cochlea and later in more basal high frequency regions. ABR thresholds at 4, 12, 24, and 48 kHz were assessed at 12, 18, and 24 months of age and compared to baseline ABR thresholds acquired at 5 months of age to determine threshold shifts (TS). There was no TS at 12 months of age at any frequency tested. At 18 months of age mice with rapamycin added to diet at 14 months had a significantly lower mean TS at 4 and 12 kHz compared to mice on control diet with no significant difference at 24 and 48 kHz. At 24 months of age, the mean 4 kHz TS in rapamycin diet group was no longer significantly lower than the control diet group, while the 12 kHz mean remained significantly lower. Mean TS at 24 and 48 kHz in the rapamycin diet group became significantly lower than in the control diet group at 24 months. Hair cell counts at 24 months showed large loss in the apical half of most rapamycin and control diet mice cochleae with no significant difference between groups. There was only mild outer hair cell loss in the basal half of rapamycin and control diet mice cochleae with no significant difference between groups. The results show that a later life addition of rapamycin can decrease age-related hearing loss in the mouse model, however, it also suggests that this decrease is a delay/deceleration rather than a complete prevention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Real-Time Simulation of a Cerebellar Scaffold Model on Graphics Processing Units</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.623552</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Large-scale simulation of detailed computational models of neuronal microcircuits plays a prominent role in reproducing and predicting the dynamics of the microcircuits. To reconstruct a microcircuit, one must choose neuron and synapse models, placements, connectivity, and numerical simulation methods according to anatomical and physiological constraints. For reconstruction and refinement, it is useful to be able to replace one module easily while leaving the others as they are. One way to achieve this is via a scaffolding approach, in which a simulation code is built on independent modules for placements, connections, and network simulations. Owing to the modularity of functions, this approach enables researchers to improve the performance of the entire simulation by simply replacing a problematic module with an improved one. Casali et al. (2019) developed a spiking network model of the cerebellar microcircuit using this approach, and while it reproduces electrophysiological properties of cerebellar neurons, it takes too much computational time. Here, we followed this scaffolding approach and replaced the simulation module with an accelerated version on graphics processing units (GPUs). Our cerebellar scaffold model ran roughly 100 times faster than the original version. In fact, our model is able to run faster than real time, with good weak and strong scaling properties. To demonstrate an application of real-time simulation, we implemented synaptic plasticity mechanisms at parallel fiber–Purkinje cell synapses, and carried out simulation of behavioral experiments known as gain adaptation of optokinetic response. We confirmed that the computer simulation reproduced experimental findings while being completed in real time. Actually, a computer simulation for 2 s of the biological time completed within 750 ms. These results suggest that the scaffolding approach is a promising concept for gradual development and refactoring of simulation codes for large-scale elaborate microcircuits. Moreover, a real-time version of the cerebellar scaffold model, which is enabled by parallel computing technology owing to GPUs, may be useful for large-scale simulations and engineering applications that require real-time signal processing and motor control.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Analysis of Hemichannels and Gap Junctions: Application and Extension of the Passive Transmembrane Ion Transport Model</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.596953</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electrical synaptic transmission is an essential form of interneuronal communication which is mediated by gap junctions that permit ion flow. Three gene families (connexins, innexins, and pannexins) have evolved to form gap junctional channels. Each gap junctional channel is formed by the docking of the hemichannel of one cell with the corresponding hemichannel of an adjacent cell. To date, there has been a lack of study models to describe this structure in detail. In this study, we demonstrate that numerical simulations suggest that the passive transmembrane ion transport model, based on the generality of ion channels, also applies to hemichannels in non-junctional plasma membranes. On this basis, we established a gap junctional channel model, which describes hemichannels' docking. We simulated homotypic and heterotypic gap junctions formed by connexins, innexins, and pannexins. Based on the numerical results and our theoretical model, we discussed the physiology of hemichannels and gap junctions, including ion blockage of hemichannels, voltage gating of gap junctions, and asymmetry and delay of electrical synaptic transmission, for which the numerical simulations are first comprehensively realized.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: NIA‐AA Alzheimer's Disease Framework: Clinical Characterization of Stages</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26071?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Background
To operationalize the National Institute on Aging – Alzheimer's Association (NIA‐AA) Research Framework for Alzheimer's Disease 6‐stage continuum of clinical progression for persons with abnormal amyloid.


Methods
The Mayo Clinic Study of Aging is a population‐based longitudinal study of aging and cognitive impairment in Olmsted County, Minnesota. We evaluated persons without dementia having 3 consecutive clinical visits. Measures for cross‐sectional categories included objective cognitive impairment (OBJ) and function (FXN). Measures for change included subjective cognitive impairment (SCD), objective cognitive change (ΔOBJ), and new onset of neurobehavioral symptoms (ΔNBS). We calculated frequencies of the stages using different cutoff points and assessed stability of the stages over 15 months.


Results
Among 243 abnormal amyloid participants, the frequencies of the stages varied with age: 66 to 90% were classified as stage 1 at age 50 but at age 80, 24 to 36% were stage 1, 32 to 47% were stage 2, 18 to 27% were stage 3, 1 to 3% were stage 4 to 6, and 3 to 9% were indeterminate. Most stage 2 participants were classified as stage 2 because of abnormal ΔOBJ only (44–59%), whereas 11 to 21% had SCD only, and 9 to 13% had ΔNBS only. Short‐term stability varied by stage and OBJ cutoff points but the most notable changes were seen in stage 2 with 38 to 63% remaining stable, 4 to 13% worsening, and 24 to 41% improving (moving to stage 1).


Interpretation
The frequency of the stages varied by age and the precise membership fluctuated by the parameters used to define the stages. The staging framework may require revisions before it can be adopted for clinical trials. ANN NEUROL 2021</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Evidence of impaired naming in patients with hippocampal amnesia</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23325?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Object naming involves accessing meaning and retrieving the associated word form from remote semantic memory. Historically, previously acquired semantic knowledge (i.e., remote semantic memory) was thought to be independent of the hippocampus via neocortical consolidation. This view is based on evidence demonstrating a dissociation in behavior in patients with hippocampal amnesia: amnesic patients are impaired in acquiring new vocabulary yet can name and define previously acquired words. More recently, the view that remote semantic memory is hippocampus‐independent has been challenged by the documentation of disruptions in aspects of remote semantic memory in patients with hippocampal amnesia, particularly in language use and depth of semantic knowledge. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that the hippocampus plays a long‐term role in remote semantic memory. We tested amnesic patients and demographically matched healthy comparison participants in an extensive naming task using photographic images of objects normalized for familiarity, object agreement, and visual complexity. Amnesic patients were less likely to correctly name objects than healthy comparison participants. Further, amnesic patients' performance worsened for words that were less familiar, more visually complex, and had less object agreement. These findings suggest that the hippocampus may play a long‐term role in semantic memory processes, rather than a time‐limited role in the initial acquisition of semantic information, and that hippocampal damage can disrupt object naming.</content:encoded>

Wild animals face novel environmental threats from human activities that may occur along a gradient of interactions with humans. Recent work has shown that merely living close to humans has major implications for a variety of antipredator traits and physiological responses. Here, we hypothesize that when human presence protects prey from their genuine predators (as sometimes seen in urban areas and at some tourist sites), this predator shield, followed by a process of habituation to humans, decouples commonly associated traits related to coping styles, which results in a new range of phenotypes. Such individuals are characterized by low aggressiveness and physiological stress responses, but have enhanced behavioral plasticity, boldness, and cognitive abilities. We refer to these individuals as “preactive,” because their physiological and behavioral coping style falls outside the classical proactive/reactive coping styles. While there is some support for this new coping style, formal multivariate studies are required to investigate behavioral and physiological responses to anthropogenic activities.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/yQhbIdrHJOw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The central complex is an insect brain area controlling spatial orientation. Immunolabeling in 20 species ranging from firebrats to flies shows that the cellular distribution of the dopamine‐synthesizing enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase in the central complex is largely conserved but reveals additional novel cell types in flies and water striders.







Abstract
Dopamine acts as a neurohormone and neurotransmitter in the insect nervous system and controls a variety of physiological processes. Dopaminergic neurons also innervate the central complex (CX), a multisensory center of the insect brain involved in sky compass navigation, goal‐directed locomotion and sleep control. To infer a possible influence of evolutionary history and lifestyle on the neurochemical architecture of the CX, we have studied the distribution of neurons immunoreactive to tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate‐limiting enzyme in dopamine biosynthesis. Analysis of representatives from 12 insect orders ranging from firebrats to flies revealed high conservation of immunolabeled neurons. One type of TH‐immunoreactive neuron was found in all species studied. The neurons have somata in the pars intercerebralis, arborizations in the lateral accessory lobes, and axonal ramifications in the central body and noduli. In all pterygote species a second type of tangential neuron of the upper division of the central body was TH‐immunoreactive. The neurons have cell bodies near the calyces and arborizations in the superior protocerebrum. Both types of neuron showed species‐specific variations in cell number and in the innervated areas outside and inside the CX. Additional neurons were found in only two taxa: one type of columnar neuron showed TH immunostaining in the water strider Gerris lacustris, but not in other Heteroptera, and a tritocerebral neuron innervating the protocerebral bridge was immunolabeled in Diptera. The data show largely taxon‐specific variations of a common ground pattern of putatively dopaminergic neurons that may be commonly involved in state‐dependent modulation of CX function.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Analyzing the Loss and the Recovery of Consciousness: Functional Connectivity Patterns and Changes in Heart Rate Variability During Propofol-Induced Anesthesia</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.652080</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The analysis of the central and the autonomic nervous systems (CNS, ANS) activities during general anesthesia (GA) provides fundamental information for the study of neural processes that support alterations of the consciousness level. In the present pilot study, we analyzed EEG signals and the heart rate (HR) variability (HRV) in a sample of 11 patients undergoing spinal surgery to investigate their CNS and ANS activities during GA obtained with propofol administration. Data were analyzed during different stages of GA: baseline, the first period of anesthetic induction, the period before the loss of consciousness, the first period after propofol discontinuation, and the period before the recovery of consciousness (ROC). In EEG spectral analysis, we found a decrease in posterior alpha and beta power in all cortical areas observed, except the occipital ones, and an increase in delta power, mainly during the induction phase. In EEG connectivity analysis, we found a significant increase of local efficiency index in alpha and delta bands between baseline and loss of consciousness as well as between baseline and ROC in delta band only and a significant reduction of the characteristic path length in alpha band between the baseline and ROC. Moreover, connectivity results showed that in the alpha band there was mainly a progressive increase in the number and in the strength of incoming connections in the frontal region, while in the beta band the parietal region showed mainly a significant increase in the number and in the strength of outcoming connections values. The HRV analysis showed that the induction of anesthesia with propofol was associated with a progressive decrease in complexity and a consequent increase in the regularity indexes and that the anesthetic procedure determined bradycardia which was accompanied by an increase in cardiac sympathetic modulation and a decrease in cardiac parasympathetic modulation during the induction. Overall, the results of this pilot study showed as propofol-induced anesthesia caused modifications on EEG signal, leading to a “rebalance” between long and short-range cortical connections, and had a direct effect on the cardiac system. Our data suggest interesting perspectives for the interactions between the central and autonomic nervous systems for the modulation of the consciousness level.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Cerebrospinal Fluid Neurofilament Light Chain (NfL) Predicts Disease Aggressiveness in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: An Application of the D50 Disease Progression Model</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.651651</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a relentlessly progressive neurodegenerative disorder. As previous therapeutic trials in ALS have been severely hampered by patients’ heterogeneity, the identification of biomarkers that reliably reflect disease progression represents a priority in ALS research. Here, we used the D50 disease progression model to investigate correlations between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels and disease aggressiveness. The D50 model quantifies individual disease trajectories for each ALS patient. The value D50 provides a unified measure of a patient’s overall disease aggressiveness (defined as time taken in months to lose 50% of functionality). The relative D50 (rD50) reflects the individual disease covered and can be calculated for any time point in the disease course. We analyzed clinical data from a well-defined cohort of 156 patients with ALS. The concentration of NfL in CSF samples was measured at two different laboratories using the same procedure. Based on patients’ individual D50 values, we defined subgroups with high (&amp;lt;20), intermediate (20–40), or low (&amp;gt;40) disease aggressiveness. NfL levels were compared between these subgroups via analysis of covariance, using an array of confounding factors: age, gender, clinical phenotype, frontotemporal dementia, rD50-derived disease phase, and analyzing laboratory. We found highly significant differences in NfL concentrations between all three D50 subgroups (p &amp;lt; 0.001), representing an increase of NfL levels with increasing disease aggressiveness. The conducted analysis of covariance showed that this correlation was independent of gender, disease phenotype, and phase; however, age, analyzing laboratory, and dementia significantly influenced NfL concentration. We could show that CSF NfL is independent of patients’ disease covered at the time of sampling. The present study provides strong evidence for the potential of NfL to reflect disease aggressiveness in ALS and in addition proofed to remain at stable levels throughout the disease course. Implementation of CSF NfL as a potential read-out for future therapeutic trials in ALS is currently constrained by its demonstrated susceptibility to (pre-)analytical variations. Here we show that the D50 model enables the discovery of correlations between clinical characteristics and CSF analytes and can be recommended for future studies evaluating potential biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: GAMER-MRI in Multiple Sclerosis Identifies the Diffusion-Based Microstructural Measures That Are Most Sensitive to Focal Damage: A Deep-Learning-Based Analysis and Clinico-Biological Validation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.647535</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients provides measures of focal brain damage and activity, which are fundamental for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and the evaluation of response to therapy. However, cMRI is insensitive to the damage to the microenvironment of the brain tissue and the heterogeneity of MS lesions. In contrast, the damaged tissue can be characterized by mathematical models on multishell diffusion imaging data, which measure different compartmental water diffusion. In this work, we obtained 12 diffusion measures from eight diffusion models, and we applied a deep-learning attention-based convolutional neural network (CNN) (GAMER-MRI) to select the most discriminating measures in the classification of MS lesions and the perilesional tissue by attention weights. Furthermore, we provided clinical and biological validation of the chosen metrics—and of their most discriminative combinations—by correlating their respective mean values in MS patients with the corresponding Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and the serum level of neurofilament light chain (sNfL), which are measures of disability and neuroaxonal damage. Our results show that the neurite density index from neurite orientation and dispersion density imaging (NODDI), the measures of the intra-axonal and isotropic compartments from microstructural Bayesian approach, and the measure of the intra-axonal compartment from the spherical mean technique NODDI were the most discriminating (respective attention weights were 0.12, 0.12, 0.15, and 0.13). In addition, the combination of the neurite density index from NODDI and the measures for the intra-axonal and isotropic compartments from the microstructural Bayesian approach exhibited a stronger correlation with EDSS and sNfL than the individual measures. This work demonstrates that the proposed method might be useful to select the microstructural measures that are most discriminative of focal tissue damage and that may also be combined to a unique contrast to achieve stronger correlations to clinical disability and neuroaxonal damage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.642384</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune, inflammatory neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system characterized by demyelination and axonal damage. Diagnosis and prognosis are mainly assessed through clinical examination and neuroimaging. However, more sensitive biomarkers are needed to measure disease activity and guide treatment decisions in MS. Prompt and individualized management can reduce inflammatory activity and delay disease progression. Neurofilament Light chain (NfL), a neuron-specific cytoskeletal protein that is released into the extracellular fluid following axonal injury, has been identified as a biomarker of disease activity in MS. Measurement of NfL levels can capture the extent of neuroaxonal damage, especially in early stages of the disease. A growing body of evidence has shown that NfL in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum can be used as reliable indicators of prognosis and treatment response. More recently, NfL has been shown to facilitate individualized treatment decisions for individuals with MS. In this review, we discuss the characteristics that make NfL a highly informative biomarker and depict the available technologies used for its measurement. We further discuss the growing role of serum and CSF NfL in MS research and clinical settings. Finally, we address some of the current topics of debate regarding the use of NfL in clinical practice and examine the possible directions that this biomarker may take in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.549322</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent neuroimaging studies have shown that functional connectomes are unique to individuals, i.e., two distinct fMRIs taken over different sessions of the same subject are more similar in terms of their connectomes than those from two different subjects. In this study, we present new results that identify specific parts of resting state and task-specific connectomes that are responsible for the unique signatures. We show that a very small part of the connectome can be used to derive features for discriminating between individuals. A network of these features is shown to achieve excellent training and test accuracy in matching imaging datasets. We show that these features are statistically significant, robust to perturbations, invariant across populations, and are localized to a small number of structural regions of the brain. Furthermore, we show that for task-specific connectomes, the regions identified by our method are consistent with their known functional characterization. We present a new matrix sampling technique to derive computationally efficient and accurate methods for identifying the discriminating sub-connectome and support all of our claims using state-of-the-art statistical tests and computational techniques.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.634748</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are communication bridges between a human brain and external world, enabling humans to interact with their environment without muscle intervention. Their functionality, therefore, depends on both the BCI system and the cognitive capacities of the user. Motor-imagery BCIs (MI-BCI) rely on the users’ mental imagination of body movements. However, not all users have the ability to sufficiently modulate their brain activity for control of a MI-BCI; a problem known as BCI illiteracy or inefficiency. The underlying mechanism of this phenomenon and the cause of such difference among users is yet not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the impact of several cognitive and psychological measures on MI-BCI performance. Fifty-five novice BCI-users participated in a left- versus right-hand motor imagery task. In addition to their BCI classification error rate and demographics, psychological measures including personality factors, affinity for technology, and motivation during the experiment, as well as cognitive measures including visuospatial memory and spatial ability and Vividness of Visual Imagery were collected. Factors that were found to have a significant impact on MI-BCI performance were Vividness of Visual Imagery, and the personality factors of orderliness and autonomy. These findings shed light on individual traits that lead to difficulty in BCI operation and hence can help with early prediction of inefficiency among users to optimize training for them.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Case Report: Chemotherapy Indication in a Case of Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Presenting Optic Pathway Glioma: A One-Year Clinical Case Study Using Differential Tractography Approach</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.620439</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is associated with peripheral and central nervous system tumors. It is noteworthy that the regions in which these tumors frequently arise are the optic pathways (OPs) and the brainstem. Thus, we decided to trace the procedure of diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) alterations along with Short-Wavelength Automated Perimetry (SWAP) examinations of the OPs after surgery and chemotherapy over 1 year, which enabled us to evaluate chemotherapy's efficacy in an NF1 patient with an OP tumor. In this study, a 25-year-old woman with NF1 and left optic radiation (OR) glioma underwent surgery to remove the glioma. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed a Pilocytic Astrocytoma (PA) WHO grade I. Post-operation chemotherapy done using nine treatment cycles of administering Temozolomide (TMZ) for 5 days every 4 weeks. Applying the region of interest (ROI) differential tractography method and SWAP four times every 3 months allowed us to follow the patient's visual acuity alterations longitudinally. The differential deterministic tractography method and statistical analyses enabled us to discover the white matter (WM) tracts anisotropy alterations over time. Furthermore, statistical analyses on the SWAP results along time illustrated possible alterations in visual acuity. Then, we could compare and associate the findings with the SWAP examinations and patient symptoms longitudinally. Statistical analyses of SWAP tests revealed a significant improvement in visual fields, and longitudinal differential tractography showed myelination and dense axonal packing in the left OR after 1 year of treatment. In this study, we examined an old hypothesis suggesting that chemotherapy is more effective than radiotherapy for NF1 patients with OP gliomas (OPGs) because of the radiation side effects on the visual field, cognition, and cerebrovascular complications. Our longitudinal clinical case study involving dMRI and SWAP on a single NF1-OPG patient showed that chemotherapy did not suppress the OP myelination over time. However, it should be noted that this is a clinical case study, and, therefore, the generalization of results is limited. Future investigations might focus on genetic-based imaging, particularly in more cases. Further, meta-analyses are recommended for giving a proper Field Of View (FOV) to researchers as a subtle clue regarding precision medicine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ability to recall the timing of events is a crucial aspect of associative learning. Yet, traditional theories of associative learning have often overlooked the role of time in learning association and shaping the behavioral outcome. They address temporal learning as an independent and parallel process. Temporal Coding Hypothesis is an attempt to bringing together the associative and non-associative aspects of learning. This account proposes temporal maps, a representation that encodes several aspects of a learned association, but attach considerable importance to the temporal aspect. A temporal map helps an agent to make inferences about missing information by applying an integration mechanism over a common element present in independently acquired temporal maps. We review the empirical evidence demonstrating the construct of temporal maps and discuss the importance of this concept in clinical and behavioral interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Serotonergic Modulation of Persistent Inward Currents in Serotonergic Neurons of Medulla in ePet-EYFP Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.657445</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Serotonergic (5-HT) neurons in the medulla play multiple functional roles associated with many symptoms and motor activities. The descending serotonergic pathway from medulla is essential for initiating locomotion. However, the ionic properties of 5-HT neurons in the medulla remain unclear. Using whole-cell patch-clamp technique, we studied the biophysical and modulatory properties of persistent inward currents (PICs) in 5-HT neurons of medulla in ePet-EYFP transgenic mice (P3–P6). PICs were recorded by a family of voltage bi-ramps (10-s duration, 40-mV peak step), and the ascending and descending PICs were mirrored to analyze the PIC hysteresis. PICs were found in 77% of 5-HT neurons (198/258) with no significant difference between parapyramidal region (n = 107) and midline raphe nuclei (MRN) (n = 91) in either PIC onset (−47.4 ± 10 mV and −48.7 ± 7 mV; P = 0.44) or PIC amplitude (226.9 ± 138 pA and 259.2 ± 141 pA; P = 0.29). Ninety-six percentage (191/198) of the 5-HT neurons displayed counterclockwise hysteresis and four percentage (7/198) exhibited the clockwise hysteresis. The composite PICs could be differentiated as calcium component (Ca_PIC) by bath application of nimodipine (25 μM), sodium component (Na_PIC) by tetrodotoxin (TTX, 2 μM), and TTX- and dihydropyridine-resistance component (TDR_PIC) by TTX and nimodipine. Ca_PIC, Na_PIC and TDR_PIC all contributed to upregulation of excitability of 5-HT neurons. 5-HT (15 μM) enhanced the PICs, including a 26% increase in amplitude of the compound currents of Ca_PIC and TDR_PIC (P &amp;lt; 0.001, n = 9), 3.6 ± 5 mV hyperpolarization of Na_PIC and TDR_PIC onset (P &amp;lt; 0.05, n = 12), 30% increase in amplitude of TDR_PIC (P &amp;lt; 0.01), and 2.0 ± 3 mV hyperpolarization of TDR_PIC onset (P &amp;lt; 0.05, n = 18). 5-HT also facilitated repetitive firing of 5-HT neurons through modulation of composite PIC, Na_PIC and TDR_PIC, and Ca_PIC and TDR_PIC, respectively. In particular, the high voltage-activated TDR_PIC facilitated the repetitive firing in higher membrane potential, and this facilitation could be amplified by 5-HT. Morphological data analysis indicated that the dendrites of 5-HT neurons possessed dense spherical varicosities intensively crossing 5-HT neurons in medulla. We characterized the PICs in 5-HT neurons and unveiled the mechanism underlying upregulation of excitability of 5-HT neurons through serotonergic modulation of PICs. This study provided insight into channel mechanisms responsible for the serotonergic modulation of serotonergic neurons in brainstem.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Protective Effects of N1-Methylnicotinamide Against High-Fat Diet- and Age-Induced Hearing Loss via Moderate Overexpression of Sirtuin 1 Protein</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.634868</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is the most common form of hearing loss and the predominant neurodegenerative disease associated with aging. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is associated with the most complex physiological processes, including metabolism, cancer onset, and aging. SIRT1 protein levels are enhanced by the conversion of nicotinamide to N&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-methylnicotinamide (MNAM), independent of its mRNA levels. Moreover, MNAM has implications in increased longevity achieved through its mitohormetic effects. Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (Nnmt) is an enzyme involved in MNAM metabolism, and its level increases under caloric restriction (CR) conditions. The CR condition has implications in delaying ARHL onset. In this study, we aimed to determine the relationship between diet, hearing function, SIRT1 and SIRT3 expression levels in the inner ear, and cochlear morphology. Mice fed with a high-fat diet (HFD), HFD + 1% MNAM, and low-fat diet (LFD) were monitored for age-related auditory-evoked brainstem responses, and changes in cochlear histology, metabolism, and protein and mRNA expressions were analyzed. Our results revealed that the HFD- and aging-mediated downregulated expression of SIRT1 and SIRT3 promoted hearing loss that was obfuscated by MNAM supplementation-induced upregulated expression of cochlear SIRT1 and SIRT3. Thus, our results suggest that MNAM can be used as a therapeutic agent for preventing ARHL.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Inflammatory Cytokine Profile and Plasticity of Brain and Spinal Microglia in Response to ATP and Glutamate</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.634020</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microglia are the primary cells in the central nervous system that identify and respond to injury or damage. Such a perturbation in the nervous system induces the release of molecules including ATP and glutamate that act as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). DAMPs are detected by microglia, which then regulate the inflammatory response in a manner sensitive to their surrounding environment. The available data indicates that ATP and glutamate can induce the release of pro inflammatory factors TNF (tumor necrosis factor), IL-1β (interleukin 1 beta), and NO (nitric oxide) from microglia. However, non-physiological concentrations of ATP and glutamate were often used to derive these insights. Here, we have compared the response of spinal cord microglia (SM) relative to brain microglia (BM) using physiologically relevant concentrations of glutamate and ATP that mimic injured conditions in the central nervous system. The data show that ATP and glutamate are not significant modulators of the release of cytokines from either BM or SM. Consistent with previous studies, spinal microglia exhibited a general trend toward reduced release of inflammatory cytokines relative to brain-derived microglia. Moreover, we demonstrate that the responses of microglia to these DAMPs can be altered by modifying the biochemical milieu in their surrounding environment. Preconditioning brain derived microglia with media from spinal cord derived mixed glial cultures shifted their release of IL-1ß and IL-6 to a less inflammatory phenotype consistent with spinal microglia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Inhibition of Acyl-CoA Synthetase Long-Chain Family Member 4 Facilitates Neurological Recovery After Stroke by Regulation Ferroptosis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.632354</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke is the main cause of disability worldwide, leading to a serious socioeconomic burden. Ferroptosis is a non-apoptotic form of programmed cell death and is related to various diseases. Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4) is considered a target of ferroptosis, but its specific role in ischemic stroke remains unclear. In this study, we investigate whether the inhibition of ACSL4 promotes the recovery of neurological function in a way that prevents ferroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A transient cerebral ischemia model was established for mice by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO); glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4), ACSL4 and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) were detected by Western blot, and changes to mitochondria were observed by a transmission electron microscope. A kit was used to determine iron levels and lipid peroxide indicators, such as glutathione peroxidase (GPx), reduced glutathione (GSH), total glutathione/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG), lipid peroxidation, reactive oxygen species, superoxide and malonaldehyde. Following MCAO, a ferroptosis inhibitor, liproxstatin-1, was administered intranasally immediately at a concentration of 10 mg/kg. Rosiglitazone was used to inhibit ACSL4 and was administered intravenously 1 h before MCAO at a concentration of 0.4 mg/kg. Brain injury was determined by neurological deficit scores, neuroscore (28-point), corner test and gait analyses, at 24 and 72 h after stroke. Brain infarct volume was determined by 2, 3, 5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining at 72 h after stroke.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;After MCAO, GPx4 protein expression decreased, ACSL4 and COX2 protein expression increased, GPx activity decreased and iron accumulation. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed that the outer mitochondrial membrane of neurons had ruptured and mitochondrial cristae had decreased or disappeared. Liproxstatin-1 could significantly attenuate the decrease of GPx4 and the increase of COX2 after MCAO, dramatically reducing iron accumulation and decreasing GPx activity, accompanied by a marked reduction in changes in lipid peroxidation indicators. The use of rosiglitazone to inhibit ACSL4 could significantly improve neurological function and reduce the brain infarct volume at 72 h after stroke. Importantly, inhibiting ACSL4 could significantly attenuate the decline of GPx4 after MCAO and markedly attenuate iron accumulation and a decrease in GPx activity. Additionally, changes in lipid peroxidation indicators were also significantly inhibited.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This study indicates that inhibiting ACSL4 can promote the recovery of neurological function after stroke by suppression of ferroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Purinergic receptors play important roles in central nervous system (CNS), where the bulk of these receptors are implicated in neuroinflammatory responses and regulation of cellular function of neurons, microglial and astrocytes. Within the P2X receptor family, P2X&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; receptor is generally known for its inactivity in normal conditions and activation by moderately high concentrations (&amp;gt;100 μM) of extracellular adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) released from injured cells as a result of brain injury or pathological conditions. Activation of P2X&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;R contributes to the activation and proliferation of microglia and directly contribute to neurodegeneration by provoking microglia-mediated neuronal death, glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity, and NLRP3 inflammasome activation that results in initiation, maturity and release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines and generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. These components of the inflammatory response play important roles in many neural pathologies and neurodegeneration disorders. In CNS, expression of P2X&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;R on microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes are upregulated under neuroinflammatory conditions. Several in vivo studies have demonstrated beneficial effects of the P2X&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonists in animal model systems of neurodegenerative diseases. A number of specific and selective P2X&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonists have been developed, but only few of them have shown efficient brain permeability. Finding potent and selective P2X&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; receptor inhibitors which are also CNS penetrable and display acceptable pharmacokinetics (PK) has presented challenges for both academic researchers and pharmaceutical companies. In this review, we discuss the role of P2X&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; receptor function in neurodegenerative diseases, the pharmacological inhibition of the receptor, and PET radiopharmaceuticals which permit non-invasive monitoring of the P2X&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; receptor contribution to neuroinflammation associated with neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Midlife Cardiovascular Fitness Is Reflected in the Brain's White Matter</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.652575</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Disappointing results from clinical trials designed to delay structural brain decline and the accompanying increase in risk for dementia in older adults have precipitated a shift in testing promising interventions from late in life toward midlife before irreversible damage has accumulated. This shift, however, requires targeting midlife biomarkers that are associated with clinical changes manifesting only in late life. Here we explored possible links between one putative biomarker, distributed integrity of brain white matter, and two intervention targets, cardiovascular fitness and healthy lifestyle behaviors, in midlife. At age 45, fractional anisotropy (FA) derived from diffusion weighted MRI was used to estimate the microstructural integrity of distributed white matter tracts in a population-representative birth cohort. Age-45 cardiovascular fitness (VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Max; N = 801) was estimated from heart rates obtained during submaximal exercise tests; age-45 healthy lifestyle behaviors were estimated using the Nyberg Health Index (N = 854). Ten-fold cross-validated elastic net predictive modeling revealed that estimated VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Max was modestly associated with distributed FA. In contrast, there was no significant association between Nyberg Health Index scores and FA. Our findings suggest that cardiovascular fitness levels, but not healthy lifestyle behaviors, are associated with the distributed integrity of white matter in the brain in midlife. These patterns could help inform future clinical intervention research targeting ADRDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24830?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Previous findings on the relationship between prediabetes (the precursor stage of type 2 diabetes) and brain health in humans are inconsistent. Thus, this systematic review of cross‐sectional and longitudinal studies aimed to summarize what is currently known about brain deficits in prediabetic adults. Following the PRISMA reporting standards for systematic reviews, we conducted a comprehensive review of peer‐reviewed journal articles published from 2009 to present, focusing on studies that assessed brain volume, structural connectivity, and cerebrovascular health in prediabetic adults and older adults (i.e., 18 years or older). We systematically searched PsychINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, and EMbase databases. Quality assessment was based on the NIH Quality Assessment Tool for Observational and Cross‐sectional Studies. In total, 19 studies were included in our review. Results from these studies show that prediabetes may be associated with deficits in brain structure and pathology, however, several studies also refute these findings. Moreover, we identified clear inconsistencies in study methodologies, including diabetes measures and classification, across studies that may account for these conflicting findings.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Rapid eye movement sleep deprivation impairs neuronal plasticity and reduces hippocampal neuronal arborization in male albino rats: Noradrenaline is involved in the process</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24838?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Rapid eye movement sleep deprivation‐associated elevated noradrenaline reduced neuronal‐branching and ‐spines, while synaptic‐length of active zones and ‐protein expressions showed compensatory increase. These changes offer possible cellular level explanation of behavioral effects. Consolidating these and previous findings suggest that REMS plays a crucial role in modulating brain noradrenaline, which affect neuronal plasticity in health and diseases. 

Abstract
Rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) favors brain development and memory, while it is decreased in neurodegenerative diseases. REMS deprivation (REMSD) affects several physiological processes including memory consolidation; however, its detailed mechanism(s) of action was unknown. REMS reduces, while REMSD elevates noradrenaline (NA) level in the brain; the latter induces several deficiencies and disorders, including changes in neuronal cytomorphology and apoptosis. Therefore, we proposed that REMS‐ and REMSD‐associated modulation of NA level might affect neuronal plasticity and affect brain functions. Male albino rats were REMS deprived by flower‐pot method for 6 days, and its effects were compared with home cage and large platform controls as well as post‐REMSD recovered and REMS‐deprived prazosin (α1‐adrenoceptor antagonist)‐treated rats. We observed that REMSD reduced CA1 and CA3 neuronal dendritic length, branching, arborization, and spine density, while length of active zone and expressions of pre‐ as well as post‐synaptic proteins were increased as compared to controls; interestingly, prazosin prevented most of the effects in vivo. Studies on primary culture of neurons from chick embryo brain confirmed that NA at lower concentration(s) induced neuronal branching and arborization, while higher doses were destructive. The findings support our contention that REMSD adversely affects neuronal plasticity, branching, and synaptic scaffold, which explain the underlying cytoarchitectural basis of REMSD‐associated patho‐physio‐behavioral changes. Consolidation of findings of this study along with that of our previous reports suggest that the neuronal disintegration could be due to either withdrawal of direct protective and proliferative role of low dose of NA or indirect effect of high dose of NA or both.</content:encoded>

Deregulation of the protein secretory pathway (PSP) is linked to many hallmarks of cancer, such as promoting tissue invasion and modulating cell-cell signaling. The collection of secreted proteins processed by the PSP, known as the secretome, is often studied due to its potential as a reservoir of tumor biomarkers. However, there has been less focus on the protein components of the secretory machinery itself. We therefore investigated the expression changes in secretory pathway components across many different cancer types. Specifically, we implemented a dual approach involving differential expression analysis and machine learning to identify PSP genes whose expression was associated with key tumor characteristics: mutation of p53, cancer status, and tumor stage. Eight different machine learning algorithms were included in the analysis to enable comparison between methods and to focus on signals that were robust to algorithm type. The machine learning approach was validated by identifying PSP genes known to be regulated by p53, and even outperformed the differential expression analysis approach. Among the different analysis methods and cancer types, the kinesin family members &lt;i&gt;KIF20A&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;KIF23&lt;/i&gt; were consistently among the top genes associated with malignant transformation or tumor stage. However, unlike most cancer types which exhibited elevated &lt;i&gt;KIF20A&lt;/i&gt; expression that remained relatively constant across tumor stages, renal carcinomas displayed a more gradual increase that continued with increasing disease severity. Collectively, our study demonstrates the complementary nature of a combined differential expression and machine learning approach for analyzing gene expression data, and highlights key PSP components relevant to features of tumor pathophysiology that may constitute potential therapeutic targets.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SeGnUiuqoI0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Temporal dynamics of a CSF1R signaling gene regulatory network involved in epilepsy</title>

Colony Stimulating Factor 1 Receptor (CSF1R) is a potential target for anti-epileptic drugs. However, inhibition of CSF1R is not well tolerated by patients, thereby prompting the need for alternative targets. To develop a framework for identification of such alternatives, we here develop a mathematical model of a pro-inflammatory gene regulatory network (GRN) involved in epilepsy and centered around CSF1R. This GRN comprises validated transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations involving STAT1, STAT3, NFκB, IL6R, CSF3R, IRF8, PU1, C/EBPα, TNFR1, CSF1 and CSF1R. The model was calibrated on mRNA levels of all GRN components in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated mouse microglial BV-2 cells, and allowed to predict that STAT1 and STAT3 have the strongest impact on the expression of the other GRN components. Microglial BV-2 cells were selected because, the modules from which the GRN was deduced are enriched for microglial marker genes. The function of STAT1 and STAT3 in the GRN was experimentally validated in BV-2 cells. Further, &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; analysis of the GRN dynamics predicted that a pro-inflammatory stimulus can induce irreversible bistability whereby the expression level of GRN components occurs as two distinct states. The irreversibility of the switch may enforce the need for chronic inhibition of the CSF1R GRN in order to achieve therapeutic benefit. The cell-to-cell heterogeneity driven by the bistability may cause variable therapeutic response. In conclusion, our modeling approach uncovered a GRN controlling CSF1R that is predominantly regulated by STAT1 and STAT3. Irreversible inflammation-induced bistability and cell-to-cell heterogeneity of the GRN provide a theoretical foundation to the need for chronic GRN control and the limited potential for disease modification via inhibition of CSF1R.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CXYdek2j0Zc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Pathway level understanding of cancer plays a key role in precision oncology. However, the current amount of high-throughput data cannot support the elucidation of full pathway topology. In this study, instead of directly learning the pathway network, we adapted the probabilistic OR gate to model the modular structure of pathways and regulon. The resulting model, OR-gate Network (ORN), can simultaneously infer pathway modules of somatic alterations, patient-specific pathway dysregulation status, and downstream regulon. In a trained ORN, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in each tumour can be explained by somatic mutations perturbing a pathway module. Furthermore, the ORN handles one of the most important properties of pathway perturbation in tumours, the mutual exclusivity. We have applied the ORN to lower-grade glioma (LGG) samples and liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) samples in TCGA and breast cancer samples from METABRIC. Both datasets have shown abnormal pathway activities related to immune response and cell cycles. In LGG samples, ORN identified pathway modules closely related to glioma development and revealed two pathways closely related to patient survival. We had similar results with LIHC samples. Additional results from the METABRIC datasets showed that ORN could characterize critical mechanisms of cancer and connect them to less studied somatic mutations (e.g., BAP1, MIR604, MICAL3, and telomere activities), which may generate novel hypothesis for targeted therapy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JmuPOL5Tct8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>
