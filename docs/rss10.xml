	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Searching for collective behavior in a small brain. (arXiv:1810.07623v1 [physics.bio-ph])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.07623</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In large neuronal networks, it is believed that functions emerge through the
collective behavior of many interconnected neurons. Recently, the development
of experimental techniques that allow simultaneous recording of calcium
concentration from a large fraction of all neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans -
a nematode with 302 neurons - creates the opportunity to ask if such emergence
is universal, reaching down to even the smallest brains. Here, we measure the
activity of 50+ neurons in C. elegans, and analyze the data by building the
maximum entropy model that matches the mean activity and pairwise correlations
among these neurons. To capture the graded nature of the cells' responses, we
assign each cell multiple states. These models, which are equivalent to a
family of Potts glasses, successfully predict higher statistical structure in
the network. In addition, these models exhibit signatures of collective
behavior: the state of single cells can be predicted from the state of the rest
of the network; the network, despite being sparse in a way similar to the
structural connectome, distributes its response globally when locally
perturbed; the distribution over network states has multiple local maxima, as
in models for memory; and the parameters that describe the real network are
close to a critical surface in this family of models.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.07429</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;About a decade ago grid cells were discovered in the medial entorhinal cortex
of rat. Their peculiar firing patterns, which correlate with periodic locations
in the environment, led to early hypothesis that grid cells may provide some
form of metric for space. Subsequent research has since uncovered a wealth of
new insights into the characteristics of grid cells and their neural
neighborhood, the parahippocampal-hippocampal region, calling for a revision
and refinement of earlier grid cell models. This survey paper aims to provide a
comprehensive summary of grid cell research published in the past decade. It
focuses on the functional characteristics of grid cells such as the influence
of external cues or the alignment to environmental geometry, but also provides
a basic overview of the underlying neural substrate.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Ensemble Inhibition and Excitation in the Human Cortex: an Ising Model Analysis with Uncertainties. (arXiv:1810.07253v1 [cond-mat.dis-nn])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.07253</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The pairwise maximum entropy model, also known as the Ising model, has been
widely used to analyze the collective activity of neurons. However, controversy
persists in the literature about seemingly inconsistent findings, whose
significance is unclear due to lack of reliable error estimates. We therefore
develop a method for accurately estimating parameter uncertainty based on
random walks in parameter space using adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo after
the convergence of the main optimization algorithm. We apply our method to the
spiking patterns of excitatory and inhibitory neurons recorded with
multielectrode arrays in the human temporal cortex during the wake-sleep cycle.
Our analysis shows that the Ising model captures neuronal collective behavior
much better than the independent model during wakefulness, light sleep, and
deep sleep when both excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) neurons are modeled;
ignoring the inhibitory effects of I-neurons dramatically overestimates
synchrony among E-neurons. Furthermore, information-theoretic measures reveal
that the Ising model explains about 80%-95% of the correlations, depending on
sleep state and neuron type. Thermodynamic measures show signatures of
criticality, although we take this with a grain of salt as it may be merely a
reflection of long-range neural correlations.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Strategic heuristics underlie animal dominance hierarchies and provide evidence of group-level social knowledge. (arXiv:1810.07215v1 [q-bio.PE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.07215</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The question of what animals understand about their social worlds is
fundamental to studies of the evolution of sociality, cognition, and animal
culture. However, the presence and extent of social knowledge in individuals is
difficult to detect, and when detections have been made, differences in
methodology make cross-species comparisons difficult. We present a new method
for detecting social knowledge. This method infers individual-level strategic
rules for aggression in dominance hierarchies where rank differences between
individuals may structure decision-making. We apply this method to a data from
172 social groups across 85 species in 22 orders. By looking for heuristics
that depend upon knowledge of group-level facts, we can back-infer the types of
knowledge individuals possess. Summary measures then place groups within a
taxonomy, providing a &quot;social assay&quot; of group-level knowledge. This assay
allows the identification of consensus strategies at the group level. The
majority of animal groups in our dataset (112 groups, 65%) follow a downward
heuristic, spreading aggression relatively equally across lower-ranked
opponents. An additional 50 groups (29%) use strategies that are indicative of
more detailed rank knowledge. Different groups within the same species can use
different strategies, indicating that the choice of heuristics may be
contextual and that the structuring of aggression should not be considered a
fixed characteristic of a species. Instead, individuals may be able to
plastically respond to changes in environmental or social conditions by
changing their strategies. Our approach to studying animal conflict provides
new opportunities to investigate the extent of rank knowledge across species,
compare the evolution of social knowledge, and better understand the effect of
social knowledge on individual behaviour in within-group conflict.

The relationship between brain structure and function has been probed using a variety of approaches, but how the underlying structural connectivity of the human brain drives behavior is far from understood. To investigate the effect of anatomical brain organization on human task performance, we use a data-driven computational modeling approach and explore the functional effects of naturally occurring structural differences in brain networks. We construct personalized brain network models by combining anatomical connectivity estimated from diffusion spectrum imaging of individual subjects with a nonlinear model of brain dynamics. By performing computational experiments in which we measure the excitability of the global brain network and spread of synchronization following a targeted computational stimulation, we quantify how individual variation in the underlying connectivity impacts both local and global brain dynamics. We further relate the computational results to individual variability in the subjects’ performance of three language-demanding tasks both before and after transcranial magnetic stimulation to the left-inferior frontal gyrus. Our results show that task performance correlates with either local or global measures of functional activity, depending on the complexity of the task. By emphasizing differences in the underlying structural connectivity, our model serves as a powerful tool to assess individual differences in task performances, to dissociate the effect of targeted stimulation in tasks that differ in cognitive demand, and to pave the way for the development of personalized therapeutics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Zw5QfjF3eog&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Genomic data integration systematically biases interactome mapping</title>

Elucidating the complete network of protein-protein interactions, or interactome, is a fundamental goal of the post-genomic era, yet existing interactome maps are far from complete. To increase the throughput and resolution of interactome mapping, methods for protein-protein interaction discovery by co-migration have been introduced. However, accurate identification of interacting protein pairs within the resulting large-scale proteomic datasets is challenging. Consequently, most computational pipelines for co-migration data analysis incorporate external genomic datasets to distinguish interacting from non-interacting protein pairs. The effect of this procedure on interactome mapping is poorly understood. Here, we conduct a rigorous analysis of genomic data integration for interactome recovery across a large number of co-migration datasets, spanning diverse experimental and computational methods. We find that genomic data integration leads to an increase in the functional coherence of the resulting interactome maps, but this comes at the expense of a decrease in power to discover novel interactions. Importantly, putative novel interactions predicted by genomic data integration are no more likely to later be experimentally discovered than those predicted from co-migration data alone. Our results reveal a widespread and unappreciated limitation in a methodology that has been widely used to map the interactome of humans and model organisms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FgE0UzOuvEs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

B cells develop high affinity receptors during the course of affinity maturation, a cyclic process of mutation and selection. At the end of affinity maturation, a number of cells sharing the same ancestor (i.e. in the same “clonal family”) are released from the germinal center; their amino acid frequency profile reflects the allowed and disallowed substitutions at each position. These clonal-family-specific frequency profiles, called “substitution profiles”, are useful for studying the course of affinity maturation as well as for antibody engineering purposes. However, most often only a single sequence is recovered from each clonal family in a sequencing experiment, making it impossible to construct a clonal-family-specific substitution profile. Given the public release of many high-quality large B cell receptor datasets, one may ask whether it is possible to use such data in a prediction model for clonal-family-specific substitution profiles. In this paper, we present the method “Substitution Profiles Using Related Families” (SPURF), a penalized tensor regression framework that integrates information from a rich assemblage of datasets to predict the clonal-family-specific substitution profile for any single input sequence. Using this framework, we show that substitution profiles from similar clonal families can be leveraged together with simulated substitution profiles and germline gene sequence information to improve prediction. We fit this model on a large public dataset and validate the robustness of our approach on two external datasets. Furthermore, we provide a command-line tool in an open-source software package (https://github.com/krdav/SPURF) implementing these ideas and providing easy prediction using our pre-fit models.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JsZ93r65PGI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: DMRT5, DMRT3, and EMX2 Cooperatively Repress Gsx2 at the Pallium-Subpallium Boundary to Maintain Cortical Identity in Dorsal Telencephalic Progenitors</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/42/9105?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Specification of dorsoventral regional identity in progenitors of the developing telencephalon is a first pivotal step in the development of the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia. Previously, we demonstrated that the two zinc finger &lt;i&gt;doublesex&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;mab-3 related&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Dmrt&lt;/i&gt;) genes, &lt;i&gt;Dmrt5&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Dmrta2&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;Dmrt3&lt;/i&gt;, which are coexpressed in high caudomedial to low rostrolateral gradients in the cerebral cortical primordium, are separately needed for normal formation of the cortical hem, hippocampus, and caudomedial neocortex. We have now addressed the role of &lt;i&gt;Dmrt3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Dmrt5&lt;/i&gt; in controlling dorsoventral division of the telencephalon in mice of either sex by comparing the phenotypes of single knock-out (KO) with double KO embryos and by misexpressing &lt;i&gt;Dmrt5&lt;/i&gt; in the ventral telencephalon. We find that DMRT3 and DMRT5 act as critical regulators of progenitor cell dorsoventral identity by repressing ventralizing regulators. Early ventral fate transcriptional regulators expressed in the dorsal lateral ganglionic eminence, such as &lt;i&gt;Gsx2&lt;/i&gt;, are upregulated in the dorsal telencephalon of &lt;i&gt;Dmrt3;Dmrt5&lt;/i&gt; double KO embryos and downregulated when ventral telencephalic progenitors express ectopic &lt;i&gt;Dmrt5&lt;/i&gt;. Conditional overexpression of &lt;i&gt;Dmrt5&lt;/i&gt; throughout the telencephalon produces gene expression and structural defects that are highly consistent with reduced GSX2 activity. Further, &lt;i&gt;Emx2;Dmrt5&lt;/i&gt; double KO embryos show a phenotype similar to &lt;i&gt;Dmrt3;Dmrt5&lt;/i&gt; double KO embryos, and both DMRT3, DMRT5 and the homeobox transcription factor EMX2 bind to a ventral telencephalon-specific enhancer in the &lt;i&gt;Gsx2&lt;/i&gt; locus. Together, our findings uncover cooperative functions of DMRT3, DMRT5, and EMX2 in dividing dorsal from ventral in the telencephalon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We identified the DMRT3 and DMRT5 zinc finger transcription factors as novel regulators of dorsoventral patterning in the telencephalon. Our data indicate that they have overlapping functions and compensate for one another. The double, but not the single, knock-out produces a dorsal telencephalon that is ventralized, and olfactory bulb tissue takes over most remaining cortex. Conversely, overexpressing &lt;i&gt;Dmrt5&lt;/i&gt; throughout the telencephalon causes expanded expression of dorsal gene determinants and smaller olfactory bulbs. Furthermore, we show that the homeobox transcription factor EMX2 that is coexpressed with DMRT3 and DMRT5 in cortical progenitors cooperates with them to maintain dorsoventral patterning in the telencephalon. Our study suggests that DMRT3/5 function with EMX2 in positioning the pallial-subpallial boundary by antagonizing the ventral homeobox transcription factor GSX2.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Hippocampal-Evoked Feedforward Inhibition in the Nucleus Accumbens</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/42/9091?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is critical for motivated behavior and is rewired following exposure to drugs of abuse. Medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the NAc express either D1 or D2 receptors and project to distinct downstream targets. Differential activation of these MSNs depends on both excitation from long-range inputs and inhibition via the local circuit. Assessing how long-range excitatory inputs engage inhibitory circuitry is therefore important for understanding NAc function. Here, we use slice electrophysiology and optogenetics to study ventral hippocampal (vHPC)-evoked feedforward inhibition in the NAc of male and female mice. We find that vHPC-evoked excitation is stronger at D1+ than D1– MSNs, whereas inhibition is unbiased at the two cell types. vHPC inputs contact both parvalbumin-positive (PV+) and somatostatin-positive (SOM+) interneurons, but PV+ cells are preferentially activated. Moreover, suppressing PV+ interneurons indicates they are primarily responsible for vHPC-evoked inhibition. Finally, repeated cocaine exposure alters the excitation of D1+ and D1– MSNs, without concomitant changes to inhibition, shifting the excitation/inhibition balance. Together, our results highlight the contributions of multiple interneuron populations to feedforward inhibition in the NAc. Moreover, they demonstrate that inhibition provides a stable backdrop on which drug-evoked changes to excitation occur within this circuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Given the importance of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in reward learning and drug-seeking behaviors, it is critical to understand what controls the activity of cells in this region. While excitatory inputs to projection neurons in the NAc have been identified, it is unclear how the local inhibitory network becomes engaged. Here, we identify a sparse population of interneurons responsible for feedforward inhibition evoked by ventral hippocampal input and characterize their connections within the NAc. We also demonstrate that the balance of excitation and inhibition that projection neurons experience is altered by exposure to cocaine. Together, this work provides insight into the fundamental circuitry of this region as well as the effects of drugs of abuse.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Hypothalamic CCL2/CCR2 Chemokine System: Role in Sexually Dimorphic Effects of Maternal Ethanol Exposure on Melanin-Concentrating Hormone and Behavior in Adolescent Offspring</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/42/9072?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Clinical and animal studies show that ethanol exposure and inflammation during pregnancy cause similar behavioral disturbances in the offspring. While ethanol is shown to stimulate both neuroimmune and neurochemical systems in adults, little is known about their anatomical relationship in response to ethanol &lt;i&gt;in utero&lt;/i&gt; and whether neuroimmune factors mediate ethanol's effects on neuronal development and behavior in offspring. Here we examined in female and male adolescent rats a specific population of neurons concentrated in lateral hypothalamus, which coexpress the inflammatory chemokine C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2) or its receptor CCR2 with the orexigenic neuropeptide, melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), that promotes ethanol drinking behavior. We demonstrate that maternal administration of ethanol (2 g/kg/d) from embryonic day 10 (E10) to E15, while having little impact on glia, stimulates expression of neuronal CCL2 and CCR2, increases density of both large CCL2 neurons colocalizing MCH and small CCL2 neurons surrounding MCH neurons, and stimulates ethanol drinking and anxiety in adolescent offspring. We show that these neuronal and behavioral changes are similarly produced by maternal administration of CCL2 (4 or 8 μg/kg/d, E10–E15) and blocked by maternal administration of a CCR2 antagonist INCB3344 (1 mg/kg/d, E10–E15), and these effects of ethanol and CCL2 are sexually dimorphic, consistently stronger in females. These results suggest that this neuronal CCL2/CCR2 system closely linked to MCH neurons has a role in mediating the effects of maternal ethanol exposure on adolescent offspring and contributes to the higher levels of adolescent risk factors for alcohol use disorders described in women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Ethanol consumption and inflammatory agents during pregnancy similarly increase alcohol intake and anxiety in adolescent offspring. To investigate how neurochemical and neuroimmune systems interact to mediate these disturbances, we examined a specific population of hypothalamic neurons coexpressing the inflammatory chemokine CCL2 and its receptor CCR2 with the neuropeptide, melanin-concentrating hormone. We demonstrate in adolescent offspring that maternal administration of CCL2, like ethanol, stimulates these neurons and increases ethanol drinking and anxiety, and these effects of ethanol are blocked by maternal CCR2 antagonist and consistently stronger in females. This suggests that neuronal chemokine signaling linked to neuropeptides mediates effects of maternal ethanol exposure on adolescent offspring and contributes to higher levels of adolescent risk factors for alcohol use disorders in women.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Control of Sleep Onset by Shal/Kv4 Channels in Drosophila Circadian Neurons</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/42/9059?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sleep is highly conserved across animal species. Both wake- and sleep-promoting neurons are implicated in the regulation of wake–sleep transition at dusk in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. However, little is known about how they cooperate and whether they act via different mechanisms. Here, we demonstrated that in female &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, sleep onset was specifically delayed by blocking the Shaker cognate L channels [Shal; also known as voltage-gated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel 4 (K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;4)] in wake-promoting cells, including large ventral lateral neurons (l-LNvs) and pars intercerebralis (PI), but not in sleep-promoting dorsal neurons (DN1s). Delayed sleep onset was also observed in males by blocking K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;4 activity in wake-promoting neurons. Electrophysiological recordings show that K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;4 channels contribute A-type currents in LNvs and PI cells, but are much less conspicuous in DN1s. Interestingly, blocking K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;4 in wake-promoting neurons preferentially increased firing rates at dusk ~ZT13, when the resting membrane potentials and firing rates were at lower levels. Furthermore, pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) is essential for the regulation of sleep onset by K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;4 in l-LNvs, and downregulation of PDF receptor (PDFR) in PI neurons advanced sleep onset, indicating K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;4 controls sleep onset via regulating PDF/PDFR signaling in wake-promoting neurons. We propose that K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;4 acts as a sleep onset controller by suppressing membrane excitability in a clock-dependent manner to balance the wake–sleep transition at dusk. Our results have important implications for the understanding and treatment of sleep disorders such as insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The mechanisms by which our brains reversibly switch from waking to sleep state remain an unanswered and intriguing question in biological research. In this study, we identified that Shal/K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;4, a well known voltage-gated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel, acts as a controller of wake–sleep transition at dusk in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; circadian neurons. We find that interference of K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;4 function with a dominant-negative form (DNK&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;4) in subsets of circadian neurons specifically disrupts sleep onset at dusk, although K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;4 itself does not exhibit circadian oscillation. K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;4 preferentially downregulates neuronal firings at ZT9–ZT17, supporting that it plays an essential role in wake–sleep transition at dusk. Our findings may help understand and eventually treat sleep disorders such as insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Opioid-Independent and Opioid-Mediated Modes of Pain Modulation</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/42/9047?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Pain is regulated endogenously through both opioid and non-opioid mechanisms. We hypothesized that two novel pain modulation tasks, one drawing on context/expectations and one using voluntary reappraisal, would show differing levels of opioid dependence. Specifically, we expected that naloxone would block context-related analgesia, whereas mental imagery-based pain reappraisal would be opioid-independent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A double-blind, placebo-controlled intravenous naloxone versus saline crossover design was used. Twenty healthy volunteers completed the two modulation tasks with acute heat stimuli calibrated to induce moderate pain. In the mental imagery task, participants imagined either a &quot;pleasant&quot; or a &quot;comparison&quot; scenario during painful heat. In the relative relief task, moderate heat stimuli coincided with visual cues eliciting relief from the expectation of intense pain, and were compared with moderate heat stimuli delivered under the expectation of non-painful warmth. Both &quot;pleasant imagery&quot; and &quot;relative relief&quot; conditions significantly improved ratings of pain intensity and pleasantness during saline treatment. Indeed, the target stimuli in both tasks, which had been calibrated to induce moderate pain, were rated as mildly pleasant. Furthermore, consistently with the main hypothesis, blocking endogenous opioid signaling with naloxone did not significantly affect imagery-induced regulation of pain intensity or pleasantness. In contrast, the relative relief-induced pain regulation (i.e., context/expectation) was blocked by naloxone. We conclude that endogenous opioid signaling is necessary for expectation-related relative relief analgesia, but not for pain reappraisal through mental imagery. These results support mental imagery as a powerful and clinically relevant strategy for regulating pain affect also in patients where endogenous opioid mechanisms might be compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neurotransmitter systems in the human brain can be probed through antagonist drugs. Studies using the opioid antagonist naloxone have demonstrated that the brain relies on both opioid and non-opioid mechanisms to downregulate pain. This holds clinical relevance given altered endogenous opioid processes in many chronic pain conditions. The present study used a double-blinded, placebo-controlled naloxone blockage of endogenous opioids in healthy humans to show differential opioid involvement in two pain modulation tasks. Context/expectation-driven (relative relief-related) analgesia was blocked by naloxone. In contrast, pain reappraisal through mental imagery was intact despite opioid receptor blockade, suggesting opioid independence. These results support mental imagery as a powerful, clinically relevant strategy for regulating pain as it does not rely on a functioning opioidergic system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Early Appearance and Spread of Fast Ripples in the Hippocampus in a Model of Cortical Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/42/9034?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fast ripples (FRs; activity of &amp;gt;250 Hz) have been considered as a biomarker of epileptic activity in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex; it is thought that they signal the focus of seizure generation. Similar high-frequency network activity has been produced &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; by changing extracellular medium composition, by using pro-epileptic substances, or by electrical stimulation. Here we study the propagation of these events between different subregions of the male rat hippocampus in a recently introduced experimental model of FRs in entorhinal cortex–hippocampal slices &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. By using a matrix of 4096 microelectrodes, the sites of initiation, propagation pathways, and spatiotemporal characteristics of activity patterns could be studied with unprecedented high resolution. To this end, we developed an analytic tool based on bidimensional current source density estimation, which delimits sinks and sources with a high precision and evaluates their trajectories using the concept of center of mass. With this methodology, we found that FRs can arise almost simultaneously at noncontiguous sites in the CA3-to-CA1 direction, underlying the spatial heterogeneity of epileptogenic foci, while continuous somatodendritic waves of activity develop. An unexpected, yet important propagation route is the propagation of activity from CA3 into the hilus and dentate gyrus. This pathway may cause reverberating activation of both regions, supporting sustained pathological network events and altered information processing in hippocampal networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Fast ripples (FRs) have been considered as a biomarker of epileptic activity and may signal the focus of seizure generation. In a model of traumatic brain injury in the rat, FRs appear in the hippocampus within a couple of hours after an extrahippocampal, cortical lesion. We analyzed the origin and dynamics of the FRs in the hippocampus using massive electrophysiological recordings, allowing an unprecedented high spatiotemporal resolution. We show that FRs originate in distinct and noncontiguous locations within the CA3 region and uncover, with high precision, the extent and dynamics of their current density. This activity propagates toward CA1 but also backpropagates to the hilus and the dentate gyrus, suggesting activation of defined microcircuits that can sustain recurrent excitation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Reduced Microglial Activity and Enhanced Glutamate Transmission in the Basolateral Amygdala in Early CNS Autoimmunity</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/42/9019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Emotional dysfunction is common in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and in mouse models of MS, including experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE); however, the etiology of these behaviors is poorly understood. To identify CNS changes associated with these behaviors, we focused on the basolateral amygdala (BLA) because of its central role in the regulation of emotional behavior. Whole-cell recordings were performed in the principal neurons of the BLA in early EAE, before demyelination, T-cell invasion, and motor dysfunction. EAE female mice displayed increased frequency of mEPSCs, with no alteration in amplitude or evoked EPSC paired-pulse ratio compared with controls. We found an increase in the AMPA-NMDA ratio and dendritic spine density, indicating increased numbers of glutamatergic synapses. We saw similar electrophysiological changes in BLA principal neurons after microglia were either inactivated (minocycline) or depleted (Mac1-Saporin) in the BLA. Microglia regulate synapses through pruning, directed by complement protein 3 (C3) expression. C3 was downregulated in the BLA in EAE. Ultrastructural analysis of microglia revealed more complex ramifications and reduced extracellular digestion of cellular elements. We also observed reduced IBA-1 and CD68 staining and lack of proinflammatory cytokine expression in the amygdala. Thus, early EAE is a state of microglial &quot;deactivation&quot; associated with reduced synaptic pruning. This contrasts with the prototypic microglial activation commonly associated with inflammatory CNS disease. Additionally, these data support a role for the acquired immune system to influence both neuronal and microglial function in early CNS autoimmunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Microglia help regulate synaptic homeostasis, but there has been little evidence for how this might be important in neuroinflammatory diseases. The data from this study reveal increased synaptic activity and spine density in early stages of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (an animal model of multiple sclerosis) in the basolateral amygdala, a nucleus important in the types of behavioral changes we have previously described. These electrophysiological and morphological effects occurred without significant elevation of local inflammatory cytokines or local demyelination. Unexpectedly, in the context of inflammatory state, we found that microglia were &quot;deactivated.&quot; This study provides strong evidence for a link between microglial activity and synaptic function; the conclusions contrast with the generally accepted view that microglia are activated in inflammatory disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: TOM1 Regulates Neuronal Accumulation of Amyloid-{beta} Oligomers by Fc{gamma}RIIb2 Variant in Alzheimer's Disease</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/42/9001?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Emerging evidences suggest that intraneuronal Aβ correlates with the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and highly contributes to neurodegeneration. However, critical mediator responsible for Aβ uptake in AD pathology needs to be clarified. Here, we report that FcRIIb2, a variant of Fc-receptor IIb (FcRIIb), functions in neuronal uptake of pathogenic Aβ. Cellular accumulation of oligomeric Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42,&lt;/sub&gt; not monomeric Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; or oligomeric Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–40&lt;/sub&gt;, was blocked by &lt;i&gt;Fcgr2b&lt;/i&gt; knock-out in neurons and partially in astrocytes. Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; internalization was FcRIIb2 di-leucine motif-dependent and attenuated by TOM1, a FcRIIb2-binding protein that repressed the receptor recycling. TOM1 expression was downregulated in the hippocampus of male 3xTg-AD mice and AD patients, and regulated by miR-126-3p in neuronal cells after exposure to Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt;. In addition, memory impairments in male 3xTg-AD mice were rescued by the lentiviral administration of TOM1 gene. Augmented Aβ uptake into lysosome caused its accumulation in cytoplasm and mitochondria. Moreover, neuronal accumulation of Aβ in both sexes of 3xTg-AD mice and memory deficits in male 3xTg-AD mice were ameliorated by forebrain-specific expression of Aβ-uptake-defective &lt;i&gt;Fcgr2b&lt;/i&gt; mutant. Our findings suggest that FcRIIb2 is essential for neuropathic uptake of Aβ in AD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Accumulating evidences suggest that intraneuronal Aβ is found in the early step of AD brain and is implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. However, the critical mediator involved in these processes is uncertain. Here, we describe that the FcRIIb2 variant is responsible for both neuronal uptake and intraneuronal distribution of pathogenic Aβ linked to memory deficits in AD mice, showing a pathologic significance of the internalized Aβ. Further, Aβ internalization is attenuated by TOM1, a novel FcRIIb2-binding protein. Together, we provide a molecular mechanism responsible for neuronal uptake of pathogenic Aβ found in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Predictive-coding theories assume that perception and action are based on internal models derived from previous experience. Such internal models require selection and consolidation to be stored over time. Sleep is known to support memory consolidation. We hypothesized that sleep supports both consolidation and abstraction of an internal task model that is subsequently used to predict upcoming stimuli. Human subjects (of either sex) were trained on deterministic visual sequences and tested with interleaved deviant stimuli after retention intervals of sleep or wakefulness. Adopting a predictive-coding approach, we found increased prediction strength after sleep, as expressed by increased error rates to deviant stimuli, but fewer errors for the immediately following standard stimuli. Sleep likewise enhanced the formation of an abstract sequence model, independent of the temporal context during training. Moreover, sleep increased confidence for sequence knowledge, reflecting enhanced metacognitive access to the model. Our results suggest that sleep supports the formation of internal models which can be used to predict upcoming events in different contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; To efficiently interact with the ever-changing world, we predict upcoming events based on similar previous experiences. Sleep is known to benefit memory consolidation. However, it is not clear whether sleep specifically supports the transformation of past experience into predictions of future events. Here, we find that, when human subjects sleep after learning a sequence of predictable visual events, they make better predictions about upcoming events compared with subjects who stayed awake for an equivalent period of time. In addition, sleep supports the transfer of such knowledge between different temporal contexts (i.e., when sequences unfold at different speeds). Thus, sleep supports perception and action by enhancing the predictive utility of previous experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Graded Transmission without Action Potentials Sustains Rhythmic Activity in Some But Not All Modulators That Activate the Same Current</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/42/8976?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurons in the central pattern-generating circuits in the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion (STG) release neurotransmitter both as a graded function of presynaptic membrane potential that persists in TTX and in response to action potentials. In the STG of the male crab &lt;i&gt;Cancer borealis&lt;/i&gt;, the modulators oxotremorine, &lt;i&gt;C. borealis&lt;/i&gt; tachykinin-related peptide Ia (CabTRP1a), red pigment concentrating hormone (RPCH), proctolin, TNRNFLRFamide, and crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP) produce and sustain robust pyloric rhythms by activating the same modulatory current (&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;MI&lt;/sub&gt;), albeit on different subsets of pyloric network targets. The muscarinic agonist oxotremorine, and the peptides CabTRP1a and RPCH elicited rhythmic triphasic intracellular alternating fluctuations of activity in the presence of TTX. Intracellular waveforms of pyloric neurons in oxotremorine and CabTRP1a in TTX were similar to those in the intact rhythm, and phase relationships among neurons were conserved. Although cycle frequency was conserved in oxotremorine and TTX, it was altered in CabTRP1a in the presence of TTX. Both rhythms were primarily driven by the pacemaker kernel consisting of the Anterior Burster and Pyloric Dilator neurons. In contrast, in TTX the circuit remained silent in proctolin, TNRNFLRFamide, and CCAP. These experiments show that graded synaptic transmission in the absence of voltage-gated Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; current is sufficient to sustain rhythmic motor activity in some, but not other, modulatory conditions, even when each modulator activates the same ionic current. This further demonstrates that similar rhythmic motor patterns can be produced by qualitatively different mechanisms, one that depends on the activity of voltage-gated Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels, and one that can persist in their absence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The pyloric rhythm of the crab stomatogastric ganglion depends both on spike-mediated and graded synaptic transmission. We activate the pyloric rhythm with a wide variety of different neuromodulators, all of which converge on the same voltage-dependent inward current. Interestingly, when action potentials and spike-mediated transmission are blocked using TTX, we find that the muscarinic agonist oxotremorine and the neuropeptide CabTRP1a sustain rhythmic alternations and appropriate phases of activity in the absence of action potentials. In contrast, TTX blocks rhythmic activity in the presence of other modulators. This demonstrates fundamental differences in the burst-generation mechanisms in different modulators that would not be suspected on the basis of their cellular actions at the level of the targeted current.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neural Correlate of Visual Familiarity in Macaque Area V2</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/42/8967?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurons in macaque inferotemporal cortex (ITC) respond less strongly to familiar than to novel images. It is commonly assumed that this effect arises within ITC because its neurons respond selectively to complex images and thus encode in an explicit form information sufficient for identifying a particular image as familiar. However, no prior study has examined whether neurons in low-order visual areas selective for local features also exhibit familiarity suppression. To address this issue, we recorded from neurons in macaque area V2 with semichronic microelectrode arrays while monkeys repeatedly viewed a set of large complex natural images. We report here that V2 neurons exhibit familiarity suppression. The effect develops over several days with a trajectory well fitted by an exponential function with a rate constant of ~100 exposures. Suppression occurs in V2 at a latency following image onset shorter than its reported latency in ITC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Familiarity suppression, the tendency for neurons to respond less strongly to familiar than novel images, is well known in monkey inferotemporal cortex. Suppression has been thought to arise in inferotemporal cortex because its neurons respond selectively to large complex images and thus explicitly to encode information sufficient for identifying a particular image as familiar. No previous study has explored the possibility that familiarity suppression occurs even in early-stage visual areas where neurons are selective for simple features in confined receptive fields. We now report that neurons in area V2 exhibit familiarity suppression. This finding challenges our current understanding of information processing in V2 as well as our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie familiarity suppression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Divergent Prelimbic Cortical Pathways Interact with BDNF to Regulate Cocaine-seeking</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/42/8956?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A single BDNF microinfusion into prelimbic (PrL) cortex immediately after the last cocaine self-administration session decreases relapse to cocaine-seeking. The BDNF effect is blocked by NMDAR antagonists. To determine whether synaptic activity in putative excitatory projection neurons in PrL cortex is sufficient for BDNF's effect on relapse, the PrL cortex of male rats was infused with an inhibitory Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD) viral vector driven by an αCaMKII promoter. Immediately after the last cocaine self-administration session, rats were injected with clozapine-N-oxide 30 min before an intra-PrL BDNF microinfusion. DREADD-mediated inhibition of the PrL cortex blocked the BDNF-induced decrease in cocaine-seeking after abstinence and cue-induced reinstatement after extinction. Unexpectedly, DREADD inhibition of PrL neurons in PBS-infused rats also reduced cocaine-seeking, suggesting that divergent PrL pathways affect relapse. Next, using a cre-dependent retroviral approach, we tested the ability of DREADD inhibition of PrL projections to the NAc core or the paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) to alter cocaine-seeking in BDNF- and PBS-infused rats. Selective inhibition of the PrL-NAc pathway at the end of cocaine self-administration blocked the BDNF-induced decrease in cocaine-seeking but had no effect in PBS-infused rats. In contrast, selective inhibition of the PrL-PVT pathway in PBS-infused rats decreased cocaine-seeking, and this effect was prevented in BDNF-infused rats. Thus, activity in the PrL-NAc pathway is responsible for the therapeutic effect of BDNF on cocaine-seeking whereas inhibition of activity in the PrL-pPVT pathway elicits a similar therapeutic effect in the absence of BDNF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The major issue in cocaine addiction is the high rate of relapse. However, the neuronal pathways governing relapse remain unclear. Using a pathway-specific chemogenetic approach, we found that BDNF differentially regulates two key prelimbic pathways to guide long-term relapse. Infusion of BDNF in the prelimbic cortex during early withdrawal from cocaine self-administration decreases relapse that is prevented when neurons projecting from the prelimbic cortex to the nucleus accumbens core are inhibited. In contrast, BDNF restores relapse when neurons projecting from the prelimbic cortex to the posterior paraventricular thalamic nucleus are inhibited. This study demonstrates that two divergent cortical outputs mediate relapse that is regulated in opposite directions by infusing BDNF in the prelimbic cortex during early withdrawal from cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Network Architecture Underlying Basal Autonomic Outflow: Evidence from Frontotemporal Dementia</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/42/8943?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The salience network is a distributed neural system that maintains homeostasis by regulating autonomic nervous system activity and social-emotional function. Here we examined how within-network connectivity relates to individual differences in human (including males and females) baseline parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous activity. We measured resting autonomic nervous system physiology in 24 healthy controls and 23 patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), a neurodegenerative disease characterized by baseline autonomic deficits. Participants also underwent structural and task-free fMRI. First, we used voxel-based morphometry to determine whether salience network atrophy was associated with lower baseline respiratory sinus arrhythmia (a parasympathetic measure) and skin conductance level (a sympathetic measure) in bvFTD. Next, we examined whether functional connectivity deficits in 21 autonomic-relevant, salience network node-pairs related to baseline autonomic dysfunction. Lower baseline respiratory sinus arrhythmia was associated with smaller volume in left ventral anterior insula (vAI), weaker connectivity between bilateral vAI and bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and stronger connectivity between bilateral ACC and bilateral hypothalamus/amygdala. Lower baseline skin conductance level, in contrast, was associated with smaller volume in inferior temporal gyrus, dorsal mid-insula, and hypothalamus; weaker connectivity between bilateral ACC and right hypothalamus/amygdala; and stronger connectivity between bilateral dorsal anterior insula and periaqueductal gray. Our results suggest that baseline parasympathetic and sympathetic tone depends on the integrity of lateralized salience network hubs (left vAI for parasympathetic and right hypothalamus/amygdala for sympathetic) and highly calibrated ipsilateral and contralateral network connections. In bvFTD, deficits in this system may underlie resting parasympathetic and sympathetic disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The salience network maintains homeostasis and regulates autonomic nervous system activity. Whether within-network connectivity patterns underlie individual differences in resting parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system activity, however, is not well understood. We measured baseline autonomic nervous system activity in healthy controls and patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, a neurodegenerative disease characterized by resting autonomic deficits, and probed how salience network dysfunction relates to diminished parasympathetic and sympathetic outflow. Our results indicate that baseline parasympathetic and sympathetic tone are the product of complex, opposing intranetwork nodal interactions and depend on the integrity of highly tuned, lateralized salience network hubs (i.e., left ventral anterior insula for parasympathetic activity and right hypothalamus/amygdala for sympathetic activity).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dorsal BNST {alpha}2A-Adrenergic Receptors Produce HCN-Dependent Excitatory Actions That Initiate Anxiogenic Behaviors</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/42/8922?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Stress is a precipitating agent in neuropsychiatric disease and initiates relapse to drug-seeking behavior in addicted patients. Targeting the stress system in protracted abstinence from drugs of abuse with anxiolytics may be an effective treatment modality for substance use disorders. α&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;-adrenergic receptors (α&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;-ARs) in extended amygdala structures play key roles in dampening stress responses. Contrary to early thinking, α&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;-ARs are expressed at non-noradrenergic sites in the brain. These non-noradrenergic α&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;-ARs play important roles in stress responses, but their cellular mechanisms of action are unclear. In humans, the α&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;-AR agonist guanfacine reduces overall craving and uncouples craving from stress, yet minimally affects relapse, potentially due to competing actions in the brain. Here, we show that heteroceptor α&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;-ARs postsynaptically enhance dorsal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (dBNST) neuronal activity in mice of both sexes. This effect is mediated by hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channels because inhibition of these channels is necessary and sufficient for excitatory actions. Finally, this excitatory action is mimicked by clozapine-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-oxide activation of the G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;-coupled DREADD hM4Di in dBNST neurons and its activation elicits anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze. Together, these data provide a framework for elucidating cell-specific actions of GPCR signaling and provide a potential mechanism whereby competing anxiogenic and anxiolytic actions of guanfacine may affect its clinical utility in the treatment of addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Stress affects the development of neuropsychiatric disorders including anxiety and addiction. Guanfacine is an α2A-adrenergic receptor (α2A-AR) agonist with actions in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) that produces antidepressant actions and uncouples stress from reward-related behaviors. Here, we show that guanfacine increases dorsal BNST neuronal activity through actions at postsynaptic α2A-ARs via a mechanism that involves hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide gated cation channels. This action is mimicked by activation of the designer receptor hM4Di expressed in the BNST, which also induces anxiety-like behaviors. Together, these data suggest that postsynaptic α2A-ARs in BNST have excitatory actions on BNST neurons and that these actions can be phenocopied by the so-called &quot;inhibitory&quot; DREADDs, suggesting that care must be taken regarding interpretation of data obtained with these tools.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Distal Dendritic Enrichment of HCN1 Channels in Hippocampal CA1 Is Promoted by Estrogen, but Does Not Require Reelin</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/5/ENEURO.0258-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;HCN1 compartmentalization in CA1 pyramidal cells, essential for hippocampal information processing, is believed to be controlled by the extracellular matrix protein Reelin. Expression of Reelin, in turn, is stimulated by 17β-estradiol (E2). In this study, we therefore tested whether E2 regulates the compartmentalization of HCN1 in CA1 via Reelin. In organotypic entorhino-hippocampal cultures, we found that E2 promotes HCN1 distal dendritic enrichment via the G protein–coupled estrogen receptor GPER1, but apparently independent of Reelin, because GST-RAP, known to reduce Reelin signaling, did not prevent E2-induced HCN1 enrichment in distal CA1. We therefore re-examined the role of Reelin for the regulation of HCN1 compartmentalization and could not detect effects of reduced Reelin signaling on HCN1 distribution in CA1, either in the (developmental) slice culture model or in tamoxifen-inducible conditional &lt;i&gt;reelin&lt;/i&gt; knockout mice during adulthood. We conclude that for HCN1 channel compartmentalization in CA1 pyramidal cells, Reelin is not as essential as previously proposed, and E2 effects on HCN1 distribution in CA1 are mediated by mechanisms that do not involve Reelin. Because HCN1 localization was not altered at different phases of the estrous cycle, gonadally derived estradiol is unlikely to regulate HCN1 channel compartmentalization, while the pattern of immunoreactivity of aromatase, the final enzyme of estradiol synthesis, argues for a role of local hippocampal E2 synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Simultaneous Assessment of Homonymous and Heteronymous Monosynaptic Reflex Excitability in the Adult Rat</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/5/ENEURO.0227-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;In order to successfully perform motor tasks such as locomotion, the central nervous system must coordinate contractions of antagonistic and synergistic muscles across multiple joints. This coordination is largely dependent upon the function of proprioceptive afferents (PAs), which make monosynaptic connections with homonymous motoneurons. Homonymous pathways have been well studied in both health and disease but their collateral fibers projecting to heteronymous, synergistic muscles receive relatively less attention. This is surprising given that PA collaterals have significant effects on the excitability of heteronymous motoneurons, and that their synaptic terminal density is activity dependent. It is likely that the relative lack of literature is due to the lack of a preparation which allows synergistic heteronymous pathways to be assessed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we describe a method to simultaneously evoke homonymous and heteronymous (synergistic) monosynaptic reflexes (MSRs) and study their modulation by descending pathways in adult rats. Through stimulation of the medial plantar nerve, we were able to produce an H reflex in the intrinsic foot (IF) muscles of the hind paw with a latency of 10.52 ± 3.8 ms. Increasing the stimulus intensity evoked a robust signal with a monosynaptic latency (11.32 ± 0.35 ms), recorded in the ipsilateral gastrocnemius (Gs). Our subsequent analyses suggest that Gs motoneurons were activated via heteronymous afferent collaterals from the medial plantar nerve. These reflexes could be evoked bilaterally and were modulated by conditioning stimuli to the cortex (Cx) and reticular formation. Interestingly, cortical stimulation was equally efficient at modulating both ipsilateral and contralateral reflexes, indicating that cortical modulation of lumbar sensory afferents lacks the laterality demonstrated by studies of cortical muscle activation. This technique represents a novel, relatively simple way to assess heteronymous afferent pathways in normal motor control as well as in models of motor disorders where adaptive and maladaptive plasticity of PAs and descending systems affects functional outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Systematic Analysis of Transmitter Coexpression Reveals Organizing Principles of Local Interneuron Heterogeneity</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/5/ENEURO.0212-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Broad neuronal classes are surprisingly heterogeneous across many parameters, and subclasses often exhibit partially overlapping traits including transmitter coexpression. However, the extent to which transmitter coexpression occurs in predictable, consistent patterns is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that pairwise coexpression of GABA and multiple neuropeptide families by olfactory local interneurons (LNs) of the moth &lt;i&gt;Manduca sexta&lt;/i&gt; is highly heterogeneous, with a single LN capable of expressing neuropeptides from at least four peptide families and few instances in which neuropeptides are consistently coexpressed. Using computational modeling, we demonstrate that observed coexpression patterns cannot be explained by independent probabilities of expression of each neuropeptide. Our analyses point to three organizing principles that, once taken into consideration, allow replication of overall coexpression structure: (1) peptidergic neurons are highly likely to coexpress GABA; (2) expression probability of allatotropin depends on myoinhibitory peptide expression; and (3) the all-or-none coexpression patterns of tachykinin neurons with several other neuropeptides. For other peptide pairs, the presence of one peptide was not predictive of the presence of the other, and coexpression probability could be replicated by independent probabilities. The stochastic nature of these coexpression patterns highlights the heterogeneity of transmitter content among LNs and argues against clear-cut definition of subpopulation types based on the presence of single neuropeptides. Furthermore, the receptors for all neuropeptides and GABA were expressed within each population of principal neuron type in the antennal lobe (AL). Thus, activation of any given LN results in a dynamic cocktail of modulators that have the potential to influence every level of olfactory processing within the AL.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/5/ENEURO.0082-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Small GTP-converting enzymes, GTPases, are essential for the efficient completion of many physiological and developmental processes. They are regulated by GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) and guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). &lt;i&gt;Arhgap39&lt;/i&gt;, also known as preoptic regulatory factor-2 (Porf-2) or Vilse, a member of the Rho GAP group, was first identified in 1990 in the rat CNS. It has since been shown to regulate apoptosis, cell migration, neurogenesis, and cerebral and hippocampal dendritic spine morphology. It plays a pivotal role in neurodevelopment and learning and memory. Homologous or orthologous genes are found in more than 280 vertebrate and invertebrate species, suggesting preservation through evolution. Not surprisingly, loss of the &lt;i&gt;Arhgap39/Porf-2&lt;/i&gt; gene in mice manifests as an embryonic lethal condition. Although &lt;i&gt;Arhgap39/Porf-2&lt;/i&gt; is highly expressed in the brain, it is also widely distributed throughout the body, with potential additional roles in oncogenesis and morphogenesis. This review summarizes, for the first time, the known information about this gene under its various names, in addition to considering its transcripts and proteins. The majority of findings described have been made in rats, mice, humans, and fruit flies. This work surveys the known functions, functional mediators, variables modifying expression and upstream regulators of expression, and potential physiological and pathological roles of &lt;i&gt;Arhgap39/Porf-2&lt;/i&gt; in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Functional Categories of Visuomotor Neurons in Macaque Frontal Eye Field</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/5/ENEURO.0131-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Frontal eye field (FEF) in macaque monkeys contributes to visual attention, visual–motor transformations and production of eye movements. Traditionally, neurons in FEF have been classified by the magnitude of increased discharge rates following visual stimulus presentation, during a waiting period, and associated with eye movement production. However, considerable heterogeneity remains within the traditional visual, visuomovement, and movement categories. Cluster analysis is a data-driven method of identifying self-segregating groups within a dataset. Because many cluster analysis techniques exist and outcomes vary with analysis assumptions, consensus clustering aggregates over multiple analyses, identifying robust groups. To describe more comprehensively the neuronal composition of FEF, we applied a consensus clustering technique for unsupervised categorization of patterns of spike rate modulation measured during a memory-guided saccade task. We report 10 functional categories, expanding on the traditional 3 categories. Categories were distinguished by latency, magnitude, and sign of visual response; the presence of sustained activity; and the dynamics, magnitude and sign of saccade-related modulation. Consensus clustering can include other metrics and can be applied to datasets from other brain regions to provide better information guiding microcircuit models of cortical function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.06710</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the eyes of a rationalist like Descartes or Spinoza, human reasoning is
flawless, marching toward uncovering ultimate truth. A few centuries later,
however, culminating in the work of Kahneman and Tversky, human reasoning was
portrayed as anything but flawless, filled with numerous misjudgments, biases,
and cognitive fallacies. With further investigations, new cognitive fallacies
continually emerged, leading to a state of affairs which can fairly be
characterized as the cognitive fallacy zoo! In this largely methodological
work, we formally present a principled way to bring order to this zoo. We
introduce the idea of establishing implication relationships (IRs) between
cognitive fallacies, formally characterizing how one fallacy implies another.
IR is analogous to, and partly inspired by, the fundamental concept of
reduction in computational complexity theory. We present several examples of
IRs involving experimentally well-documented cognitive fallacies: base-rate
neglect, availability bias, conjunction fallacy, decoy effect, framing effect,
and Allais paradox. We conclude by discussing how our work: (i) allows for
identifying those pivotal cognitive fallacies whose investigation would be the
most rewarding research agenda, and importantly (ii) permits a systematized,
guided research program on cognitive fallacies, motivating influential
theoretical as well as experimental avenues of future research.

	<content:encoded>Fabry disease (FD) is a life-threatening X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by α-galactosidase A (α-GAL) deficiency. Small fiber pathology and pain are major FD symptoms of unknown pathophysiology. α-GAL deficient mice (GLA KO) age-dependently accumulate globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons paralleled by endoplasmic stress and apoptosis as contributors to skin denervation. Old GLA KO mice show increased TRPV1 protein in DRG neurons and heat hypersensitivity upon i.pl. capsaicin. In turn, GLA KO mice are protected from heat and mechanical hypersensitivity in neuropathic and inflammatory pain models based on reduced neuronal I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; and Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 currents. We show that in vitro α-GAL silencing increases intracellular Gb3 accumulation paralleled by loss of Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 currents, which is reversed by incubation with agalsidase-α and lucerastat. We provide first evidence of a direct Gb3 effect on neuronal integrity and ion channel function as potential mechanism underlying pain and small fiber pathology in FD.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Changes to social feeding behaviors are not sufficient for the fitness gains of the C. elegans N2 reference strain</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38675</link>
	<content:encoded>The standard reference &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; strain, N2, has evolved marked behavioral changes in social feeding behavior since its isolation from the wild. We show that the causal, laboratory-derived mutations in two genes, &lt;i&gt;npr-1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;glb-5&lt;/i&gt;, confer large fitness advantages in standard laboratory conditions. Using environmental manipulations that suppress social/solitary behavior differences, we show the fitness advantages of the derived alleles remained unchanged, suggesting selection on these alleles acted through pleiotropic traits. Transcriptomics, developmental timing, and food consumption assays showed that N2 animals mature faster, produce more sperm, and consume more food than a strain containing ancestral alleles of these genes regardless of behavioral strategies. Our data suggest that the pleiotropic effects of &lt;i&gt;glb-5&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;npr-1&lt;/i&gt; are a consequence of changes to O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; -sensing neurons that regulate both aerotaxis and energy homeostasis. Our results demonstrate how pleiotropy can lead to profound behavioral changes in a popular laboratory model.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Feedback regulation of cytoneme-mediated transport shapes a tissue-specific FGF morphogen gradient</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38137</link>
	<content:encoded>Gradients of signaling proteins are essential for inducing tissue morphogenesis. However, mechanisms of gradient formation remain controversial. Here we characterized the distribution of fluorescently-tagged signaling proteins, FGF and FGFR, expressed at physiological levels from the genomic knock-in alleles in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. FGF produced in the larval wing imaginal-disc moves to the air-sac-primordium (ASP) through FGFR-containing cytonemes that extend from the ASP to contact the wing-disc source. The number of FGF-receiving cytonemes extended by ASP cells decreases gradually with increasing distance from the source, generating a recipient-specific FGF gradient. Acting as a morphogen in the ASP, FGF activates concentration-dependent gene expression, inducing &lt;i&gt;pointed&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;P1 at &lt;/i&gt;higher and &lt;i&gt;cut&lt;/i&gt; at lower levels. The transcription-factors Pointed-P1 and Cut antagonize each other and differentially regulate formation of FGFR-containing cytonemes, creating regions with higher-to-lower numbers of FGF-receiving cytonemes. These results reveal a robust mechanism where morphogens self-generate precise tissue-specific gradient contours through feedback regulation of cytoneme-mediated dispersion.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37268</link>
	<content:encoded>MarR (multiple antibiotic resistance repressor) family proteins are bacterial repressors that regulate transcription in response to a wide range of chemical signals. Although specific features of MarR family function have been described, the role of atomic motions in MarRs remains unexplored thus limiting insights into the evolution of allostery in this ubiquitous family of repressors. Here, we provide the first experimental evidence that internal dynamics play a crucial functional role in MarR proteins. &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; AdcR (adhesin-competence repressor) regulates Zn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis and Zn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; functions as an allosteric activator of DNA binding. Zn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; coordination triggers a transition from somewhat independent domains to a more compact structure. We identify residues that impact allosteric activation on the basis of Zn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-induced perturbations of atomic motions over a wide range of timescales. These findings appear to reconcile the distinct allosteric mechanisms proposed for other MarRs and highlight the importance of conformational dynamics in biological regulation.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/446625v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a genetically complex, clinically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disease. Recently, our understanding of the molecular abnormalities in ASD has been expanded through transcriptomic analyses of postmortem brains. However, a crucial molecular pathway involved in synaptic development, RNA editing, has not yet been studied on a genome-wide scale. Here, we profiled the global patterns of adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing in a large cohort of post-mortem ASD brains. Strikingly, we observed a global bias of hypo-editing in ASD brains, common to different brain regions and involving many genes with known neurobiological functions. Through genome-wide protein-RNA binding analyses and detailed molecular assays, we show that the Fragile X proteins, FMRP and FXR1P, interact with ADAR proteins and modulate A-to-I editing. Furthermore, we observed convergent patterns of RNA editing alterations in ASD and Fragile X syndrome, thus establishing RNA editing as a molecular link underlying these two highly related diseases. Our findings support a role for RNA editing dysregulation in ASD and highlight novel mechanisms for RNA editing regulation.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Prospect Theory is the predominant behavioral economic theory describing decision-making under risk. It accounts for near universal aspects of human choice behavior whose prevalence may reflect fundamental neural mechanisms. We now apply Prospect Theory's framework to rodents, using a task in which rats chose between guaranteed and probabilistic rewards. Like humans, rats distorted probabilities and showed diminishing marginal sensitivity, in which they were less sensitive to differences in larger rewards. They exhibited reference dependence, in which the valence of outcomes (gain or loss) was determined by an internal reference point reflecting reward history. The similarities between rats and humans suggest conserved neural substrates, and enable application of powerful molecular/circuit tools to study mechanisms of psychological phenomena from behavioral economics.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Though congenital hydrocephalus is heritable, it has been linked only to eight genes, one of which is MPDZ. Humans and mice that carry a truncated version of MPDZ incur severe hydrocephalus resulting in acute morbidity and lethality. We show by magnetic resonance imaging that contrast-medium penetrates into the brain ventricles of mice carrying a Mpdz loss-of-function mutation, whereas none is detected in the ventricles of normal mice, implying that the permeability of the choroid plexus epithelial cell monolayer is abnormally high. Comparative proteomic analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid of normal and hydrocephalic mice revealed up to a 53-fold increase in protein concentration, suggesting that transcytosis through the choroid plexus epithelial cells of Mpdz KO mice is substantially higher than in normal mice. These conclusions are support-ed by ultrastructural evidence, and by immunohistochemistry and cytology data. Our results provide a straightforward and concise explanation for the pathophysiology of Mpdz-linked hydrocephalus.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The impact of global vs. phonics teaching methods for reading on the emergence of left hemisphere neural specialization for word recognition is unknown in children. We tested 42 first graders behaviorally and with electroencephalography with Fast Periodic Visual Stimulation to measure selective neural responses to letter strings. Letter strings were inserted periodically (1/5) in pseudofonts in 40sec sequences displayed at 6Hz and were either words globally taught at school, eliciting visual whole-word form recognition (global method), or control words/pseudowords eliciting grapheme-phoneme mappings (phonic method). Selective responses (F/5, 1.2Hz) were left lateralized for control stimuli but bilateral for globally taught words, especially in poor readers. These results show that global method instruction induces activation in the right hemisphere, involved in holistic processing and visual object recognition, rather than in the specialized left hemisphere for reading. Poor readers, given their difficulties in automatizing grapheme-phoneme mappings, mostly rely on this alternative inadequate strategy.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Multivariate lesion behaviour mapping based on machine learning algorithms has recently been suggested to complement the methods of anatomo-behavioural approaches in cognitive neuroscience. Several studies applied and validated support vector regression-based lesion symptom mapping (SVR-LSM) to map anatomo-behavioural relations. However, this promising method, as well as the multivariate approach per se, still bears many open questions. By using large lesion samples in three simulation experiments, the present study empirically tested the validity of several methodological aspects. We found that i) correction for multiple comparisons is required in the current implementation of SVR-LSM, ii) that sample sizes of at least 100 to 120 subjects are required to optimally model voxel-wise lesion location in SVR-LSM, and iii) that SVR-LSM is susceptible to misplacement of statistical topographies along the brain's vasculature to a similar extent as mass-univariate analyses.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/445742v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>A robust method for quantifying the cellular architecture (cytoarchitecture) of the brain is a requisite for differentiating brain areas, identifying neurological diseases, and modeling architectural differences across species. Current methods for characterizing cytoarchitecture and, in particular, identifying laminar (layer) divisions in tissue samples, require the expertise of trained neuroanatomists to manually annotate the various regions within each image. However, as neuroanatomical datasets grow in volume, manual annotations become inefficient, impractical, and risk the potential of biasing results. In this paper, we propose an automated framework for cellular density estimation and detection of laminar divisions within retinal and neocortical datasets. This method is based upon the use of sparse recovery methods to simultaneously denoise cellular densities and detect transitions in the density which mark the beginning and end of layers. Retinal and neocortical images are used to demonstrate the efficacy of the methods. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using automation to reveal the cytoarchitecture of neurological samples in high-resolution images.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/445700v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Identification of neuron cell type helps us connect neural circuitry and behavior; greater specificity in cell type and subtype classification provides a clearer picture of specific relationships between the brain and behavior. With the advent of high-density probes, large-scale neuron classification is needed, as typical extracellular recordings are identity-blind to the neurons they record. Current methods for identification of neurons include optogenetic tagging and intracellular recordings, but are limited in that they are expensive, time-consuming, and have a limited scope. Therefore, a more automated, real-time method is needed for large-scale neuron identification. Data from two recordings was incorporated into this research; the single-channel recording included data from three neuron types in the motor cortex: FS, IT, and PT neurons. The multichannel recording contained data from two neuron subtypes: PT_L and PT_U neurons. This allowed for an examination of both general neuron classification and more specific subtype classification, which was done via artificial neural networks (ANNs) and machine learning (ML) algorithms. For the single-channel neuron classification, the ANNs achieved 91% accuracy, while the ML algorithms achieved 98% accuracy, using the raw electrical waveform. The multi-channel classification, which was significantly more difficult due to the similarity between the neuron types, yielded an ineffective ANN, reaching 68% accuracy, while the ML algorithms reached 81% using 8 calculated features from the waveform. Thus, to distinguish between differentneuron cell types and subtypes in the motor cortex, both ANNs andspecific ML algorithms can facilitate rapid and accurate near realtime large-scale classification.</content:encoded>

A linear combination of these neurons' activity predicts the animal's velocity and body curvature and is sufficient to infer its posture. This sparse linear model outperforms single neuron or PCA models at predicting behavior. Among neurons important for the prediction are well-known locomotory neurons, such as AVA, as well as neurons not traditionally associated with locomotion. We compare neural activity of the same animal during unrestrained movement and during immobilization and find large differences between brain-wide neural dynamics during real and fictive locomotion.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/445585v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Spike sorting is the process of detecting and clustering action potential waveforms from extracellular voltage recordings to identify spikes of putative single neurons. Typically, spike detection is done using a fixed voltage threshold and shadow period, but this approach can lead to missed spikes during high firing rate epochs or noisy conditions. We developed a novel spike detection method utilizing a computationally simple form of template matching that efficiently detects spikes from candidate single units and is tolerant of high firing rates and electrical noise without a whitening filter. Template matching was based on a sliding cosine similarity between mean spike waveforms of candidate single units and the extracellular voltage signal. Performance was tested in whisker somatosensory cortex (S1) of anesthetized mice in vivo. The method consistently detected whisker-evoked spikes that were missed by a standard fixed voltage threshold. Detection was most improved for spikes evoked by strong stimuli (40-70% increase), less improved for weaker stimuli, and unchanged for spontaneous spiking. This reflected the failure of standard detection during spatiotemporally dense spiking. Template-based detection revealed higher signal-to-noise ratio for sensory responses and sharper sensory tuning. Thus, this template matching method (and other model-based spike detection methods) critically improve the quantification of single-unit spiking activity.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The Landscape of Parkin Variants Reveals Pathogenic Mechanisms and Therapeutic Targets in PD</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/445551v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Mutations in Parkin (PARK2) are the most common genetic cause of early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). Parkin encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase implicated in the turnover of damaged mitochondria. Hundreds of Parkin missense variants have been reported in public databases, yet the role of most of them in PD remains unclear. Here we analyzed Parkin variants using clinical, experimental, and structural modeling approaches. For most variants, clinical evidence alone was insufficient to determine pathogenicity. Utilizing a cell model that allows measurement of Parkin-mediated mitophagy and Parkin stability, 51 variants were classified into five groups based on their effect on Parkin function. Most variants were like wildtype and unexpectedly, several enhanced mitophagy. A minority destabilized Parkin or severely disrupted Parkin-mediated mitophagy, most of which were also determined as pathogenic based on clinical evidence alone. Structural simulation predicted multiple mechanisms for both the increase and decrease in Parkin function. Interestingly, impaired mitophagy in several of the most common pathogenic Parkin variants could be rescued both by naturally-occurring (p.V224A) and structure-guided designer (p.W403A; p.F146A) hyperactive Parkin variants. These findings provide a framework to classify Parkin variants based on pathogenicity and suggest that several pathogenic Parkin variants represent promising targets for genotype-specific drug design.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/445528v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Reduced levels of dopamine in Parkinson's disease (PD) contribute to changes in learning, resulting from the loss of midbrain dopamine neurons that transmit a teaching signal to the striatum. Dopamine medication used by PD patients has previously been linked to either behavioral changes during learning itself or adjustments in approach and avoidance behavior after learning. To date, however, very little is known about the specific relationship between dopaminergic medication-driven differences during learning and subsequent changes in approach/avoidance tendencies in individual patients. We assessed 24 PD patients on and off dopaminergic medication and 24 healthy controls (HC) performing a probabilistic reinforcement learning task, while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. During learning, medication in PD reduced an overemphasis on negative outcomes. When patients were on medication, learning rates were lower for negative (but not positive) outcomes and concurrent striatal BOLD responses showed reduced prediction error sensitivity. Medication-induced shifts in negative learning rates were predictive of changes in approach/avoidance choice patterns after learning, and these changes were accompanied by striatal BOLD response alterations. These findings highlight dopamine-driven learning differences in PD and provide new insight into how changes in learning impact the transfer of learned value to approach/avoidance responses in novel contexts.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/445064v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Imaging of transmembrane voltage deep in brain tissue with cellular resolution has the potential to reveal information processing by neuronal circuits in living animals with minimal perturbation. Multi-photon voltage imaging in vivo, however, is currently limited by speed and sensitivity of both indicators and imaging methods. Here, we report the engineering of an improved genetically encoded voltage indicator, ASAP3, which exhibits up to 51% fluorescence responses in the physiological voltage range, sub-millisecond activation kinetics, and full responsivity under two-photon illumination. We also introduce an ultrafast local volume excitation (ULOVE) two-photon scanning method to sample ASAP3 signals in awake mice at kilohertz rates with increased stability and sensitivity. ASAP3 and ULOVE allowed continuous single-trial tracking of spikes and subthreshold events for minutes in deep locations, with subcellular resolution, and with repeated sampling over multiple days. By imaging voltage in visual cortex neurons, we found evidence for cell type-dependent subthreshold modulation by locomotion. Thus, ASAP3 and ULOVE enable continuous high-speed high-resolution imaging of electrical activity in deeply located genetically defined neurons during awake behavior.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/444463v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Correlations of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) signals are being widely used for assessing functional connectivity of healthy and diseased brains. However, an association was recently observed between rsfMRI connectivity modulations and head motion and regarded as a causal relationship, which has raised serious concerns about the validity of many rsfMRI findings. Here, we studied the origin of this rsfMRI-motion association and its relationship to arousal modulations. By using a template-matching method to locate arousal-related fMRI changes, we showed that the effects of high motion time points on rsfMRI connectivity are due to their significant overlap with arousal-affected time points. The finding suggests that the association between rsfMRI connectivity and head motion arises from their co-modulations at transient arousal modulations, and this information is critical not only for proper interpretation of motion-associated rsfMRI connectivity changes but also for controlling the potential confounding effects of arousal modulation on rsMRI metrics.</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: p11 in cholinergic interneurons of the nucleus accumbens is essential for dopamine responses to rewarding stimuli</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0332-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;A recent study showed that p11 expressed in cholinergic interneurons (CINs) of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a key regulator of depression-like behaviors. Dopaminergic neurons projecting to the NAc are responsible for reward-related behaviors, and their function is impaired in depression. The present study investigated the role of p11 in NAc CINs in dopamine responses to rewarding stimuli. The extracellular dopamine and acetylcholine (ACh) levels in the NAc were determined in freely moving male mice using &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; microdialysis. Rewarding stimuli (cocaine, palatable food and female mouse encounter) induced an increase in dopamine efflux in the NAc of wild-type mice. The dopamine responses were attenuated (cocaine) or abolished (food and female mouse encounter) in constitutive p11 KO mice. The dopamine response to cocaine was accompanied by an increase in ACh NAc efflux, whereas the attenuated dopamine response to cocaine in p11 KO mice was restored by activation of nicotinic or muscarinic ACh receptors in the NAc. Dopamine responses to rewarding stimuli and ACh release in the NAc were attenuated in mice with deletion of p11 from cholinergic neurons (ChAT-p11 cKO mice), whereas gene delivery of p11 to CINs restored the dopamine responses. Furthermore, chemogenetic studies revealed that p11 is required for activation of CINs in response to rewarding stimuli. Thus, p11 in NAc CINs plays a critical role in activating these neurons to mediate dopamine responses to rewarding stimuli. The dysregulation of mesolimbic dopamine system by dysfunction of p11 in NAc CINs may be involved in pathogenesis of depressive states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; p11 is a critical regulator of CIN activity as measured by the dopamine response of the mesolimbic dopamine pathway to rewarding stimuli. p11 is required for reward-mediated NAc CIN activation and induction in ACh release, resulting in the enhancement of dopamine release. The reduction of p11 expression in NAc CINs is tightly associated with anhedonia as well as other depression-like symptoms of behavioral despair. To improve therapeutic efficacy of antidepressants for anhedonia, a new type of antidepressant directly or indirectly acting on the mesolimbic dopamine pathway needs to be developed. For this purpose, therapeutic strategies that increase the function of p11 and its signaling pathway in NAc CINs may have an impact on antidepressant efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Sex differences in the rapid cell signaling mechanisms underlying the memory-enhancing effects of 17{beta}-estradiol</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0267-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Little is known about how 17β-estradiol (E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) mediates memory formation in males. In ovariectomized mice, bilateral dorsal hippocampal (DH) infusion of E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; enhances memory consolidation in object recognition and object placement tasks in a manner dependent on activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt signaling. Here, bilateral DH E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; infusion enhanced memory consolidation in both tasks in ovariectomized female, gonadally-intact male, and castrated male mice, suggesting comparable facilitation of memory consolidation in both sexes, independent of testicular hormones in males. Contrary to previous reports in ovariectomized mice, E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; did not increase DH ERK or Akt phosphorylation in males, nor did the ERK inhibitor U0126 prevent E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from enhancing memory consolidation among intact and castrated males. These data suggest that ERK activation is not necessary for E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to enhance memory consolidation in males, and compared with previous reports in females, reveal novel sex differences in the cell-signaling pathways through which E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; facilitates memory consolidation. To explore the mechanisms underlying E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced memory enhancements in males, phosphorylation of the transcription factor cAMP binding protein (CREB) in the DH was assessed. E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; increased phospho-CREB levels in both sexes, yet U0126 did not block these increases in castrated or intact males, indicating that E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; regulates CREB phosphorylation in males via an ERK-independent mechanism. Collectively, these findings suggest that the beneficial effects of hippocampal E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on memory consolidation in males and females are mediated by different molecular mechanisms, which has important implications for the development of treatments to reduce memory dysfunction in men and women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significant Statement&lt;/b&gt; The impact of biological sex on neural function is understudied, despite clear sex differences in the risks and symptomology of disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, mood disorders, developmental learning disabilities, and attention-deficit disorder. The ability of 17β-estradiol to enhance memory consolidation in females depends on rapid activation of cell signaling pathways in the dorsal hippocampus, yet the mechanisms underlying its effects in males are unknown. The present study suggests a novel sex difference in the hippocampal cell-signaling mechanisms through which 17β-estradiol facilitates memory consolidation. These and future studies may lead to the development of sex-specific therapeutics that more effectively reduce cognitive dysfunction in diseases that disproportionately affect one sex or the other.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Immune challenge alters neural functioning via cytokine production. Inflammation has profound impact on the central regulation of fertility, but the mechanisms involved are not clearly defined. The anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 is responsible for balancing the immune response in the brain. To examine whether IL-10 has an effect on the function of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons, we first examined the effect of immune responses with distinct cytokine profiles, such as the T cell-dependent (TD) and T cell-independent (TI) B-cell response. We investigated the effect of the TD and TI immune responses on ERK1/2 phosphorylation in GnRH neurons by administering fluorescein isothiocyanate/keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH-FITC) or dextran-FITC to female mice. Although dextran-FITC had no effect, KLH-FITC induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in GnRH neurons after 6 d. KLH-FITC treatment increased the levels of IL-10 in the hypothalamus (HYP), but this treatment did not cause lymphocyte infiltration or an increase in the levels of proinflammatory cytokines. In IL-10 knock-out (KO) mice, KLH-FITC-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the GnRH neurons was absent. We also showed that in IL-10 KO mice, the estrous cycle was disrupted. Perforated patch-clamp recordings from GnRH-GFP neurons, IL-10 immunohistochemistry, and in vitro experiments on acute brain slices revealed that IL-10 can directly alter GnRH neuron firing and induce ERK1/2 phosphorylation. These observations demonstrate that IL-10 plays a role in influencing signaling of GnRH neurons in the TD immune response. These results also provide the first evidence that IL-10 can directly alter the function of GnRH neurons and may help the maintenance of the integrity of the estrous cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Strategic and Dynamic Temporal Weighting for Perceptual Decisions in Humans and Macaques</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/5/ENEURO.0169-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Perceptual decision-making is often modeled as the accumulation of sensory evidence over time. Recent studies using psychophysical reverse correlation have shown that even though the sensory evidence is stationary over time, subjects may exhibit a time-varying weighting strategy, weighting some stimulus epochs more heavily than others. While previous work has explained time-varying weighting as a consequence of static decision mechanisms (e.g., decision bound or leak), here we show that time-varying weighting can reflect strategic adaptation to stimulus statistics, and thus can readily take a number of forms. We characterized the temporal weighting strategies of humans and macaques performing a motion discrimination task in which the amount of information carried by the motion stimulus was manipulated over time. Both species could adapt their temporal weighting strategy to match the time-varying statistics of the sensory stimulus. When early stimulus epochs had higher mean motion strength than late, subjects adopted a pronounced early weighting strategy, where early information was weighted more heavily in guiding perceptual decisions. When the mean motion strength was greater in later stimulus epochs, in contrast, subjects shifted to a marked late weighting strategy. These results demonstrate that perceptual decisions involve a temporally flexible weighting process in both humans and monkeys, and introduce a paradigm with which to manipulate sensory weighting in decision-making tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Optimal Evidence Accumulation on Social Networks. (arXiv:1810.05909v1 [physics.soc-ph])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05909</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A fundamental question in biology is how organisms integrate sensory and
social evidence to make decisions. However, few models describe how both these
streams of information can be combined to optimize choices. Here we develop a
normative model for collective decision making in a network of agents
performing a two-alternative forced choice task. We assume that rational
(Bayesian) agents in this network make private measurements, and observe the
decisions of their neighbors until they accumulate sufficient evidence to make
an irreversible choice. As each agent communicates its decision to those
observing it, the flow of social information is described by a directed graph.
The decision-making process in this setting is intuitive, but can be complex.
We describe when and how the absence of a decision of a neighboring agent
communicates social information, and how an agent must marginalize over all
unobserved decisions. We also show how decision thresholds and network
connectivity affect group evidence accumulation, and describe the dynamics of
decision making in social cliques. Our model provides a bridge between the
abstractions used in the economics literature and the evidence accumulator
models used widely in neuroscience and psychology.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/39368</link>
	<content:encoded>The Large Cell (LC) motor neurons of the crab cardiac ganglion have variable membrane conductance magnitudes even within the same individual, yet produce identical synchronized activity in the intact network. In a previous study we blocked a subset of K&lt;sup&gt;+ &lt;/sup&gt;conductances across LCs, resulting in loss of synchronous activity (Lane et al., 2016). In this study, we hypothesized that this same variability of conductances makes LCs vulnerable to desynchronization during neuromodulation. We exposed the LCs to serotonin (5HT) and dopamine (DA) while recording simultaneously from multiple LCs. Both amines had distinct excitatory effects on LC output, but only 5HT caused desynchronized output. We further determined that DA rapidly increased gap junctional conductance. Co-application of both amines induced 5HT-like output, but waveforms remained synchronized. Furthermore, DA prevented desynchronization induced by the K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA), suggesting that dopaminergic modulation of electrical coupling plays a protective role in maintaining network synchrony.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Recurrent loss of HMGCS2 shows that ketogenesis is not essential for the evolution of large mammalian brains</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38906</link>
	<content:encoded>Apart from glucose, fatty acid-derived ketone bodies provide metabolic energy for the brain during fasting and neonatal development. We investigated the evolution of &lt;i&gt;HMGCS2&lt;/i&gt;, the key enzyme required for ketone body biosynthesis (ketogenesis). Unexpectedly, we found that three mammalian lineages, comprising cetaceans (dolphins and whales), elephants and mastodons, and Old World fruit bats have lost this gene. Remarkably, many of these species have exceptionally large brains and signs of intelligent behavior. While fruit bats are sensitive to starvation, cetaceans and elephants can still withstand periods of fasting. This suggests that alternative strategies to fuel large brains during fasting evolved repeatedly and reveals flexibility in mammalian energy metabolism. Furthermore, we show that &lt;i&gt;HMGCS2&lt;/i&gt; loss preceded brain size expansion in toothed whales and elephants. Thus, while ketogenesis was likely important for brain size expansion in modern humans, ketogenesis is not a universal precondition for the evolution of large mammalian brains.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38621</link>
	<content:encoded>CD95/Fas ligand binds to the death receptor CD95 to induce apoptosis in sensitive cells. We previously reported that CD95L mRNA is enriched in sequences that, when converted to si/shRNAs, kill all cancer cells by targeting critical survival genes (&lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml#bib27&quot;&gt;Putzbach et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;). We now report expression of full-length CD95L mRNA itself is highly toxic to cells and induces a similar form of cell death. We demonstrate that small (s)RNAs derived from CD95L are loaded into the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC) which is required for the toxicity and processing of CD95L mRNA into sRNAs is independent of both Dicer and Drosha. We provide evidence that in addition to the CD95L transgene a number of endogenous protein coding genes involved in regulating protein translation, particularly under low miRNA conditions, can be processed to sRNAs and loaded into the RISC suggesting a new level of cell fate regulation involving RNAi.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37868</link>
	<content:encoded>In cancer cells, loss of G1/S control is often accompanied by p53 pathway inactivation, the latter usually rationalized as a necessity for suppressing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. However, we found an unanticipated effect of p53 loss in mouse and human G1-checkpoint-deficient cells: reduction of DNA damage. We show that abrogation of the G1/S-checkpoint allowed cells to enter S-phase under growth-restricting conditions at the expense of severe replication stress manifesting as decelerated DNA replication, reduced origin firing and accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). In this system, loss of p53 allowed mitogen-independent proliferation, not by suppressing apoptosis, but rather by restoring origin firing and reducing DNA breakage. Loss of G1/S control also caused DNA damage and activation of p53 in an &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; retinoblastoma model. Moreover, in a teratoma model, loss of &lt;i&gt;Trp53&lt;/i&gt; reduced DNA breakage. Thus, loss of p53 may promote growth of incipient cancer cells by reducing replication-stress-induced DNA damage.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Mechanically-stimulated ATP release from murine bone cells is regulated by a balance of injury and repair</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37812</link>
	<content:encoded>Bone cells sense and actively adapt to physical perturbations to prevent critical damage. ATP release is among the earliest cellular responses to mechanical stimulation. Mechanical stimulation of a single murine osteoblast led to the release of 70 {plus minus} 24 amole ATP, which stimulated calcium responses in neighboring cells. Osteoblasts contained ATP-rich vesicles that were released upon mechanical stimulation. Surprisingly, interventions that promoted vesicular release reduced ATP release, while inhibitors of vesicular release potentiated ATP release. Searching for an alternative ATP release route, we found that mechanical stresses induced reversible cell membrane injury &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/PLC/PKC-dependent vesicular exocytosis facilitated membrane repair, thereby minimizing cell injury and reducing ATP release. Priming cellular repair machinery prior to mechanical stimulation reduced subsequent membrane injury and ATP release, linking cellular mechanosensitivity to prior mechanical exposure. Thus, our findings position ATP release as an integrated readout of membrane injury and repair.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37516</link>
	<content:encoded>In most well studied rod-shaped bacteria, peptidoglycan is primarily crosslinked by penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). However, in mycobacteria, crosslinks formed by L,D-transpeptidases (LDTs) are highly abundant. To elucidate the role of these unusual crosslinks, we characterized &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium smegmatis&lt;/i&gt; cells lacking all LDTs. We find that crosslinks generate by LDTs are required for rod shape maintenance specifically at sites of aging cell wall, a byproduct of polar elongation. Asymmetric polar growth leads to a non-uniform distribution of these two types of crosslinks in a single cell. Consequently, in the absence of LDT-mediated crosslinks, PBP-catalyzed crosslinks become more important. Because of this, &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; (Mtb) is more rapidly killed using a combination of drugs capable of PBP- and LDT- inhibition. Thus, knowledge about the spatial and genetic relationship between drug targets can be exploited to more effectively treat this pathogen.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Whereas the composition of the human gut microbiome is well resolved, predictive understanding is still lacking. Here, we followed a bottom-up strategy to explore human gut community dynamics: we established a synthetic community composed of three representative human gut isolates (&lt;i&gt;Roseburia intestinalis &lt;/i&gt;L1-82, &lt;i&gt;Faecalibacterium prausnitzii&lt;/i&gt; A2-165 and &lt;i&gt;Blautia hydrogenotrophica &lt;/i&gt;S5a33) and explored their interactions under well-controlled conditions &lt;i&gt;in vitro. &lt;/i&gt;Systematic mono- and pair-wise fermentation experiments confirmed competition for fructose and cross-feeding of formate. We quantified with a mechanistic model how well tri-culture dynamics was predicted from mono-culture data. With the model as reference, we demonstrated that strains grown in co-culture behaved differently than in mono-culture and confirmed their altered behavior at the transcriptional level. In addition, we showed with replicate tri-cultures and simulations that dominance in tri-culture sensitively depended on initial conditions. Our work has important implications for gut microbial community modeling as well as ecological interaction detection from batch cultures.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Fireflies and their luminous courtships have inspired centuries of scientific study. Today firefly luciferase is widely used in biotechnology, but the evolutionary origin of bioluminescence within beetles remains unclear. To shed light on this long-standing question, we sequenced the genomes of two firefly species that diverged over 100 million-years-ago: the North American &lt;i&gt;Photinus pyralis&lt;/i&gt; and Japanese &lt;i&gt;Aquatica lateralis.&lt;/i&gt; To compare bioluminescent origins, we also sequenced the genome of a related click beetle, the Caribbean &lt;i&gt;Ignelater luminosus&lt;/i&gt;, with bioluminescent biochemistry near-identical to fireflies, but anatomically unique light organs, suggesting the intriguing hypothesis of parallel gains of bioluminescence. Our analyses support independent gains of bioluminescence in fireflies and click beetles, and provide new insights into the genes, chemical defenses, and symbionts that evolved alongside their luminous lifestyle.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34870</link>
	<content:encoded>TET enzymes convert 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and higher oxidized derivatives. TETs stably associate with and are post-translationally modified by the nutrient-sensing enzyme OGT, suggesting a connection between metabolism and the epigenome. Here, we show for the first time that modification by OGT enhances TET1 activity &lt;i&gt;in vitro.&lt;/i&gt; We identify a TET1 domain that is necessary and sufficient for binding to OGT and report a point mutation that disrupts the TET1-OGT interaction. We show that this interaction is necessary for TET1 to rescue hematopoetic stem cell production in tet mutant zebrafish embryos, suggesting that OGT promotes TET1's function during development. Finally, we show that disrupting the TET1-OGT interaction in mouse embryonic stem cells changes the abundance of TET2 and 5-methylcytosine, which is accompanied by alterations in gene expression. These results link metabolism and epigenetic control, which may be relevant to the developmental and disease processes regulated by these two enzymes.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: GAL4 drivers specific for Type Ib and Type Is motor neurons in Drosophila</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/445577v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The Drosophila larval neuromuscular system is extensively used by researchers to study neuronal cell biology, and Drosophila glutamatergic motor neurons (MNs) have become a major model system. There are two main Types of glutamatergic MNs, Ib and Is, with different structural and physiological properties at synaptic level at the neuromuscular junction. To generate genetic tools to identify and manipulate MNs of each Type, we screened for GAL4 driver lines for this purpose. Here we describe GAL4 drivers specific for examples of neurons within each Type, Ib or Is. These drivers showed high expression levels and were expressed in only few MNs, making them amenable tools for specific studies of both axonal and synapse biology in identified Type I MNs.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Deliberation and enaction during adaptive economic choice</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/445346v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Economic decisions can adapt to contexts. Choices can be quick and impulsive or slow and more deliberative, depending on the temporal context. Choices can also depend on how we enact the choice, in an action context. Where we decide to go for dinner may change if we can take a taxi or need to walk. We hypothesized that frontal action circuits could contribute to adapting economic choices to context because of their privileged position over actions as endpoints of decisions. To test this, we performed an unbiased survey of neuronal population activity across motor, premotor and prefrontal cortices as animals expressed context-dependent economic preferences. Activity in distributed action circuits tracked the animals evolving preferences in real-time and integrated them with a signal for their enaction. We propose that frontal action circuits form a neural substrate that supports an adaptive control over economic choice by flexibly translating real-time preferences into actions.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/445312v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Type 1 Estrogen receptor-expressing neurons in the ventrolateral subdivision of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvlEsr1) play a causal role in the control of social behaviors including aggression. Here we use six different viral-genetic tracing methods to map the connectional architecture of VMHvlEsr1 neurons. These data reveal a high level of input convergence and output divergence ('fan-in/fan-out') from and to over 30 distinct brain regions, with a high degree (~90%) of recurrence. Unlike GABAergic populations in other hypothalamic nuclei controlling feeding and parenting behavior, VMHvlEsr1 glutamatergic neurons collateralize to multiple targets. However, we identify two anatomically distinct subpopulations with anterior vs. posterior biases in their collateralization patterns. Surprisingly, these two subpopulations receive indistinguishable inputs. These studies suggest an overall system architecture in which an anatomically feed-forward sensory-to-motor processing stream is integrated with a dense, highly recurrent central processing circuit. This architecture differs from the 'brain-inspired' feed-forward circuits used in certain types of artificial intelligence networks.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Reduced visual and frontal cortex activation during visual working memory in grapheme-colour synaesthetes relative to young and older adults.</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/444992v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The sensory recruitment model envisages visual working memory (VWM) as an emergent property that is encoded and maintained in sensory (visual) regions. The model implies that enhanced sensory-perceptual functions, as in synaesthesia, entail a dedicated VWM-system, showing reduced visual cortex activity as a result of neural specificity. By contrast, sensory-perceptual decline, as in old age, is expected to show enhanced visual cortex activity as a result of neural broadening. To test this model, young grapheme-colour synaesthetes, older adults and young controls engaged in a delayed pair-associative retrieval and a delayed matching-to-sample task, consisting of achromatic fractal stimuli that do not induce synaesthesia. While a previous analysis of this dataset (Pfeifer et al., 2016) has focused on cued retrieval and recognition of pair-associates (i.e. long-term memory), the current study focuses on visual working memory and considers, for the first time, the crucial delay period in which no visual stimuli are present, but working memory processes are engaged. Participants were trained to criterion and demonstrated comparable behavioural performance on VWM tasks. Whole-brain and region-of-interest-analyses revealed significantly lower activity in the synaesthetes middle frontal gyrus and visual regions (cuneus, inferior temporal cortex) respectively, suggesting greater neural efficiency relative to young and older adults in both tasks. The results support the sensory recruitment model and can explain age and individual WM-differences based on neural specificity in visual cortex.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The properties of different dopamine receptors constrain the function of dopamine signals in the striatum of the basal ganglia. Still, dopamine receptor kinetics are often neglected in considerations of the temporal dynamics of dopamine signalling. Here we develop a neurochemical model of dopamine receptor binding taking into account slow receptor kinetics. Contrary to current views, in our model D1 and D2 dopamine receptor populations react very similarly to dopamine signals independent of their timescale and integrate them over minutes. Furthermore, our model explains why ramping dopamine concentrations, observed experimentally, are an effective signal for increasing the occupancy of dopamine receptors.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Actomyosin-mediated nanostructural remodeling of the presynaptic vesicle pool by cannabinoids induces long-term depression</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/444950v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Endo- and exocannabinoids, such as the psychoactive component of marijuana, exert their effects on brain function by inducing several forms of synaptic plasticity through the modulation of presynaptic vesicle release. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the widely expressed endocannabinoid-mediated long-term depression (eCB-LTD), are poorly understood. Here, we reveal that eCB-LTD depends on the contractile properties of the pre-synaptic actomyosin cytoskeleton. Preventing this contractility, both directly by inhibiting non-muscle myosin II NMII ATPase and indirectly by inhibiting the upstream Rho-associated kinase ROCK, abolished long-term, but not short-term forms of cannabinoid-induced functional plasticity in both inhibitory hippocampal and excitatory cortico-striatal synapses. Furthermore, using 3D superresolution microscopy, we find an actomyosin contractility-dependent redistribution of synaptic vesicle pools within the presynaptic compartment following cannabinoid receptor activation, leading to vesicle clustering and depletion from the pre-synaptic active zone. These results suggest that cannabinoid-induced functional plasticity is mediated by a nanoscale structural reorganization of the presynaptic compartment produced by actomyosin contraction. By introducing the contractile NMII as an important actin binding/structuring protein in the dynamic regulation of synaptic function, our results open new perspectives in the understanding of mechanisms of synaptic and cognitive function, marijuana intoxication and psychiatric pathogenesis.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/444943v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Normalization is a fundamental operation throughout neuronal systems to adjust dynamic range. In the visual cortex various cell circuits have been identified that provide the substrate for such a canonical function, but how these circuits are orchestrated remains unclear. Here we suggest the serotonergic (5-HT) system as another player involved in normalization. 5-HT receptors of different classes are co-distributed across different cortical cell types, but their individual contribution to cortical population responses is unknown. We combined wide-field calcium imaging of primary visual cortex (V1) with optogenetic stimulation of 5-HT neurons in mice dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) -- the major hub for widespread release of serotonin across cortex -- in combination with selective 5-HT receptor blockers. While inhibitory (5-HT1A) receptors accounted for subtractive suppression of spontaneous activity, depolarizing (5-HT2A) receptors promoted divisive suppression of response gain. Added linearly, these components led to normalization of population responses over a range of visual contrasts.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Ivan Tomić, Paul M. Bays&lt;/p&gt;

The precision with which visual information can be recalled from working memory declines as the number of items in memory increases. This finding has been explained in terms of the distribution of a limited representational resource between items. Here we investigated how the sensory strength of memoranda affects resource allocation. We manipulated signal strength of an orientation stimulus in two ways: we varied the internal (sensory) noise by adjusting stimulus contrast, and varied the external (stimulus) noise by altering the within-stimulus variability. Both manipulations had similar effects on the precision with which the orientation could be recalled, but differed in their impact on memory for other stimuli. These results indicate that increasing internal noise released resources that could be used to store other stimuli more precisely; increasing external noise had no such effect. We show that these observations can be captured by a simple neural model of working memory encoding, in which spiking activity takes on the role of the limited resource.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/532tuGBOm9M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: As soon as you taste it - evidence for sequential and parallel processing of gustatory information</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0269-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The quick and reliable detection and identification of a tastant in the mouth regulate nutrient uptake and toxin expulsion. Consistent with the pivotal role of the gustatory system, taste category information (e.g. sweet, salty) is represented during the earliest phase of the taste-evoked cortical response (Crouzet et al., 2015) and different tastes are perceived and responded to within only a few hundred milliseconds, in rodents (Perez et al., 2013) and humans (Bujas, 1935). Currently, it is unknown whether taste detection and discrimination are sequential or parallel processes, i.e. whether you know what it is as soon as you taste it. To investigate the sequence of processing steps involved in taste perceptual decisions, participants tasted sour, salty, bitter, and sweet solutions and performed a taste-detection and a taste-discrimination task. We measured response times and 64-channel scalp electrophysiological recordings, and tested the link between the timing of behavioral decisions and the timing of neural taste representations determined with multivariate pattern analyses. Irrespective of taste and task, neural decoding onset and behavioral response times were strongly related, demonstrating that differences between taste judgments are reflected early during chemosensory encoding. Neural and behavioral detection times were faster for the iso-hedonic salty and sour tastes than their discrimination time. No such latency difference was observed for sweet and bitter, which differ hedonically. Together, these results indicate that the human gustatory system detects a taste faster than it discriminates between tastes, yet hedonic computations may run in parallel (Perez et al., 2013) and facilitate taste identification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Human response behavior reflects the culmination of multiple processing stages, so that the emergence of the commonly observed response delay between simple and more complex gustatory perceptual decisions remained unaddressed. For the first time, we show a strong correspondence between neural and behavioral task-dependent latency differences, providing evidence that this lag is represented during early chemosensory encoding, rather than resulting from higher-level cognitive processing. Moreover, we find that the processing sequence itself varies with taste contrast, likely dependent on hedonics. We suggest that taste hedonic features are processed in parallel to purely sensory computations with the potential to facilitate stimulus identification in the human gustatory sense, supporting the concept of a flexible sequence of gustatory coding states.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05558</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many probabilistic models of interest in scientific computing and machine
learning have expensive, black-box likelihoods that prevent the application of
standard techniques for Bayesian inference, such as MCMC, which would require
access to the gradient or a large number of likelihood evaluations. We
introduce here a novel sample-efficient inference framework, Variational
Bayesian Monte Carlo (VBMC). VBMC combines variational inference with
Gaussian-process based, active-sampling Bayesian quadrature, using the latter
to efficiently approximate the intractable integral in the variational
objective. Our method produces both a nonparametric approximation of the
posterior distribution and an approximate lower bound of the model evidence,
useful for model selection. We demonstrate VBMC both on several synthetic
likelihoods and on a neuronal model with data from real neurons. Across all
tested problems and dimensions (up to $D = 10$), VBMC performs consistently
well in reconstructing the posterior and the model evidence with a limited
budget of likelihood evaluations, unlike other methods that work only in very
low dimensions. Our framework shows great promise as a novel tool for posterior
and model inference with expensive, black-box likelihoods.

We reveal that weeks prior to complete axonal degeneration, the dismantling of axonal branches is accompanied by contemporaneous new axonal sprouting resulting in synapse formation onto nearby NMJs. Denervation events tend to propagate from the first lost NMJ, consistent with a contribution of neuromuscular factors extrinsic to motor neurons, with distal branches being more susceptible. These results show that NMJ denervation in ALS is a complex and dynamic process of continuous denervation and new innervation rather than a manifestation of sudden global motor neuron degeneration.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Can Hamilton's rule be violated?</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/41901</link>
	<content:encoded>How generally Hamilton's rule holds is a much debated question. The answer to that question depends on how costs and benefits are defined. When using the regression method to define costs and benefits, there is no scope for violations of Hamilton's rule. We introduce a general model for assortative group compositions to show that, when using the counterfactual method for computing costs and benefits, there is room for violations. The model also shows that there are limitations to observing violations in equilibrium, as the discrepancies between Hamilton's rule and the direction of selection may imply that selection will take the population out of the region of disagreement, precluding observations of violations in equilibrium. Given what it takes to create a violation, empirical tests of Hamilton's rule, both in and out of equilibrium, require the use of statistical models that allow for identifying non-linearities in the fitness function.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: RalB directly triggers invasion downstream Ras by mobilizing the Wave complex</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/40474</link>
	<content:encoded>The two Ral GTPases, RalA and RalB, have crucial roles downstream Ras oncoproteins in human cancers; in particular, RalB is involved in invasion and metastasis. However, therapies targeting Ral signalling are not available yet. By a novel optogenetic approach, we found that light-controlled activation of Ral at plasma-membrane promotes the recruitment of the Wave Regulatory Complex (WRC) via its effector exocyst, with consequent induction of protrusions and invasion. We show that active Ras signals to RalB via two RalGEFs (Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factors), RGL1 and RGL2, to foster invasiveness; RalB contribution appears to be more important than that of MAPK and PI3K pathways. Moreover, on the clinical side, we uncovered a potential role of RalB in human breast cancers by determining that RalB expression at protein level increases in a manner consistent with progression toward metastasis. This work highlights the Ras-RGL1/2-RalB-exocyst-WRC axis as appealing target for novel anti-cancer strategies.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/39887</link>
	<content:encoded>The intracellular parasite &lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma gondii,&lt;/i&gt; hijacks evolutionarily conserved host processes by delivering effector proteins into the host cell that shift gene expression in a timely fashion. We identified a parasite dense granule protein as GRA18 that once released in the host cell cytoplasm forms versatile complexes with regulatory elements of the β-catenin destruction complex. By interacting with GSK3/PP2A-B56, GRA18 drives β-catenin up-regulation and the downstream effects on host cell gene expression. In the context of macrophages infection, GRA18 induces the expression of a specific set of genes commonly associated with an anti-inflammatory response that includes those encoding chemokines CCL17 and CCL22. Overall, this study adds another original strategy by which &lt;i&gt;T. gondii&lt;/i&gt; tachyzoites reshuffle the host cell interactome through a GSK3/β-catenin axis to selectively reprogram immune gene expression.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Dynein-2 intermediate chains play crucial but distinct roles in primary cilia formation and function</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/39655</link>
	<content:encoded>The dynein-2 microtubule motor is the retrograde motor for intraflagellar transport. Mutations in dynein-2 components cause skeletal ciliopathies, notably Jeune syndrome. Dynein-2 contains a heterodimer of two non-identical intermediate chains, WDR34 and WDR60. Here, we use knockout cell lines to demonstrate that each intermediate chain has a distinct role in cilium function. Using quantitative proteomics, we show that WDR34 KO cells can assemble a dynein-2 motor complex that binds IFT proteins yet fails to extend an axoneme, indicating complex function is stalled. In contrast, WDR60 KO cells do extend axonemes but show reduced assembly of dynein-2 and binding to IFT proteins. Both proteins are required to maintain a functional transition zone and for efficient bidirectional intraflagellar transport. Our results indicate that the subunit asymmetry within the dynein-2 complex is matched with a functional asymmetry between the dynein-2 intermediate chains. Furthermore, this work reveals that loss of function of dynein-2 leads to defects in transition zone architecture, as well as intraflagellar transport.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The primary visual cortex of carnivores and primates is dominated by the OFF visual pathway and responds more strongly to dark than light stimuli. Here, we demonstrate that this cortical OFF dominance is modulated by the size and spatial frequency of the stimulus in awake primates and we uncover a main neuronal mechanism underlying this modulation. We show that large grating patterns with low spatial frequencies drive five times more OFF-dominated than ON-dominated neurons, but this pronounced cortical OFF dominance is strongly reduced when the grating size decreases and the spatial frequency increases, as when the stimulus moves away from the observer. We demonstrate that the reduction in cortical OFF dominance is not caused by a selective reduction of visual responses in OFF-dominated neurons but by a change in the ON/OFF response balance of neurons with diverse receptive field properties that can be ON or OFF dominated, simple, or complex. We conclude that cortical OFF dominance is continuously adjusted by a neuronal mechanism that modulates ON/OFF response balance in multiple cortical neurons when the spatial properties of the visual stimulus change with viewing distance and/or optical blur.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Behavioral states marked by varying levels of arousal and attention modulate some properties of cortical responses (e.g. average firing rates or pairwise correlations), yet it is not fully understood what drives these response changes and how they might affect downstream stimulus decoding. Here we show that changes in state modulate the tuning of response variance-to-mean ratios (Fano factors) in a fashion that is neither predicted by a Poisson spiking model nor changes in the mean firing rate, with a substantial effect on stimulus discriminability. We recorded motion-sensitive neurons in middle temporal cortex (MT) in two states: alert fixation and light, opioid anesthesia. Anesthesia tended to lower average spike counts, without decreasing trial-to-trial variability compared to the alert state. Under anesthesia, within-trial fluctuations in excitability were correlated over longer time scales compared to the alert state, creating supra-Poisson Fano factors. In contrast, alert-state MT neurons have higher mean firing rates and largely sub-Poisson variability that is stimulus-dependent and cannot be explained by firing rate differences alone. The absence of such stimulus-induced variability tuning in the anesthetized state suggests different sources of variability between states. A simple model explains state-dependent shifts in the distribution of observed Fano factors via a suppression in the variance of gain fluctuations in the alert state. A population model with stimulus-induced variability tuning and behaviorally constrained information-limiting correlations explores the potential enhancement in stimulus discriminability by the cortical population in the alert state.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/I5VLXmddQbU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Targeted activation of cholinergic interneurons accounts for the modulation of dopamine by striatal nicotinic receptors</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0397-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Striatal dopamine (DA) is a major player in action selection and reinforcement. DA release is under strong local control by striatal ACh acting at axonal nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs) on DA axons. Striatal nAChRs have been shown to control how DA is released in response to ascending activity from DA neurons, and they also directly drive DA release following synchronized activity in a small local cholinergic network. The source of striatal ACh has been thought to arise solely from intrinsic cholinergic interneurons (ChIs), but recent findings have identified a source of cholinergic inputs to striatum from brainstem nuclei, the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) and laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT). Here, we used targeted optogenetic activation alongside DA detection with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to test whether ChIs alone and/or brainstem afferents to the striatum can account for how ACh drives and modulates DA release in rat striatum. We demonstrate that targeted transient light activation of rat striatal ChIs drives striatal DA release, corroborating and extending previous observations in mouse to rat. However, the same light stimulation targeted to cholinergic brainstem afferents did not drive DA release, and nor did it modulate DA release activated subsequently by electrical stimulation, whereas targeted activation of ChIs did so. We were unable to obtain any evidence for DA modulation by PPN/LDT stimulation. By contrast, we could readily identify that striatal ChIs alone are sufficient to provide a source of ACh that powerfully regulates DA via nAChRs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Striatal acetylcholine (ACh) can powerfully regulate striatal dopamine (DA). Until recently, cholinergic interneurons were thought to be the only source of striatal ACh, but brainstem cholinergic neurons have now been revealed to innervate striatum. Here, we use targeted optogenetic activation in rats to explore which input accounts for the rapid regulation of striatal DA release. We find that targeted activation of striatal cholinergic interneurons in rat striatal slices can reproduce how striatal ACh drives and modulates dopamine release in mouse, but we could not find comparable evidence for a role for brainstem cholinergic inputs. Activation of cholinergic interneurons alone can reproduce the previously documented effects of activating all striatal ACh systems on DA release.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0326-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Background:&lt;/b&gt; Alterations in the corticostriatal system have been implicated in numerous substance use disorders, including alcohol use disorder (AUD). Adaptations in this neural system are associated with enhanced drug-seeking behaviors following exposure to cues predicting drug availability. Therefore, understanding how potential treatments alter neural activity in this system could lead to more refined and effective approaches for AUD. &lt;b&gt;Methods:&lt;/b&gt; Local field potentials (LFPs) were acquired simultaneously in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and nucleus accumbens (NA) of both alcohol preferring (P) and Wistar rats engaged in a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm wherein a light cue signaled the availability of ethanol. On test days, the COMT inhibitor tolcapone was administered prior to conditioning. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; Stimulus-evoked voltage changes were observed following the presentation of the ethanol cue in both strains, and were most pronounced in the PFC of P rats. Phase analyses of LFPs in the theta band (5-11 Hz) revealed that PFC-NA synchrony was reduced in P rats relative to Wistars, but was robustly increased during drinking. Presentation of the cue resulted in a larger phase reset in the PFC of P rats but not Wistars, an effect that was attenuated by tolcapone. Additionally, tolcapone reduced cued ethanol intake in P rat but not Wistars. &lt;b&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/b&gt; These results suggest a link between corticostriatal synchrony and genetic risk for excessive drinking. Moreover, inhibition of COMT within these systems may result in reduced attribution of salience to reward paired stimuli via modulation of stimulus-evoked changes to cortical oscillations in genetically susceptible populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Alcoholism is highly heritable and genetic vulnerability is associated with increased likelihood of alcohol-use related problems. Presentation of environmental stimuli paired with alcohol are capable of inducing craving and relapse in alcohol dependent individuals. The work described here using a rodent model of cued ethanol availability suggests that altered corticostriatal activity may be associated with genetic vulnerability to abuse alcohol. Additionally, our data suggest that inhibition of the COMT enzyme activity may reduce the influence that alcohol-conditioned stimuli elicit on behavior, resulting in a reduction of cued alcohol seeking in genetically susceptible individuals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05077</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Complex problem solving is a high level cognitive process which has been
thoroughly studied over the last decade. The Tower of London (TOL) is a task
that has been widely used to study problem-solving. In this study, we aim to
explore the underlying cognitive network dynamics among anatomical regions of
complex problem solving and its sub-phases, namely planning and execution. A
new brain network construction model establishing dynamic functional brain
networks using fMRI is proposed. The first step of the model is a preprocessing
pipeline that manages to decrease the spatial redundancy while increasing the
temporal resolution of the fMRI recordings. Then, dynamic brain networks are
estimated using artificial neural networks. The network properties of the
estimated brain networks are studied in order to identify regions of interest,
such as hubs and subgroups of densely connected brain regions. The major
similarities and dissimilarities of the network structure of planning and
execution phases are highlighted. Our findings show the hubs and clusters of
densely interconnected regions during both subtasks. It is observed that there
are more hubs during the planning phase compared to the execution phase, and
the clusters are more strongly connected during planning compared to execution.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Daniel Strömbom, Audrey Dussutour&lt;/p&gt;

Ants, termites and humans often form well-organized and highly efficient trails between different locations. Yet the microscopic traffic rules responsible for this organization and efficiency are not fully understood. In previous experimental studies with leaf-cutting ants (&lt;i&gt;Atta colombica&lt;/i&gt;), a set of local priority rules were isolated and it was proposed that these rules govern the temporal and spatial organization of the traffic on the trails. Here we introduce a model based on these priority rules to investigate whether they are sufficient to produce traffic similar to that observed in the experiments on both a narrow and a wider trail. We establish that the model is able to reproduce key characteristics of the traffic on the trails. In particular, we show that the proposed priority rules induce de-synchronization into clusters of inbound and outbound ants on a narrow trail, and that priority-type dependent segregated traffic emerges on a wider trail. Due to the generic nature of the proposed priority rules we speculate that they may be used to model traffic organization in a variety of other ant species.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mqMMX0_JVcg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Fly development amazes us by the precision and reproducibility of gene expression, especially since the initial expression patterns are established during very short nuclear cycles. Recent live imaging of &lt;i&gt;hunchback&lt;/i&gt; promoter dynamics shows a stable steep binary expression pattern established within the three minute interphase of nuclear cycle 11. Considering expression models of different complexity, we explore the trade-off between the ability of a regulatory system to produce a steep boundary and minimize expression variability between different nuclei. We show how a limited readout time imposed by short developmental cycles affects the gene’s ability to read positional information along the embryo’s anterior posterior axis and express reliably. Comparing our theoretical results to real-time monitoring of the &lt;i&gt;hunchback&lt;/i&gt; transcription dynamics in live flies, we discuss possible regulatory strategies, suggesting an important role for additional binding sites, gradients or non-equilibrium binding and modified transcription factor search strategies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NmHDABd2idw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

We present the results of a model inversion algorithm for electrocorticography (ECoG) data recorded during epileptic seizures. The states and parameters of neural mass models were tracked during a total of over 3000 seizures from twelve patients with focal epilepsy. These models provide an estimate of the effective connectivity within intracortical circuits over the time course of seizures. Observing the dynamics of effective connectivity provides insight into mechanisms of seizures. Estimation of patients seizure dynamics revealed: 1) a highly stereotyped pattern of evolution for each patient, 2) distinct sub-groups of onset mechanisms amongst patients, and 3) different offset mechanisms for long and short seizures. Stereotypical dynamics suggest that, once initiated, seizures follow a deterministic path through the parameter space of a neural model. Furthermore, distinct sub-populations of patients were identified based on characteristic motifs in the dynamics at seizure onset. There were also distinct patterns between long and short duration seizures that were related to seizure offset. Understanding how these different patterns of seizure evolution arise may provide new insights into brain function and guide treatment for epilepsy, since specific therapies may have preferential effects on the various parameters that could potentially be individualized. Methods that unite computational models with data provide a powerful means to generate testable hypotheses for further experimental research. This work provides a demonstration that the hidden connectivity parameters of a neural mass model can be dynamically inferred from data. Our results underscore the power of theoretical models to inform epilepsy management. It is our hope that this work guides further efforts to apply computational models to clinical data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FP4XLutG9Ic&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Ten quick tips for getting the most scientific value out of numerical data</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/OAsr7tu2D9w/article</link>

Most studies in the life sciences and other disciplines involve generating and analyzing numerical data of some type as the foundation for scientific findings. Working with numerical data involves multiple challenges. These include reproducible data acquisition, appropriate data storage, computationally correct data analysis, appropriate reporting and presentation of the results, and suitable data interpretation.
Finding and correcting mistakes when analyzing and interpreting data can be frustrating and time-consuming. Presenting or publishing incorrect results is embarrassing but not uncommon. Particular sources of errors are inappropriate use of statistical methods and incorrect interpretation of data by software. To detect mistakes as early as possible, one should frequently check intermediate and final results for plausibility. Clearly documenting how quantities and results were obtained facilitates correcting mistakes. Properly understanding data is indispensable for reaching well-founded conclusions from experimental results. Units are needed to make sense of numbers, and uncertainty should be estimated to know how meaningful results are. Descriptive statistics and significance testing are useful tools for interpreting numerical results if applied correctly. However, blindly trusting in computed numbers can also be misleading, so it is worth thinking about how data should be summarized quantitatively to properly answer the question at hand. Finally, a suitable form of presentation is needed so that the data can properly support the interpretation and findings. By additionally sharing the relevant data, others can access, understand, and ultimately make use of the results.
These quick tips are intended to provide guidelines for correctly interpreting, efficiently analyzing, and presenting numerical data in a useful way.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OAsr7tu2D9w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

In this article, we review recent advances in understanding the epigenetic and transcriptional mechanisms mediating sexual differentiation of the brain in mammals, flies, and worms. These studies suggest a model of sexual differentiation wherein master regulators of sex determination initiate a cascade of sexually dimorphic gene expression that controls development of neural pathways and behavioral displays in a strikingly modular manner. With these advances in molecular genetics, it is now feasible to disassemble different components of sexually dimorphic social behaviors without disrupting other behavioral interactions. Such experimental tractability promises rapid advances in this exciting field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Microglia enhance synapse activity to promote local network synchronization</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0088-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Microglia are highly motile immune-reactive cells that play integral roles in the response to brain infection and damage, and in the progression of various neurological diseases. During development, microglia also help sculpt neural circuits, via both promoting synapse formation and by targeting specific synapses for elimination and phagocytosis. Microglia are also active surveyors of neural circuits in the mature, healthy brain, although the functional consequences of such microglia-neuron contacts under these conditions is unclear. Using &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; imaging of neurons and microglia in awake mice, we report here the functional consequences of microglia-synapse contacts. Direct contact between a microglial process and a single synapse results in a specific increase in the activity of that contacted synapse, and a corresponding increase in back-propagating action potentials along the parent dendrite. This increase in activity is not seen for microglia-synapse contacts when microglia are activated by chronic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment. To probe how this microglia-synapse contact affects neural circuits, we imaged across larger populations of motor cortical neurons. When microglia were again activated by LPS (or partially ablated) there was a decrease in the extent to which neuronal activity was synchronized. Together our results demonstrate that interactions between physiological or resting microglia and synapses in the mature, healthy brain leads to an increase in neuronal activity and thereby helps to synchronize local populations of neurons. Our novel findings provide a plausible physical basis for understanding how alterations in immune status may impact on neural circuit plasticity and on cognitive behaviors such as learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Microglia, the sole immune cells in the central nervous system, make frequent contacts with synapses on dendritic spines, but the functional significance of these contact has remained elusive. In this study we use &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; two photon imaging and demonstrate that microglia contact on spines increases synaptic activity. This microglia-induced increase in synaptic activity enhances the synchronization of neuronal populations. This increase synchrony is inhibited by microglial activation, proving a possible mechanistic basis for how immune status may impact on neural circuit function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this work the stochastic generalization of single Hodgkin-Huxley neuron is
further extended to unidirectionally coupled neurons. Our main focus is to
elucidate the role of channel noise in the kinetics and energetics of spiking
of action potential and the synchronization between two coupled neurons. We
have found that the size of the patch is playing the pivotal role in
synchronization and metabolic energy consumption. For example, there exists
three different patch size ranges in which coupled neuron system behaves in a
different manner from noise enhanced phase to dead range state before reaching
the deterministic limit. We have also found that the sodium and potassium
channel blockers have characteristic kinetic and energetic effects on
synchronization process and metabolic energy consumption rate which has been
validated with the simulated data.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04191</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Designing artificial cyber-agents able to interact with human safely, smartly
and in a natural way is a current open problem in control. Solving such an
issue will allow the design of cyber-agents capable of co-operatively
interacting with people in order to fulfil common joint tasks in a multitude of
different applications. This is particularly relevant in the context of
healthcare applications. Indeed, the use has been proposed of artificial agents
interacting and coordinating their movements with those of a patient suffering
from social or motor disorders. Specifically, it has been shown that an
artificial agent exhibiting certain kinematic properties could provide
innovative and efficient rehabilitation strategies for these patients.
Moreover, it has also been shown that the level of motor coordination is
enhanced if these kinematic properties are similar to those of the individual
it is interacting with. In this paper we discuss, first, a new method based on
Markov Chains to confer &quot;human motor characteristics&quot; on a virtual agent, so as
that it can coordinate its motion with that of a target individual while
exhibiting specific kinematic properties. Then, we embed such synthetic model
in a control architecture based on reinforcement learning to synthesize a
cyber-agent able to mimic the behaviour of a specific human performing a joint
motor task with one or more individuals.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Pre-Synaptic Pool Modification (PSPM): A Supervised Learning Procedure for Spiking Neural Networks. (arXiv:1810.03199v2 [cs.NE] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03199</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A central question in neuroscience is how to develop realistic models that
predict output firing behavior based on provided external stimulus. Given a set
of external inputs and a set of output spike trains, the objective is to
discover a network structure which can accomplish the transformation as
accurately as possible. Due to the difficulty of this problem in its most
general form, approximations have been made in previous work. Past
approximations have sacrificed network size, recurrence, allowed spiked count,
or have imposed layered network structure. Here we present a learning rule
without these sacrifices, which produces a weight matrix of a leaky
integrate-and-fire (LIF) network to match the output activity of both
deterministic LIF networks as well as probabilistic integrate-and-fire (PIF)
networks. Inspired by synaptic scaling, our pre-synaptic pool modification
(PSPM) algorithm outputs deterministic, fully recurrent spiking neural networks
that can provide a novel generative model for given spike trains. Similarity in
output spike trains is evaluated with a variety of metrics including a
van-Rossum like measure and a numerical comparison of inter-spike interval
distributions. Application of our algorithm to randomly generated networks
improves similarity to the reference spike trains on both of these stated
measures. In addition, we generated LIF networks that operate near criticality
when trained on critical PIF outputs. Our results establish that learning rules
based on synaptic homeostasis can be used to represent input-output
relationships in fully recurrent spiking neural networks.

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Cajal-Retzius (CR) cells are one of the earliest populations of neurons in the cerebral cortex of rodents and primates, and they play a critical role in corticogenesis and cortical lamination during neocortical development. However, a comprehensive morphological and physiological profile of CR cells in the mouse neocortex has not yet been established. Here, we systematically investigated the dynamic development of CR cells in Tg(Ebf2-EGFP)58Gsat/Mmcd mice. The morphological complexity, membrane activities and presynaptic inputs of CR cells coordinately increase and reach a plateau at P5–P9 before regressing. Using 3D reconstruction, we delineated a parallel-stratification pattern of the axonal extension of CR cells. Furthermore, we found that the morphological structure and presynaptic inputs of CR cells were disturbed in Reelin-deficient mice. These findings confirm that CR cells undergo a transient maturation process in layer 1 before disappearing. Importantly, Reelin deficiency impairs the formation of synaptic connections onto CR cells. In conclusion, our results provide insights into the rapid maturation and axonal stratification of CR cells in layer 1. These findings suggest that both the electrophysiological activities and the morphology of CR cells provide vital guidance for the modulation of early circuits, in a Reelin-dependent manner.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Sequence Alterations of Cortical Genes Linked to Individual Connectivity of the Human Brain</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy262/5126790?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Individual differences in humans are driven by unique brain structural and functional profiles, presumably mediated in part through differential cortical gene expression. However, the relationships between cortical gene expression profiles and individual differences in large-scale neural network organization remain poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether the magnitude of sequence alterations in regional cortical genes mapped onto brain areas with high degree of functional connectivity variability across individuals. First, human genetic expression data from the Allen Brain Atlas was used to identify protein-coding genes associated with cortical areas, which delineated the regional genetic signature of specific cortical areas based on sequence alteration profiles. Thereafter, we identified brain regions that manifested high degrees of individual variability by using test-retest functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging and graph-theory analyses in healthy subjects. We found that rates of genetic &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;sequence alterations&lt;/span&gt; shared a distinct spatial topography with cortical regions exhibiting individualized (highly-variable) connectivity profiles. Interestingly, gene expression profiles of brain regions with highly individualized connectivity patterns and elevated number of sequence alterations are devoted to &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;neuropeptide-signaling-pathways&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;chemical-synaptic-transmission&lt;/span&gt;. Our findings support that genetic &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;sequence alterations&lt;/span&gt; may underlie important aspects of brain connectome individualities in humans.Significance Statement: The neurobiological underpinnings of our individuality as humans are still an unsolved question. Although the notion that genetic variation drives an individual’s brain organization has been previously postulated, specific links between neural connectivity and gene expression profiles have remained elusive. In this study, we identified the magnitude of population-based sequence alterations in discrete cortical regions and compared them to the brain topological distribution of functional connectivity variability across an independent human sample. We discovered that brain regions with high degree of connectional individuality are defined by increased rates of genetic sequence alterations; these findings specifically implicated genes involved in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;neuropeptide-signaling pathways&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;chemical-synaptic transmission&lt;/span&gt;. These observations support that genetic &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;sequence alterations&lt;/span&gt; may underlie important aspects of the emergence of the brain individuality across humans.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Sparse representation is considered an important coding strategy for cortical processing in various sensory modalities. It remains unclear how cortical sparseness arises and is being regulated. Here, unbiased recordings from primary auditory cortex of awake adult mice revealed salient sparseness in layer (L)2/3, with a majority of excitatory neurons exhibiting no increased spiking in response to each of sound types tested. Sparse representation was not observed in parvalbumin (PV) inhibitory neurons. The nonresponding neurons did receive auditory-evoked synaptic inputs, marked by weaker excitation and lower excitation/inhibition (E/I) ratios than responding cells. Sparse representation arises during development in an experience-dependent manner, accompanied by differential changes of excitatory input strength and a transition from unimodal to bimodal distribution of E/I ratios. Sparseness level could be reduced by suppressing PV or L1 inhibitory neurons. Thus, sparse representation may be dynamically regulated via modulating E/I balance, optimizing cortical representation of the external sensory world.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy258/5126794?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult mouse hippocampus occur in a specific neurogenic niche, where a multitude of extracellular signaling molecules converges to regulate NSC proliferation as well as fate and functional integration. However, the underlying mechanisms how NSCs react to extrinsic signals and convert them to intracellular responses still remains elusive. NSCs contain a functional endocannabinoid system, including the cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1). To decipher whether CB1 regulates adult neurogenesis directly or indirectly &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;in vivo&lt;/span&gt;, we performed NSC-specific conditional inactivation of CB1 by using triple-transgenic mice. Here, we show that lack of CB1 in NSCs is sufficient to decrease proliferation of the stem cell pool, which consequently leads to a reduction in the number of newborn neurons. Furthermore, neuronal differentiation was compromised at the level of dendritic maturation pointing towards a postsynaptic role of CB1 &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;in vivo&lt;/span&gt;. Deteriorated neurogenesis in NSC-specific CB1 knock-outs additionally resulted in reduced long-term potentiation in the hippocampal formation. The observed cellular and physiological alterations led to decreased short-term spatial memory and increased depression-like behavior. These results demonstrate that CB1 expressed in NSCs and their progeny controls neurogenesis in adult mice to regulate the NSC stem cell pool, dendritic morphology, activity-dependent plasticity, and behavior.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

The common marmoset is an ideal model as it has sophisticated social/emotional behavior, reaching adulthood within 2 years of birth. Magnetic resonance imaging was used in an accelerated longitudinal cohort (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 41; aged 3–27 months; scanned 2–7 times over 2 years). Splines were used to model nonlinear trajectories of grey matter volume development in 53 cortical areas and 16 subcortical nuclei. Generally, volumes increased before puberty, peaked, and declined into adulthood. We identified 3 milestones of grey matter development: I) age at peak volume; II) age at onset of volume decline; and III) age at maximum rate of volume decline. These milestones differentiated growth trajectories of primary sensory/motor cortical areas from those of association cortex but also revealed distinct trajectories between association cortices. Cluster analysis of trajectories showed that prefrontal cortex was the most heterogenous of association regions, comprising areas with distinct milestones and developmental trajectories. These results highlight the potential of high-field structural MRI to define the dynamics of primate brain development and importantly to identify when specific prefrontal circuits may be most vulnerable to environmental impact.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: CAPON Is a Critical Protein in Synaptic Molecular Networks in the Prefrontal Cortex of Mood Disorder Patients and Contributes to Depression-Like Behavior in a Mouse Model</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Aberrant regulation and activity of synaptic proteins may cause synaptic pathology in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of mood disorder patients. Carboxy-terminal PDZ ligand of NOS1 (CAPON) is a critical scaffold protein linked to synaptic proteins like nitric oxide synthase 1, synapsins. We hypothesized that CAPON is altered together with its interacting synaptic proteins in the PFC in mood disorder patients and may contribute to depression-like behaviors in mice subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). Here, we found that CAPON-immunoreactivity (ir) was significantly increased in the dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex in major depressive disorder (MDD), which was accompanied by an upregulation of spinophilin-ir and a downregulation of synapsin-ir. The increases in CAPON and spinophilin and the decrease in synapsin in the DLPFC of MDD patients were also seen in the PFC of CUMS mice. CAPON-ir positively correlated with spinophilin-ir (but not with synapsin-ir) in mood disorder patients. CAPON colocalized with spinophilin in the DLPFC of MDD patients and interacted with spinophilin in human brain. Viral-mediated CAPON downregulation in the medial PFC notably reversed the depression-like behaviors in the CUMS mice. These data suggest that CAPON may contribute to aspects of depressive behavior, possibly as an interacting protein for spinophilin in the PFC.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;SAD kinases regulate presynaptic vesicle clustering and neuronal polarization. A previous report demonstrated that &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Sada&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Sadb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; double-mutant mice showed perinatal lethality with a severe defect in axon/dendrite differentiation, but their single mutants did not. These results indicated that they were functionally redundant. Surprisingly, we show that on a C57BL/6N background, SAD-A is essential for cortical development whereas SAD-B is dispensable. &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Sada&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice died within a few days after birth. Their cortical lamination pattern was disorganized and radial migration of cortical neurons was perturbed. Birth date analyses with BrdU and in utero electroporation using pCAG-EGFP vector showed a delayed migration of cortical neurons to the pial surface in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Sada&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Time-lapse imaging of these mice confirmed slow migration velocity in the cortical plate. While the neurites of hippocampal neurons in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Sada&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice could ultimately differentiate in culture to form axons and dendrites, the average length of their axons was shorter than that of the wild type. Thus, analysis on a different genetic background than that used initially revealed a nonredundant role for SAD-A in neuronal migration and differentiation.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Pace of Neurogenesis Is Regulated by the Transient Retention of the Apical Endfeet of Differentiating Cells</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy252/5126791?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The development of the mammalian cerebral cortex involves a variety of temporally organized events such as successive waves of neuronal production and the transition of progenitor competence for each neuronal subtype generated. The number of neurons generated in a certain time period, that is, the rate of neuron production, varies across the regions of the brain and the specific developmental stage; however, the underlying mechanism of this process is poorly understood. We have recently found that nascent neurons communicate with undifferentiated progenitors and thereby regulate neurogenesis, through a transiently retained apical endfoot that signals via the Notch pathway. Here, we report that the retention time length of the neuronal apical endfoot correlates with the rate of neuronal production in the developing mouse cerebral cortex. We further demonstrate that a forced reduction or extension of the retention period through the disruption or stabilization of adherens junction, respectively, resulted in the acceleration or deceleration of neurogenesis, respectively. Our results suggest that the apical endfeet of differentiating cells serve as a pace controller for neurogenesis, thereby assuring the well-proportioned laminar organization of the neocortex.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Nonhuman primates, and great apes in particular, possess a variety of cognitive abilities thought to underlie human brain and cognitive evolution, most notably, the manufacture and use of tools. In a relatively large sample (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 226) of captive chimpanzees (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Pan troglodytes&lt;/span&gt;) for whom pedigrees are well known, the overarching aim of the current study was to investigate the source of heritable variation in brain structure underlying tool use skills. Specifically, using source-based morphometry (SBM), a multivariate analysis of naturally occurring patterns of covariation in gray matter across the brain, we investigated (1) the genetic contributions to variation in SBM components, (2) sex and age effects for each component, and (3) phenotypic and genetic associations between SBM components and tool use skill. Results revealed important sex- and age-related differences across largely heritable SBM components and associations between structural covariation and tool use skill. Further, shared genetic mechanisms appear to account for a heritable link between variation in both the capacity to use tools and variation in morphology of the superior limb of the superior temporal sulcus and adjacent parietal cortex. Findings represent the first evidence of heritability of structural covariation in gray matter among nonhuman primates.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Adult aging is associated with differences in structure, function, and connectivity of brain areas. Age-based brain comparisons have typically rested on the assumption that brain areas exhibit a similar spatial organization across age; we evaluate this hypothesis directly. Area parcellation methods that identify locations where resting-state functional correlations (RSFC) exhibit abrupt transitions (boundary-mapping) are used to define cortical areas in cohorts of individuals sampled across a large range of the human adult lifespan (20–93 years). Most of the strongest areal boundaries are spatially consistent across age. Differences in parcellation boundaries are largely explained by differences in cortical thickness and anatomical alignment in older relative to younger adults. Despite the parcellation similarities, age-specific parcellations exhibit better internal validity relative to a young-adult parcellation applied to older adults’ data, and age-specific parcels are better able to capture variability in task-evoked functional activity. Incorporating age-specific parcels as nodes in RSFC network analysis reveals that the spatial topography of the brain’s large-scale system organization is comparable throughout aging, but confirms that the segregation of systems declines with increasing age. These observations demonstrate that many features of areal organization are consistent across adulthood, and reveal sources of age-related brain variation that contribute to the differences.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

The morphogenesis of sex combs (SCs), a male trait in many species of fruit flies, is an excellent system in which to study the cell biology, genetics and evolution of a trait. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;, where the incipient SC rotates from horizontal to a vertical position, three signal comb properties have been documented: length, final angle and shape (linearity). During SC rotation, in which many cellular processes are occurring both spatially and temporally, it is difficult to distinguish which processes are crucial for which attributes of the comb. We have used a novel approach combining simulations and experiments to uncover the spatio-temporal dynamics underlying SC rotation. Our results indicate that 1) the final SC shape is primarily controlled by the inhomogeneity of initial cell size in cells close to the immature comb, 2) the final angle is primarily controlled by later cell expansion and 3) a temporal sequence of cell expansion mitigates the malformations generally associated with longer rotated SCs. Overall, our work has linked together the morphological diversity of SCs and the cellular dynamics behind such diversity, thus providing important insights on how evolution may affect SC development via the behaviours of surrounding epithelial cells.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EZcUqc7bSzc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Modeling effects of voltage dependent properties of the cardiac muscarinic receptor on human sinus node function</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/5GHzKb9ZyCk/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Robin Moss, Frank B. Sachse, Eloy G. Moreno-Galindo, Ricardo A. Navarro-Polanco, Martin Tristani-Firouzi, Gunnar Seemann&lt;/p&gt;

The cardiac muscarinic receptor (M2R) regulates heart rate, in part, by modulating the acetylcholine (ACh) activated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; current &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;K,ACh&lt;/sub&gt; through dissociation of G-proteins, that in turn activate K&lt;sub&gt;ACh&lt;/sub&gt; channels. Recently, M2Rs were noted to exhibit intrinsic voltage sensitivity, i.e. their affinity for ligands varies in a voltage dependent manner. The voltage sensitivity of M2R implies that the affinity for ACh (and thus the ACh effect) varies throughout the time course of a cardiac electrical cycle. The aim of this study was to investigate the contribution of M2R voltage sensitivity to the rate and shape of the human sinus node action potentials in physiological and pathophysiological conditions. We developed a Markovian model of the &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;K,ACh&lt;/sub&gt; modulation by voltage and integrated it into a computational model of human sinus node. We performed simulations with the integrated model varying ACh concentration and voltage sensitivity. Low ACh exerted a larger effect on &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;K,ACh&lt;/sub&gt; at hyperpolarized versus depolarized membrane voltages. This led to a slowing of the pacemaker rate due to an attenuated slope of phase 4 depolarization with only marginal effect on action potential duration and amplitude. We also simulated the theoretical effects of genetic variants that alter the voltage sensitivity of M2R. Modest negative shifts in voltage sensitivity, predicted to increase the affinity of the receptor for ACh, slowed the rate of phase 4 depolarization and slowed heart rate, while modest positive shifts increased heart rate. These simulations support our hypothesis that altered M2R voltage sensitivity contributes to disease and provide a novel mechanistic foundation to study clinical disorders such as atrial fibrillation and inappropriate sinus tachycardia.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5GHzKb9ZyCk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Modulation of Beta Bursts in the Subthalamic Nucleus Predicts Motor Performance</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/41/8905?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Considerable evidence suggests a role of beta-band oscillations in voluntary movements. However, most of the studies linking beta power to motor performance are based on data averaged across trials that ignore the fast dynamics of oscillatory activity and trial-to-trial variations in motor responses. Recently, emphasis has shifted from the functional implications of the mean beta power to the presence and nature of episodic bursts of beta activity. Here we test the hypothesis that beta bursts, though short in duration in more physiological state, may help explain spontaneous variations in motor behavior of human adults at the single-trial level. To this end, we recorded local field potential activity from the subthalamic nucleus of parkinsonian patients of both genders whose motor behavior had been normalized as far as possible through treatment with the dopamine prodrug, levodopa. We found that beta bursts present in a time-limited window well before movement onset in the contralateral subthalamic nucleus reduce the peak velocity of that movement and that this effect is further amplified by the amplitude of the burst. Additionally, prolonged reaction times are observed when bursts occur immediately after the GO cue. Together, these results suggest that the modulation of the timing and amplitude of beta bursts might serve to dynamically adapt motor performance. These results offer new insight in the pathology of Parkinson's disease, and suggest that beta bursts whose presence and nature are modulated by context may have a physiological role in modulating behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Beta oscillations (~13–30 Hz) have been increasingly interpreted as transient bursts rather than as rhythmically sustained oscillations (Feingold et al., 2015). Prolonged and increased probability of beta bursts in the subthalamic nucleus correlates with the severity of motor impairment in Parkinson's disease (Tinkhauser et al., 2017a, b). However, it remains unclear whether beta bursts act to modify motor performance on a trial-by-trial basis under more physiological condition. Here, we found that, according to the time window in which they fall, beta bursts reduced the velocity of the forthcoming movement or prolonged the reaction time. These results offer new insight in the pathology of Parkinson's disease and also suggest that the modulation of beta bursts might serve to dynamically adapt motor performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Obesity affects &amp;gt;600 million people worldwide, a staggering number that appears to be on the rise. One of the lesser known consequences of obesity is its deleterious effects on cognition, which have been well documented across many cognitive domains and age groups. To investigate the cellular mechanisms that underlie obesity-associated cognitive decline, we used diet-induced obesity in male mice and found memory impairments along with reductions in dendritic spines, sites of excitatory synapses, increases in the activation of microglia, the brain's resident immune cells, and increases in synaptic profiles within microglia, in the hippocampus, a brain region linked to cognition. We found that partial knockdown of the receptor for fractalkine, a chemokine that can serve as a &quot;find me&quot; cue for microglia, prevented microglial activation and cognitive decline induced by obesity. Furthermore, we found that pharmacological inhibition of microglial activation in obese mice was associated with prevention of both dendritic spine loss and cognitive degradation. Finally, we observed that pharmacological blockade of microglial phagocytosis lessened obesity-associated cognitive decline. These findings suggest that microglia play an active role in obesity-associated cognitive decline by phagocytosis of synapses that are important for optimal function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Obesity in humans correlates with reduced cognitive function. To investigate the cellular mechanisms underlying this, we used diet-induced obesity in mice and found impaired performance on cognitive tests of hippocampal function. These deficits were accompanied by reduced numbers of dendritic spines, increased microglial activation, and increased synaptic profiles within microglia. Inhibition of microglial activation by transgenic and pharmacological methods prevented cognitive decline and dendritic spine loss in obese mice. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of the phagocytic activity of microglia was also sufficient to prevent cognitive degradation. This work suggests that microglia may be responsible for obesity-associated cognitive decline and dendritic spine loss.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Differentiating between Models of Perceptual Decision Making Using Pupil Size Inferred Confidence</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/41/8874?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;During perceptual decisions, subjects often rely more strongly on early, rather than late, sensory evidence, even in tasks when both are equally informative about the correct decision. This early psychophysical weighting has been explained by an integration-to-bound decision process, in which the stimulus is ignored after the accumulated evidence reaches a certain bound, or confidence level. Here, we derive predictions about how the average temporal weighting of the evidence depends on a subject's decision confidence in this model. To test these predictions empirically, we devised a method to infer decision confidence from pupil size in 2 male monkeys performing a disparity discrimination task. Our animals' data confirmed the integration-to-bound predictions, with different internal decision bounds and different levels of correlation between pupil size and decision confidence accounting for differences between animals. However, the data were less compatible with two alternative accounts for early psychophysical weighting: attractor dynamics either within the decision area or due to feedback to sensory areas, or a feedforward account due to neuronal response adaptation. This approach also opens the door to using confidence more broadly when studying the neural basis of decision making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; An animal's ability to adjust decisions based on its level of confidence, sometimes referred to as &quot;metacognition,&quot; has generated substantial interest in neuroscience. Here, we show how measurements of pupil diameter in macaques can be used to infer their confidence. This technique opens the door to more neurophysiological studies of confidence because it eliminates the need for training on behavioral paradigms to evaluate confidence. We then use this technique to test predictions from competing explanations of why subjects in perceptual decision making often rely more strongly on early evidence: the way in which the strength of this effect should depend on a subject's decision confidence. We find that a bounded decision formation process best explains our empirical data.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Spectral Resolution Clustering for Brain Parcellation. (arXiv:1810.04026v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04026</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We take an image science perspective on the problem of determining brain
network connectivity given functional activity. But adapting the concept of
image resolution to this problem, we provide a new perspective on network
partitioning for individual brain parcellation. The typical goal here is to
determine densely-interconnected subnetworks within a larger network by
choosing the best edges to cut. We instead define these subnetworks as
resolution cells, where highly-correlated activity within the cells makes edge
weights difficult to determine from the data. Subdividing the resolution
estimates into disjoint resolution cells via clustering yields a new variation,
and new perspective, on spectral clustering. This provides insight and
strategies for open questions such as the selection of model order and the
optimal choice of preprocessing steps for functional imaging data. The approach
is demonstrated using functional imaging data, where we find the proposed
approach produces parcellations which are more predictive across multiple scans
versus conventional methods, as well as versus alternative forms of spectral
clustering.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03856</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;While objects from different categories can be reliably decoded from fMRI
brain response patterns, it has proved more difficult to distinguish visually
similar inputs, such as different instances of the same category. Here, we
apply a recently developed deep learning system to the reconstruction of face
images from human fMRI patterns. We trained a variational auto-encoder (VAE)
neural network using a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) unsupervised
training procedure over a large dataset of celebrity faces. The auto-encoder
latent space provides a meaningful, topologically organized 1024-dimensional
description of each image. We then presented several thousand face images to
human subjects, and learned a simple linear mapping between the multi-voxel
fMRI activation patterns and the 1024 latent dimensions. Finally, we applied
this mapping to novel test images, turning the obtained fMRI patterns into VAE
latent codes, and ultimately the codes into face reconstructions. Qualitative
and quantitative evaluation of the reconstructions revealed robust pairwise
decoding (&amp;gt;95% correct), and a strong improvement relative to a baseline model
(PCA decomposition). Furthermore, this brain decoding model can readily be
recycled to probe human face perception along many dimensions of interest; for
example, the technique allowed for accurate gender classification, and even to
decode which face was imagined, rather than seen by the subject.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03855</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The flow of information through the brain is reflected by the activity
patterns of neural cells. Indeed, these firing patterns are widely used as
input data to predictive models that relate stimuli and animal behavior to the
activity of a population of neurons. However, relatively little attention was
paid to single neuron spike trains as predictors of cell or network properties
in the brain. In this work, we introduce an approach to neuronal spike train
data mining which enables effective classification and clustering of neuron
types and network activity states based on single-cell spiking patterns. This
approach is centered around applying state-of-the-art time series
classification/clustering methods to sequences of interspike intervals recorded
from single neurons. We demonstrate good performance of these methods in tasks
involving classification of neuron type (e.g. excitatory vs. inhibitory cells)
and/or neural circuit activity state (e.g. awake vs. REM sleep vs. nonREM sleep
states) on an open-access cortical spiking activity dataset.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03661</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Temporal resolution of visual information processing is thought to be an
important factor in predator-prey interactions, shaped in the course of
evolution by animals' ecology. Here I show that light can be considered to have
a dual role of a source of information, which guides motor actions, and an
environmental feedback for those actions. I consequently show how temporal
perception might depend on behavioral adaptations realized by the nervous
system. I propose an underlying mechanism of synaptic clock, with every synapse
having its characteristic time unit, determined by the persistence of memory
traces of synaptic inputs, which is used by the synapse to tell time. The
present theory offers a testable framework, which may account for numerous
experimental findings, including the interspecies variation in temporal
resolution and the properties of subjective time perception, specifically the
variable speed of perceived time passage, depending on emotional and
attentional states or tasks performed.

However, recent developments have started to shed light on why the brain may rely on probabilistic synapses. Here, we start out by reviewing experimental evidence on the specificity and plasticity of synaptic response statistics. Next, we overview different computational perspectives on the function of plastic probabilistic synapses for constrained, statistical and deep learning. We highlight that all of these views require some form of optimisation of probabilistic synapses, which has recently gained support from theoretical analysis of long-term synaptic plasticity experiments. Finally, we contrast these different computational views and propose avenues for future research. Overall, we argue that the time is ripe for a better understanding of the computational functions of probabilistic synapses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Zic4-lineage cells increase their contribution to visual thalamic nuclei during murine embryogenesis if they are homozygous or heterozygous for loss of Pax6 function</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0367-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Our aim was to study the mechanisms that contribute to the development of discrete thalamic nuclei during mouse embryogenesis (both sexes included). We characterized the expression of the transcription factor coding gene &lt;i&gt;Zic4&lt;/i&gt; and the distribution of cells that expressed &lt;i&gt;Zic4&lt;/i&gt; in their lineage. We used genetic fate mapping to show that &lt;i&gt;Zic4&lt;/i&gt;-lineage cells mainly contribute to a subset of thalamic nuclei, in particular the lateral geniculate nuclei, which are crucial components of the visual pathway. We observed that almost all &lt;i&gt;Zic4&lt;/i&gt;-lineage diencephalic progenitors express the transcription factor Pax6 at variable location-dependent levels. We used conditional mutagenesis to delete either one or both copies of &lt;i&gt;Pax6&lt;/i&gt; from &lt;i&gt;Zic4&lt;/i&gt;-lineage cells. We found that &lt;i&gt;Zic4&lt;/i&gt;-lineage cells carrying either homozygous or heterozygous loss of &lt;i&gt;Pax6&lt;/i&gt; contributed in abnormally high numbers to one or both of the main lateral geniculate nuclei. This could not be attributed to a change in cell production and was likely due to altered sorting of thalamic cells. Our results indicate that positional information encoded by the levels of Pax6 in diencephalic progenitors is an important determinant of the eventual locations of their daughter cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The development of the thalamus is a process in which cells that initially appear similar give rise to distinct cell groups called nuclei. How these nuclei form is poorly understood. We utilised a mouse model in which cells that express the gene &lt;i&gt;Zic4&lt;/i&gt; can be followed. We studied the consequences of knocking out either one or both copies of the gene encoding the Pax6 transcription factor in these &lt;i&gt;Zic4&lt;/i&gt;-lineage cells. We found that these mutations had significant effects on the contribution of &lt;i&gt;Zic4&lt;/i&gt;-lineage cells to specifically visual thalamic nuclei. This was not attributable to a change in &lt;i&gt;Zic4&lt;/i&gt;-lineage cell production in mutants. Rather, we suggest that mutation of Pax6 affects the distribution of &lt;i&gt;Zic4&lt;/i&gt;-lineage neurons to specific thalamic nuclei.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Identifying the in Vivo Cellular Correlates of Antipsychotic Drugs</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0220-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;GPCRs such as 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; and D2 are implicated in the therapeutic and the side effects of antipsychotics. However, the pattern of brain activity that leads to the behavioural effects of antipsychotics is poorly understood. To address this question, we used the transgenic ‘FosTRAP’ mice (&lt;i&gt;Mus musculus&lt;/i&gt;), where a fluorescent reporter marks the cells responsive to the stimulus of interest. Here the stimulus was an administration of various antipsychotic drugs. In case of typical antipsychotics such as Haloperidol, the &lt;i&gt;c-fos&lt;/i&gt; active cells were predominantly found in the striatum whereas in case of the atypical antipsychotics (Clozapine and Olanzapine) &lt;i&gt;c-fos&lt;/i&gt; induced cells were more numerous in the cortical regions e.g., orbital cortex, piriform cortex. Curiously, we also observed ependymal cells to be a novel cellular target of atypical antipsychotics. 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; is considered to be a major target for atypical antipsychotics. Therefore, we bred ‘FosTRAP’ mice with 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; knockout mice and tested their response to the prototype of atypical antipsychotics- Clozapine. Interestingly, the absence of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; did not significantly affect the number of &lt;i&gt;c-fos&lt;/i&gt; induced cells in the cortical regions. However, the ependymal cells showed a dramatically reduced response to Clozapine in the absence of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;. In summary, the TRAP system has allowed us to identify various region-specific activity induced by antipsychotics and novel cellular targets of the antipsychotics. These results serve as a ‘proof of principle’ study that can be extended to explore the biochemical and physiological changes brought about by antipsychotics and specifically identify antipsychotic-responsive cells in the live tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Antipsychotic drugs have been the first choice of treatment for mental illnesses such as Schizophrenia. Thorough understanding of the cellular and neuronal targets of these drugs should deepen our understanding of the pathophysiology of the mental disorders and help the development of improved therapy. We report here the use of FosTrap mice that allowed us to label cells and brain areas that were responsive to the antipsychotic treatment. We identified brain regions such as orbital cortex, piriform cortex and ventral posteromedial thalamus as the targets of the atypical class of antipsychotics. Importantly, we also report for the first time that, ependymal cells, lining the ventricles, are targeted by the atypical antipsychotics and this effect is modulated by the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) based on visual evoked potentials (VEP)
allow for spelling from a keyboard of flashing characters. Among VEP BCIs,
code-modulated visual evoked potentials (c-VEPs) are designed for high-speed
communication . In c-VEPs, all characters flash simultaneously. In particular,
each character flashes according to a predefined 63-bit binary sequence
(m-sequence), circular-shifted by a different time lag. For a given character,
the m-sequence evokes a VEP in the electroencephalogram (EEG) of the subject,
which can be used as a template. This template is obtained during a calibration
phase at the beginning of each session. Then, the system outputs the desired
character after a predefined number of repetitions by estimating its time lag
with respect to the template. Our work avoids the calibration phase, by
extracting from the VEP relative lags between successive characters, and
predicting the full word using a dictionary.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03262</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal morphology is an essential element for brain activity and function.
We take advantage of current availability of brain-wide neuron digital
reconstructions of the Pyramidal cells from a mouse brain, and analyze several
emergent features of brain-wide neuronal morphology. We observe that axonal
trees are self-affine while dendritic trees are self-similar. We also show that
tree size appear to be random, independent of the number of dendrites within
single neurons. Moreover, we consider inhomogeneous branching model which
stochastically generates rooted 3-Cayley trees for the brain-wide neuron
topology. Based on estimated order-dependent branching probability from actual
axonal and dendritic trees, our inhomogeneous model quantitatively captures a
number of topological features including size and shape of both axons and
dendrites. This sheds lights on a universal mechanism behind the topological
formation of brain-wide axonal and dendritic trees.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Testing two potentially multivariate variables for statistical dependence on
the basis finite samples is a fundamental statistical challenge. Here we
explore a family of tests that adapt to the complexity of the relationship
between the variables, promising robust power across scenarios. Building on the
distance correlation, we introduce a family of adaptive independence criteria
based on nonlinear monotonic transformations of distances. We show that these
criteria, like the distance correlation and RKHS-based criteria, provide
dependence indicators. We propose a class of adaptive (multi-threshold) test
statistics, which form the basis for permutation tests. These tests empirically
outperform some of the established tests in average and worst-case statistical
sensitivity across a range of univariate and multivariate relationships and
might deserve further exploration.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Steady state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain computer interfaces
have shown its robustness in achieving high information transfer rate.
State-of-the-art training-based SSVEP decoding methods such as extended
Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and Task-Related Component Analysis (TRCA)
are the major players that elevate the efficiency of SSVEP-based BCI through
individualized calibration process. However, the calibration may be
time-consuming in order to collect sufficient training templates, deteriorating
the practicality in real-world context. This study aims to develop a
cross-subject transferring approach to reduce the need of training data from a
new user. The proposed least-squares transformation (LST) method was able to
significantly reduce the training templates required for TRCA-based SSVEP
detection on a 40-class SSVEP dataset from 8 subjects. This study shed light on
plug-and-play high speed SSVEP-based BCI for further practical applications.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: In-silico dynamic analysis of cytotoxic drug administration to solid tumours: Effect of binding affinity and vessel permeability</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/G8Cye4lL4dQ/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Vasileios Vavourakis, Triantafyllos Stylianopoulos, Peter A. Wijeratne&lt;/p&gt;

The delivery of blood-borne therapeutic agents to solid tumours depends on a broad range of biophysical factors. We present a novel multiscale, multiphysics, in-silico modelling framework that encompasses dynamic tumour growth, angiogenesis and drug delivery, and use this model to simulate the intravenous delivery of cytotoxic drugs. The model accounts for chemo-, hapto- and mechanotactic vessel sprouting, extracellular matrix remodelling, mechano-sensitive vascular remodelling and collapse, intra- and extravascular drug transport, and tumour regression as an effect of a cytotoxic cancer drug. The modelling framework is flexible, allowing the drug properties to be specified, which provides realistic predictions of in-vivo vascular development and structure at different tumour stages. The model also enables the effects of neoadjuvant vascular normalisation to be implicitly tested by decreasing vessel wall pore size. We use the model to test the interplay between time of treatment, drug affinity rate and the size of the vessels endothelium pores on the delivery and subsequent tumour regression and vessel remodelling. Model predictions confirm that small-molecule drug delivery is dominated by diffusive transport and further predict that the time of treatment is important for low affinity but not high affinity cytotoxic drugs, the size of the vessel wall pores plays an important role in the effect of low affinity but not high affinity drugs, that high affinity cytotoxic drugs remodel the tumour vasculature providing a large window for the normalisation of the vascular architecture, and that the combination of large pores and high affinity enhances cytotoxic drug delivery efficiency. These results have implications for treatment planning and methods to enhance drug delivery, and highlight the importance of in-silico modelling in investigating the optimisation of cancer therapy on a personalised setting.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/G8Cye4lL4dQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Interactive reservoir computing for chunking information streams</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/QfNrS1Ht3hA/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Toshitake Asabuki, Naoki Hiratani, Tomoki Fukai&lt;/p&gt;

Chunking is the process by which frequently repeated segments of temporal inputs are concatenated into single units that are easy to process. Such a process is fundamental to time-series analysis in biological and artificial information processing systems. The brain efficiently acquires chunks from various information streams in an unsupervised manner; however, the underlying mechanisms of this process remain elusive. A widely-adopted statistical method for chunking consists of predicting frequently repeated contiguous elements in an input sequence based on unequal transition probabilities over sequence elements. However, recent experimental findings suggest that the brain is unlikely to adopt this method, as human subjects can chunk sequences with uniform transition probabilities. In this study, we propose a novel conceptual framework to overcome this limitation. In this process, neural networks learn to predict dynamical response patterns to sequence input rather than to directly learn transition patterns. Using a mutually supervising pair of reservoir computing modules, we demonstrate how this mechanism works in chunking sequences of letters or visual images with variable regularity and complexity. In addition, we demonstrate that background noise plays a crucial role in correctly learning chunks in this model. In particular, the model can successfully chunk sequences that conventional statistical approaches fail to chunk due to uniform transition probabilities. In addition, the neural responses of the model exhibit an interesting similarity to those of the basal ganglia observed after motor habit formation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QfNrS1Ht3hA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Cortical D2 dopamine receptor (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Drd2&lt;/span&gt;) have mostly been examined in the context of cognitive function regulation and neurotransmission modulation of medial prefrontal cortex by principal neurons and parvalbumin positive, fast-spiking, interneurons in schizophrenia. Early studies suggested the presence of D2 receptors in several cortical areas, albeit with major technical limitations. We used combinations of transgenic reporter systems, recombinase activated viral vectors, quantitative translatome analysis, and high sensitivity in situ hybridization to identify D2 receptor expressing cells and establish a map of their respective projections. Our results identified previously uncharacterized clusters of D2 expressing neurons in limbic and sensory regions of the adult mouse brain cortex. Characterization of these clusters by translatome analysis and cell type specific labeling revealed highly heterogeneous expression of D2 receptors in principal neurons and various populations of interneurons across cortical areas. Transcript enrichment analysis also demonstrated variable levels of D2 receptor expression and several orphan G-protein-coupled receptors coexpression in different neuronal clusters, thus suggesting strategies for genetic and therapeutic targeting of D2 expressing neurons in specific cortical areas. These results pave the way for a thorough re-examination of cortical D2 receptor functions, which could provide information about neuronal circuits involved in psychotic and mood disorders.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Diadenosine-Polyphosphate Analogue AppCH2ppA Suppresses Seizures by Enhancing Adenosine Signaling in the Cortex</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy257/5122731?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Epilepsy is a multifactorial disorder associated with neuronal hyperexcitability that affects more than 1% of the human population. It has long been known that adenosine can reduce seizure generation in animal models of epilepsies. However, in addition to various side effects, the instability of adenosine has precluded its use as an anticonvulsant treatment. Here we report that a stable analogue of diadenosine-tetraphosphate: AppCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ppA effectively suppresses spontaneous epileptiform activity in vitro and in vivo in a Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) mouse model (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Tsc1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;+/−&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;), and in postsurgery cortical samples from TSC human patients. These effects are mediated by enhanced adenosine signaling in the cortex post local neuronal adenosine release. The released adenosine induces A1 receptor-dependent activation of potassium channels thereby reducing neuronal excitability, temporal summation, and hypersynchronicity. AppCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ppA does not cause any disturbances of the main vital autonomous functions of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Tsc1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;+/&lt;/span&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; mice in vivo. Therefore, we propose this compound to be a potent new candidate for adenosine-related treatment strategies to suppress intractable epilepsies.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Early Adolescence is a Critical Period for the Maturation of Inhibitory Behavior</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Psychiatric conditions marked by impairments in cognitive control often emerge during adolescence, when the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and its inputs undergo structural and functional maturation and are vulnerable to disruption by external events. It is not known, however, whether there exists a specific temporal window within the broad range of adolescence when the development of PFC circuitry and its related behaviors are sensitive to disruption. Here we show, in male mice, that repeated exposure to amphetamine during early adolescence leads to impaired behavioral inhibition, aberrant PFC dopamine connectivity, and reduced PFC dopamine function in adulthood. Remarkably, these deficits are not observed following exposure to the exact same amphetamine regimen at later times. These findings demonstrate that there is a critical period for the disruption of the adolescent maturation of cognitive control and PFC dopamine function and suggest that early adolescence is particularly relevant to the emergence of psychopathology in humans.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Saccadic Adaptation Boosts Ongoing Gamma Activity in a Subsequent Visuoattentional Task</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Attention and saccadic adaptation (SA) are critical components of visual perception, the former enhancing sensory processing of selected objects, the latter maintaining the eye movements accuracy toward them. Recent studies propelled the hypothesis of a tight functional coupling between these mechanisms, possibly due to shared neural substrates. Here, we used magnetoencephalography to investigate for the first time the neurophysiological bases of this coupling and of SA per se. We compared visual discrimination performance of 12 healthy subjects before and after SA. Eye movements and magnetic signals were recorded continuously. Analyses focused on gamma band activity (GBA) during the pretarget period of the discrimination and the saccadic tasks. We found that GBA increases after SA. This increase was found in the right hemisphere for both postadaptation saccadic and discrimination tasks. For the latter, GBA also increased in the left hemisphere. We conclude that oculomotor plasticity involves GBA modulation within an extended neural network which persists after SA, suggesting a possible role of gamma oscillations in the coupling between SA and attention.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Representing Multiple Observed Actions in the Motor System</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy237/5122730?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;There is now converging evidence that others’ actions are represented in the motor system. However, social cognition requires us to represent not only the actions but also the interactions of others. To do so, it is imperative that the motor system can represent multiple observed actions. The current fMRI study investigated whether this is possible by measuring brain activity from 29 participants while they observed 2 right hands performing sign language gestures. Three key results were obtained. First, brain activity in the premotor and parietal motor cortex was stronger when 2 hands performed 2 different gestures than when 1 hand performed a single gesture. Second, both individual observed gestures could be decoded from brain activity in the same 2 regions. Third, observing 2 different gestures compared with 2 identical gestures activated brain areas related to motor conflict, and this activity was correlated with parietal motor activity. Together, these results show that the motor system is able to represent multiple observed actions, and as such reveal a potential mechanism by which third-party social encounters could be processed in the brain.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Recent advances in epigenomics have made it possible to map genome-wide regulatory regions using empirical methods. Subsequent comparative epigenomic studies have revealed that regulatory regions diverge rapidly between genome of different species, and that the divergence is more pronounced in enhancers than in promoters. To understand genomic changes underlying these patterns, we investigated if we can identify specific sequence fragments that are over-enriched in regulatory regions, thus potentially contributing to regulatory functions of such regions. Here we report numerous sequence fragments that are statistically over-enriched in enhancers and promoters of different mammals (which we refer to as ‘sequence determinants’). Interestingly, the degree of statistical enrichment, which presumably is associated with the degree of regulatory impacts of the specific sequence determinant, was significantly higher for promoter sequence determinants than enhancer sequence determinants. We further used a machine learning method to construct prediction models using sequence determinants. Remarkably, prediction models constructed from one species could be used to predict regulatory regions of other species with high accuracy. This observation indicates that even though the precise locations of regulatory regions diverge rapidly during evolution, the functional potential of sequence determinants underlying regulatory sequences may be conserved between species.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Q4TbfATi4e4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Noise propagation in an integrated model of bacterial gene expression and growth</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/BQy09pr4TN8/article</link>

In bacterial cells, gene expression, metabolism, and growth are highly interdependent and tightly coordinated. As a result, stochastic fluctuations in expression levels and instantaneous growth rate show intricate cross-correlations. These correlations are shaped by feedback loops, trade-offs and constraints acting at the cellular level; therefore a quantitative understanding requires an integrated approach. To that end, we here present a mathematical model describing a cell that contains multiple proteins that are each expressed stochastically and jointly limit the growth rate. Conversely, metabolism and growth affect protein synthesis and dilution. Thus, expression noise originating in one gene propagates to metabolism, growth, and the expression of all other genes. Nevertheless, under a small-noise approximation many statistical quantities can be calculated analytically. We identify several routes of noise propagation, illustrate their origins and scaling, and establish important connections between noise propagation and the field of metabolic control analysis. We then present a many-protein model containing &amp;gt;1000 proteins parameterized by previously measured abundance data and demonstrate that the predicted cross-correlations between gene expression and growth rate are in broad agreement with published measurements.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/BQy09pr4TN8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Cocaine Exposure Modulates Perineuronal Nets and Synaptic Excitability of Fast-Spiking Interneurons in the Medial Prefrontal Cortex</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/5/ENEURO.0221-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;We previously reported that perineuronal nets (PNNs) are required for cocaine-associated memories. Perineuronal nets are extracellular matrix that primarily surrounds parvalbumin (PV)-containing, GABAergic fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Here we measured the impact of acute (1 d) or repeated (5 d) cocaine exposure on PNNs and PV cells within the prelimbic and infralimbic regions of the mPFC. Adult rats were exposed to 1 or 5 d of cocaine and stained for PNNs (using &lt;i&gt;Wisteria floribunda&lt;/i&gt; agglutinin) and PV intensity 2 or 24 h later. In the prelimbic and infralimbic PFC, PNN staining intensity decreased 2 h after 1 d of cocaine exposure but increased after 5 d of cocaine exposure. Cocaine also produced changes in PV intensity, which generally lagged behind that of PNNs. In the prelimbic PFC, both 1 and 5 d of cocaine exposure increased GAD65/67 puncta near PNN-surrounded PV cells, with an increase in the GAD65/67-to-VGluT1 puncta ratio after 5 d of cocaine exposure. In the prelimbic PFC, slice electrophysiology studies in FSIs surrounded by PNNs revealed that both 1 and 5 d of cocaine exposure reduced the number of action potentials 2 h later. Synaptic changes demonstrated that 5 d of cocaine exposure increased the inhibition of FSIs, potentially reducing the inhibition of pyramidal neurons and contributing to their hyperexcitability during relapse behavior. These early and rapid responses to cocaine may alter the network stability of PV FSIs that partially mediate the persistent and chronic nature of drug addiction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(18)30246-7?rss=yes</link>
	<content:encoded>Speech has long been recognized as ‘special’. Here, we suggest that one of the reasons for speech being special is that our auditory system has evolved to encode it in an efficient, optimal way. The theory of efficient neural coding argues that our perceptual systems have evolved to encode environmental stimuli in the most efficient way. Mathematically, this can be achieved if the optimally efficient codes match the statistics of the signals they represent. Experimental evidence suggests that the auditory code is optimal in this mathematical sense: statistical properties of speech closely match response properties of the cochlea, the auditory nerve, and the auditory cortex.</content:encoded>

Many pathological conditions, such as seizures, stroke, and spreading depression, are associated with substantial changes in ion concentrations in the extracellular space (ECS) of the brain. An understanding of the mechanisms that govern ECS concentration dynamics may be a prerequisite for understanding such pathologies. To estimate the transport of ions due to electrodiffusive effects, one must keep track of both the ion concentrations and the electric potential simultaneously in the relevant regions of the brain. Although this is currently unfeasible experimentally, it is in principle achievable with computational models based on biophysical principles and constraints. Previous computational models of extracellular ion-concentration dynamics have required extensive computing power, and therefore have been limited to either phenomena on very small spatiotemporal scales (micrometers and milliseconds), or simplified and idealized 1-dimensional (1-D) transport processes on a larger scale. Here, we present the 3-D Kirchhoff-Nernst-Planck (KNP) framework, tailored to explore electrodiffusive effects on large spatiotemporal scales. By assuming electroneutrality, the KNP-framework circumvents charge-relaxation processes on the spatiotemporal scales of nanometers and nanoseconds, and makes it feasible to run simulations on the spatiotemporal scales of millimeters and seconds on a standard desktop computer. In the present work, we use the 3-D KNP framework to simulate the dynamics of ion concentrations and the electrical potential surrounding a morphologically detailed pyramidal cell. In addition to elucidating the single neuron contribution to electrodiffusive effects in the ECS, the simulation demonstrates the efficiency of the 3-D KNP framework. We envision that future applications of the framework to more complex and biologically realistic systems will be useful in exploring pathological conditions associated with large concentration variations in the ECS.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/m141eIlY3sI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Prediction of gene regulatory enhancers across species reveals evolutionarily conserved sequence properties</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/b9OpfD0Vd78/article</link>

Genomic regions with gene regulatory enhancer activity turnover rapidly across mammals. In contrast, gene expression patterns and transcription factor binding preferences are largely conserved between mammalian species. Based on this conservation, we hypothesized that enhancers active in different mammals would exhibit conserved sequence patterns in spite of their different genomic locations. To investigate this hypothesis, we evaluated the extent to which sequence patterns that are predictive of enhancers in one species are predictive of enhancers in other mammalian species by training and testing two types of machine learning models. We trained support vector machine (SVM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers to distinguish enhancers defined by histone marks from the genomic background based on DNA sequence patterns in human, macaque, mouse, dog, cow, and opossum. The classifiers accurately identified many adult liver, developing limb, and developing brain enhancers, and the CNNs outperformed the SVMs. Furthermore, classifiers trained in one species and tested in another performed nearly as well as classifiers trained and tested on the same species. We observed similar cross-species conservation when applying the models to human and mouse enhancers validated in transgenic assays. This indicates that many short sequence patterns predictive of enhancers are largely conserved. The sequence patterns most predictive of enhancers in each species matched the binding motifs for a common set of TFs enriched for expression in relevant tissues, supporting the biological relevance of the learned features. Thus, despite the rapid change of active enhancer locations between mammals, cross-species enhancer prediction is often possible. Our results suggest that short sequence patterns encoding enhancer activity have been maintained across more than 180 million years of mammalian evolution.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/b9OpfD0Vd78&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Role of the K+-Cl- co-transporter KCC2a isoform in mammalian respiration at birth</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0264-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;In central respiratory circuitry, synaptic excitation is responsible for synchronizing neuronal activity in the different respiratory rhythm phases, whereas chloride-mediated inhibition is important for shaping the respiratory pattern itself. The potassium chloride co-transporter KCC2, which serves to maintain low intraneuronal Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; concentration and thus render chloride-mediated synaptic signaling inhibitory, exists in two isoforms, KCC2a and KCC2b. KCC2 is essential for functional breathing motor control at birth, but the specific contribution of the KCC2a isoform remains unknown. Here, to address this issue we investigated the respiratory phenotype of mice deficient for KCC2a. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; plethysmographic recordings revealed that KCC2a-deficient pups at P0 transiently express an abnormally low breathing rate and a high occurrence of apneas. Immunostainings confirmed that KCC2a is normally expressed in the brainstem neuronal groups involved in breathing (preBötzinger complex, parafacial respiratory group, hypoglossus nucleus), and is absent in these regions in the KCC2a&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mutant. However, in variously reduced &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; medullary preparations, spontaneous rhythmic respiratory activity is similar to that expressed in wild-type preparations, as is hypoglossal motor output, and no respiratory pauses are detected, suggesting that the rhythm-generating networks are not intrinsically affected in mutants at P0. In contrast, inhibitory neuromodulatory influences exerted by the pons on respiratory rhythmogenesis are stronger in the mutant, thereby explaining the breathing anomalies observed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Thus, our results indicate that the KCC2a isoform is important for establishing proper breathing behavior at the time of birth, but by acting at site(s) that are extrinsic to the central respiratory networks themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; The expression of the neuronal specific potassium chloride co-transporter KCC2 is necessary for the generation of respiratory activity at birth, but the specific role of the KCC2a isoform in this process remains unknown. By examining &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; the breathing motor output of newborn KCC2a&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice we observed a lower breathing frequency and a high occurrence of apneas at birth. These anomalies, expressed mainly at P0 (day of birth), do not arise from changes in the brainstem respiratory rhythm-generating circuits, but appear to result from abnormally strong inhibitory pontine neuromodulatory influences that target these networks. Our results provide evidence for a transient but important role of the KCC2a isoform in the proper development of the central respiratory command.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0190-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Rodents actively whisk their vibrissae, which, when they come in contact with surrounding objects, enables rodents to gather spatial information about the environment. Cortical motor command of whisking is crucial for the control of vibrissa movement. Using awake and head-fixed rats, we investigated the correlations between axonal projection patterns and firing properties in identified layer 5 neurons in the motor cortex, which are associated with vibrissa movement. We found that cortical neurons that sent axons to the brainstem fired preferentially during large-amplitude vibrissae movements and that corticocallosal neurons exhibited a high firing rate during small vibrissa movements or during a quiet state. The differences between these two corticofugal circuits may be related to the mechanisms of motor-associated information processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The contents of cortical motor commands and the pathways that they take are two important questions in neuroscience. Previous studies in rodents reported that motor cortex neurons exhibit variable activity patterns during whisking behavior. We combined physiological and morphological analyses of single neurons to provide more detail for understanding the neural circuit related to motor control.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>A major aspect of the regulatory function of mast cells appears to be their role as intermediaries between the nervous and immune systems. Mast cells are activated by neurotransmitters allowing neural control of innate and adaptive immunity. Conversely, mast cells secrete mediators including neurotransmitters and neurotrophic factors that directly influence nerves, causing acute activation and/or long-lasting changes in excitability and phenotype. While some basic mechanisms underlying mast cell–nerve communication are well-established, the full extent to which this relationship influences health and disease is unclear.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: February 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 54&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Mary H Patton, Jay A Blundon, Stanislav S Zakharenko&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cortical circuits are particularly sensitive to incoming sensory information during well-defined intervals of postnatal development called ‘critical periods’. The critical period for cortical plasticity closes in adults, thus restricting the brain’s ability to indiscriminately store new sensory information. For example, children acquire language in an exposure-based manner, whereas learning language in adulthood requires more effort and attention. It has been suggested that pairing sounds with the activation of neuromodulatory circuits involved in attention reopens this critical period. Here, we review two critical period hypotheses related to neuromodulation: cortical disinhibition and thalamic adenosine. We posit that these mechanisms co-regulate the critical period for auditory cortical plasticity. We also discuss ways to reopen this period and rejuvenate cortical plasticity in adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Inhibition of TrkB- and TrkC-Signaling Pathways Affects Neurogenesis in the Opossum Developing Neocortex</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy246/5112945?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;We have previously reported that the blockage of TrkB and TrkC signaling in primary culture of opossum neocortical cells affects neurogenesis that involves a range of processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Here, we studied whether TrkB and TrkC activity specifically affects various types of progenitor cell populations during neocortex formation in the Monodelphis opossum in vivo. We found that the inhibition of TrkB and TrkC activities affects the same proliferative cellular phenotype, but TrkC causes more pronounced changes in the rate of cell divisions. Additionally, inhibition of TrkB and TrkC does not affect apoptosis in vivo, which was found in cell culture experiments. The lack of TrkB and TrkC receptor activity caused the arrest of newly generated neurons; therefore, they could not penetrate the subplate zone. We suggest that at this time point in development, migration consists of 2 steps. During the initial step, neurons migrate and reach the base of the subplate, whereas during the next step the migration of neurons to their final position is regulated by TrkB or TrkC signaling.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Hippocampal Shape Maturation in Childhood and Adolescence</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy244/5112943?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The hippocampus is a subcortical structure critical for learning and memory, and a thorough understanding of its neurodevelopment is important for studying these processes in health and disease. However, few studies have quantified the typical developmental trajectory of the structure in childhood and adolescence. This study examined the cross-sectional age-related changes and sex differences in hippocampal shape in a multisite, multistudy cohort of 1676 typically developing children (age 1–22 years) using a novel intrinsic brain mapping method based on Laplace–Beltrami embedding of surfaces. Significant age-related expansion was observed bilaterally and nonlinear growth was observed primarily in the right head and tail of the hippocampus. Sex differences were also observed bilaterally along the lateral and medial aspects of the surface, with females exhibiting relatively larger surface expansion than males. Additionally, the superior posterior lateral surface of the left hippocampus exhibited an age–sex interaction with females expanding faster than males. Shape analysis provides enhanced sensitivity to regional changes in hippocampal morphology over traditional volumetric approaches and allows for the localization of developmental effects. Our results further support evidence that hippocampal structures follow distinct maturational trajectories that may coincide with the development of learning and memory skills during critical periods of development.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Hierarchical Brain Network for Face and Voice Integration of Emotion Expression</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy240/5112944?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The brain has separate specialized computational units to process faces and voices located in occipital and temporal cortices. However, humans seamlessly integrate signals from the faces and voices of others for optimal social interaction. How are emotional expressions, when delivered by different sensory modalities (faces and voices), integrated in the brain? In this study, we characterized the brains’ response to faces, voices, and combined face–voice information (congruent, incongruent), which varied in expression (neutral, fearful). Using a whole-brain approach, we found that only the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (rpSTS) responded more to bimodal stimuli than to face or voice alone but only when the stimuli contained emotional expression. Face- and voice-selective regions of interest, extracted from independent functional localizers, similarly revealed multisensory integration in the face-selective rpSTS only; further, this was the only face-selective region that also responded significantly to voices. Dynamic causal modeling revealed that the rpSTS receives unidirectional information from the face-selective fusiform face area, and voice-selective temporal voice area, with emotional expression affecting the connection strength. Our study promotes a hierarchical model of face and voice integration, with convergence in the rpSTS, and that such integration depends on the (emotional) salience of the stimuli.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Neuroanatomy of Autism Spectrum Disorder Symptomatology in 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy239/5112941?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11.2DS) is a genetic condition associated with a high prevalence of neuropsychiatric conditions that include autism spectrum disorder (ASD). While evidence suggests that clinical phenotypes represent distinct neurodevelopmental outcomes, it remains unknown whether this translates to the level of neurobiology. To fractionate the 22q11.2DS phenotype on the level of neuroanatomy, we examined differences in vertex-wise estimates of cortical volume, surface area, and cortical thickness between 1) individuals with 22q11.2DS (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 62) and neurotypical controls (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 57) and 2) 22q11.2DS individuals with ASD symptomatology (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 30) and those without (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 25). We firstly observed significant differences in surface anatomy between 22q11.2DS individuals and controls for all 3 neuroanatomical features, predominantly in parietotemporal regions, cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. We also established that 22q11.2DS individuals with ASD symptomatology were neuroanatomically distinct from 22q11.2DS individuals without ASD symptoms, particularly in brain regions that have previously been linked to ASD (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortices and the entorhinal cortex). Our findings indicate that different clinical 22q11.2DS phenotypes, including those with ASD symptomatology, may represent different neurobiological subgroups. The spatially distributed patterns of neuroanatomical differences associated with ASD symptomatology in 22q11.2DS may thus provide useful information for patient stratification and the prediction of clinical outcomes.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Recent advances in Ca2+ imaging have given neuroscientists a tool to follow the activity of large numbers of individual neurons simultaneously in vivo in the brains of animals as they are presented with sensory stimulation, respond to environmental challenges, and engage in behaviors. The Ca2+ sensors used to transduce changes in cellular Ca2+ into changes in fluorescence must bind Ca2+ to produce a signal. By binding Ca2+, these sensors can act as buffers, often reducing the magnitude of a Ca2+ change severalfold, and producing a proportional slowing of the rates of change.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The auditory modality is fundamentally a temporal sense that requires analysis of changes in sound signals on timescales ranging from microseconds to minutes. To generate a faithful representation of changes in sound intensity and frequency over time, sound offsets (disappearances) as well as sound onsets (appearances) must be encoded by the auditory system. We review here the computational significance, perceptual roles, anatomical locations, and cellular and network origins of sound-offset responses in the mammalian auditory brain.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Sensorimotor predictions are essential for adaptive behavior. In natural environments, events that demand sensorimotor predictions unfold across many timescales, and corresponding temporal predictions (either explicit or implicit) should therefore emerge in brain dynamics. Neuronal oscillations are scale-specific processes found in several frequency bands. They underlie periodicity in sensorimotor processing and can represent temporal predictions via their phase dynamics. These processes build upon endogenous neural rhythmicity and adapt in response to exogenous timing demands.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The rate of affective disorder is substantially higher in women than in men, and considerable evidence points to the actions of ovarian hormones in mediating this disparity. In this Opinion, we discuss the hypothesis that cyclic changes in ovarian hormone levels produce cyclic alterations in connectivity between the intrinsic networks of the brain. These alterations produce specific temporal windows within the menstrual cycle when internetwork connectivity is increased, associated with increased stress reactivity and better memory for unpleasant, arousing events, leading to increased negative mood and susceptibility to affective disorder.</content:encoded>
