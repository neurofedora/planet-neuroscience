	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Is Smaller Better: A Proposal To Consider Bacteria For Biologically Inspired Modeling. (arXiv:1709.04300v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04300</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Bacteria are easily characterizable model organisms with an impressively
complicated set of capabilities. Among their capabilities is quorum sensing, a
detailed cell-cell signaling system that may have a common origin with
eukaryotic cell-cell signaling. Not only are the two phenomena similar, but
quorum sensing, as is the case with any bacterial phenomenon when compared to
eukaryotes, is also easier to study in depth than eukaryotic cell-cell
signaling. This ease of study is a contrast to the only partially understood
cellular dynamics of neurons. Here we review the literature on the strikingly
neuron-like qualities of bacterial colonies and biofilms, including ion-based
and hormonal signaling, and action potential-like behavior. This allows them to
feasibly act as an analog for neurons that could produce more detailed and more
accurate biologically-based computational models. Using bacteria as the basis
for biologically feasible computational models may allow models to better
harness the tremendous ability of biological organisms to make decisions and
process information. Additionally, principles gleaned from bacterial function
have the potential to influence computational efforts divorced from biology,
just as neuronal function has in the abstract influenced countless machine
learning efforts.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A Constrained, Weighted-L1 Minimization Approach for Joint Discovery of Heterogeneous Neural Connectivity Graphs. (arXiv:1709.04090v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04090</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Determining functional brain connectivity is crucial to understanding the
brain and neural differences underlying disorders such as autism. Recent
studies have used Gaussian graphical models to learn brain connectivity via
statistical dependencies across brain regions from neuroimaging. However,
previous studies often fail to properly incorporate priors tailored to
neuroscience, such as preferring shorter connections. To remedy this problem,
the paper here introduces a novel, weighted-$\ell_1$, multi-task graphical
model (W-SIMULE). This model elegantly incorporates a flexible prior, along
with a parallelizable formulation. Additionally, W-SIMULE extends the
often-used Gaussian assumption, leading to considerable performance increases.
Here, applications to fMRI data show that W-SIMULE succeeds in determining
functional connectivity in terms of (1) log-likelihood, (2) finding edges that
differentiate groups, and (3) classifying different groups based on their
connectivity, achieving 58.6\% accuracy on the ABIDE dataset. Having
established W-SIMULE's effectiveness, it links four key areas to autism, all of
which are consistent with the literature. Due to its elegant domain adaptivity,
W-SIMULE can be readily applied to various data types to effectively estimate
connectivity.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We propose a neuronal network model which undergoes a saddle-node bifurcation
on an invariant circle as the mechanism of the transition from the interictal
to the ictal (seizure) state. In the vicinity of this transition, the model
captures important dynamical features of both interictal and ictal states. We
study the nature of interictal spikes and early warnings of the transition
predicted by this model. We further demonstrate that recurrent seizures emerge
due to the interaction between two networks.

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/189134v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Homeostatic regulation is a powerful tool utilized by virtually all biological systems, brain included. Broadly speaking, each homeostatic process embodies two components: the sensing component, whereby a deviation is detected and quantified, and the effecting component that executes the homeostatic adjustment with the goal of alleviating the deviation. In the central nervous system, homeostatic plasticity has been suggested to play an important role in shaping the dynamics of single neurons and neuronal networks. However, existing 'biophysical' models of homeostatic plasticity are exceedingly simplistic. These models usually describe the sensor component in terms of simple averaging over neuronal activity and offer no explanation of the relevant biochemical pathways. Here, we attempt to fill this gap in our understanding of homeostatic plasticity by proposing a biophysical framework to explain detection of prolonged synaptic inactivity that may occur in some scenarios of brain injury. We propose that sensing of, and response to, synaptic inactivity involves detection of the extracellular glutamate level and occurs via the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), while the inactivity-induced synthesis of one of the homeostatic plasticity effectors, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF), serves as an effecting component of the system. This model can help to explain the experimental observations linking prolonged neuronal inactivity to TNF signaling. Importantly, the proposed signaling scheme is not limited to mGluRs and astrocytes, but rather is potentially applicable to any cells expressing receptors that activate the relevant G protein units. The proposed signaling scheme is likely to be useful for developing pharmacological interventions targeting homeostatic plasticity pathways.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Conservation of preparatory neural events regardless of how movement is initiated</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/189035v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Voluntary movement is believed to be preceded by a preparatory stage. Evidence arises from experiments where a delay separates instruction and execution cues. While this sequence emulates some real-world situations (e.g., swatting a fly upon landing) movements are commonly made at a moment of one's choosing (reaching for a coffee cup) or are made reactively (intercepting a falling cup). To ascertain whether neural events are conserved across such contexts, we examined motor cortex population-level responses in monkeys when reaches were initiated either after an imposed delay, at a self-chosen time, or reactively with very low latency. We found that the same preparatory and movement-related events were conserved. However, preparation was temporally flexible and could be remarkably brief. Our findings support the existing hypothesis that preparation is an obligatory stage that achieves a consistent state prior to movement. Yet our results reveal that preparation can unfold more rapidly than previously supposed.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Assessing robustness against potential publication bias in coordinate based fMRI meta-analyses using the Fail-Safe N</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/189001v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The importance of integrating research findings is incontrovertible and coordinate based meta-analyses have become a popular approach to combine results of fMRI studies when only peaks of activation are reported. Similar to classical meta-analyses, coordinate based meta-analyses may be subject to different forms of publication bias which impacts results and possibly invalidates findings. We develop a tool that assesses the robustness to potential publication bias on cluster level. We investigate the possible influence of the file-drawer effect, where studies that do not report certain results fail to get published, by determining the number of noise studies that can be added to an existing fMRI meta-analysis before the results are no longer statistically significant. In this paper we illustrate this tool through an example and test the effect of several parameters through extensive simulations. We provide an algorithm for which code is freely available to generate noise studies and enables users to determine the robustness of meta-analytical results.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Associations between memory traces emerge in a generic neural circuit model through STDP</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/188938v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The formation of associations between memory items, that enables recall of one memory component by activating another, is a fundamental operation of higher brain function. Recent neural recordings provide insight into the way how such associations are encoded on the level of neurons in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL). We show that important features of these experimental data can be reproduced by a generic neural circuit model consisting of excitatory and inhibitory spiking neurons with data-based short- and long-term synaptic plasticity. A key result of the experimental data and the model is that the association process causes the emergence of overlaps between the assemblies of neurons that encode the memory components. These overlaps appear in the experiments and the model at the same time when the association becomes computationally functional. Hence our model elucidates computational and plasticity processes that are likely to shape memory systems in the brain.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Cortical Connectivity In A Macaque Model Of Congenital Blindness</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/188888v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Brain-mapping of the congenitally blind human reveals extensive plasticity. The visual cortex of the blind has been observed to support higher cognitive functions including language and numerical processing. This functional shift is hypothesized to reflect a metamodal cortical function, where computations are defined by the local network. In the case of developmental deafferentation, local circuits are considered to implement higher cognitive functions by accommodating diverse long-distance inputs. However, the extent to which visual deprivation triggers a reorganization of the large-scale network in the cortex is still controversial. Here we show that early prenatal ablation of the retina, an experimental model of anophthalmia in macaque, leads to a major reduction of area V1 and the creation of a default extrastriate cortex (DEC). Anophthalmic and normal macaques received retrograde tracer injections in DEC, as well as areas V2 and V4 post-natally. This revealed a six-fold expansion of the spatial extent of local connectivity in the DEC and a surprisingly high location of the DEC derived from a computational model of the cortical hierarchy. In the anophthalmic the set of areas projecting to the DEC, area V2 and V4 does not differ from that of normal adult controls, but there is a highly significant increase in the relative cumulative weight of the ventral stream areas input to the early visual areas. These findings show that although occupying the territory that would have become primary visual cortex the DEC exhibits features of a higher order area, thus reflecting a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on cortical specification. Understanding the interaction of these contributing factors will shed light on cortical plasticity during primate development and the neurobiology of blindness.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/188870v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Human cognitive strategies vary across nations and cultures. However, it is unknown whether the cognitive strategies of nations are randomly distributed or whether groups of countries are clustered by similar cognitive profiles. Using a mobile-based virtual reality navigation task, we measured spatial navigation ability in more than 2.5 million people globally. Using a clustering approach, we find that navigation ability is not smoothly distributed globally but clustered into five distinct yet geographically related groups of countries. Furthermore, the economic wealth of a nation (Gross Domestic Product per capita) was predictive of the average navigation ability of its inhabitants and gender inequality (Gender Gap Index) was predictive of the size of performance difference between males and females. Thus, cognitive abilities, at least for spatial navigation, are clustered according to economic wealth and gender inequalities globally. This will not only inform cognitive assessment but also clinical assessment and educational approaches in the future.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Cholecystokinin release triggered by presynaptic NMDA receptors produces LTP and sound-sound associative memory formation</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/188839v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Memory is stored in neural networks via changes in synaptic strength mediated in part by NMDA-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP). There is evidence that entorhinal cortex enables neocortical neuroplasticity through cholecystokinin (CCK)-containing neocortical projections. Here we show that a CCKB antagonist blocks high-frequency stimulation (HFS)-induced LTP in the auditory cortex, whereas local infusion of CCK induces LTP. CCK-/- mice lacked neocortical LTP and showed deficits in a cue-cue associative learning paradigm; administration of CCK rescued associative learning. HFS of CCK-containing entorhino-neocortical projection neurons in anesthetized mice enabled cue-cue associative learning. Furthermore, when one cue was pre-conditioned to footshock, the mouse showed a freezing response to the other cue, indicating that the mice had formed an association. HFS-induced neocortical LTP was completely blocked by either NMDA antagonist or CCK-BR antagonist, while application of either NMDA or CCK induced LTP after low-frequency stimulation (LFS). Moreover, in the presence of CCK LTP was still induced, even after blockade of NMDA receptors. Local application of NMDA induced CCK release in the neocortex. To identify how NMDA receptor switches LTP, a stimulation protocol of 25 pulse-pairs was adopted to replace HFS; NMDA-dependent LTP was induced with the inter-pulse intervals between 10 and 100 ms, but not with those of 5 and 200 ms. LTP-mediated plasticity was linked to localization of the NMDA receptor subunit NR2a on cortical CCK terminals originating in the entorhinal cortex. These novel findings suggest that presynaptic NMDA receptors on CCK terminals control the release of CCK, which enables neocortical LTP and formation of cue-cue associative memory.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/188789v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The function of mossy cells (MCs) in the dentate gyrus has remained elusive. Here we determined the functional impact of single mossy fibre (MF) synapses on MC firing in mouse entorhino-hippocampal slice cultures. We stimulated single MF boutons and recorded Ca2+ transients in the postsynaptic spine and excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) at the MC soma. Synaptic responses to single presynaptic stimuli varied strongly between different MF synapses, even if they were located on the same MC dendrite. Synaptic strengths ranged from subthreshold EPSPs to direct postsynaptic action potential (AP) generation. Induction of synaptic plasticity at these individual MF synapses resulted in potentiation or depression depending on the initially encountered synaptic state, indicating that synaptic transmission at MF synapses on MCs is determined by their previous functional history. With these footprints of synaptic activity these synapses control individually MC firing thereby enabling modulation of the dentate network by single granule cells.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The connectivity of the human brain is fundamental to understanding the principles of cognitive function, and the mechanisms by which it can go awry. To that extent, tools for estimating human brain networks are required for single participant, group level, and cross-study analyses. We have developed an open-source, cloud-enabled, turn-key pipeline that operates on (groups of) raw diffusion and structure magnetic resonance imaging data, estimating brain networks (connectomes) across 24 different spatial scales, with quality assurance visualizations at each stage of processing. Running a harmonized analysis on 10 different datasets comprising 2,295 subjects and 2,861 scans reveals that the connectomes across datasets are similar on coarse scales, but quantitatively different on fine scales. Our framework therefore illustrates that while general principles of human brain organization may be preserved across experiments, obtaining reliable p-values and clinical biomarkers from connectomics will require further harmonization efforts.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/188664v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Prestimulus subsequent memory effects (preSMEs) - differences in neural activity elicited by a task cue at encoding that are predictive of later memory performance - are thought to reflect differential engagement of preparatory processes that benefit episodic memory encoding. The present experiment investigated age differences in preSMEs indexed by differences in ERP amplitude just prior to the onset of a study event. Healthy young and older human adults (both males and females) incidentally encoded words for a subsequent memory test. Each study word was preceded by a task cue that signaled the judgment to perform on the word. Words were presented for either a short (300 ms) or a long (1000 ms) duration with the aim of placing differential benefits on engaging the preparatory processes initiated by the task cue. ERPs associated with subsequent successful and unsuccessful recollection, operationalized here by source memory accuracy, were estimated time-locked to the onset of the task cue. In a late time-window (1000-2000 ms following cue onset), young adults demonstrated frontally-distributed preSMEs in both the short and long conditions, albeit with opposite polarities in the two conditions. This finding suggests that preSMEs in young adults are sensitive to task demands. Although older adults showed no evidence of preSMEs in the same late time window, significant preSMEs were observed in an earlier time window (500-1000 ms) in both encoding conditions. These results are broadly consistent with the proposal that older adults differ from their young counterparts in how they engage preparatory processes during memory encoding.</content:encoded>

Gene order is not random in eukaryotic chromosomes, and co-regulated genes tend to be clustered. The mechanisms that determine co-regulation of large regions of the genome and its connection with chromatin three-dimensional (3D) organization are still unclear however. Here we have adapted a recently described method for identifying chromatin topologically associating domains (TADs) to identify coexpression domains (which we term “CODs”). Using human normal breast and breast cancer RNA-seq data, we have identified approximately 500 CODs. CODs in the normal and breast cancer genomes share similar characteristics but differ in their gene composition. COD genes have a greater tendency to be coexpressed with genes that reside in other CODs than with non-COD genes. Such inter-COD coexpression is maintained over large chromosomal distances in the normal genome but is partially lost in the cancer genome. Analyzing the relationship between CODs and chromatin 3D organization using Hi-C contact data, we find that CODs do not correspond to TADs. In fact, intra-TAD gene coexpression is the same as random for most chromosomes. However, the contact profile is similar between gene pairs that reside either in the same COD or in coexpressed CODs. These data indicate that co-regulated genes in the genome present similar patterns of contacts irrespective of the frequency of physical chromatin contacts between them.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fhS4VF136qI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: After Nerve Injury, Lineage Tracing Shows That Myelin and Remak Schwann Cells Elongate Extensively and Branch to Form Repair Schwann Cells, Which Shorten Radically on Remyelination</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/37/9086?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There is consensus that, distal to peripheral nerve injury, myelin and Remak cells reorganize to form cellular columns, Bungner's bands, which are indispensable for regeneration. However, knowledge of the structure of these regeneration tracks has not advanced for decades and the structure of the cells that form them, denervated or repair Schwann cells, remains obscure. Furthermore, the origin of these cells from myelin and Remak cells and their ability to give rise to myelin cells after regeneration has not been demonstrated directly, although these conversions are believed to be central to nerve repair. Using genetic lineage-tracing and scanning-block face electron microscopy, we show that injury of sciatic nerves from mice of either sex triggers extensive and unexpected Schwann cell elongation and branching to form long, parallel processes. Repair cells are 2- to 3-fold longer than myelin and Remak cells and 7- to 10-fold longer than immature Schwann cells. Remarkably, when repair cells transit back to myelinating cells, they shorten ~7-fold to generate the typically short internodes of regenerated nerves. The present experiments define novel morphological transitions in injured nerves and show that repair Schwann cells have a cell-type-specific structure that differentiates them from other cells in the Schwann cell lineage. They also provide the first direct evidence using genetic lineage tracing for two basic assumptions in Schwann cell biology: that myelin and Remak cells generate the elongated cells that build Bungner bands in injured nerves and that such cells can transform to myelin cells after regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; After injury to peripheral nerves, the myelin and Remak Schwann cells distal to the injury site reorganize and modify their properties to form cells that support the survival of injured neurons, promote axon growth, remove myelin-associated growth inhibitors, and guide regenerating axons to their targets. We show that the generation of these repair-supportive Schwann cells involves an extensive cellular elongation and branching, often to form long, parallel processes. This generates a distinctive repair cell morphology that is favorable for the formation of the regeneration tracks that are essential for nerve repair. Remyelination, conversely, involves a striking cell shortening to form the typical short myelin cells of regenerated nerves. We also provide evidence for direct lineage relationships between: (1) repair cells and myelin and Remak cells of uninjured nerves and (2) remyelinating cells in regenerated nerves.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Individual Movement Variability Magnitudes Are Explained by Cortical Neural Variability</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/37/9076?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Humans exhibit considerable motor variability even across trivial reaching movements. This variability can be separated into specific kinematic components such as extent and direction that are thought to be governed by distinct neural processes. Here, we report that individual subjects (males and females) exhibit different magnitudes of kinematic variability, which are consistent (within individual) across movements to different targets and regardless of which arm (right or left) was used to perform the movements. Simultaneous fMRI recordings revealed that the same subjects also exhibited different magnitudes of fMRI variability across movements in a variety of motor system areas. These fMRI variability magnitudes were also consistent across movements to different targets when performed with either arm. Cortical fMRI variability in the posterior–parietal cortex of individual subjects explained their movement–extent variability. This relationship was apparent only in posterior-parietal cortex and not in other motor system areas, thereby suggesting that individuals with more variable movement preparation exhibit larger kinematic variability. We therefore propose that neural and kinematic variability are reliable and interrelated individual characteristics that may predispose individual subjects to exhibit distinct motor capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neural activity and movement kinematics are remarkably variable. Although intertrial variability is rarely studied, here, we demonstrate that individual human subjects exhibit distinct magnitudes of neural and kinematic variability that are reproducible across movements to different targets and when performing these movements with either arm. Furthermore, when examining the relationship between cortical variability and movement variability, we find that cortical fMRI variability in parietal cortex of individual subjects explained their movement extent variability. This enabled us to explain why some subjects performed more variable movements than others based on their cortical variability magnitudes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Contribution of Astroglial Cx43 Hemichannels to the Modulation of Glutamatergic Currents by D-Serine in the Mouse Prefrontal Cortex</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/37/9064?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes interact dynamically with neurons by modifying synaptic activity and plasticity. This interplay occurs through a process named gliotransmission, meaning that neuroactive molecules are released by astrocytes. Acting as a gliotransmitter, D-serine, a co-agonist of the NMDA receptor at the glycine-binding site, can be released by astrocytes in a calcium [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;-dependent manner. A typical feature of astrocytes is their high expression level of connexin43 (Cx43), a protein forming gap junction channels and hemichannels associated with dynamic neuroglial interactions. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of Cx43 hemichannel activity reduced the amplitude of NMDA EPSCs in mouse layer 5 prefrontal cortex pyramidal neurons without affecting AMPA EPSC currents. This reduction of NMDA EPSCs was rescued by addition of D-serine in the extracellular medium. LTP of NMDA and AMPA EPSCs after high-frequency stimulation was reduced by prior inhibition of Cx43 hemichannel activity. Inactivation of D-serine synthesis within the astroglial network resulted in the reduction of NMDA EPSCs, which was rescued by adding extracellular D-serine. We showed that the activity of Cx43 hemichannels recorded in cultured astrocytes was [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt; dependent. Accordingly, in acute cortical slices, clamping [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; at a low level in astroglial network resulted in an inhibition of NMDA EPSC potentiation that was rescued by adding extracellular D-serine. This work demonstrates that astroglial Cx43 hemichannel activity is associated with D-serine release. This process, occurring by direct permeation of D-serine through hemichannels or indirectly by Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry and activation of other [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;-dependent mechanisms results in the modulation of synaptic activity and plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We recorded neuronal glutamatergic (NMDA and AMPA) responses in prefrontal cortex (PFC) neurons and used pharmacological and genetic interventions to block connexin-mediated hemichannel activity specifically in a glial cell population. For the first time in astrocytes, we demonstrated that hemichannel activity depends on the intracellular calcium concentration and is associated with D-serine release. Blocking hemichannel activity reduced the LTP of these excitatory synaptic currents triggered by high-frequency stimulation. These observations may be particularly relevant in the PFC, where D-serine and its converting enzyme are highly expressed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/37/9054?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ipsilateral motor areas of cerebral cortex are active during arm movements and even reliably predict movement direction. Is coding similar during ipsilateral and contralateral movements? If so, is it in extrinsic (world-centered) or intrinsic (joint-configuration) coordinates? We addressed these questions by examining the similarity of multivoxel fMRI patterns in visuomotor cortical regions during unilateral reaching movements with both arms. The results of three complementary analyses revealed that fMRI response patterns were similar across right and left arm movements to identical targets (extrinsic coordinates) in visual cortices, and across movements with equivalent joint-angles (intrinsic coordinates) in motor cortices. We interpret this as evidence for the existence of distributed neural populations in multiple motor system areas that encode ipsilateral and contralateral movements in a similar manner: according to their intrinsic/joint coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Cortical motor control exhibits clear lateralization: each hemisphere controls the motor output of the contralateral body. Nevertheless, neural populations in ipsilateral areas across the visuomotor hierarchy are active during unilateral movements. We show that fMRI response patterns in the motor cortices are similar for both arms if the movement direction is mirror-reversed across the midline. This suggests that in both ipsilateral and contralateral motor cortices, neural populations have effector-invariant coding of movements in intrinsic coordinates. This not only affects our understanding of motor control, it may serve in the development of brain machine interfaces that also use ipsilateral neural activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Changes in the Excitability of Neocortical Neurons in a Mouse Model of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Are Not Specific to Corticospinal Neurons and Are Modulated by Advancing Disease</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/37/9037?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cell type-specific changes in neuronal excitability have been proposed to contribute to the selective degeneration of corticospinal neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and to neocortical hyperexcitability, a prominent feature of both inherited and sporadic variants of the disease, but the mechanisms underlying selective loss of specific cell types in ALS are not known. We analyzed the physiological properties of distinct classes of cortical neurons in the motor cortex of &lt;i&gt;hSOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice of both sexes and found that they all exhibit increases in intrinsic excitability that depend on disease stage. Targeted recordings and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; calcium imaging further revealed that neurons adapt their functional properties to normalize cortical excitability as the disease progresses. Although different neuron classes all exhibited increases in intrinsic excitability, transcriptional profiling indicated that the molecular mechanisms underlying these changes are cell type specific. The increases in excitability in both excitatory and inhibitory cortical neurons show that selective dysfunction of neuronal cell types cannot account for the specific vulnerability of corticospinal motor neurons in ALS. Furthermore, the stage-dependent alterations in neuronal function highlight the ability of cortical circuits to adapt as disease progresses. These findings show that both disease stage and cell type must be considered when developing therapeutic strategies for treating ALS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; It is not known why certain classes of neurons preferentially die in different neurodegenerative diseases. It has been proposed that the enhanced excitability of affected neurons is a major contributor to their selective loss. We show using a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a disease in which corticospinal neurons exhibit selective vulnerability, that changes in excitability are not restricted to this neuronal class and that excitability does not increase monotonically with disease progression. Moreover, although all neuronal cell types tested exhibited abnormal functional properties, analysis of their gene expression demonstrated cell type-specific responses to the ALS-causing mutation. These findings suggest that therapies for ALS may need to be tailored for different cell types and stages of disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Bilingual Language Switching in the Laboratory versus in the Wild: The Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Adaptive Language Control</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/37/9022?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For a bilingual human, every utterance requires a choice about which language to use. This choice is commonly regarded as part of general executive control, engaging prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices similarly to many types of effortful task switching. However, although language control within artificial switching paradigms has been heavily studied, the neurobiology of natural switching within socially cued situations has not been characterized. Additionally, although theoretical models address how language control mechanisms adapt to the distinct demands of different interactional contexts, these predictions have not been empirically tested. We used MEG (RRID: &lt;a href=&quot;https://scicrunch.org/resolver/NIFINV:nlx_inv_090918&quot;&gt;NIFINV:nlx_inv_090918&lt;/a&gt;) to investigate language switching in multiple contexts ranging from completely artificial to the comprehension of a fully natural bilingual conversation recorded &quot;in the wild.&quot; Our results showed less anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortex involvement for more natural switching. In production, voluntary switching did not engage the prefrontal cortex or elicit behavioral switch costs. In comprehension, while laboratory switches recruited executive control areas, fully natural switching within a conversation only engaged auditory cortices. Multivariate pattern analyses revealed that, in production, interlocutor identity was represented in a sustained fashion throughout the different stages of language planning until speech onset. In comprehension, however, a biphasic pattern was observed: interlocutor identity was first represented at the presentation of the interlocutor and then again at the presentation of the auditory word. In all, our findings underscore the importance of ecologically valid experimental paradigms and offer the first neurophysiological characterization of language control in a range of situations simulating real life to various degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Bilingualism is an inherently social phenomenon, interactional context fully determining language choice. This research addresses the neural mechanisms underlying multilingual individuals' ability to successfully adapt to varying conversational contexts both while speaking and listening. Our results showed that interactional context critically determines language control networks' engagement: switching under external constraints heavily recruited prefrontal control regions, whereas natural, voluntary switching did not. These findings challenge conclusions derived from artificial switching paradigms, which suggested that language switching is intrinsically effortful. Further, our results predict that the so-called bilingual advantage should be limited to individuals who need to control their languages according to external cues and thus would not occur by virtue of an experience in which switching is fully free.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Superoptimal Perceptual Integration Suggests a Place-Based Representation of Pitch at High Frequencies</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/37/9013?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Pitch, the perceptual correlate of sound repetition rate or frequency, plays an important role in speech perception, music perception, and listening in complex acoustic environments. Despite the perceptual importance of pitch, the neural mechanisms that underlie it remain poorly understood. Although cortical regions responsive to pitch have been identified, little is known about how pitch information is extracted from the inner ear itself. The two primary theories of peripheral pitch coding involve stimulus-driven spike timing, or phase locking, in the auditory nerve (time code), and the spatial distribution of responses along the length of the cochlear partition (place code). To rule out the use of timing information, we tested pitch discrimination of very high-frequency tones (&amp;gt;8 kHz), well beyond the putative limit of phase locking. We found that high-frequency pure-tone discrimination was poor, but when the tones were combined into a harmonic complex, a dramatic improvement in discrimination ability was observed that exceeded performance predicted by the optimal integration of peripheral information from each of the component frequencies. The results are consistent with the existence of pitch-sensitive neurons that rely only on place-based information from multiple harmonically related components. The results also provide evidence against the common assumption that poor high-frequency pure-tone pitch perception is the result of peripheral neural-coding constraints. The finding that place-based spectral coding is sufficient to elicit complex pitch at high frequencies has important implications for the design of future neural prostheses to restore hearing to deaf individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The question of how pitch is represented in the ear has been debated for over a century. Two competing theories involve timing information from neural spikes in the auditory nerve (time code) and the spatial distribution of neural activity along the length of the cochlear partition (place code). By using very high-frequency tones unlikely to be coded via time information, we discovered that information from the individual harmonics is combined so efficiently that performance exceeds theoretical predictions based on the optimal integration of information from each harmonic. The findings have important implications for the design of auditory prostheses because they suggest that enhanced spatial resolution alone may be sufficient to restore pitch via such implants.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Mutant Huntingtin Is Secreted via a Late Endosomal/Lysosomal Unconventional Secretory Pathway</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/37/9000?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of a CAG triplet in the gene encoding for huntingtin (Htt). The resulting mutant protein (mHtt) with extended polyglutamine (polyQ) sequence at the N terminus leads to neuronal degeneration both in a cell-autonomous and a non-cell-autonomous manner. Recent studies identified mHtt in the extracellular environment and suggested that its spreading contributes to toxicity, but the mechanism of mHtt release from the cell of origin remains unknown. In this study, we performed a comprehensive, unbiased analysis of secretory pathways and identified an unconventional lysosomal pathway as an important mechanism for mHtt secretion in mouse neuroblastoma and striatal cell lines, as well as in primary neurons. mHtt secretion was dependent on synaptotagmin 7, a regulator of lysosomal secretion, and inhibited by chemical ablation of late endosomes/lysosomes, suggesting a lysosomal secretory pattern. mHtt was targeted preferentially to the late endosomes/lysosomes compared with wild-type Htt. Importantly, we found that late endosomal/lysosomal targeting and secretion of mHtt could be inhibited efficiently by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and neutral sphingomyelinase chemical inhibitors, Ly294002 and GW4869, respectively. Together, our data suggest a lysosomal mechanism of mHtt secretion and offer potential strategies for pharmacological modulation of its neuronal secretion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This is the first study examining the mechanism of mutant huntingtin (mHTT) secretion in an unbiased manner. We found that the protein is secreted via a late endosomal/lysosomal unconventional secretory pathway. Moreover, mHtt secretion can be reduced significantly by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and neutral sphingomyelinase inhibitors. Understanding and manipulating the secretion of mHtt is important because of its potentially harmful propagation in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Plasticity Beyond V1: Reinforcement of Motion Perception upon Binocular Central Retinal Lesions in Adulthood</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/37/8989?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Induction of a central retinal lesion in both eyes of adult mammals is a model for macular degeneration and leads to retinotopic map reorganization in the primary visual cortex (V1). Here we characterized the spatiotemporal dynamics of molecular activity levels in the central and peripheral representation of five higher-order visual areas, V2/18, V3/19, V4/21a,V5/PMLS, area 7, and V1/17, in adult cats with central 10° retinal lesions (both sexes), by means of real-time PCR for the neuronal activity reporter gene &lt;i&gt;zif268.&lt;/i&gt; The lesions elicited a similar, permanent reduction in activity in the center of the lesion projection zone of area V1/17, V2/18, V3/19, and V4/21a, but not in the motion-driven V5/PMLS, which instead displayed an increase in molecular activity at 3 months postlesion, independent of visual field coordinates. Also area 7 only displayed decreased activity in its LPZ in the first weeks postlesion and increased activities in its periphery from 1 month onward. Therefore we examined the impact of central vision loss on motion perception using random dot kinematograms to test the capacity for form from motion detection based on direction and velocity cues. We revealed that the central retinal lesions either do not impair motion detection or even result in better performance, specifically when motion discrimination was based on velocity discrimination. In conclusion, we propose that central retinal damage leads to enhanced peripheral vision by sensitizing the visual system for motion processing relying on feedback from V5/PMLS and area 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Central retinal lesions, a model for macular degeneration, result in functional reorganization of the primary visual cortex. Examining the level of cortical reactivation with the molecular activity marker &lt;i&gt;zif268&lt;/i&gt; revealed reorganization in visual areas outside V1. Retinotopic lesion projection zones typically display an initial depression in &lt;i&gt;zif268&lt;/i&gt; expression, followed by partial recovery with postlesion time. Only the motion-sensitive area V5/PMLS shows no decrease, and even a significant activity increase at 3 months post-retinal lesion. Behavioral tests of motion perception found no impairment and even better sensitivity to higher random dot stimulus velocities. We demonstrate that the loss of central vision induces functional mobilization of motion-sensitive visual cortex, resulting in enhanced perception of moving stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Wnt9a Can Influence Cell Fates and Neural Connectivity across the Radial Axis of the Developing Cochlea</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/37/8975?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Vertebrate hearing organs manifest cellular asymmetries across the radial axis that underlie afferent versus efferent circuits between the inner ear and the brain. Therefore, understanding the molecular control of patterning across this axis has important functional implications. Radial axis patterning begins before the cells become postmitotic and is likely linked to the onset of asymmetric expression of secreted factors adjacent to the sensory primordium. This study explores one such asymmetrically expressed gene, &lt;i&gt;Wnt9a&lt;/i&gt;, which becomes restricted to the neural edge of the avian auditory organ, the basilar papilla, by embryonic day 5 (E5). Radial patterning is disrupted when &lt;i&gt;Wnt9a&lt;/i&gt; is overexpressed throughout the prosensory domain beginning on E3. Sexes were pooled for analysis and sex differences were not studied. Analysis of gene expression and afferent innervation on E6 suggests that ectopic Wnt9a expands the neural-side fate, possibly by re-specifying the abneural fate. RNA sequencing reveals quantitative changes, not only in Wnt-pathway genes, but also in genes involved in axon guidance and cytoskeletal remodeling. By E18, these early patterning effects are manifest as profound changes in cell fates [short hair cells (HCs) are missing], ribbon synapse numbers, outward ionic currents, and efferent innervation. These observations suggest that Wnt9a may be one of the molecules responsible for breaking symmetry across the radial axis of the avian auditory organ. Indirectly, Wnt9a can regulate the mature phenotype whereby afferent axons predominantly innervate neural-side tall HCs, resulting in more ribbon synapses per HC compared with abneural-side short HCs with few ribbons and large efferent synapses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Wnts are a class of secreted factors that are best known for stimulating cell division in development and cancer. However, in certain contexts during development, Wnt-expressing cells can direct neighboring cells to take on specific fates. This study suggests that the Wnt9a ligand may play such a role in the developing hearing organ of the bird cochlea. This was shown through patterning defects that occur in response to the overexpression of Wnt9a. This manipulation increased one type of sensory hair cell (tall HCs) at the expense of another (short HCs) that is usually located furthest from the Wnt9a source. The extraneous tall HCs that replaced short HCs showed some physiological properties and neuronal connections consistent with a fate switch.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Attenuated Activity across Multiple Cell Types and Reduced Monosynaptic Connectivity in the Aged Perirhinal Cortex</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/37/8965?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The perirhinal cortex (PER), which is critical for associative memory and stimulus discrimination, has been described as a wall of inhibition between the neocortex and hippocampus. With advanced age, rats show deficits on PER-dependent behavioral tasks and fewer PER principal neurons are activated by stimuli, but the role of PER interneurons in these altered circuit properties in old age has not been characterized. In the present study, PER neurons were recorded while rats traversed a circular track bidirectionally in which the track was either empty or contained eight novel objects evenly spaced around the track. Putative interneurons were discriminated from principal cells based on the autocorrelogram, waveform parameters, and firing rate. While object modulation of interneuron firing was observed in both young and aged rats, PER interneurons recorded from old animals had lower firing rates compared with those from young animals. This difference could not be accounted for by differences in running speed, as the firing rates of PER interneurons did not show significant velocity modulation. Finally, in the aged rats, relative to young rats, there was a significant reduction in detected excitatory and inhibitory monosynaptic connections. Together these data suggest that with advanced age there may be reduced afferent drive from excitatory cells onto interneurons that may compromise the wall of inhibition between the hippocampus and cortex. This circuit dysfunction could erode the function of temporal lobe networks and ultimately contribute to cognitive aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We report that lower firing rates observed in aged perirhinal cortical principal cells are associated with weaker interneuron activity and reduced monosynaptic coupling between excitatory and inhibitory cells. This is likely to affect feedforward inhibition from the perirhinal to the entorhinal cortex that gates the flow of information to the hippocampus. This is significant because cognitive dysfunction in normative and pathological aging has been linked to hyperexcitability in the aged CA3 subregion of the hippocampus in rats, monkeys, and humans. The reduced inhibition in the perirhinal cortex reported here could contribute to this circuit imbalance, and may be a key point to consider for therapeutic interventions aimed at restoring network function to optimize cognition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/37/8952?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;GABAergic neurons in the inferior colliculus (IC) play a critical role in auditory information processing, yet their responses to sound are unknown. Here, we used optogenetic methods to characterize the response properties of GABAergic and presumed glutamatergic neurons to sound in the IC. We found that responses to pure tones of both inhibitory and excitatory classes of neurons were similar in their thresholds, response latencies, rate-level functions, and frequency tuning, but GABAergic neurons may have higher spontaneous firing rates. In contrast to their responses to pure tones, the inhibitory and excitatory neurons differed in their ability to follow amplitude modulations. The responses of both cell classes were affected by their location regardless of the cell type, especially in terms of their frequency tuning. These results show that the synaptic domain, a unique organization of local neural circuits in the IC, may interact with all types of neurons to produce their ultimate response to sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Although the inferior colliculus (IC) in the auditory midbrain is composed of different types of neurons, little is known about how these specific types of neurons respond to sound. Here, for the first time, we characterized the response properties of GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons in the IC. Both classes of neurons had diverse response properties to tones but were overall similar, except for the spontaneous activity and their ability to follow amplitude-modulated sound. Both classes of neurons may compose a basic local circuit that is replicated throughout the IC. Within each local circuit, the inputs to the local circuit may have a greater influence in determining the response properties to sound than the specific neuron types.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Calpain-GRIP Signaling in Nucleus Accumbens Core Mediates the Reconsolidation of Drug Reward Memory</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/37/8938?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Exposure to drug-paired cues causes drug memories to be in a destabilized state and interfering with memory reconsolidation can inhibit relapse. Calpain, a calcium-dependent neutral cysteine protease, is involved in synaptic plasticity and the formation of long-term fear memory. However, the role of calpain in the reconsolidation of drug reward memory is still unknown. In the present study, using a conditioned place preference (CPP) model, we found that exposure to drug-paired contextual stimuli induced the activation of calpain and decreased the expression of glutamate receptor interacting protein 1 (GRIP1) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core, but not shell, of male rats. Infusions of calpain inhibitors in the NAc core immediately after retrieval disrupted the reconsolidation of cocaine/morphine cue memory and blocked retrieval-induced calpain activation and GRIP1 degradation. The suppressive effect of calpain inhibitors on the expression of drug-induced CPP lasted for at least 14 d. The inhibition of calpain without retrieval 6 h after retrieval or after exposure to an unpaired context had no effects on the expression of reward memory. Calpain inhibition after retrieval also decreased cocaine seeking in a self-administration model and this effect did not recover spontaneously after 28 d. Moreover, the knock-down of GRIP1 expression in the NAc core by lentivirus-mediated short-hairpin RNA blocked disruption of the reconsolidation of drug cue memories that was induced by calpain inhibitor treatment. These results suggest that calpain activity in the NAc core is crucial for the reconsolidation of drug reward memory via the regulation of GRIP1 expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Calpain plays an important role in synaptic plasticity and long-term memory consolidation, however, its role in the reconsolidation of drug cue memory remains unknown. Using conditioned place preference and self-administration procedures, we found that exposure to drug-paired cues induced the activation of calpain and decreased glutamate receptor interacting protein 1 (GRIP1) expression in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core. The inhibition of calpain activity in the NAc core immediately after retrieval disrupted the reconsolidation of cocaine/morphine cue memory that was blocked by prior GRIP1 knock-down. Our findings indicate that calpain-GRIP signaling is essential for the restabilization process that is associated with drug cue memory and the inhibition of calpain activity may be a novel strategy for the prevention of drug relapse.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Human Occipital and Parietal GABA Selectively Influence Visual Perception of Orientation and Size</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/37/8929?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in human brain. The level of GABA varies substantially across individuals, and this variability is associated with interindividual differences in visual perception. However, it remains unclear whether the association between GABA level and visual perception reflects a general influence of visual inhibition or whether the GABA levels of different cortical regions selectively influence perception of different visual features. To address this, we studied how the GABA levels of parietal and occipital cortices related to interindividual differences in size, orientation, and brightness perception. We used visual contextual illusion as a perceptual assay since the illusion dissociates perceptual content from stimulus content and the magnitude of the illusion reflects the effect of visual inhibition. Across individuals, we observed selective correlations between the level of GABA and the magnitude of contextual illusion. Specifically, parietal GABA level correlated with size illusion magnitude but not with orientation or brightness illusion magnitude; in contrast, occipital GABA level correlated with orientation illusion magnitude but not with size or brightness illusion magnitude. Our findings reveal a region- and feature-dependent influence of GABA level on human visual perception. Parietal and occipital cortices contain, respectively, topographic maps of size and orientation preference in which neural responses to stimulus sizes and stimulus orientations are modulated by intraregional lateral connections. We propose that these lateral connections may underlie the selective influence of GABA on visual perception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; GABA, the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in human visual system, varies substantially across individuals. This interindividual variability in GABA level is linked to interindividual differences in many aspects of visual perception. However, the widespread influence of GABA raises the question of whether interindividual variability in GABA reflects an overall variability in visual inhibition and has a general influence on visual perception or whether the GABA levels of different cortical regions have selective influence on perception of different visual features. Here we report a region- and feature-dependent influence of GABA level on human visual perception. Our findings suggest that GABA level of a cortical region selectively influences perception of visual features that are topographically mapped in this region through intraregional lateral connections.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/37/8919?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The basic organization principles of the primary visual cortex (V1) are commonly assumed to also hold in the association cortex such that neurons within a cortical column share functional connectivity patterns and represent the same region of the visual field. We mapped the visual receptive fields (RFs) of neurons recorded at the same electrode in the ventral intraparietal area (VIP) and the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) of rhesus monkeys. We report that the spatial characteristics of visual RFs between adjacent neurons differed considerably, with increasing heterogeneity from VIP to PFC. In addition to RF incongruences, we found differential functional connectivity between putative inhibitory interneurons and pyramidal cells in PFC and VIP. These findings suggest that local RF topography vanishes with hierarchical distance from visual cortical input and argue for increasingly modified functional microcircuits in noncanonical association cortices that contrast V1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Our visual field is thought to be represented faithfully by the early visual brain areas; all the information from a certain region of the visual field is conveyed to neurons situated close together within a functionally defined cortical column. We examined this principle in the association areas, PFC, and ventral intraparietal area of rhesus monkeys and found that adjacent neurons represent markedly different areas of the visual field. This is the first demonstration of such noncanonical organization of these brain areas.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Opposite Synaptic Alterations at the Neuromuscular Junction in an ALS Mouse Model: When Motor Units Matter</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/37/8901?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Denervation of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) precedes the loss of motor neurons (MNs) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ALS is characterized by a motor unit (MU)-dependent vulnerability where MNs with fast-fatigable (FF) characteristics are lost first, followed by fast fatigue-resistant (FR) and slow (S) MNs. However, changes in NMJ properties as a function of MU types remain debated. We hypothesized that NMJ synaptic functions would be altered precociously in an MU-specific manner, before structural alterations of the NMJ. Synaptic transmission and morphological changes of NMJs have been explored in two nerve–muscle preparations of male &lt;i&gt;SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G37R&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice and their wild-type (WT) littermates: the soleus (S and FR MU); and the extensor digitorum longus (FF MU). S, FR, and FF NMJs of WT mice showed distinct synaptic properties from which we build an MU synaptic profile (MUSP) that reports MU-dependent NMJ synaptic properties. At postnatal day 180 (P180), FF and S NMJs of SOD1 already showed, respectively, lower and higher quantal content compared with WT mice, before signs of MN death and before NMJ morphological alterations. Changes persisted in both muscles until preonset (P380), while denervation was frequent in the mutant mouse. MN death was evident at this stage. Additional changes occurred at clinical disease onset (P450) for S and FR MU. As a whole, our results reveal a reversed MUSP in SOD1 mutants and highlight MU-specific synaptic changes occurring in a precise temporal sequence. Importantly, changes in synaptic properties appear to be good predictors of vulnerability to neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The inadequate excitability of motor neurons and their output, the neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), has been considered a key factor in the detrimental outcome of the motor function in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, a conundrum persists at the NMJ whereby persistent but incoherent opposite neurotransmission changes have been reported to take place. This article untangles this conundrum by systematically analyzing the changes in synaptic properties over the course of the disease progression as a function of the motor unit type. This temporal analysis reveals that early synaptic alterations evolve with disease progression but precede NMJ neurodegeneration. These data provide a novel framework of analysis and comparison of synaptic transmission alterations in neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Time of Day Differences in Neural Reward Functioning in Healthy Young Men</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/37/8895?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Reward function appears to be modulated by the circadian system, but little is known about the neural basis of this interaction. Previous research suggests that the neural reward response may be different in the afternoon; however, the direction of this effect is contentious. Reward response may follow the diurnal rhythm in self-reported positive affect, peaking in the early afternoon. An alternative is that daily reward response represents a type of prediction error, with neural reward activation relatively high at times of day when rewards are unexpected (i.e., early and late in the day). The present study measured neural reward activation in the context of a validated reward task at 10.00 h, 14.00 h, and 19.00 h in healthy human males. A region of interest BOLD fMRI protocol was used to investigate the diurnal waveform of activation in reward-related brain regions. Multilevel modeling found, as expected, a highly significant quadratic time-of-day effect focusing on the left putamen (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Consistent with the &quot;prediction error&quot; hypothesis, activation was significantly higher at 10.00 h and 19.00 h compared with 14.00 h. It is provisionally concluded that the putamen may be particularly important in endogenous priming of reward motivation at different times of day, with the pattern of activation consistent with circadian-modulated reward expectancies in neural pathways (i.e., greater activation to reward stimuli at unexpected times of day). This study encourages further research into circadian modulation of reward and underscores the methodological importance of accounting for time of day in fMRI protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This is one of the first studies to use a repeated-measures imaging procedure to explore the diurnal rhythm of reward activation. Although self-reported reward (most often operationalized as positive affect) peaks in the afternoon, the present findings indicate that neural activation is lowest at this time. We conclude that the diurnal neural activation pattern may reflect a prediction error of the brain, where rewards at unexpected times (10.00 h and 19.00 h) elicit higher activation in reward brain regions than at expected (14.00 h) times. These data also have methodological significance, suggesting that there may be a time of day influence, which should be accounted for in neural reward studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: STIM1 Regulates Somatic Ca2+ Signals and Intrinsic Firing Properties of Cerebellar Purkinje Neurons</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/37/8876?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Control of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; flux between the cytosol and intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; stores is essential for maintaining normal cellular function. It has been well established in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells that stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) initiates and regulates refilling Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; into the ER. Here, we describe a novel, additional role for STIM1, the regulation of free cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and the consequent control of spike firing in neurons. Among central neurons, cerebellar Purkinje neurons express the highest level of STIM1, and they fire continuously in the absence of stimulation, making somatic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis of particular importance. By using Purkinje neuron-specific STIM1 knock-out (STIM1&lt;sup&gt;PKO&lt;/sup&gt;) male mice, we found that the deletion of STIM1 delayed clearance of cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in the soma during ongoing neuronal firing. Deletion of STIM1 also reduced the Purkinje neuronal excitability and impaired intrinsic plasticity without affecting long-term synaptic plasticity. In vestibulo-ocular reflex learning, STIM1&lt;sup&gt;PKO&lt;/sup&gt; male mice showed severe deficits in memory consolidation, whereas they were normal in memory acquisition. Our results suggest that STIM1 is critically involved in the regulation of the neuronal excitability and the intrinsic plasticity of the Purkinje neurons as well as cerebellar memory consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), which regulates the refilling of ER Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, has been investigated in several systems including the CNS. In addition to a previous study showing that STIM1 regulates dendritic ER Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; refilling and mGluR1-mediated synaptic transmission, we provide compelling evidence describing a novel role of STIM1 in spike firing Purkinje neurons. We found that STIM1 regulates cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; clearance of the soma during spike firing, and the interruption of this cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; clearing disrupts neuronal excitability and cerebellar memory consolidation. Our results provide new insights into neuronal functions of STIM1 from single neuronal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dynamics to behavior level.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Learning and Stress Shape the Reward Response Patterns of Serotonin Neurons</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/37/8863?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The ability to predict reward promotes animal survival. Both dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area and serotonin neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) participate in reward processing. Although the learning effects on dopamine neurons have been extensively characterized, it remains largely unknown how the response of serotonin neurons evolves during learning. Moreover, although stress is known to strongly influence reward-related behavior, we know very little about how stress modulates neuronal reward responses. By monitoring Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals during the entire process of Pavlovian conditioning, we here show that learning differentially shapes the response patterns of serotonin neurons and dopamine neurons in mice of either sex. Serotonin neurons gradually develop a slow ramp-up response to the reward-predicting cue, and ultimately remain responsive to the reward, whereas dopamine neurons increase their response to the cue but reduce their response to the reward. For both neuron types, the responses to the cue and the reward depend on reward value, are reversible when the reward is omitted, and are rapidly reinstated by restoring the reward. We also found that stressors including head restraint and fearful context substantially reduce the response strength of both neuron types, to both the cue and the reward. These results reveal the dynamic nature of the reward responses, support the hypothesis that DRN serotonin neurons signal the current likelihood of receiving a net benefit, and suggest that the inhibitory effect of stress on the reward responses of serotonin neurons and dopamine neurons may contribute to stress-induced anhedonia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Both serotonin neurons in the dorsal raphe and dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area are intimately involved in reward processing. Using long-term fiber photometry of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals from freely behaving mice, we here show that learning produces a ramp-up activation pattern in serotonin neurons that differs from that in dopamine neurons, indicating complementary roles for these two neuron types in reward processing. Moreover, stress treatment substantially reduces the reward responses of both serotonin neurons and dopamine neurons, suggesting a possible physiological basis for stress-induced anhedonia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Insights into the molecular changes associated with postnatal human brain development: an integrated transcriptomics and proteomics study</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/188565v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Healthy cortical development depends on precise regulation of transcription and translation. However, the relationships between levels of mRNAs and their respective translated proteins have not yet been examined comprehensively in the developing human brain. We surveyed the proteomic landscape of 69 dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples across seven stages of postnatal life and integrated these data with paired transcriptome data. We detected 911 proteins by liquid chromatography mass-spectrometry, and 83 were significantly associated with postnatal age (FDR P&amp;lt;0.05). Network analysis revealed five modules of co-regulated proteins, three of which correlated with age, including two modules with increasing expression implicated in gliogenesis and NADH-metabolism and one neurogenesis-related module with decreasing expression throughout development. These age-related protein modules overlapped with RNA modules and displayed collinear developmental trajectories between paired RNA and protein expression. We also found that the correspondence between mRNAs and proteins decrease as a function of age, especially for genes involved in neurogenesis and cytoskeleton organization. Finally, intellectual disability and developmental delay genetic risk loci converged on myelination and ATP metabolism-related modules in the proteome and transcriptome, consistent with their neuropathological relevance. Collectively, these findings reveal dynamic aspects of protein regulation in the human prefrontal cortex, providing new insights into development, maturation and disease.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Evidence for a long-term protection of wheel-running exercise against cocaine psychomotor sensitization in adolescent but not in young adult mice</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/188466v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Rodents housed with a running wheel can exhibit attenuated cocaine seeking and cocaine-induced psychomotor activation. However, the longevity of the exercise anti-drug protection and the influence of the developmental stage during which exercise is displayed received little attention. Here, females and males C57BL/6J mice, aged 28 (adolescents) or 77 (young adults) days were housed with (n=56) or without (n=28) a running wheel. After 3 weeks in these conditions, half of the exercised mice were deprived of their wheel (n=28) whereas the other half and the sedentary mice (no wheel) were kept in their respective environments throughout experimentation. After 3 additional weeks, mice were tested for initiation of psychomotor sensitization to 9 once-daily intraperitoneal injections of 8 mg/kg cocaine (following 2 drug-free test sessions). The expression of sensitization was assessed on a single test session 30 days after the last sensitizing cocaine injection. Continuously exercised mice (wheel throughout experimentation) were less responsive to the initiation and the expression of cocaine effects, regardless of the gender and the developmental period during which exercise was introduced. Wheel-running during adolescence attenuated in later life the initiation and the expression of sensitization in females and only its expression in males. In adult females and males, previously-exercised and sedentary mice exhibited indiscernible levels of initiation and expression of sensitization. Thus, the likelihood of the long-term protection of exercise against cocaine vulnerability may depend not only on the gender but also and especially on the period of life in which exercise took place.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Modulation of visual gamma oscillation by excitatory drive and the excitation/inhibition balance in the visual cortex</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/188326v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Cortical gamma oscillations are generated in circuits that include excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) neurons. Prominent MEG/EEG gamma oscillations in visual cortex can be induced by static or moving high-contrast edges stimuli. In a previous study in children, we observed that increasing velocity of visual motion substantially accelerated gamma oscillations, and led to the suppression of gamma response magnitude. These velocity-related modulations might reflect the balance between neural excitation induced by increasing excitatory drive, and efficacy of inhibition. Here, we searched for functional correlates of visual gamma modulations and assessed their development in 75 typically developing individuals aged 7-40 years. Gamma oscillations were measured with MEG in response to high-contrast annular gratings drifting at 1.2, 3.6, or 6.0 deg/s. In adults, we also recorded pupillary constriction as an indirect measure of excitatory drive. Pupil constriction increased with increasing velocity, thus suggesting increased excitatory drive to the cortex. Despite drastic developmental changes in gamma frequency and response strength, the magnitude of the velocity-related gamma modulations - a shift to higher frequency and amplitude suppression - remained remarkably stable. Based on the previous simulation studies, we hypothesized that gamma suppression might result from excessively strong excitatory drive caused by increasing motion velocity and reflects a trade-off between overexcited excitatory and inhibitory circuitry. In children, the stronger gamma suppression correlated with higher IQ, suggesting importance of an optimal E/I balance for cognitive functioning. The velocity-related changes in gamma response may appear useful to assess E/I balance in the visual cortex.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/188318v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In Parkinson's disease, noradrenergic cells of the locus coeruleus and dopamine cells within the nigrostriatal pathway undergo profound degeneration. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the production of all catecholamines, including dopamine and noradrenaline, and is selectively expressed in the cells that produce these neurotransmitters. In vitro studies have previously shown that the TH-synthetic system can contribute to the formation of reactive oxygen species. In addition, animal models of dopamine mishandling demonstrated that free dopamine is neurotoxic. To examine how increased TH activity might influence catecholamine systems in vivo, we generated TH-overexpressing mice (TH-HI) with six total copies of the TH murine gene. A commensurate increase in TH mRNA produced a threefold increase in both total TH protein and phosphorylated TH levels. We found an increased rate of dopamine synthesis in both young and adult mice, reflected by the accumulation of L-DOPA following NSD-1015 administration, as well as elevated dopamine tissue content in young mice and an increased presence of dopamine metabolites at both ages. Adult mice show no difference in baseline locomotor behaviour compared to wildtype littermates, but a have potentiated response to amphetamine. In addition to elevated dopamine turnover in the striatum, TH-HI mice show reduced levels of glutathione and increased levels of cysteinylated catechols. These results indicate that a heightened level of active TH can produce oxidative stress, and may represent a source of toxicity that is specific to catecholamine cells, which are most vulnerable to degeneration in Parkinson's disease.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/187708v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Hyperlipidemia is recognized as a major health problem worldwide, moreover, it is considered as a major risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases development. Since the majority of studies were performed to investigate the effect of hyperlipidemia on the angiogenesis of peripheral derived endothelial cell, this study aims to assess the effect of hyperlipidemia on the angiogenic response of human brain cells. Furthermore, it aims also to assess the involvement of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin. To achieve this aim, human Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cells (hBMECs) were treated with different concentration of Oxidized Low Density Lipoprotein (OxLDL) (1-100 g/ml) for 24 hours. Migration rate and tube formation as markers of angiogenesis were performed, also Comassie blue was used to detect protein level. OxLDL was found to inhibit brain angiogenesis in dose dependent manner over a wide range of concentrations (1-100 g/ml). Using 1 g/ml of OxLDL made minimum reduction of 10% whereas using 100 g/ml of OxLDL resulted 70-80% reduction in the angiogenic potential of hBMECs within 24 hours. Moreover, OxLDL mediated its effect through reduced VEGF level and this effect was partially reversed by administered 5 ng/ml of VEGF. Additionally, OxLDL reduced the level of angiopoitin-2. This further supports the assumption that OxLDL has an anti-angiogenic effect in hBMECs and surely in the brain also. As a conclusion, OxLDL inhibits brain angiogenesis in dose dependent manner through reducing the level of angiogenic factor in human brain microvascular endothelial cells.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/187294v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Action-outcome (A-O) and stimulus-response (S-R) processes that are two forms of instrumental conditioning that are important components of decision making and action selection. The former adapts its response according to the outcome while the latter is insensitive to the outcome. An unsolved question is how these two processes emerge, cooperate and interact inside the brain in order to issue a unique behavioral answer. Here we propose a model of the interaction between the cortex, the basal ganglia and the thalamus based on a dual competition. We hypothesize that the striatum, the subthalamic nucleus, the internal pallidum (GPi), the thalamus, and the cortex are involved in closed feedback loops through the hyperdirect and direct pathways. These loops support a competition process that results in the ability for the basal ganglia to make a cognitive decision followed by a motor decision. Considering lateral cortical interactions (short range excitation, long range inhibition), another competition takes place inside the cortex allowing this latter to make a cognitive and a motor decision. We show how this dual competition endows the model with two regimes. One is oriented towards action-outcome and is driven by reinforcement learning, the other is oriented towards stimulus-response and is driven by Hebbian learning. The final decision is made according to a combination of these two mechanisms with a gradual transfer from the former to the latter. We confirmed these theoretical results on primates using a two-armed bandit task and a reversible bilateral inactivation of the internal part of the globus pallidus.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Part of the symptomatology of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are alterations in arousal and reactivity which could be related to a maladaptive increase in the automated sensory change detection system of the brain. In the current EEG study we investigated whether the brain's response to a simple auditory sensory change was altered in patients with PTSD relative to trauma-exposed matched controls who did not develop the disorder. Thirteen male PTSD patients and trauma-exposed controls matched for age and educational level were presented regular auditory pure tones (1000 Hz, 200 ms duration), with 11% of the tones deviating in both duration (50 ms) and frequency (1200 Hz) while watching a silent movie. Relative to the controls, patients who had developed PTSD showed enhanced mismatch negativity (MMN), increased theta power (5-7 Hz), and stronger suppression of upper alpha activity (13-15 Hz) after deviant vs. standard tones. Behaviourally, the alpha suppression in PTSD correlated with decreased spatial working memory performance suggesting it might reflect enhanced stimulus-feature representations in auditory memory. These results taken together suggest that PTSD patients and trauma-exposed controls can be distinguished by enhanced involuntary attention to changes in sensory patterns.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/BcGlKAb3694/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Kiesha Prem, Alex R. Cook, Mark Jit&lt;/p&gt;

Heterogeneities in contact networks have a major effect in determining whether a pathogen can become epidemic or persist at endemic levels. Epidemic models that determine which interventions can successfully prevent an outbreak need to account for social structure and mixing patterns. Contact patterns vary across age and locations (e.g. home, work, and school), and including them as predictors in transmission dynamic models of pathogens that spread socially will improve the models’ realism. Data from population-based contact diaries in eight European countries from the POLYMOD study were projected to 144 other countries using a Bayesian hierarchical model that estimated the proclivity of age-and-location-specific contact patterns for the countries, using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. Household level data from the Demographic and Health Surveys for nine lower-income countries and socio-demographic factors from several on-line databases for 152 countries were used to quantify similarity of countries to estimate contact patterns in the home, work, school and other locations for countries for which no contact data are available, accounting for demographic structure, household structure where known, and a variety of metrics including workforce participation and school enrolment. Contacts are highly assortative with age across all countries considered, but pronounced regional differences in the age-specific contacts at home were noticeable, with more inter-generational contacts in Asian countries than in other settings. Moreover, there were variations in contact patterns by location, with work-place contacts being least assortative. These variations led to differences in the effect of social distancing measures in an age structured epidemic model. Contacts have an important role in transmission dynamic models that use contact rates to characterize the spread of contact-transmissible diseases. This study provides estimates of mixing patterns for societies for which contact data such as POLYMOD are not yet available.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/BcGlKAb3694&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this short essay, we discuss some basic features of cognitive activity at
several different space-time scales: from neural networks in the brain to
civilizations. One motivation for such comparative study is its heuristic
value. Attempts to better understand the functioning of &quot;wetware&quot; involved in
cognitive activities of central nervous system by comparing it with a computing
device have a long tradition. We suggest that comparison with Internet might be
more adequate. We briefly touch upon such subjects as encoding, compression,
and Saussurean trichotomy langue/langage/parole in various environments.

that this type of synchrony facilitates the binding or grouping of separate
stimulus components. We argue instead for a more general function: A measure of
the prior probability of incoming stimuli, implemented by long-range,
horizontal, intra-cortical connections. We show that networks of this kind --
pulse-coupled excitatory spiking networks in a noisy environment -- can provide
a sufficient substrate for stimulus-dependent spike synchrony. This allows a
quick (few spikes) estimate of the match between inputs and the input history
as encoded in the network structure. Given the ubiquity of small, strongly
excitatory subnetworks in cortex, we thus propose that many experimental
observations of spike synchrony can be viewed as signs of input patterns that
resemble long-term experience, i.e. patterns of high prior probability.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human learners are adept at grasping the complex relationships underlying
incoming sequential input. In the present work, we formalize complex
relationships as graph structures derived from temporal associations in motor
sequences. Next, we explore the extent to which learners are sensitive to key
variations in the topological properties inherent to those graph structures.
Participants performed a probabilistic motor sequence task in which the order
of button presses was determined by the traversal of graphs with modular,
lattice-like, or random organization. Graph nodes each represented a unique
button press and edges represented a transition between button presses. Results
indicate that learning, indexed here by participants' response times, was
strongly mediated by the graph's meso-scale organization, with modular graphs
being associated with shorter response times than random and lattice graphs.
Moreover, variations in a node's number of connections (degree) and a node's
role in mediating long-distance communication (betweeness centrality) impacted
graph learning, even after accounting for level of practice on that node. These
results demonstrate that the graph architecture underlying temporal sequences
of stimuli fundamentally constrain learning, and moreover that tools from
network science provide a valuable framework for assessing how learners encode
complex, temporally structured information.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02852</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Learning about complex associations between pieces of information enables
individuals to quickly adjust their expectations and develop mental models.
Yet, the degree to which humans can learn higher-order information about
complex associations is not well understood; nor is it known whether the
learning process differs for social and non-social information. Here, we employ
a paradigm in which the order of stimulus presentation forms temporal
associations between the stimuli, collectively constituting a complex network
structure. We examined individual differences in the ability to learn network
topology for which stimuli were social versus non-social. Although participants
were able to learn both social and non-social networks, their performance in
social network learning was uncorrelated with their performance in non-social
network learning. Importantly, social traits, including social orientation and
perspective-taking, uniquely predicted the learning of social networks but not
the learning of non-social networks. Taken together, our results suggest that
the process of learning higher-order structure in social networks is
independent from the process of learning higher-order structure in non-social
networks. Our study design provides a promising approach to identify
neurophysiological drivers of social network versus non-social network
learning, extending our knowledge about the impact of individual differences on
these learning processes. Implications for how people learn and adapt to new
social contexts that require integration into a new social network are
discussed.

	<content:encoded>Stress is a major trigger of seizures in people with epilepsy. Exposure to stress results in the release of several stress mediators throughout the brain, including the hippocampus, a region sensitive to stress and prone to seizures. Stress mediators interact with their respective receptors to produce distinct effects on the excitability of hippocampal neurons and networks. Crucially, these stress mediators and their actions exhibit unique spatiotemporal profiles, generating a complex combinatorial output with time- and space-dependent effects on hippocampal network excitability and seizure generation.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Distinct selection mechanisms for when predictions and rewards guide visual selective attention</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/188045v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>How does the brain combine predictions and rewards to guide visual selective attention? Recent findings in humans have implied an additive influence, suggesting distinct sources of bias that act on visual selection (additive-bias hypothesis). Alternately, neuroeconomic evidence suggests that the brain applies an expected-value operation, where the likelihood that a spatial location will become task relevant (spatial-certainty) is multiplied by the reward-value of that location (spatial-value). We sought to arbitrate between these two alternatives, and furthermore, to test whether these conflicting accounts have arisen because both operations are available to the visual-selection system, and their manifestation is context dependent (mixed-operations hypothesis). Over two experiments we tested whether the influence of predictions and reward remained additive, even under conditions that stressed the optimality of an additive operation. Participants completed an endogenous cueing task. Spatial-certainty varied across blocks, and targets appeared in coloured circles that were associated with high or low reward values. In Experiment 1 we tested multiple conditions of spatial-certainty, and more densely sampled high certainty-levels, under the assumption that this would free more resources for the influence of spatial-value, should the two share underlying resources. In Experiment 2, potential reward value was manipulated so that an expected-value operation was objectively more profitable. Across both experiments, the additive-bias hypothesis clearly outperformed the expected-value and mixed-operations hypotheses. These findings refute theories that expected-value computations are the singular mechanism underlying the deployment of endogenous spatial attention. Instead, and even when suboptimal, spatial-certainties and spatial-values are parcellated by the selective attention system.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Sensory stimuli evoke spiking activities patterned across neurons and time that are hypothesized to encode information about their identity. Since the same stimulus can be encountered in a multitude of ways, how stable or flexible are these stimulus-evoked responses? Here, we examined this issue in the locust olfactory system. In the antennal lobe, we found that both spatial and temporal features of odor-evoked responses varied in a stimulus-history dependent manner. The response variations were not random, but allowed the antennal lobe circuit to enhance the uniqueness of the current stimulus. Nevertheless, information about the odorant identity became confounded due to this contrast-enhancement computation. Notably, a linear logical classifier (OR-of-ANDs) that can decode information distributed in flexible subsets of neurons generated predictions that matched results from our behavioral experiments. In sum, our results reveal a simple computational logic for achieving the stability vs. flexibility tradeoff in sensory coding.</content:encoded>

Hence, in monkeys performing a saccade countermanding task to earn larger or smaller fluid rewards, we sampled spiking and synaptic activity simultaneously across all layers of the supplementary eye field (SEF), an agranular cortical area contributing to performance monitoring in nonhuman primate and human studies. Laminar-specific synaptic currents with associated spike rate facilitation and suppression represented error production, reward gain or loss feedback, and reward delivery. The latency, polarity and magnitude of current and spike rate modulation were not predicted by the canonical cortical microcircuit. Pronounced synaptic currents in layer 2/3, which are modulated by loss magnitude, will contribute to the error-related negativity (ERN) and feedback-related negativity (FRN). These unprecedented findings reveal critical features of the cortical microcircuitry supporting performance monitoring and demonstrate that SEF can contribute to the error- and feedback-related negativity.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Allosteric conformational change cascade in cytoplasmic dynein revealed by structure-based molecular simulations</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Shintaroh Kubo, Wenfei Li, Shoji Takada&lt;/p&gt;

Cytoplasmic dynein is a giant ATP-driven molecular motor that proceeds to the minus end of the microtubule (MT). Dynein hydrolyzes ATP in a ring-like structure, containing 6 AAA+ (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) modules, which is ~15 nm away from the MT binding domain (MTBD). This architecture implies that long-distance allosteric couplings exist between the AAA+ ring and the MTBD in order for dynein to move on the MT, although little is known about the mechanisms involved. Here, we have performed comprehensive molecular simulations of the dynein motor domain based on pre- and post- power-stroke structural information and in doing so we address the allosteric conformational changes that occur during the power-stroke and recovery-stroke processes. In the power-stroke process, the N-terminal linker movement was the prerequisite to the nucleotide-dependent AAA1 transition, from which a transition cascade propagated, on average, in a circular manner on the AAA+ ring until it reached the AAA6/C-terminal module. The recovery-stroke process was initiated by the transition of the AAA6/C-terminal, from which the transition cascade split into the two directions of the AAA+ ring, occurring both clockwise and anti-clockwise. In both processes, the MTBD conformational change was regulated by the AAA4 module and the AAA5/Strut module.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Funneled potential and flux landscapes dictate the stabilities of both the states and the flow: Fission yeast cell cycle</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/7uCW9oTiM_A/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaosheng Luo, Liufang Xu, Bo Han, Jin Wang&lt;/p&gt;

Using fission yeast cell cycle as an example, we uncovered that the non-equilibrium network dynamics and global properties are determined by two essential features: the potential landscape and the flux landscape. These two landscapes can be quantified through the decomposition of the dynamics into the detailed balance preserving part and detailed balance breaking non-equilibrium part. While the funneled potential landscape is often crucial for the stability of the single attractor networks, we have uncovered that the funneled flux landscape is crucial for the emergence and maintenance of the stable limit cycle oscillation flow. This provides a new interpretation of the origin for the limit cycle oscillations: There are many cycles and loops existed flowing through the state space and forming the flux landscapes, each cycle with a probability flux going through the loop. The limit cycle emerges when a loop stands out and carries significantly more probability flux than other loops. We explore how robustness ratio (RR) as the gap or steepness versus averaged variations or roughness of the landscape, quantifying the degrees of the funneling of the underlying potential and flux landscapes. We state that these two landscapes complement each other with one crucial for stabilities of states on the cycle and the other crucial for the stability of the flow along the cycle. The flux is directly related to the speed of the cell cycle. This allows us to identify the key factors and structure elements of the networks in determining the stability, speed and robustness of the fission yeast cell cycle oscillations. We see that the non-equilibriumness characterized by the degree of detailed balance breaking from the energy pump quantified by the flux is the cause of the energy dissipation for initiating and sustaining the replications essential for the origin and evolution of life. Regulating the cell cycle speed is crucial for designing the prevention and curing strategy of cancer.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7uCW9oTiM_A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

We investigate methods to vaccinate contact networks—i.e. removing nodes in such a way that disease spreading is hindered as much as possible—with respect to their cost-efficiency. Any real implementation of such protocols would come with costs related both to the vaccination itself, and gathering of information about the network. Disregarding this, we argue, would lead to erroneous evaluation of vaccination protocols. We use the susceptible-infected-recovered model—the generic model for diseases making patients immune upon recovery—as our disease-spreading scenario, and analyze outbreaks on both empirical and model networks. For different relative costs, different protocols dominate. For high vaccination costs and low costs of gathering information, the so-called acquaintance vaccination is the most cost efficient. For other parameter values, protocols designed for query-efficient identification of the network’s largest degrees are most efficient.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qHBfqQHqk_Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Adenylyl cyclase (AC) is an important messenger involved in G-protein-coupled-receptor signal transduction pathways, which is a well-known target for drug development. AC is regulated by activated stimulatory (Gα&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) and inhibitory (Gα&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) G proteins in the cytosol. Although experimental studies have shown that these Gα subunits can stimulate or inhibit AC’s function in a non-competitive way, it is not well understood what the difference is in their mode of action as both Gα subunits appear structurally very similar in a non-lipidated state. However, a significant difference between Gα&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; and Gα&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is that while Gα&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; does not require any lipidation in order to stimulate AC, N-terminal myristoylation is crucial for Gα&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;’s inhibitory function as AC is not inhibited by non-myristoylated Gα&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;. At present, only the conformation of the complex including Gα&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; and AC has been resolved via X-ray crystallography. Therefore, understanding the interaction between Gα&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and AC is important as it will provide more insight into the unknown mechanism of AC regulation. This study demonstrates via classical molecular dynamics simulations that the myristoylated Gα&lt;sub&gt;i1&lt;/sub&gt; structure is able to interact with apo adenylyl cyclase type 5 in a way that causes inhibition of the catalytic function of the enzyme, suggesting that Gα lipidation could play a crucial role in AC regulation and in regulating G protein function by affecting Gα&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;’s active conformation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/BpoioK4eFoA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Bicycling suppresses abnormal beta synchrony in the Parkinsonian basal ganglia</title>

&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freezing of gait is a poorly understood symptom of Parkinson's disease, and can severely disrupt the locomotion of affected patients. However, bicycling ability remains surprisingly unaffected in most patients suffering from freezing suggesting functional differences in the motor network. The purpose of this study was to characterize and contrast the oscillatory dynamics underlying bicycling and walking in the basal ganglia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We present the first local field potential recordings directly comparing bicycling and walking in Parkinson's disease patients with electrodes implanted in the subthalamic nuclei for deep brain stimulation. Low (13-22 Hz) and high (23-35 Hz) beta power changes were analyzed in 22 subthalamic nuclei from 13 Parkinson's disease patients (57.5 +/- 5.9 years, four female). The study group consisted of five patients with and eight patients without freezing of gait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In patients without freezing of gait, both bicycling and walking led to a suppression of subthalamic beta power (13-35 Hz), and this suppression was stronger for bicycling. Freezers showed a similar pattern in general. Superimposed on this pattern, however, we observed a movement-induced, narrowband power increase around 18 Hz, which was evident even in the absence of freezing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results indicate that bicycling facilitates overall suppression of beta power. Furthermore, movement leads to exaggerated synchronization in the low beta band specifically within the basal ganglia of patients susceptible to freezing. Abnormal ∼18 Hz oscillations are implicated in the pathophysiology of freezing of gait, and suppressing them may form a key strategy in developing potential therapies.

&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We here aimed at characterizing heart-brain interactions in patients with disorders of consciousness. We tested how this information impacts data-driven classification between unresponsive and minimally conscious patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cohort of 127 patients in vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (VS/UWS, n=70) and minimally conscious state (MCS, n=57) were presented with the ‘Local-Global' auditory oddball paradigm, which distinguishes two levels of processing: short-term deviation of local auditory regularities and global long-term rule violations. In addition to previously validated markers of consciousness extracted from electroencephalograms (EEG), we computed autonomic cardiac markers, such as heart rate and variability (HR, HRV), and cardiac cycle phase-shifts triggered by the processing of the auditory stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;HR and HRV were similar in patients across groups. The cardiac cycle was not sensitive to the processing of local regularities in either the VS/UWS or MCS patients. In contrast, global regularities induced a phase-shift of the cardiac cycle exclusively in the MCS group. The interval between the auditory stimulation and the following R-peak was significantly shortened in MCS when the auditory rule was violated. When the information of the cardiac cycle modulations and other consciousness-related EEG markers were combined, single-patient classification performance was enhanced compared to classification with solely EEG markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Mutations of KIF14 Cause Primary Microcephaly by Impairing Cytokinesis</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25044</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH) is a rare condition characterized by a reduced cerebral cortex accompanied with intellectual disability. Mutations in 17 genes have been shown to cause this phenotype. Recently, mutations in &lt;em&gt;CIT,&lt;/em&gt; encoding CRIK (&lt;b&gt;Citron Rho-interacting kinase) —&lt;/b&gt; a component of the central spindle matrix, were added. We aimed at identifying novel MCPH-associated genes and exploring their functional role in pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Linkage analysis and whole-exome sequencing were performed in consanguineous and nonconsanguineous MCPH families to identify disease-causing variants. Functional consequences were investigated by RNA studies and on cellular level using immunofluorescence and microscopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: We identified homozygous mutations in &lt;em&gt;KIF14&lt;/em&gt; (NM_014875.2;c.263T&amp;gt;A;pLeu88*, c.2480_2482delTTG;p.Val827del and c.4071G&amp;gt;A;p.Gln1357=) as the likely cause in three MCPH families. Further, in a patient presenting with a severe form of primary microcephaly and short stature, we identified compound heterozygous missense mutations in &lt;em&gt;KIF14&lt;/em&gt; (NM_014875.2;c.2545C&amp;gt;G;p.His849Asp and c.3662G&amp;gt;T;p.Gly1221Val). Three of the five identified mutations impaired splicing and two resulted in a truncated protein. Intriguingly, &lt;em&gt;Kif14&lt;/em&gt; knockout mice also showed primary microcephaly. Human k&lt;b&gt;inesin-like protein&lt;/b&gt; KIF14, a microtubule motor protein, localizes at the midbody to finalize cytokinesis by interacting with CRIK. We found impaired localization of both KIF14 and CRIK at the midbody in patient-derived fibroblasts. Further, we observed a large number of binucleated and apoptotic cells — signs of failed cytokinesis that we also observed in experimentally KIF14-depleted cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Our data corroborate the role of an impaired cytokinesis for the etiology of primary and syndromic microcephaly as has been proposed by recent findings on &lt;em&gt;CIT&lt;/em&gt; mutations.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Deconstructing normal pressure hydrocephalus: Ventriculomegaly as early sign of neurodegeneration</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25046</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) remains both over-suspected on clinical grounds and under-confirmed when based on immediate and sustained response to cerebrospinal fluid diversion. Poor long-term post-shunt benefits and findings of neurodegenerative pathology in most patients with adequate follow up suggests that hydrocephalic disorders appearing in late adulthood may often result from initially unapparent parenchymal abnormalities. We critically review the NPH literature, highlighting the near universal lack of blinding and controls, the absence of specific clinical, imaging, or pathologic features, and the ongoing dependence for diagnostic confirmation on variable cutoffs of gait response to bedside fluid-drainage testing. We also summarize our long-term institutional experience, in which post-shunt benefits in patients with initial diagnosis of idiopathic NPH persist in only 32% of patients at 36 months, with known revised diagnosis in over 25% (Alzheimer disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and progressive supranuclear palsy). We postulate that previously reported NPH cases with “dual” pathology (i.e., developing a “second” disorder) more likely represent ventriculomegalic presentations of selected neurodegenerative disorders in which benefits from shunting may be short-lived, with a consequently unfavorable risk-benefit ratio.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Brexanolone as adjunctive therapy in super-refractory status epilepticus</title>

We conducted a multicenter, phase 1/2 study in SRSE patients to evaluate the safety and tolerability of brexanolone (USAN; formerly SAGE-547 Injection), a proprietary, aqueous formulation of the neuroactive steroid, allopregnanolone. Secondary objectives included pharmacokinetic assessment and open-label evaluation of brexanolone response during and after anesthetic third-line agent (TLA) weaning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25008-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients receiving TLAs for SRSE control were eligible for open-label, 1-hour brexanolone loading infusions, followed by maintenance infusion. After 48 hours of brexanolone infusion, TLAs were weaned during brexanolone maintenance. After 4 days, the brexanolone dose was tapered. Safety and functional status were assessed over 3 weeks of follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25008-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-five patients received open-label study drug. No serious adverse events (SAEs) were attributable to study drug, as determined by the Safety Review Committee. Sixteen patients (64%) experienced ≥1 SAE. Six patient deaths occurred, all deemed related to underlying medical conditions. Twenty-two patients underwent ≥1 TLA wean attempt. Seventeen (77%) met the response endpoint of weaning successfully off TLAs before tapering brexanolone. Sixteen (73%) were successfully weaned off TLAs within 5 days of initiating brexanolone infusion without anesthetic agent reinstatement in the following 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25008-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an open-label cohort of limited size, brexanolone demonstrated tolerability among SRSE patients of heterogeneous etiologies and was associated with a high rate of successful TLA weaning. The results suggest the possible development of brexanolone as an adjunctive therapy for SRSE requiring pharmacological coma for seizure control.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this work, we study the dynamic range in a neuronal network modelled by
cellular automaton. We consider deterministic and non-deterministic rules to
simulate electrical and chemical synapses. Chemical synapses have an intrinsic
time-delay and are susceptible to parameter variations guided by learning
Hebbian rules of behaviour. Our results show that chemical synapses can
abruptly enhance sensibility of the neural network, a manifestation that can
become even more predominant if learning rules of evolution are applied to the
chemical synapses.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02684</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The ability to rapidly identify symmetry and anti-symmetry is an essential
attribute of intelligence. Symmetry perception is a central process in human
vision and may be key to human 3D visualization. While previous work in
understanding neuron symmetry perception has concentrated on the neuron as an
integrator, here we show how the coincidence detecting property of the spiking
neuron can be used to reveal symmetry density in spatial data. We develop a
method for synchronizing symmetry-identifying spiking artificial neural
networks to enable layering and feedback in the network. We show a method for
building a network capable of identifying symmetry density between sets of data
and present a digital logic implementation demonstrating an 8x8
leaky-integrate-and-fire symmetry detector in a field programmable gate array.
Our results show that the efficiencies of spiking neural networks can be
harnessed to rapidly identify symmetry in spatial data with applications in
image processing, 3D computer vision, and robotics.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02470</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This document presents the material of two lectures on statistical physics
and neural representations, delivered by one of us (R.M.) at the Fundamental
Problems in Statistical Physics XIV summer school in July 2017. In a first
part, we consider the neural representations of space (maps) in the
hippocampus. We introduce an extension of the Hopfield model, able to store
multiple spatial maps as continuous, finite-dimensional attractors. The phase
diagram and dynamical properties of the model are analyzed. We then show how
spatial representations can be dynamically decoded using an effective Ising
model capturing the correlation structure in the neural data, and compare
applications to data obtained from hippocampal multi-electrode recordings and
by (sub)sampling our attractor model. In a second part, we focus on the problem
of learning data representations in machine learning, in particular with
artificial neural networks. We start by introducing data representations
through some illustrations. We then analyze two important algorithms, Principal
Component Analysis and Restricted Boltzmann Machines, with tools from
statistical physics.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Fractional cable equation for general geometry, a model of axons with swellings and anomalous diffusion. (arXiv:1709.02443v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02443</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Different experimental studies have reported anomalous diffusion in brain
tissues and notably this anomalous diffusion is expressed through fractional
derivatives. Axons are important to understand neurodegenerative diseases such
as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Indeed,
abnormal accumulation of proteins and organelles in axons is a hallmark feature
of these diseases. The diffusion in the axons can become to anomalous as a
result from this abnormality. In this case the voltage propagation in axons is
affected. Another hallmark feature of different neurodegenerative diseases is
given by discrete swellings along the axon. In order to model the voltage
propagation in axons with anomalous diffusion and swellings, in this paper we
propose a fractional cable equation for general geometry. This generalized
equation depends on fractional parameters and geometric quantities such as the
curvature and torsion of the cable. For a cable with a constant radius we show
that the voltage decreases when the fractional effect increases. In cables with
swellings we find that when the fractional effect or the swelling radius
increase, the voltage decreases. A similar behavior is obtained when the number
of swellings and the fractional effect increase. Moreover, we find that when
the radius swelling (or the number of swellings) and the fractional effect
increase at the same time, the voltage dramatically decreases.

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Cell-specific gain modulation by synaptically released zinc in cortical circuits of audition</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/29893</link>
	<content:encoded>In many excitatory synapses, mobile zinc is found within glutamatergic vesicles and is coreleased with glutamate. &lt;i&gt;Ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies established that synaptically released (synaptic) zinc inhibits excitatory neurotransmission at lower frequencies of synaptic activity but enhances steady state synaptic responses during higher frequencies of activity. However, it remains unknown how synaptic zinc affects neuronal processing &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we imaged the sound-evoked neuronal activity of the primary auditory cortex in awake mice. We discovered that synaptic zinc enhanced the gain of sound-evoked responses in CaMKII-expressing principal neurons, but it reduced the gain of parvalbumin- and somatostatin-expressing interneurons. This modulation was sound intensity-dependent and, in part, NMDA receptor-independent. By establishing a previously unknown link between synaptic zinc and gain control of auditory cortical processing, our findings advance understanding about cortical synaptic mechanisms and create a new framework for approaching and interpreting the role of the auditory cortex in sound processing.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/29820</link>
	<content:encoded>The Zika virus has emerged as a global public health concern. Its rapid geographic expansion is attributed to the success of &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; mosquito vectors, but local epidemiological drivers are still poorly understood. Feira de Santana played a pivotal role in the Chikungunya epidemic in Brazil and was one of the first urban centres to report Zika infections. Using a climate-driven transmission model and notified Zika case data, we show that a low observation rate and high vectorial capacity translated into a significant attack rate during the 2015 outbreak, with a subsequent decline in 2016 and fade-out in 2017 due to herd-immunity. We find a potential Zika-related, low risk for microcephaly per pregnancy, but with significant public health impact given high attack rates. The balance between the loss of herd-immunity and viral re-importation will dictate future transmission potential of in this urban setting.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Simultaneous activation of parallel sensory pathways promotes a grooming sequence in Drosophila</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/28804</link>
	<content:encoded>A central model that describes how behavioral sequences are produced features a neural architecture that readies different movements simultaneously, and a mechanism where prioritized suppression between the movements determines their sequential performance. We previously described a model whereby suppression drives a &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; grooming sequence that is induced by simultaneous activation of different sensory pathways that each elicit a distinct movement (Seeds et al. 2014). Here, we confirm this model using transgenic expression to identify and optogenetically activate sensory neurons that elicit specific grooming movements. Simultaneous activation of different sensory pathways elicits a grooming sequence that resembles the naturally induced sequence. Moreover, the sequence proceeds after the sensory excitation is terminated, indicating that a persistent trace of this excitation induces the next grooming movement once the previous one is performed. This reveals a mechanism whereby parallel sensory inputs can be integrated and stored to elicit a delayed and sequential grooming response.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Damage to corticospinal fibers in the cervical spinal cord is known to impair dexterous hand movements. However, accumulating evidence has shown that precision grip can recover considerably through rehabilitative training. Recent multidisciplinary studies have revealed that, at the spinal level, this recovery is possible due to an indirect neural pathway through propriospinal neurons (PNs), which relay cortical commands to hand motoneurons. Although this indirect spinal pathway is heavily involved in recovery, its role is dwarfed by a simultaneous large-scale network reorganization spanning motor-related cortices and mesolimbic structures.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Mobility can promote the evolution of cooperation via emergent self-assortment dynamics</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/jZzpQOEMUtY/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Jaideep Joshi, Iain D Couzin, Simon A Levin, Vishwesha Guttal&lt;/p&gt;

The evolution of costly cooperation, where cooperators pay a personal cost to benefit others, requires that cooperators interact more frequently with other cooperators. This condition, called positive assortment, is known to occur in spatially-structured viscous populations, where individuals typically have low mobility and limited dispersal. However many social organisms across taxa, from cells and bacteria, to birds, fish and ungulates, are mobile, and live in populations with considerable inter-group mixing. In the absence of information regarding others’ traits or conditional strategies, such mixing may inhibit assortment and limit the potential for cooperation to evolve. Here we employ spatially-explicit individual-based evolutionary simulations to incorporate costs and benefits of two coevolving costly traits: cooperative and local cohesive tendencies. We demonstrate that, despite possessing no information about others’ traits or payoffs, mobility (via self-propulsion or environmental forcing) facilitates assortment of cooperators via a dynamically evolving difference in the cohesive tendencies of cooperators and defectors. We show analytically that this assortment can also be viewed in a multilevel selection framework, where selection for cooperation among emergent groups can overcome selection against cooperators within the groups. As a result of these dynamics, we find an oscillatory pattern of cooperation and defection that maintains cooperation even in the absence of well known mechanisms such as kin interactions, reciprocity, local dispersal or conditional strategies that require information on others’ strategies or payoffs. Our results offer insights into differential adhesion based mechanisms for positive assortment and reveal the possibility of cooperative aggregations in dynamic fission-fusion populations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jZzpQOEMUtY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Population FBA predicts metabolic phenotypes in yeast</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/-Ch-pmMQQWc/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Piyush Labhsetwar, Marcelo C. R. Melo, John A. Cole, Zaida Luthey-Schulten&lt;/p&gt;

Using protein counts sampled from single cell proteomics distributions to constrain fluxes through a genome-scale model of metabolism, Population flux balance analysis (Population FBA) successfully described metabolic heterogeneity in a population of independent &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; cells growing in a defined medium. We extend the methodology to account for correlations in protein expression arising from the co-regulation of genes and apply it to study the growth of independent &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; cells in two different growth media. We find the partitioning of flux between fermentation and respiration predicted by our model agrees with recent &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C fluxomics experiments, and that our model largely recovers the Crabtree effect (the experimentally known bias among certain yeast species toward fermentation with the production of ethanol even in the presence of oxygen), while FBA without proteomics constraints predicts respirative metabolism almost exclusively. The comparisons to the &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C study showed improvement upon inclusion of the correlations and motivated a technique to systematically identify inconsistent kinetic parameters in the literature. The minor secretion fluxes for glycerol and acetate are underestimated by our method, which indicate a need for further refinements to the metabolic model. For yeast cells grown in synthetic defined (SD) medium, the calculated broad distribution of growth rates matches experimental observations from single cell studies, and we characterize several metabolic phenotypes within our modeled populations that make use of diverse pathways. Fast growing yeast cells are predicted to perform significant amount of respiration, use serine-glycine cycle and produce ethanol in mitochondria as opposed to slow growing cells. We use a genetic algorithm to determine the proteomics constraints necessary to reproduce the growth rate distributions seen experimentally. We find that a core set of 51 constraints are essential but that additional constraints are still necessary to recover the observed growth rate distribution in SD medium.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-Ch-pmMQQWc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

AVM smooth muscle cells (AVMSMCs) were isolated and identified by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, and candidate miRNAs were then tested in these cells. Migration, tube formation, and CCK-8–induced proliferation assays were used to test the effect of the miRNAs on phenotypic properties of AVMSMCs. A quantitative proteomics approach was used to identify protein expression changes in AVMSMCs treated with miRNA mimics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Among these miRNAs, miR-137 and miR-195* levels were significantly decreased in AVMs and constituent AVMSMCs. Experimentally elevating the level of these microRNAs inhibited AVMSMC migration, tube formation, and survival in vitro and the formation of vascular rings in vivo. Proteomics showed the protein expression signature of AVMSMCs and identified downstream proteins regulated by miR-137 and miR-195* that were key signaling proteins involved in vessel development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Brain structural connectivity atrophy in Alzheimer's disease. (arXiv:1709.02369v2 [physics.med-ph] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02369</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Analysis and quantification of brain structural changes, using Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), are increasingly used to define novel biomarkers of
brain pathologies, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Network-based models of
the brain have shown that both local and global topological properties can
reveal patterns of disease propagation. On the other hand, intra-subject
descriptions cannot exploit the whole information context, accessible through
inter-subject comparisons. To address this, we developed a novel approach,
which models brain structural connectivity atrophy with a multiplex network and
summarizes it within a classification score. On an independent dataset
multiplex networks were able to correctly segregate, from normal controls (NC),
AD patients and subjects with mild cognitive impairment that will convert to AD
(cMCI) with an accuracy of, respectively, $0.86 \pm 0.01$ and $0.84 \pm 0.01$.
The model also shows that illness effects are maximally detected by parceling
the brain in equal volumes of $3000$ $mm^3$ (&quot;patches&quot;), without any $a$
$priori$ segmentation based on anatomical features. A direct comparison to
standard voxel-based morphometry on the same dataset showed that the multiplex
network approach had higher sensitivity. This method is general and can have
twofold potential applications: providing a reliable tool for clinical trials
and a disease signature of neurodegenerative pathologies.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02341</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This work combines the free energy principle from cognitive neuroscience and
the ensuing active inference dynamics with recent advances in variational
inference on deep generative models and evolution strategies as efficient
large-scale black-box optimisation technique, to introduce the &quot;deep active
inference&quot; agent. This agent tries to minimize a variational free energy bound
on the average surprise of its sensations, which is motivated by a homeostatic
argument. It does so by changing the parameters of its generative model,
together with a variational density approximating the posterior distribution
over latent variables, given its observations, and by acting on its environment
to actively sample input that is likely under its generative model. The
internal dynamics of the agent are implemented using deep neural networks, as
used in machine learning, and recurrent dynamics, making the deep active
inference agent a scalable and very flexible class of active inference agents.
Using the mountaincar problem, we show how goal-directed behaviour can be
implemented by defining sensible prior expectations on the latent states in the
agent's model, that it will try to fulfil. Furthermore, we show that the deep
active inference agent can learn a generative model of the environment, which
can be sampled from to understand the agent's beliefs about the environment and
its interaction with it.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The field of neuroscience is facing an unprecedented expanse in the volume
and diversity of available data. Traditionally, network models have provided
key insights into the structure and function of the brain. With the advent of
big data in neuroscience, both more sophisticated models capable of
characterizing the increasing complexity of the data and novel methods of
quantitative analysis are needed. Recently multilayer networks, a mathematical
extension of traditional networks, have gained increasing popularity in
neuroscience due to their ability to capture the full information of
multi-model, multi-scale, spatiotemporal data sets. Here, we review multilayer
networks and their applications in neuroscience, showing how incorporating the
multilayer framework into network neuroscience analysis has uncovered
previously hidden features of brain networks. We specifically highlight the use
of multilayer networks to model disease, structure-function relationships,
network evolution, and link multi-scale data. Finally, we close with a
discussion of promising new directions of multilayer network neuroscience
research and propose a modified definition of multilayer networks designed to
unite and clarify the use of the multilayer formalism in describing real-world
systems.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02323</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hierarchies feature prominently in anatomical accounts of cortical
organisation. An open question is which computational (algorithmic) processes
are implemented by these hierarchies. One renowned hypothesis is that cortical
hierarchies implement a model of the world's causal structure and serve to
infer environmental states from sensory inputs. This view, which casts
perception as hierarchical Bayesian inference, has become a highly influential
concept in both basic and clinical neuroscience. So far, however, a direct
correspondence between the predicted order of hierarchical Bayesian
computations and the sequence of evoked neuronal activity has not been
demonstrated. Here, we present evidence for this correspondence from
neuroimaging and electrophysiological data in healthy volunteers. Trial-wise
sequences of hierarchical computations were inferred from participants'
behaviour during a social learning task that required multi-level inference
about intentions. We found that the temporal sequence of neuronal activity
matched the order of computations as predicted by the theory. These findings
provide strong evidence for the operation of hierarchical Bayesian inference in
human cortex. Furthermore, our approach offers a novel strategy for the
combined computational-physiological phenotyping of patients with disorders of
perception, such as schizophrenia or autism.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02008</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many organisms can remember locations they have previously visited during a
search. Visual search experiments have shown exploration is guided away from
these locations, reducing the overlap of the search path before finding a
hidden target. We develop and analyze a two-layer neural field model that
encodes positional information during a search task. A position-encoding layer
sustains a bump attractor corresponding to the searching agent's current
location, and search is modeled by velocity input that propagates the bump. A
memory layer sustains persistent activity bounded by a wave front, whose edges
expand in response to excitatory input from the position layer. Search can then
be biased in response to remembered locations, influencing velocity inputs to
the position layer. Asymptotic techniques are used to reduce the dynamics of
our model to a low-dimensional system of equations that track the bump position
and front boundary. Performance is compared for different target-finding tasks.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/27702</link>
	<content:encoded>Addressing how neural circuits underlie behavior is routinely done by measuring electrical activity from single neurons in experimental sessions. While such recordings yield snapshots of neural dynamics during specified tasks, they are ill-suited for tracking single-unit activity over longer timescales relevant for most developmental and learning processes, or for capturing neural dynamics across different behavioral states. Here we describe an automated platform for continuous long-term recordings of neural activity and behavior in freely moving rodents. An unsupervised algorithm identifies and tracks the activity of single units over weeks of recording, dramatically simplifying the analysis of large datasets. Months-long recordings from motor cortex and striatum made and analyzed with our system revealed remarkable stability in basic neuronal properties, such as firing rates and inter-spike interval distributions. Interneuronal correlations and the representation of different movements and behaviors were similarly stable. This establishes the feasibility of high-throughput long-term extracellular recordings in behaving animals.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/27402</link>
	<content:encoded>We have identified the plant biflavonoid hinokiflavone as an inhibitor of splicing &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and modulator of alternative splicing in cells. Chemical synthesis confirms hinokiflavone is the active molecule. Hinokiflavone inhibits splicing&lt;i&gt; in vitro&lt;/i&gt; by blocking spliceosome assembly, leading to accumulation of the A complex. Cells treated with hinokiflavone show altered subnuclear organization specifically of splicing factors required for A complex formation, which relocalize together with SUMO1 and SUMO2 into enlarged nuclear speckles. Hinokiflavone increases protein SUMOylation levels, both in &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; splicing reactions and in cells. Hinokiflavone also inhibited a purified, &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; expressed SUMO protease, SENP1, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, indicating the increase in SUMOylated proteins results primarily from inhibition of de-SUMOylation. Using a quantitative proteomics assay we identified many SUMO2 sites whose levels increased in cells following hinokiflavone treatment, with the major targets including 6 proteins that are components of the U2 snRNP and required for A complex formation.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/26509</link>
	<content:encoded>Wnt5a-Ror signaling constitutes a developmental pathway crucial for embryonic tissue morphogenesis, reproduction and adult tissue regeneration, yet the molecular mechanisms by which the Wnt5a-Ror pathway mediates these processes are largely unknown. Using a proteomic screen, we identify the kinesin superfamily protein Kif26b as a downstream target of the Wnt5a-Ror pathway. Wnt5a-Ror, through a process independent of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin-dependent pathway, regulates the cellular stability of Kif26b by inducing its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Through this mechanism, Kif26b modulates the migratory behavior of cultured mesenchymal cells in a Wnt5a-dependent manner. Genetic perturbation of Kif26b function in vivo caused embryonic axis malformations and depletion of primordial germ cells in the developing gonad, two phenotypes characteristic of disrupted Wnt5a-Ror signaling. These findings indicate that Kif26b links Wnt5a-Ror signaling to the control of morphogenetic cell and tissue behaviors in vertebrates and reveal a new role for regulated proteolysis in noncanonical Wnt5a-Ror signal transduction.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Phenomics, which ideally involves in-depth phenotyping at the whole-organism scale, may enhance our functional understanding of genetic variation. Here, we demonstrate methods to profile hundreds of phenotypic measures comprised of morphological and densitometric traits at a large number of sites within the axial skeleton of adult zebrafish. We show the potential for vertebral patterns to confer heightened sensitivity, with similar specificity, in discriminating mutant populations compared to analyzing individual vertebrae in isolation. We identify phenotypes associated with human brittle bone disease and thyroid stimulating hormone receptor hyperactivity. Finally, we develop allometric models and show their potential to aid in the discrimination of mutant phenotypes masked by alterations in growth. Our studies demonstrate virtues of deep phenotyping in a spatially distributed organ system. Analyzing phenotypic patterns may increase productivity in genetic screens, and facilitate the study of genetic variants associated with smaller effect sizes, such as those that underlie complex diseases.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Commissural axons switch on responsiveness to Wnt attraction during midline crossing to turn anteriorly after exiting the floor plate. We report here Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) downregulates Shisa2, which inhibits glycosylation and cell surface presentation of Frizzled3 in rodent commissural axon growth cones. Constitutive Shisa2 expression causes randomized turning of post-crossing commissural axons along the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis. Loss of Shisa2 lead to precocious anterior turning of commissural axons before or during midline crossing. Post-crossing commissural axon turning is completely randomized along the A-P axis when &lt;i&gt;Wntless&lt;/i&gt;, essential for Wnt secretion, is conditionally knocked out in the floor plate.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/24502</link>
	<content:encoded>Genetic analysis has revealed that the dual specificity protein kinase DYRK1A has multiple roles in the development of the central nervous system. Increased &lt;i&gt;DYRK1A&lt;/i&gt; gene dosage, such as occurs in Down syndrome, affects neural progenitor cell differentiation, while haploinsufficiency of &lt;i&gt;DYRK1A&lt;/i&gt; is associated with severe microcephaly. Using a set of known and newly synthesized DYRK1A inhibitors, along with CRISPR-mediated gene activation and shRNA knockdown of &lt;i&gt;DYRK1A&lt;/i&gt;, we show that chemical inhibition or genetic knockdown of &lt;i&gt;DYRK1A&lt;/i&gt; interferes with neural specification of human pluripotent stem cells, a process equating to the earliest stage of human brain development. DYRK1A inhibition insulates the self-renewing subpopulation of human pluripotent stem cells from powerful signals that drive neural induction. Our results suggest a novel mechanism for the disruptive effects of loss of &lt;i&gt;DYRK1A&lt;/i&gt; during early mammalian development, and reveal a requirement for &lt;i&gt;DYRK1A&lt;/i&gt; in the acquisition of competence for differentiation in human pluripotent stem cells.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/24260</link>
	<content:encoded>Meta-analyses are increasingly used for synthesis of evidence, and often include an assessment of publication bias based on detection of asymmetry in funnel plots. We studied the influence of different normalisation approaches, sample size and intervention effects on funnel plot asymmetry, using empirical datasets and illustrative simulations. We found that funnel plots of the Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) plotted against the standard error (SE) are susceptible to distortion, leading to overestimation of the existence and extent of publication bias. Distortion was more severe when the primary studies had a small sample size and when an intervention effect was present. We show that using the Normalised Mean Difference (when possible), or plotting the SMD against a sample size-based precision estimate, are more reliable alternatives. We conclude that funnel plots using the SMD in combination with the SE are unsuitable for publication bias assessments and can lead to false-positive results.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Tool use has allowed humans to become one of the most successful species. However, tool-assisted foraging has also pushed many of our prey species to extinction or endangerment, a technology-driven process thought to be uniquely human. Here, we demonstrate that tool-assisted foraging on shellfish by long-tailed macaques (&lt;i&gt;Macaca fascicularis&lt;/i&gt;) in Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park, Thailand, reduces prey size and prey abundance, with more pronounced effects where the macaque population size is larger. We compared availability, sizes and maturation stages of shellfish between two adjacent islands inhabited by different-sized macaque populations and demonstrate potential effects on the prey reproductive biology. We provide evidence that once technological macaques reach a large enough group size, they enter a feedback loop – driving shellfish prey size down with attendant changes in the tool sizes used by the monkeys. If this pattern continues, prey populations could be reduced to a point where tool-assisted foraging is no longer beneficial to the macaques, which in return may lessen or extinguish the remarkable foraging technology employed by these primates.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Two passive mechanical conditions modulate power generation by the outer hair cells</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/0NEUBF5ry7U/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Yanju Liu, Sheryl M. Gracewski, Jong-Hoon Nam&lt;/p&gt;

In the mammalian cochlea, small vibrations of the sensory epithelium are amplified due to active electro-mechanical feedback of the outer hair cells. The level of amplification is greater in the base than in the apex of the cochlea. Theoretical studies have used longitudinally varying active feedback properties to reproduce the location-dependent amplification. The active feedback force has been considered to be proportional to the basilar membrane displacement or velocity. An underlying assumption was that organ of Corti mechanics are governed by rigid body kinematics. However, recent progress in vibration measurement techniques reveals that organ of Corti mechanics are too complicated to be fully represented with rigid body kinematics. In this study, two components of the active feedback are considered explicitly—organ of Corti mechanics, and outer hair cell electro-mechanics. Physiological properties for the outer hair cells were incorporated, such as the active force gain, mechano-transduction properties, and membrane RC time constant. Instead of a kinematical model, a fully deformable 3D finite element model was used. We show that the organ of Corti mechanics dictate the longitudinal trend of cochlear amplification. Specifically, our results suggest that two mechanical conditions are responsible for location-dependent cochlear amplification. First, the phase of the outer hair cell’s somatic force with respect to its elongation rate varies along the cochlear length. Second, the local stiffness of the organ of Corti complex felt by individual outer hair cells varies along the cochlear length. We describe how these two mechanical conditions result in greater amplification toward the base of the cochlea.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0NEUBF5ry7U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/30286</link>
	<content:encoded>Neurotransmitter release depends on the SNARE complex formed by syntaxin-1, synaptobrevin and SNAP-25, as well as on complexins, which bind to the SNARE complex and play active and inhibitory roles. A crystal structure of a Complexin-I fragment bearing a so-called 'superclamp' mutation bound to a truncated SNARE complex lacking the C-terminus of the synaptobrevin SNARE motif (SNAREΔ60) suggested that an 'accessory' α-helix of Complexin-I inhibits release by inserting into the C-terminus of the SNARE complex. Previously, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments performed in different laboratories yielded apparently discrepant results in support or against the existence of such binding mode in solution (Trimbuch et al., 2014; Krishnakumar et al., 2015). Here, ITC experiments performed to solve these discrepancies now show that the region containing the Complexin-I accessory helix and preceding N-terminal sequences does interact with SNAREΔ60, but the interaction requires the polybasic juxtamembrane region of syntaxin-1 and is not affected by the superclamp mutation within the experimental error of these experiments.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Dual function of the PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 axis in myelination of the peripheral nervous system</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/29241</link>
	<content:encoded>Myelination is a biosynthetically demanding process in which mTORC1, the gatekeeper of anabolism, occupies a privileged regulatory position. We have shown previously that loss of mTORC1 function in Schwann cells (SCs) hampers myelination. Here, we genetically disrupted key inhibitory components upstream of mTORC1, TSC1 or PTEN, in mouse SC development, adult homeostasis, and nerve injury. Surprisingly, the resulting mTORC1 hyperactivity led to markedly delayed onset of both developmental myelination and remyelination after injury. However, if mTORC1 was hyperactivated after myelination onset, radial hypermyelination was observed. At early developmental stages, physiologically high PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 signaling suppresses expression of Krox20 (Egr2), the master regulator of PNS myelination. This effect is mediated by S6K and contributes to control mechanisms that keep SCs in a not-fully differentiated state to ensure proper timing of myelination initiation. An ensuing decline in mTORC1 activity is crucial to allow myelination to start, while remaining mTORC1 activity drives myelin growth.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/29218</link>
	<content:encoded>Methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR), found in strictly anaerobic methanogenic and methanotrophic archaea, catalyzes the reversible production and consumption of the potent greenhouse gas methane. The α subunit of MCR (McrA) contains several unusual post-translational modifications, including a rare thioamidation of glycine. Based on the presumed function of homologous genes involved in the biosynthesis of thioviridamide, a thioamide-containing natural product, we hypothesized that the archaeal &lt;i&gt;tfuA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ycaO&lt;/i&gt; genes would be responsible for post-translational installation of thioglycine into McrA. Mass spectrometric characterization of McrA from the methanogenic archaeon &lt;i&gt;Methanosarcina acetivorans&lt;/i&gt; lacking &lt;i&gt;tfuA&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;i&gt;/&lt;/i&gt;or &lt;i&gt;ycaO&lt;/i&gt; revealed the presence of glycine, rather than thioglycine, supporting this hypothesis. Phenotypic characterization of the ∆&lt;i&gt;ycaO-tfuA&lt;/i&gt; mutant revealed a severe growth rate defect on substrates with low free energy yields and at elevated temperatures (39°C - 45°C). Our analyses support a role for thioglycine in stabilizing the protein secondary structure near the active site.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: The physical dimensions of amyloid aggregates control their infective potential as prion particles</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/27109</link>
	<content:encoded>Transmissible amyloid particles called prions are associated with infectious prion diseases in mammals and inherited phenotypes in yeast. All amyloid aggregates can give rise to potentially infectious seeds that accelerate their growth. Why some amyloid seeds are highly infectious prion particles while others are less infectious or even inert, is currently not understood. To address this question, we analyzed the suprastructure and dimensions of synthetic amyloid fibrils assembled from the yeast (&lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;) prion protein Sup35NM. We then quantified the ability of these particles to induce the [&lt;i&gt;PSI&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;] prion phenotype in cells. Our results show a striking relationship between the length distribution of the amyloid fibrils and their ability to induce the heritable [&lt;i&gt;PSI&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;] prion phenotype. Using a simple particle size threshold model to describe transfection activity, we explain how dimensions of amyloid fibrils are able to modulate their infectious potential as prions.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Fundamental bound on the persistence and capacity of short-term memory stored as graded persistent activity</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/22225</link>
	<content:encoded>It is widely believed that persistent neural activity underlies short-term memory. Yet, as we show, temporal degradation in such networks behaves differently from human short-term memory performance. We build a more general framework where the memory is viewed as a problem of passing information through noisy channels that represent analog persistent activity networks. Rather than directly storing information, such memory networks might hold information encoded to achieve robustness against noise. We derive a fundamental lower-bound on memory recall precision, which declines with storage duration and number of stored items. We show that human performance, though inconsistent with models involving direct (uncoded) storage in persistent activity networks, can be well-fit by the theoretical bound. This finding is consistent with the view that if the brain stores information in patterns of persistent activity, it might use codes that minimize the effects of noise, motivating the search for such codes in the brain.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01437</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sensory processing is hard because the variables of interest are encoded in
spike trains in a relatively complex way. A major goal in sensory processing is
to understand how the brain extracts those variables. Here we revisit a common
encoding model in which variables are encoded linearly. Although there are
typically more variables than neurons, this problem is still solvable because
only a small number of variables appear at any one time (sparse prior).
However, previous solutions usually require all-to-all connectivity,
inconsistent with the sparse connectivity seen in the brain. Here we propose a
principled algorithm that provably reaches the MAP inference solution but using
sparse connectivity. Our algorithm is inspired by the mouse olfactory bulb, but
our approach is general enough to apply to other modalities; in addition, it
should be possible to extend it to nonlinear encoding models.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01116</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We investigated the possibility of using a machine-learning scheme in
conjunction with commercial wearable EEG-devices for translating listener's
subjective experience of music into scores that can be used in popular
on-demand music streaming services. Our study resulted into two variants,
differing in terms of performance and execution time, and hence, subserving
distinct applications in online streaming music platforms. The first method,
NeuroPicks, is extremely accurate but slower. It is based on the
well-established neuroscientific concepts of brainwave frequency bands,
activation asymmetry index and cross frequency coupling (CFC). The second
method, NeuroPicksVQ, offers prompt predictions of lower credibility and relies
on a custom-built version of vector quantization procedure that facilitates a
novel parameterization of the music-modulated brainwaves. Beyond the feature
engineering step, both methods exploit the inherent efficiency of extreme
learning machines (ELMs) so as to translate, in a personalized fashion, the
derived patterns into a listener's score. NeuroPicks method may find
applications as an integral part of contemporary music recommendation systems,
while NeuroPicksVQ can control the selection of music tracks. Encouraging
experimental results, from a pragmatic use of the systems, are presented.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Allen Brain Atlas project (ABA) generated a genome-scale collection of
gene-expression profiles using in-situ hybridization. These profiles were
co-registered to the three-dimensional Allen Reference Atlas (ARA) of the adult
mouse brain. A set of more than 4,000 such volumetric data are available for
the full brain, at a resolution of 200 microns. These data are presented in a
voxel-by-gene matrix. The ARA comes with several systems of annotation,
hierarchical (40 cortical regions, 209 sub-cortical regions in the whole
brain), or non-hierarchical (12 regions in the left hemisphere, with refinement
into 94 regions, and cortical layers). The high-dimensional nature of this
dataset and the possible connection between anatomy and gene expression pose
challenges to data analysis. We developed the Brain Gene Expression Analysis
Toolbox, whose functionalities include: determination of marker genes for brain
regions, statistical analysis of brain-wide co-expression patterns, and the
computation of brain-wide correlation maps with cell-type specific microarray
data.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Estimating short-term synaptic plasticity from pre- and postsynaptic spiking</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/Bi9xTDVaR8E/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Abed Ghanbari, Aleksey Malyshev, Maxim Volgushev, Ian H. Stevenson&lt;/p&gt;

Short-term synaptic plasticity (STP) critically affects the processing of information in neuronal circuits by reversibly changing the effective strength of connections between neurons on time scales from milliseconds to a few seconds. STP is traditionally studied using intracellular recordings of postsynaptic potentials or currents evoked by presynaptic spikes. However, STP also affects the statistics of postsynaptic spikes. Here we present two model-based approaches for estimating synaptic weights and short-term plasticity from pre- and postsynaptic spike observations alone. We extend a generalized linear model (GLM) that predicts postsynaptic spiking as a function of the observed pre- and postsynaptic spikes and allow the connection strength (coupling term in the GLM) to vary as a function of time based on the history of presynaptic spikes. Our first model assumes that STP follows a Tsodyks-Markram description of vesicle depletion and recovery. In a second model, we introduce a functional description of STP where we estimate the coupling term as a biophysically unrestrained function of the presynaptic inter-spike intervals. To validate the models, we test the accuracy of STP estimation using the spiking of pre- and postsynaptic neurons with known synaptic dynamics. We first test our models using the responses of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons to simulated presynaptic input with different types of STP, and then use simulated spike trains to examine the effects of spike-frequency adaptation, stochastic vesicle release, spike sorting errors, and common input. We find that, using only spike observations, both model-based methods can accurately reconstruct the time-varying synaptic weights of presynaptic inputs for different types of STP. Our models also capture the differences in postsynaptic spike responses to presynaptic spikes following short vs long inter-spike intervals, similar to results reported for thalamocortical connections. These models may thus be useful tools for characterizing short-term plasticity from multi-electrode spike recordings in vivo.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Bi9xTDVaR8E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: kWIP: The &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-mer weighted inner product, a &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; estimator of genetic similarity</title>

Modern genomics techniques generate overwhelming quantities of data. Extracting population genetic variation demands computationally efficient methods to determine genetic relatedness between individuals (or “samples”) in an unbiased manner, preferably &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt;. Rapid estimation of genetic relatedness directly from sequencing data has the potential to overcome reference genome bias, and to verify that individuals belong to the correct genetic lineage before conclusions are drawn using mislabelled, or misidentified samples. We present the &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-mer Weighted Inner Product (kWIP), an assembly-, and alignment-free estimator of genetic similarity. kWIP combines a probabilistic data structure with a novel metric, the weighted inner product (WIP), to efficiently calculate pairwise similarity between sequencing runs from their &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-mer counts. It produces a distance matrix, which can then be further analysed and visualised. Our method does not require prior knowledge of the underlying genomes and applications include establishing sample identity and detecting mix-up, non-obvious genomic variation, and population structure. We show that kWIP can reconstruct the true relatedness between samples from simulated populations. By re-analysing several published datasets we show that our results are consistent with marker-based analyses. kWIP is written in C++, licensed under the GNU GPL, and is available from https://github.com/kdmurray91/kwip.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tulTaPSFLkI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: DeepPep: Deep proteome inference from peptide profiles</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/ZthcKVb-HhE/article</link>

Protein inference, the identification of the protein set that is the origin of a given peptide profile, is a fundamental challenge in proteomics. We present DeepPep, a deep-convolutional neural network framework that predicts the protein set from a proteomics mixture, given the sequence universe of possible proteins and a target peptide profile. In its core, DeepPep quantifies the change in probabilistic score of peptide-spectrum matches in the presence or absence of a specific protein, hence selecting as candidate proteins those with the largest impact to the peptide profile. Application of the method across datasets argues for its competitive predictive ability (AUC of 0.80±0.18, AUPR of 0.84±0.28) in inferring proteins without need of peptide detectability on which the most competitive method rely. We find that the convolutional neural network architecture outperforms the traditional artificial neural network architectures without convolution layers in protein inference. We expect that similar deep learning architectures that allow learning nonlinear patterns can be further extended to problems in metagenome profiling and cell type inference. The source code of DeepPep and the benchmark datasets used in this study are available at https://deeppep.github.io/DeepPep/.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZthcKVb-HhE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Training Spiking Neural Networks for Cognitive Tasks: A Versatile Framework Compatible to Various Temporal Codes. (arXiv:1709.00583v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00583</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Conventional modeling approaches have found limitations in matching the
increasingly detailed neural network structures and dynamics recorded in
experiments to the diverse brain functionalities. On another approach, studies
have demonstrated to train spiking neural networks for simple functions using
supervised learning. Here, we introduce a modified SpikeProp learning
algorithm, which achieved better learning stability in different activity
states. In addition, we show biological realistic features such as lateral
connections and sparse activities can be included in the network. We
demonstrate the versatility of this framework by implementing three well-known
temporal codes for different types of cognitive tasks, which are MNIST digits
recognition, spatial coordinate transformation, and motor sequence generation.
Moreover, we find several characteristic features have evolved alongside the
task training, such as selective activity, excitatory-inhibitory balance, and
weak pair-wise correlation. The coincidence between the self-evolved and
experimentally observed features indicates their importance on the brain
functionality. Our results suggest a unified setting in which diverse cognitive
computations and mechanisms can be studied.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Alcohol improves cerebellar-learning deficit in myoclonus-dystonia - a clinical and electrophysiological investigation</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25035</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objectives&lt;/em&gt;: To characterize neurophysiological subcortical abnormalities in myoclonus-dystonia and their modulation by alcohol administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods&lt;/em&gt;: Cerebellar associative learning and basal ganglia-brainstem interaction were investigated in 17 myoclonus-dystonia patients with &lt;em&gt;epsilon-sarcoglycan&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SGCE)&lt;/em&gt; gene mutation and 21 age- and sex-matched healthy controls by means of classical eyeblink conditioning and blink reflex recovery cycle before and after alcohol intake resulting in a breath alcohol concentration of 0.08% (0.8 g/l). The alcohol responsiveness of clinical symptoms was evaluated by three blinded raters with a standardized video protocol and clinical rating scales including the Unified Myoclonus Rating Scale (UMRS) and the Burke Fahn Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results&lt;/em&gt;: Patients showed a significantly reduced number of conditioned eyeblink responses before alcohol administration compared to controls. While the conditioning response rate decreased under alcohol intake in controls, it increased in patients (ANOVA: alcohol state x Group p = 0.004). Blink reflex recovery cycle before and after alcohol intake did not differ between groups. Myoclonus improved significantly after alcohol intake (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.016). The severity of action myoclonus at baseline correlated negatively with the conditioning response in classical eyeblink conditioning in patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interpretation&lt;/em&gt;: The combination of findings with reduced baseline acquisition of conditioned eyeblink responses and normal blink reflex recovery cycle in patients that improved significantly by alcohol intake suggests a crucial role of cerebellar networks in the generation of symptoms in these patients.

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decreasing biomedical research support over the past decade has driven many talented young scientists to seek careers outside academia. In 2011, the Department of Neurology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine developed an internal grant review program (IGRP) to systematically review career development awards (CDAs) and research grants (e.g., R01s) for junior investigators prior to NIH submission. With IGRP implementation, we observed significant increases in the number of CDAs and R-grants awarded to junior investigators. Thus, internal grant review is an effective means for supporting junior faculty and help them retain their research roles within academia. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Concussion in adolescence and risk of multiple sclerosis</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25036</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: To assess whether concussion in childhood or adolescence is associated with subsequent multiple sclerosis risk. Previous research suggests an association but methodological limitations included retrospective data collection and small study populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: The national Swedish Patient (hospital diagnoses) and Multiple Sclerosis registers were used to identify all MS diagnoses up to 2012 among people born from 1964, when the Patient Register was established. The 7292 patients with multiple sclerosis were matched individually with 10 people without MS by sex, year of birth, age/vital status at multiple sclerosis diagnosis, and region of residence (county), resulting in a study population of 80212. Diagnoses of concussion and control diagnoses of broken limb bones were identified using the Patient Register from birth to age 10 years or from ages 11 to 20 years. Conditional logistic regression was used to examine associations with multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Concussion in adolescence was associated with a raised risk of multiple sclerosis, producing adjusted odds ratios (and 95% confidence intervals) of 1.22 (1.05-1.42, p=0.008) and 2.33 (1.35-4.04, p=0.002) for one diagnosis of concussion, or more than one diagnosis of concussion, respectively, compared with none. No notable association with multiple sclerosis was observed for concussion in childhood, or broken limb bones in childhood and adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Head trauma in adolescence, particularly if repeated, is associated with a raised risk of future multiple sclerosis, possibly due to initiation of an autoimmune process in the central nervous system. This further emphasises the importance of protecting young people from head injuries. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A single Markov-type kinetic model accounting for the macroscopic currents of all human voltage-gated sodium channel isoforms</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/_o404RFqmDo/article</link>

Modelling ionic channels represents a fundamental step towards developing biologically detailed neuron models. Until recently, the voltage-gated ion channels have been mainly modelled according to the formalism introduced by the seminal works of Hodgkin and Huxley (HH). However, following the continuing achievements in the biophysical and molecular comprehension of these pore-forming transmembrane proteins, the HH formalism turned out to carry limitations and inconsistencies in reproducing the ion-channels electrophysiological behaviour. At the same time, Markov-type kinetic models have been increasingly proven to successfully replicate both the electrophysiological and biophysical features of different ion channels. However, in order to model even the finest non-conducting molecular conformational change, they are often equipped with a considerable number of states and related transitions, which make them computationally heavy and less suitable for implementation in conductance-based neurons and large networks of those. In this purely modelling study we develop a Markov-type kinetic model for all human voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs). The model framework is detailed, unifying (i.e., it accounts for all ion-channel isoforms) and computationally efficient (i.e. with a minimal set of states and transitions). The electrophysiological data to be modelled are gathered from previously published studies on whole-cell patch-clamp experiments in mammalian cell lines heterologously expressing the human VGSC subtypes (from Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.1 to Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.9). By adopting a minimum sequence of states, and using the same state diagram for all the distinct isoforms, the model ensures the lightest computational load when used in neuron models and neural networks of increasing complexity. The transitions between the states are described by original ordinary differential equations, which represent the rate of the state transitions as a function of voltage (i.e., membrane potential). The kinetic model, developed in the NEURON simulation environment, appears to be the simplest and most parsimonious way for a detailed phenomenological description of the human VGSCs electrophysiological behaviour.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_o404RFqmDo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Differential receptive field organizations give rise to nearly identical neural correlations across three parallel sensory maps in weakly electric fish</title>

Understanding how neural populations encode sensory information thereby leading to perception and behavior (i.e., the neural code) remains an important problem in neuroscience. When investigating the neural code, one must take into account the fact that neural activities are not independent but are actually correlated with one another. Such correlations are seen ubiquitously and have a strong impact on neural coding. Here we investigated how differences in the antagonistic center-surround receptive field (RF) organization across three parallel sensory maps influence correlations between the activities of electrosensory pyramidal neurons. Using a model based on known anatomical differences in receptive field center size and overlap, we initially predicted large differences in correlated activity across the maps. However, &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiological recordings showed that, contrary to modeling predictions, electrosensory pyramidal neurons across all three segments displayed nearly identical correlations. To explain this surprising result, we incorporated the effects of RF surround in our model. By systematically varying both the RF surround gain and size relative to that of the RF center, we found that multiple RF structures gave rise to similar levels of correlation. In particular, incorporating known physiological differences in RF structure between the three maps in our model gave rise to similar levels of correlation. Our results show that RF center overlap alone does not determine correlations which has important implications for understanding how RF structure influences correlated neural activity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ty2LC2VNPl8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The capacity of pluripotent embryonic stem cells to differentiate into any cell type in the body makes them invaluable in the field of regenerative medicine. However, because of the complexity of both the core pluripotency network and the process of cell fate computation it is not yet possible to control the fate of stem cells. We present a theoretical model of stem cell fate computation that is based on Halley and Winkler’s Branching Process Theory (BPT) and on Greaves &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;.’s agent-based computer simulation derived from that theoretical model. BPT abstracts the complex production and action of a Transcription Factor (TF) into a single critical branching process that may dissipate, maintain, or become supercritical. Here we take the single TF model and extend it to multiple interacting TFs, and build an agent-based simulation of multiple TFs to investigate the dynamics of such coupled systems. We have developed the simulation and the theoretical model together, in an iterative manner, with the aim of obtaining a deeper understanding of stem cell fate computation, in order to influence experimental efforts, which may in turn influence the outcome of cellular differentiation. The model used is an example of self-organization and could be more widely applicable to the modelling of other complex systems. The simulation based on this model, though currently limited in scope in terms of the biology it represents, supports the utility of the Halley and Winkler’s branching process model in describing the behaviour of stem cell gene regulatory networks. Our simulation demonstrates three key features: (i) the existence of a critical value of the branching process parameter, dependent on the details of the cistrome in question; (ii) the ability of an active cistrome to “ignite” an otherwise fully dissipated cistrome, and drive it to criticality; (iii) how coupling cistromes together can reduce their critical branching parameter values needed to drive them to criticality.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/r1JHEeymEL0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>In mammals, acoustic information arises in the cochlea and is transmitted to the ventral cochlear nuclei (VCN). Three groups of VCN neurons extract different features from the firing of auditory nerve fibers and convey that information along separate pathways through the brainstem. Two of these pathways process temporal information: octopus cells detect coincident firing among auditory nerve fibers and transmit signals along monaural pathways, and bushy cells sharpen the encoding of fine structure and feed binaural pathways.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A computational model of spatio-temporal cardiac intracellular calcium handling with realistic structure and spatial flux distribution from sarcoplasmic reticulum and t-tubule reconstructions</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/l1xtSADDZ4s/article</link>

Intracellular calcium cycling is a vital component of cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. The key structures responsible for controlling calcium dynamics are the cell membrane (comprising the surface sarcolemma and transverse-tubules), the intracellular calcium store (the sarcoplasmic reticulum), and the co-localisation of these two structures to form dyads within which calcium-induced-calcium-release occurs. The organisation of these structures tightly controls intracellular calcium dynamics. In this study, we present a computational model of intracellular calcium cycling in three-dimensions (3-D), which incorporates high resolution reconstructions of these key regulatory structures, attained through imaging of tissue taken from the sheep left ventricle using serial block face scanning electron microscopy. An approach was developed to model the sarcoplasmic reticulum structure at the whole-cell scale, by reducing its full 3-D structure to a 3-D network of one-dimensional strands. The model reproduces intracellular calcium dynamics during control pacing and reveals the high-resolution 3-D spatial structure of calcium gradients and intracellular fluxes in both the cytoplasm and sarcoplasmic reticulum. We also demonstrated the capability of the model to reproduce potentially pro-arrhythmic dynamics under perturbed conditions, pertaining to calcium-transient alternans and spontaneous release events. Comparison with idealised cell models emphasised the importance of structure in determining calcium gradients and controlling the spatial dynamics associated with calcium-transient alternans, wherein the probabilistic nature of dyad activation and recruitment was constrained. The model was further used to highlight the criticality in calcium spark propagation in relation to inter-dyad distances. The model presented provides a powerful tool for future investigation of structure-function relationships underlying physiological and pathophysiological intracellular calcium handling phenomena at the whole-cell. The approach allows for the first time direct integration of high-resolution images of 3-D intracellular structures with models of calcium cycling, presenting the possibility to directly assess the functional impact of structural remodelling at the cellular scale.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/l1xtSADDZ4s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Mouth-clicks used by blind expert human echolocators – signal description and model based signal synthesis</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/MUsIJbXVblY/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Lore Thaler, Galen M. Reich, Xinyu Zhang, Dinghe Wang, Graeme E. Smith, Zeng Tao, Raja Syamsul Azmir Bin. Raja Abdullah, Mikhail Cherniakov, Christopher J. Baker, Daniel Kish, Michail Antoniou&lt;/p&gt;

Echolocation is the ability to use sound-echoes to infer spatial information about the environment. Some blind people have developed extraordinary proficiency in echolocation using mouth-clicks. The first step of human biosonar is the transmission (mouth click) and subsequent reception of the resultant sound through the ear. Existing head-related transfer function (HRTF) data bases provide descriptions of reception of the resultant sound. For the current report, we collected a large database of click emissions with three blind people expertly trained in echolocation, which allowed us to perform unprecedented analyses. Specifically, the current report provides the first ever description of the spatial distribution (i.e. beam pattern) of human expert echolocation transmissions, as well as spectro-temporal descriptions at a level of detail not available before. Our data show that transmission levels are fairly constant within a 60° cone emanating from the mouth, but levels drop gradually at further angles, more than for speech. In terms of spectro-temporal features, our data show that emissions are consistently very brief (~3ms duration) with peak frequencies 2-4kHz, but with energy also at 10kHz. This differs from previous reports of durations 3-15ms and peak frequencies 2-8kHz, which were based on less detailed measurements. Based on our measurements we propose to model transmissions as sum of monotones modulated by a decaying exponential, with angular attenuation by a modified cardioid. We provide model parameters for each echolocator. These results are a step towards developing computational models of human biosonar. For example, in bats, spatial and spectro-temporal features of emissions have been used to derive and test model based hypotheses about behaviour. The data we present here suggest similar research opportunities within the context of human echolocation. Relatedly, the data are a basis to develop synthetic models of human echolocation that could be virtual (i.e. simulated) or real (i.e. loudspeaker, microphones), and which will help understanding the link between physical principles and human behaviour.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MUsIJbXVblY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Fetal Growth and Premature Delivery in Pregnant Women on Anti-epileptic Drugs</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25031</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; To evaluate the effects of epilepsy and antiepileptic drugs (AED) use during pregnancy on fetal growth and preterm delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; This study included singleton liveborns born to women enrolled in the North American Antiepileptic Drug Pregnancy Registry between 1997 and 2016. Data were collected prospectively through telephone interviews. The prevalence of preterm birth (&amp;lt;37 weeks) and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) among infants exposed prenatally to AED when used by women with epilepsy (WWE) or women without epilepsy (WWOE) was compared with that among infants unexposed to AEDs and born to WWOE. Multivariable log-binomial regression models were used to estimate relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; The study population included infants born to 6,777 AED-WWE, 696 AED-WWOE, and 486 no-AED WWOE. The risk of prematurity was 6.2% for no-AED-WWOE, 9.3% for AED-WWE (RR 1.5, 95%CI: 1.0-2.1) and 10.5% for AED-WWOE (RR 1.5: 1.0-2.4). Prenatal exposure to AED in WWE and WWOE was associated with a mean lower birth weight of 110 and 136 grams, respectively, as compared to no-AED WWOE. The prevalence of SGA was 5.0% for no-AED-WWOE, 10.9% for AED-WWE (RR 2.0: 1.3-3.0) and 11.0% for AED-WWOE (RR 1.9: 1.2-2.9). Within users of AEDs in monotherapy, the prevalence of SGA ranged from 7.3% for lamotrigine to 18.5% for topiramate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interpretation&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; Women on AEDs during pregnancy, whether for epilepsy or for other neuropsychiatric indications, are at a higher risk of delivering prematurely and giving birth to SGA newborns. The risk may vary by drug. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Spasticity occurs in a wide range of neurological diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, after trauma or after stroke and is characterized by increased reflexes leading to muscle hypertonia. Spasticity is a painful symptom and can severely restrict everyday life, but might also participate in maintaining a low level of motor function in severely impaired patients. Constitutive activity of the serotonin receptors 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B/C&lt;/sub&gt; is required for the development of spasticity after spinal cord injury or during amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We sought here to provide direct evidence for a role of brainstem serotonin neurons in spasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;em&gt;SOD1&lt;/em&gt;(G37R) mice expressing a conditional allele of an ALS-linked SOD1 mutation were crossed to Tph2-CRE mice expressing CRE in serotonergic neurons. Measurement of long lasting reflex using EMG, behavioural follow up and histological techniques were used to characterize spasticity and motor phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Deleting mutant SOD1 expression selectively in brainstem serotonin neurons was sufficient to rescue loss of TPH2 immunoreactivity and largely preserve serotonin innervation of motor neurons in the spinal cord. Furthermore, this abrogated constitutive activity of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B/C&lt;/sub&gt; receptors and abolished spasticity in end-stage mice. Consistent with spasticity mitigating motor symptoms, selective deletion worsened motor function and accelerated the onset of paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Degeneration of serotonin neurons is necessary to trigger spasticity through the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B/C&lt;/sub&gt; receptor. The wide range of drugs targeting the serotonergic system could be useful to treat spasticity in neurological diseases. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: GABBR2 mutations determine phenotype in Rett syndrome and epileptic encephalopathy</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25032</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Rett syndrome (RTT) and epileptic encephalopathy (EE) are devastating neurodevelopmental disorders with distinct diagnostic criteria. However, highly heterogeneous and overlapping clinical features often allocate patients into the boundary of the two conditions, complicating accurate diagnosis and appropriate medical interventions. Therefore, we investigated the specific molecular mechanism that allows an understanding of the pathogenesis and relationship of these two conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We screened novel genetic factors from 34 RTT-like patients without &lt;em&gt;MECP2&lt;/em&gt; mutations, which account for ∼90% of RTT cases, by whole exome sequencing. The biological function of the discovered variants was assessed in cell culture and &lt;em&gt;Xenopus tropicalis&lt;/em&gt; models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: We identified a recurring &lt;em&gt;de novo&lt;/em&gt; variant in GABAB receptor R2 (&lt;em&gt;GABBR2&lt;/em&gt;) that reduces the receptor function, whereas different &lt;em&gt;GABBR2&lt;/em&gt; variants in EE patients possess a more profound effect in reducing receptor activity and are more responsive to agonist rescue in an animal model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;em&gt;GABBR2&lt;/em&gt; is a genetic factor that determines RTT- or EE-like phenotype expression depending on the variant positions. &lt;em&gt;GABBR2&lt;/em&gt;-mediated GABA signaling is a crucial factor in determining the severity and nature of neurodevelopmental phenotypes.

&lt;p&gt;Hexanucleotide repeat expansions in C9orf72 gene locus create double jeopardy, first by leading to DNA–RNA R-loops that spawn double-strand breaks and second by the synthesis of dipeptide repeats that hinder DNA repair. This two-pronged mechanism may explain neurodegeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Domain-based prediction of the human isoform interactome provides insights into the functional impact of alternative splicing</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/pOE3h8IZjMI/article</link>

Alternative splicing is known to remodel protein-protein interaction networks (“interactomes”), yet large-scale determination of isoform-specific interactions remains challenging. We present a domain-based method to predict the isoform interactome from the reference interactome. First, we construct the domain-resolved reference interactome by mapping known domain-domain interactions onto experimentally-determined interactions between reference proteins. Then, we construct the isoform interactome by predicting that an isoform loses an interaction if it loses the domain mediating the interaction. Our prediction framework is of high-quality when assessed by experimental data. The predicted human isoform interactome reveals extensive network remodeling by alternative splicing. Protein pairs interacting with different isoforms of the same gene tend to be more divergent in biological function, tissue expression, and disease phenotype than protein pairs interacting with the same isoforms. Our prediction method complements experimental efforts, and demonstrates that integrating structural domain information with interactomes provides insights into the functional impact of alternative splicing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pOE3h8IZjMI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A method of determining where to target surveillance efforts in heterogeneous epidemiological systems</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Alexander J. Mastin, Frank van den Bosch, Timothy R. Gottwald, Vasthi Alonso Chavez, Stephen R. Parnell&lt;/p&gt;

The spread of pathogens into new environments poses a considerable threat to human, animal, and plant health, and by extension, human and animal wellbeing, ecosystem function, and agricultural productivity, worldwide. Early detection through effective surveillance is a key strategy to reduce the risk of their establishment. Whilst it is well established that statistical and economic considerations are of vital importance when planning surveillance efforts, it is also important to consider epidemiological characteristics of the pathogen in question—including heterogeneities within the epidemiological system itself. One of the most pronounced realisations of this heterogeneity is seen in the case of vector-borne pathogens, which spread between ‘hosts’ and ‘vectors’—with each group possessing distinct epidemiological characteristics. As a result, an important question when planning surveillance for emerging vector-borne pathogens is where to place sampling resources in order to detect the pathogen as early as possible. We answer this question by developing a statistical function which describes the probability distributions of the prevalences of infection at first detection in both hosts and vectors. We also show how this method can be adapted in order to maximise the probability of early detection of an emerging pathogen within imposed sample size and/or cost constraints, and demonstrate its application using two simple models of vector-borne citrus pathogens. Under the assumption of a linear cost function, we find that sampling costs are generally minimised when either hosts or vectors, but not both, are sampled.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HsuotfhBM24&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: HLA class I haplotype diversity is consistent with selection for frequent existing haplotypes</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/983RcTGNU5k/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Idan Alter, Loren Gragert, Stephanie Fingerson, Martin Maiers, Yoram Louzoun&lt;/p&gt;

The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) contains the most polymorphic genetic system in humans, the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes of the adaptive immune system. High allelic diversity in HLA is argued to be maintained by balancing selection, such as negative frequency-dependent selection or heterozygote advantage. Selective pressure against immune escape by pathogens can maintain appreciable frequencies of many different HLA alleles. The selection pressures operating on combinations of HLA alleles across loci, or haplotypes, have not been extensively evaluated since the high HLA polymorphism necessitates very large sample sizes, which have not been available until recently. We aimed to evaluate the effect of selection operating at the HLA haplotype level by analyzing HLA A~C~B~DRB1~DQB1 haplotype frequencies derived from over six million individuals genotyped by the National Marrow Donor Program registry. In contrast with alleles, HLA haplotype diversity patterns suggest purifying selection, as certain HLA allele combinations co-occur in high linkage disequilibrium. Linkage disequilibrium is positive (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'&amp;gt;0) among frequent haplotypes and negative (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'&amp;lt;0) among rare haplotypes. Fitting the haplotype frequency distribution to several population dynamics models, we found that the best fit was obtained when significant positive frequency-dependent selection (FDS) was incorporated. Finally, the Ewens-Watterson test of homozygosity showed excess homozygosity for 5-locus haplotypes within 23 US populations studied, with an average &lt;i&gt;Fnd&lt;/i&gt; of 28.43. Haplotype diversity is most consistent with purifying selection for HLA Class I haplotypes (HLA-A, -B, -C), and was not inferred for HLA Class II haplotypes (-DRB1 and—DQB1). We discuss our empirical results in the context of evolutionary theory, exploring potential mechanisms of selection that maintain high linkage disequilibrium in MHC haplotype blocks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/983RcTGNU5k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Amputees who wish to rid themselves of a phantom limb must weaken the neural representation of the absent limb. Conversely, amputees who wish to replace a lost limb must assimilate a neuroprosthetic with the existing neural representation. Whether we wish to remove a phantom limb or assimilate a synthetic one, we will benefit from knowing more about the developmental process that enables embodiment. A potentially critical contributor to that process is the spontaneous activity – in the form of limb twitches – that occurs exclusively and abundantly during active (REM) sleep, a particularly prominent state in early development.</content:encoded>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: All Wrapped Up: Environmental Effects on Myelination</title>
	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30124-8?rss=yes</link>
	<content:encoded>To date, studies have demonstrated the dynamic influence of exogenous environmental stimuli on multiple regions of the brain. This environmental influence positively and negatively impacts programs governing myelination, and acts on myelinating oligodendrocyte (OL) cells across the human lifespan. Developmentally, environmental manipulation of OL progenitor cells (OPCs) has profound effects on the establishment of functional cognitive, sensory, and motor programs. Furthermore, central nervous system (CNS) myelin remains an adaptive entity in adulthood, sensitive to environmentally induced structural changes.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>In physiological conditions, adult neurons have low intracellular Cl− [(Cl−)I] levels underlying the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic inhibitory drive. In contrast, neurons have high (Cl−)I levels and excitatory GABA actions in a wide range of pathological conditions including spinal cord lesions, chronic pain, brain trauma, cerebrovascular infarcts, autism, Rett and Down syndrome, various types of epilepsies, and other genetic or environmental insults. The diuretic highly specific NKCC1 chloride importer antagonist bumetanide (PubChem CID: 2461) efficiently restores low (Cl−)I levels and attenuates many disorders in experimental conditions and in some clinical trials.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30123-6?rss=yes</link>
	<content:encoded>Deficits in GABAergic inhibition result in the abnormal neuronal activation and synchronization that underlies seizures. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for transforming a normal brain into an epileptic one remain largely unknown. Hyperpolarizing inhibition mediated by type A GABA (GABAA) receptors is dependent on chloride extrusion by the neuron-specific type 2K+–Cl− cotransporter (KCC2). Loss-of-function mutations in KCC2 are a known cause of infantile epilepsy in humans and KCC2 dysfunction is present in patients with both idiopathic and acquired epilepsy.</content:encoded>
