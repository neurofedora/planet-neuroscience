	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00415-021-10437-5</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The relationship between visual impairment and cognitive performance in multiple sclerosis (MS) remains poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To determine associations between visual acuity and optical coherence tomography (OCT) measures with cognitive performance of MS patients and healthy controls (HCs).&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;141 MS patients (with and without MS optic neuritis; MSON) and 50 HCs underwent neuropsychological, visual, and OCT testing. California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT-II), Brief Visuospatial Memory Test (BVMT-R), and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) were used. Patients with test performance below − 1.5 standard deviations of the mean HCs scores were labeled as cognitive impairment. Visual ability was assessed with 100%, 2.5%, and 1.25% low-contrast letter acuity (LCLA) charts. OCT-derived peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness, macular volume (MV), macular ganglion cell inner plexiform (mGCIP) thickness (as a sum of GC and IP layers), and macular inner nuclear layer (mINL) were computed.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;

                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;100% and 2.5% LCLA associated with SDMT in MS and HCs (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.012, respectively). In MSON patients, visually demanding tests were explained by pRNFL and macular volume for SDMT (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;β&lt;/em&gt; = 0.172, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.039 and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;β&lt;/em&gt; = 0.27, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001) and MV for BVMT-R (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;β&lt;/em&gt; = 0.21, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.012). In non-MSON, only mINL was predictor of CVLT-II. pRNFL and MV predicted cognitive impairment with an accuracy of 72.2% (Negelkerke &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;R&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.234). These findings were driven by associations within the progressive MS subgroup. HC’s SDMT performance was explained by mGCIP (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;β&lt;/em&gt; = 0.316, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;

                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Both LCLA and OCT-based measures (pRNFL and macular volume) were associated with MS cognitive performance. OCT-based measures were also significant predictors of cognitive status in MS patients. mGCIP associated with cognitive performance in HCs.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Neurology: Comparison of patients with transient and sustained increments of antiphospholipid antibodies after acute ischemic stroke</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00415-021-10432-w</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background and purpose&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is one of the uncommon causes of ischemic stroke, and is associated with young and female patients. However, the significance of antiphospholipid antibody (aPL) in older ischemic stroke patients is uncertain. We aimed to examine the significance of aPLs in ischemic stroke in these older patients.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Materials and methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A total of 739 patients with acute ischemic stroke within 7 days of initial symptoms were collected consecutively. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained from medical records. aPLs (lupus anticoagulant, anti-cardiolipin antibody, anti-β2glycoprotein-I antibody) were measured the day after admission and the presence of at least one antibody was regarded as positive aPL. Patients with positive aPL were rechecked after at least 12 weeks for confirmation of APS.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Result&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Of the 739 patients, 103 (13.9%) had at least one aPL initially. These patients were older, had more atrial fibrillation and higher levels of inflammatory markers. Among the 103 aPL positive patients, 41 remained positive at 3 months, 23 showed negative conversion, and 39 were not available for follow-up. Patients diagnosed with APS had higher numbers of aPL and had specifically anti-β2glycoprotein-I IgG antibody. The patients with aPLs did not differ significantly from the others in terms of stroke subtype.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;aPL was rather common in ischemic stroke patients regardless of age. Although the influence of transient positive aPL on ischemic stroke remains uncertain, two or more aPLs and the presence of anti-β2glycoprotein-I IgG may predict a diagnosis of APS.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Neurology: Predictors of treatment response to pharmacotherapy in patients with persistent postural–perceptual dizziness</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The study aimed to identify the predictors of response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for 12 weeks in patients with persistent postural–perceptual dizziness (PPPD). Short-term treatment responses were studied in 197 outpatients [127 (64.5%) women, mean age ± SD = 51.7 ± 15.9] diagnosed with PPPD. Clinical and self-rated assessments were analyzed at the baseline and at the end of pharmacotherapy for 12 weeks. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine the following variables as the potential predictors of treatment response as measured by scoring in clinical global impression-improvement scale (CGI-I) scores: age, sex, comorbidity, baseline CGI-S score, Beck Depression Inventory–II score, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory score, Dizziness Handicap Inventory score at the baseline, and prescribed doses of antidepressants or benzodiazepines. The overall response rate to pharmacotherapy was 65.0% (128/197). Female sex and greater disease severity at the baseline (higher CGI-S score) were associated with a better response to the pharmacotherapy. Subgroup analyses by sex identified younger age and lower anxiety as the indicators for better outcomes in men, and absence of comorbidities in women. During the initial assessment, the severity of PPPD was associated with depressive symptoms and subjective functional handicap due to dizziness. The response to pharmacotherapy is favorable in PPPD. Sex, age and initial disease severity are the predictors of the response to SSRIs in patients with PPPD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neurology: Thalamic atrophy in patients with pure hereditary spastic paraplegia type 4</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00415-020-10387-4</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SPG4 is an autosomal dominant pure form of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) caused by mutations in the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SPAST&lt;/em&gt; gene. HSP is considered an upper motor neuron disorder characterized by progressive spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs caused by degeneration of the corticospinal tract. In other neurodegenerative motor disorders, the thalamus and basal ganglia are affected, with a considerable impact on disease progression. However, only a few works have studied these brain structures in HSP, mainly in complex forms of this disease. Our research aims to detect potential alterations in the volume and shape of the thalamus and various basal ganglia structures by comparing 12 patients with pure HSP and 18 healthy controls. We used two neuroimaging procedures: automated segmentation of the subcortical structures (thalamus, hippocampus, caudate nucleus, globus pallidus, and putamen) in native space and shape analysis of the structures. We found a significant reduction in thalamic volume bilaterally, as well as an inward deformation, mainly in the sensory-motor thalamic regions in patients with pure HSP and a mutation in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SPG4&lt;/em&gt;. We also observed a significant negative correlation between the shape of the thalamus and clinical scores (the Spastic Paraplegia Rating Scale score and disease duration). Moreover, we found a ‘Group × Age’ interaction that was closely related to the severity of the disease. No differences in volume or in shape were found in the remaining subcortical structures studied. Our results suggest that changes in structure of the thalamus could be an imaging biomarker of disease progression in pHSP.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis confronted us, like many researchers worldwide, with an unforeseen challenge during the final stages of a randomized controlled trial involving ataxia patients. Institutional guidelines suddenly no longer allowed regular follow-up visits to take place, impeding the clinical evaluation of long-term outcomes. Here, we discuss the various scenarios that we considered in response to these imposed restrictions and share our experience of home video recording by dedicated, extensively instructed family members. Albeit somewhat unconventional at first glance, this last resort strategy enabled us to reliably assess the study’s primary endpoint at the predefined point in time and hopefully encourages researchers in other ongoing ataxia trials to continue their activities. Remote assessments of ataxia severity may serve as a reasonable substitute in interventional trials beyond the current exceptional situation generated by the COVID-19 pandemic, but will require further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We describe a rare case of post-infective Acute Motor Axonal Neuropathy (AMAN) variant of Guillain-Barrè Syndrome (GBS) associated with myelitis and anti-GD1b positivity after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patient referred to the hospital reporting a history of ten days lasting moderate fever, myalgia and anosmia, with the onset of progressive quadriparesis and ascending paraesthesias in the four limbs since five days from defervescence. A chest computed tomography demonstrated interstitial pneumonia with “ground glass opacities”, suggesting Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The patient exhibited three negative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) nasopharyngeal swabs, while SARS-CoV-2 IgG was found in plasma. The electrophysiological examination demonstrated an AMAN and the spinal cord Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) showed a T2-weighted hyperintense lesion in the posterior part of the spinal cord at the C7-D1 levels. Furthermore, anti-GD1b IgM was detected. GBS and myelitis could exceptionally develop simultaneously. Our findings reasonably support a causality link between COVID-19 and the neurological symptoms, suggesting a post-infective autoimmune reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00415-020-10200-2</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;From March to May 2020, the Italian health care system, as many others, was almost entirely devoted to the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. In this context, a number of questions arose, from the increased stroke risk due to COVID-19 infection to the quality of stroke patient care. The overwhelming need of COVID-19 patient management made mandatory a complete re-organization of the stroke pathways: many health professionals were reallocated and a number of stroke units was turned into COVID-19 wards. As a result, acute stroke care suffered from a shortage of services and delays in time-dependent treatments and diagnostic work-up. In-patient and out-patient care and rehabilitation facilities for stroke survivors were also reduced or slowed down, to direct resources to COVID-19 patients care and to reduce contagion risks. Overall, this is likely to result in a significant future increased burden of complications and disabilities that will impact the health care systems in the coming months. Thus, while still fighting against COVID-19 disease, authorities need to promptly implement robust action plans, including an increase of workforce, without forgetting the assurance of a high level of stroke care. The medical community and the health care administrators should always keep in mind that stroke was before, and will be after the pandemic, a, sometimes, life-threatening condition, and almost always a disease with a severe impact on the quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Whether pre-intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) provides any extra benefits to mechanical thrombectomy (MT) remains controversial. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare MT with pre-IVT (IVT + MT) and MT without pre-IVT (MT) for acute ischemic stroke of large vessel occlusion.&lt;/p&gt;

                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library to identify studies comparing outcomes between IVT + MT and MT from inception to Jan 24, 2019. Random effects mode was used to pool relative risk (RR) with confidence intervals (CI) to compare functional independence in terms of modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0–2, favorable outcome (mRS 0–1) and mortality at three-months, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, successful reperfusion, and complete reperfusion between the two treatments groups.&lt;/p&gt;

                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We included 30 studies enrolling 8970 patients with acute ischemic stroke of large vessel occlusion. Compared with MT, IVT + MT significantly increased the rate of 3-month functional independence (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.12–1.30; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt; P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) and favorable outcome (RR 1.28; 95% CI 1.16–1.40; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001), increased the rate of successful reperfusion (RR 1.04,95% CI 1.01–1.08;  &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; =  0.013) and complete reperfusion (RR 1.10; 95% CI 1.01–1.19; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.024), reduced the rate of mortality (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.67–0.82; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt; P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001), without significantly increasing the rate of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (RR 0.98,95% CI 0.82–1.17;  &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.833). The results remained stable in sensitivity analyses and adjusting for publication bias.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Increased aortic stiffness has been found to be associated with cognitive function decline, but the evidence is still under debate. It is of great significance to elucidate the evidence in this debate to help make primary prevention decisions to slow cognitive decline in our routine clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Electronic databases of PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were systematically searched to identify peer-reviewed articles published in English from January 1, 1986, to March 16, 2020, that reported the association between aortic stiffness and cognitive function. Studies that reported the association between aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) and cognitive function, cognitive impairment, and dementia were included in the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Thirty-nine studies were included in the qualitative analysis, and 29 studies were included in the quantitative analysis. The aortic PWV was inversely associated with memory and processing speed in the cross-sectional analysis. In the longitudinal analysis, the high category of aortic PWV was 44% increased risk of cognitive impairment (OR 1.44; 95% CI 1.24–1.85) compared with low PWV, and the risk of cognitive impairment increased 3.9% (OR 1.039; 95% CI 1.005–1.073) per 1 m/s increase in aortic PWV. Besides, meta-regression analysis showed that age significantly increased the association between high aortic PWV and cognitive impairment risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Aortic stiffness measured by aortic PWV was inversely associated with memory and processing speed and could be an independent predictor for cognitive impairment, especially for older individuals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Possibilistic Clustering-Promoting Semi-Supervised Learning for EEG- based Emotion Recognition</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.690044</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the latest brain computer interface(BCI) is to perform accurate emotion recognition through the customized their recognizers to each subject. In the field of machine learning, graph-based semi-supervised learning has attracted more and more attention due to its intuitive and good learning performance for emotion recognition. However, each individual subject may present noise or outlier EEG patterns in the same scenario, the existing GSSL methods are sensitive or not enough robust to noise or outlier EEG-based data. To address the problem, in this paper, we invent a Possibilistic Clustering-Promoting semi-supervised learning for EEG-based Emotion Recognition (PCP-ER). Specifically, it constrains each instance to have the same label membership value with its local weighted mean (LWM), so as to improve the reliability of the recognition method. In addition, a regularization term about fuzzy entropy is introduced into the objective function, and the generalization ability of membership function is enhanced by increasing the amount of sample discrimination information, which improves the robustness of the method to noise and outlier. A large number of experimental results on the three real datasets (i.e., DEAP, SEED and SEED-IV) show that the proposed method improves the reliability and robustness of the EEG emotion recognition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11951</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Intracranial recordings in epilepsy patients are increasingly utilized to
gain insight into the electrophysiological mechanisms of human cognition. There
are currently several practical limitations to conducting research with these
patients, including patient and researcher availability and the cognitive
abilities of patients, which limit the amount of task-related data that can be
collected. Prior studies have synchronized clinical audio, video, and neural
recordings to understand naturalistic behaviors, but these recordings are
centered on the patient to understand their seizure semiology and thus do not
capture and synchronize audiovisual stimuli from tasks. Here, we describe a
platform for cognitive monitoring of neurosurgical patients during their
hospitalization that benefits both patients and researchers alike. We provide
the full specifications for this system and describe some example use cases in
perception, memory, and sleep research. Our system opens up new avenues to
collect more data per patient using real-world tasks, affording new
possibilities to conduct longitudinal studies of the electrophysiological basis
of human cognition under naturalistic conditions.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11927</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Partial differential equations (PDEs) are concise and understandable
representations of domain knowledge, which are essential for deepening our
understanding of physical processes and predicting future responses. However,
the PDEs of many real-world problems are uncertain, which calls for PDE
discovery. We propose the symbolic genetic algorithm (SGA-PDE) to discover
open-form PDEs directly from data without prior knowledge about the equation
structure. SGA-PDE focuses on the representation and optimization of PDE.
Firstly, SGA-PDE uses symbolic mathematics to realize the flexible
representation of any given PDE, transforms a PDE into a forest, and converts
each function term into a binary tree. Secondly, SGA-PDE adopts a specially
designed genetic algorithm to efficiently optimize the binary trees by
iteratively updating the tree topology and node attributes. The SGA-PDE is
gradient-free, which is a desirable characteristic in PDE discovery since it is
difficult to obtain the gradient between the PDE loss and the PDE structure. In
the experiment, SGA-PDE not only successfully discovered nonlinear Burgers'
equation, Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, and Chafee-Infante equation, but
also handled PDEs with fractional structure and compound functions that cannot
be solved by conventional PDE discovery methods.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Genetic Programming (GP) is known to suffer from the burden of being
computationally expensive by design. While, over the years, many techniques
have been developed to mitigate this issue, data vectorization, in particular,
is arguably still the most attractive strategy due to the parallel nature of
GP. In this work, we employ a series of benchmarks meant to compare both the
performance and evolution capabilities of different vectorized and iterative
implementation approaches across several existing frameworks. Namely, TensorGP,
a novel open-source engine written in Python, is shown to greatly benefit from
the TensorFlow library to accelerate the domain evaluation phase in GP. The
presented performance benchmarks demonstrate that the TensorGP engine manages
to pull ahead, with relative speedups above two orders of magnitude for
problems with a higher number of fitness cases. Additionally, as a consequence
of being able to compute larger domains, we argue that TensorGP performance
gains aid the discovery of more accurate candidate solutions.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11908</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this work, we extend standard neural networks by building upon an
assumption that neuronal activations correspond to the angle of a complex
number lying on the unit circle, or 'phasor.' Each layer in such a network
produces new activations by taking a weighted superposition of the previous
layer's phases and calculating the new phase value. This generalized
architecture allows models to reach high accuracy and carries the singular
advantage that mathematically equivalent versions of the network can be
executed with or without regard to a temporal variable. Importantly, the value
of a phase angle in the temporal domain can be sparsely represented by a
periodically repeating series of delta functions or 'spikes'. We demonstrate
the atemporal training of a phasor network on standard deep learning tasks and
show that these networks can then be executed in either the traditional
atemporal domain or spiking temporal domain with no conversion step needed.
This provides a novel basis for constructing deep networkswhich operate via
temporal, spike-based calculations suitable for neuromorphic computing
hardware.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11872</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The quest for determinism in machine learning has disproportionately focused
on characterizing the impact of noise introduced by algorithmic design choices.
In this work, we address a less well understood and studied question: how does
our choice of tooling introduce randomness to deep neural network training. We
conduct large scale experiments across different types of hardware,
accelerators, state of art networks, and open-source datasets, to characterize
how tooling choices contribute to the level of non-determinism in a system, the
impact of said non-determinism, and the cost of eliminating different sources
of noise.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings are surprising, and suggest that the impact of non-determinism
in nuanced. While top-line metrics such as top-1 accuracy are not noticeably
impacted, model performance on certain parts of the data distribution is far
more sensitive to the introduction of randomness. Our results suggest that
deterministic tooling is critical for AI safety. However, we also find that the
cost of ensuring determinism varies dramatically between neural network
architectures and hardware types, e.g., with overhead up to $746\%$, $241\%$,
and $196\%$ on a spectrum of widely used GPU accelerator architectures,
relative to non-deterministic training. The source code used in this paper is

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Since the rising of the takeaway ordering platform, the M platform has taken
the lead in the industry with its high-quality service. The increasing order
volume leads the competition between platforms to reduce the distribution cost,
which increases rapidly because of the unreasonable distribution route. By
analyzing platform distribution's current situation, we study the vehicle
routing problem of urban distribution on the M platform and minimize the
distribution cost. Considering the constraints of the customer's expected
delivery time and vehicle condition, we combine the different arrival times of
the vehicle routing problem model using three soft time windows and solve the
problem using a genetic algorithm (GA). The results show that our model and

of distribution cost and delivery time, thus providing decision support for the

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: A Logical Neural Network Structure With More Direct Mapping From Logical Relations. (arXiv:2106.11463v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11463</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Logical relations widely exist in human activities. Human use them for making
judgement and decision according to various conditions, which are embodied in
the form of \emph{if-then} rules. As an important kind of cognitive
intelligence, it is prerequisite of representing and storing logical relations
rightly into computer systems so as to make automatic judgement and decision,
especially for high-risk domains like medical diagnosis. However, current
numeric ANN (Artificial Neural Network) models are good at perceptual
intelligence such as image recognition while they are not good at cognitive
intelligence such as logical representation, blocking the further application
of ANN. To solve it, researchers have tried to design logical ANN models to
represent and store logical relations. Although there are some advances in this
research area, recent works still have disadvantages because the structures of
these logical ANN models still don't map more directly with logical relations
which will cause the corresponding logical relations cannot be read out from
their network structures. Therefore, in order to represent logical relations
more clearly by the neural network structure and to read out logical relations
from it, this paper proposes a novel logical ANN model by designing the new
logical neurons and links in demand of logical representation. Compared with
the recent works on logical ANN models, this logical ANN model has more clear
corresponding with logical relations using the more direct mapping method
herein, thus logical relations can be read out following the connection
patterns of the network structure. Additionally, less neurons are used.

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Fetal Neuroprotective Strategies: Therapeutic Agents and Their Underlying Synaptic Pathways</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2021.680899</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Synaptic signaling is integral for proper brain function. During fetal development, exposure to inflammation or mild hypoxic-ischemic insult may lead to synaptic changes and neurological damage that impairs future brain function. Preterm neonates are most susceptible to these deleterious outcomes. Evaluating clinically used and novel fetal neuroprotective measures is essential for expanding treatment options to mitigate the short and long-term consequences of fetal brain injury. Magnesium sulfate is a clinical fetal neuroprotective agent utilized in cases of imminent preterm birth. By blocking N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, magnesium sulfate reduces glutamatergic signaling, which alters calcium influx, leading to a decrease in excitotoxicity. Emerging evidence suggests that melatonin and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) may also serve as novel putative fetal neuroprotective candidates. Melatonin has important anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties and is a known mediator of synaptic plasticity and neuronal generation. While NAC acts as an antioxidant and a precursor to glutathione, it also modulates the glutamate system. Glutamate excitotoxicity and dysregulation can induce perinatal preterm brain injury through damage to maturing oligodendrocytes and neurons. The improved drug efficacy and delivery of the dendrimer-bound NAC conjugate provides an opportunity for enhanced pharmacological intervention. Here, we review recent literature on the synaptic pathways underlying these therapeutic strategies, discuss the current gaps in knowledge, and propose future directions for the field of fetal neuroprotective agents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Duration Comparisons for Vision and Touch Are Dependent on Presentation Order and Temporal Context</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2021.664264</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Integrating visual and tactile information in the temporal domain is critical for active perception. To accomplish this, coordinated timing is required. Here, we study perceived duration within and across these two modalities. Specifically, we examined how duration comparisons within and across vision and touch were influenced by temporal context and presentation order using a two-interval forced choice task. We asked participants to compare the duration of two temporal intervals defined by tactile or visual events. Two constant standard durations (700 ms and 1,000 ms in ‘shorter’ sessions; 1,000 ms and 1,500 ms in ‘longer’ sessions) were compared to variable comparison durations in different sessions. In crossmodal trials, standard and comparison durations were presented in different modalities, whereas in the intramodal trials, the two durations were presented in the same modality. The standard duration was either presented first (&amp;lt;sc&amp;gt;) or followed the comparison duration (&amp;lt;cs&amp;gt;). In both crossmodal and intramodal conditions, we found that the longer standard duration was overestimated in &amp;lt;cs&amp;gt; trials and underestimated in &amp;lt;sc&amp;gt; trials whereas the estimation of shorter standard duration was unbiased. Importantly, the estimation of 1,000ms was biased when it was the longer standard duration within the shorter sessions but not when it was the shorter standard duration within the longer sessions, indicating an effect of temporal context. The effects of presentation order can be explained by a central tendency effect applied in different ways to different presentation orders. Both crossmodal and intramodal conditions showed better discrimination performance for &amp;lt;sc&amp;gt; trials than &amp;lt;cs&amp;gt; trials, supporting the Type B effect for both crossmodal and intramodal duration comparison. Moreover, these results were not dependent on whether the standard duration was defined using tactile or visual stimuli. Overall, our results indicate that duration comparison between vision and touch is dependent on presentation order and temporal context, but not modality.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Cognitive Profiles of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Differ in Resting-State Functional Connectivity: An fMRI Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.682100</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Half of all amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-frontotemporal spectrum disorder (ALS-FTSD) patients are classified as cognitively impaired, of which 10% have frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and an additional 40% suffer from a frontotemporal syndrome not severe enough to be described as dementia (cognitively impaired/ALSci). As changes in cerebral function measured by resting-state magnet resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) are known in ALS, we investigated whether group differences in resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) networks could be observed between ALS patients with different cognitive profiles against healthy controls (HC). Furthermore, we correlated cognition and motor functioning with network connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Healthy controls, 69, and 97 ALS patients underwent functional MRI scanning and cognitive assessment. The ALS patients were categorized as non-impaired (ALSni; n = 68), cognitively impaired (ALSci; n = 21), and ALS-FTD (n = 8). Group differences in connectivity of the default mode network (DMN), motor network (MN), and ventral attention network (VAN) were investigated using a full-factorial model; correlations between global cognitive performance, shifting, and motor symptom severity were established using Pearson’s correlation.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;At a liberal alpha level of uncorrected p &amp;lt; 0.005 and a cluster size exceeding 20 voxels, we found widespread decreases in functional connectivity in all three networks when comparing ALS patients to HC. Similar patterns of hypoconnectivity in the bilateral motor cortices and frontotemporal emerged when comparing the ALSci and ALS-FTD patients to those not cognitively impaired. Hyperconnectivity in the DMN temporal gyrus correlated with worse global cognition; moreover, hyperconnectivity in the VAN thalamus, insula, and putamen correlated with worse shifting ability. Better-preserved motor function correlated with higher MN connectivity. Only the motor-related effects prevailed at a more conservative significance level of p&lt;sub&gt;FDR&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;lt; 0.001.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Resting-state functional connectivity differs between cognitive profiles of ALS and is directly associated with clinical presentation, specifically with motor function, and cognitive shifting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.652608</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Light-activated biointerfaces provide a non-genetic route for effective control of neural activity. InP quantum dots (QDs) have a high potential for such biomedical applications due to their uniquely tunable electronic properties, photostability, toxic-heavy-metal-free content, heterostructuring, and solution-processing ability. However, the effect of QD nanostructure and biointerface architecture on the photoelectrical cellular interfacing remained unexplored. Here, we unravel the control of the photoelectrical response of InP QD-based biointerfaces via nanoengineering from QD to device-level. At QD level, thin ZnS shell growth (∼0.65 nm) enhances the current level of biointerfaces over an order of magnitude with respect to only InP core QDs. At device-level, band alignment engineering allows for the bidirectional photoelectrochemical current generation, which enables light-induced temporally precise and rapidly reversible action potential generation and hyperpolarization on primary hippocampal neurons. Our findings show that nanoengineering QD-based biointerfaces hold great promise for next-generation neurostimulation devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neural Correlates of Causal Inferences in Discourse Understanding and Logical Problem-Solving: A Meta-Analysis Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.666179</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In discourse comprehension, we need to draw inferences to make sense of discourse. Previous neuroimaging studies have investigated the neural correlates of causal inferences in discourse understanding. However, these findings have been divergent, and how these types of inferences are related to causal inferences in logical problem-solving remains unclear. Using the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) approach, the current meta-analysis analyzed 19 experiments on causal inferences in discourse understanding and 20 experiments on those in logical problem-solving to identify the neural correlates of these two cognitive processes and their shared and distinct neural correlates. We found that causal inferences in discourse comprehension recruited a left-lateralized frontotemporal brain system, including the left inferior frontal gyrus, the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG), and the bilateral medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), while causal inferences in logical problem-solving engaged a nonoverlapping brain system in the frontal and parietal cortex, including the left inferior frontal gyrus, the bilateral middle frontal gyri, the dorsal MPFC, and the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL). Furthermore, the pattern similarity analyses showed that causal inferences in discourse understanding were primarily related to the terms about language processing and theory-of-mind processing. Both types of inferences were found to be related to the terms about memory and executive function. These findings suggest that causal inferences in discourse understanding recruit distinct neural bases from those in logical problem-solving and rely more on semantic knowledge and social interaction experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: A Comparison of Closed Loop vs. Fixed Frequency tACS on Modulating Brain Oscillations and Visual Detection</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.661432</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transcranial alternating current stimulation has emerged as an effective tool for the exploration of brain oscillations. By applying a weak alternating current between electrodes placed on the scalp matched to the endogenous frequency, tACS enables the specific modulation of targeted brain oscillations This results in alterations in cognitive functions or persistent physiological changes. Most studies that utilize tACS determine a fixed stimulation frequency prior to the stimulation that is kept constant throughout the experiment. Yet it is known that brain rhythms can encounter shifts in their endogenous frequency. This could potentially move the ongoing brain oscillations into a frequency region where it is no longer affected by the stimulation, thereby decreasing or negating the effect of tACS. Such an effect of a mismatch between stimulation frequency and endogenous frequency on the outcome of stimulation has been shown before for the parietal alpha-activity. In this study, we employed an intermittent closed loop stimulation protocol, where the stimulation is divided into short epochs, between which an EEG is recorded and rapidly analyzed to determine a new stimulation frequency for the next stimulation epoch. This stimulation protocol was tested in a three-group study against a classical fixed stimulation protocol and a sham-treatment. We targeted the parietal alpha rhythm and hypothesized that this setup will ensure a constant close match between the frequencies of tACS and alpha activity. This closer match should lead to an increased modulation of detection of visual luminance changes depending on the phase of the tACS and an increased rise in alpha peak power post stimulation when compared to a protocol with fixed pre-determined stimulation frequency. Contrary to our hypothesis, our results show that only a fixed stimulation protocol leads to a persistent increase in post-stimulation alpha power as compared to sham. Furthermore, in none of the stimulated groups significant modulation of detection performance occurred. While the lack of behavioral effects is inconclusive due to the short selection of different phase bins and trials, the physiological results suggest that a constant stimulation with a fixed frequency is actually beneficial, when the goal is to produce persistent synaptic changes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: BENDR: Using Transformers and a Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning Task to Learn From Massive Amounts of EEG Data</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.653659</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep neural networks (DNNs) used for brain–computer interface (BCI) classification are commonly expected to learn general features when trained across a variety of contexts, such that these features could be fine-tuned to specific contexts. While some success is found in such an approach, we suggest that this interpretation is limited and an alternative would better leverage the newly (publicly) available massive electroencephalography (EEG) datasets. We consider how to adapt techniques and architectures used for language modeling (LM) that appear capable of ingesting awesome amounts of data toward the development of encephalography modeling with DNNs in the same vein. We specifically adapt an approach effectively used for automatic speech recognition, which similarly (to LMs) uses a self-supervised training objective to learn compressed representations of raw data signals. After adaptation to EEG, we find that a single pre-trained model is capable of modeling completely novel raw EEG sequences recorded with differing hardware, and different subjects performing different tasks. Furthermore, both the internal representations of this model and the entire architecture can be fine-tuned to a variety of downstream BCI and EEG classification tasks, outperforming prior work in more task-specific (sleep stage classification) self-supervision.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Enhanced Information Flow From Cerebellum to Secondary Visual Cortices Leads to Better Surgery Outcome in Degenerative Cervical Myelopathy Patients: A Stochastic Dynamic Causal Modeling Study With Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.632829</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) damages the spinal cord, resulting in long-term neurological impairment including motor and visual deficits. Given that visual feedback is crucial in guiding movements, the visual disorder may be a cause of motor deficits in patients with DCM. It has been shown that increased functional connectivity between secondary visual cortices and cerebellum, which are functionally related to the visually guided movements, was correlated with motor function in patients with DCM. One possible explanation is that the information integration between these regions was increased to compensate for impaired visual acuity in patients with DCM and resulted in better visual feedback during motor function. However, direct evidence supporting this hypothesis is lacking. To test this hypothesis and explore in more detail the information flow within the “visual-cerebellum” system, we measured the effective connectivity (EC) among the “visual-cerebellum” system via dynamic causal modeling and then tested the relationship between the EC and visual ability in patients with DCM. Furthermore, the multivariate pattern analysis was performed to detect the relationship between the pattern of EC and motor function in patients with DCM. We found (1) significant increases of the bidirectional connections between bilateral secondary visual cortices and cerebellum were observed in patients with DCM; (2) the increased self-connection of the cerebellum was positively correlated with the impaired visual acuity in patients; (3) the amplitude of effectivity from the cerebellum to secondary visual cortices was positively correlated with better visual recovery following spinal cord decompression surgery; and (4) the pattern of EC among the visual-cerebellum system could be used to predict the pre-operative motor function. In conclusion, this study provided direct evidence that the increased information integration within the “visual-cerebellum” system compensated for visual impairments, which might have importance for sustaining better motor function in patients with DCM.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Neuroinflammation-Driven Lymphangiogenesis in CNS Diseases</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.683676</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The central nervous system (CNS) undergoes immunosurveillance despite the lack of conventional antigen presenting cells and lymphatic vessels in the CNS parenchyma. Additionally, the CNS is bathed in a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF is continuously produced, and consequently must continuously clear to maintain fluid homeostasis despite the lack of conventional lymphatics. During neuroinflammation, there is often an accumulation of fluid, antigens, and immune cells to affected areas of the brain parenchyma. Failure to effectively drain these factors may result in edema, prolonged immune response, and adverse clinical outcome as observed in conditions including traumatic brain injury, ischemic and hypoxic brain injury, CNS infection, multiple sclerosis (MS), and brain cancer. Consequently, there has been renewed interest surrounding the expansion of lymphatic vessels adjacent to the CNS which are now thought to be central in regulating the drainage of fluid, cells, and waste out of the CNS. These lymphatic vessels, found at the cribriform plate, dorsal dural meninges, base of the brain, and around the spinal cord have each been implicated to have important roles in various CNS diseases. In this review, we discuss the contribution of meningeal lymphatics to these processes during both steady-state conditions and neuroinflammation, as well as discuss some of the many still unknown aspects regarding the role of meningeal lymphatics in neuroinflammation. Specifically, we focus on the observed phenomenon of lymphangiogenesis by a subset of meningeal lymphatics near the cribriform plate during neuroinflammation, and discuss their potential roles in immunosurveillance, fluid clearance, and access to the CSF and CNS compartments. We propose that manipulating CNS lymphatics may be a new therapeutic way to treat CNS infections, stroke, and autoimmunity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Reissner’s fiber (RF) is a secreted filament that floats in the neural canal of chordates. Since its discovery in 1860, there has been no agreement on its primary function, and its strong conservation across chordate species has remained a mystery for comparative neuroanatomists. Several findings, including the chemical composition and the phylogenetic history of RF, clinical observations associating RF with the development of the neural canal, and more recent studies suggesting that RF is needed to develop a straight vertebral column, may shed light on the functions of this structure across chordates. In this article, we will briefly review the evidence mentioned above to suggest a role of RF in the origin of fundamental innovations of the chordate body plan, especially the elongation of the neural tube and maintenance of the body axis. We will also mention the relevance of RF for medical conditions like hydrocephalus, scoliosis of the vertebral spine and possibly regeneration of the spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.696376</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Oligodendrocytes are the myelinating cells of the central nervous system. They provide trophic, metabolic, and structural support to neurons. In several pathologies such as multiple sclerosis (MS), these cells are severely affected and fail to remyelinate, thereby leading to neuronal death. The gold standard for studying remyelination is the g-ratio, which is measured by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Therefore, studying the fine structure of the oligodendrocyte population in the human brain at different stages through TEM is a key feature in this field of study. Here we study the ultrastructure of oligodendrocytes, its progenitors, and myelin in 10 samples of human white matter using nine different markers of the oligodendrocyte lineage (NG2, PDGFRα, A2B5, Sox10, Olig2, BCAS1, APC-(CC1), MAG, and MBP). Our findings show that human oligodendrocytes constitute a very heterogeneous population within the human white matter and that its stages of differentiation present characteristic features that can be used to identify them by TEM. This study sheds light on how these cells interact with other cells within the human brain and clarify their fine characteristics from other glial cell types.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Despite emerging evidence suggesting that visceral fat may play a major role in obesity-induced neurodegeneration, little evidence exists on the association between visceral fat and brain cortical thickness in the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;Purpose&lt;p&gt;We aimed to examine the association between abdominal fat and brain cortical thickness in a Korean elderly population.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;This cross-sectional study included elderly individuals without dementia (n = 316). Areas of visceral fat and subcutaneous fat (cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) were estimated from computed tomography scans. Regional cortical thicknesses (mm) were obtained by analyzing brain magnetic resonance images. Given the inverted U-shaped relationship between visceral fat area and global cortical thickness (examined using a generalized additive model), visceral fat area was categorized into quintiles, with the middle quintile being the reference group. A generalized linear model was built to explore brain regions associated with visceral fat. The same approach was used for subcutaneous fat.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The mean (standard deviation) age was 67.6 (5.0) years. The highest quintile (vs. the middle quintile) group of visceral fat area had reduced cortical thicknesses in the global [β = –0.04 mm, standard error (SE) = 0.02 mm, p = 0.004], parietal (β = –0.04 mm, SE = 0.02 mm, p = 0.01), temporal (β = –0.05 mm, SE = 0.02 mm, p = 0.002), cingulate (β = –0.06 mm, SE = 0.02 mm, p = 0.01), and insula lobes (β = –0.06 mm, SE = 0.03 mm, p = 0.02). None of the regional cortical thicknesses significantly differed between the highest and the middle quintile groups of subcutaneous fat area.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that a high level of visceral fat, but not subcutaneous fat, is associated with a reduced cortical thickness in the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Role of Protein Persulfidation in Brain Aging and Neurodegeneration</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.674135</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S), originally considered a toxic gas, is now a recognized gasotransmitter. Numerous studies have revealed the role of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S as a redox signaling molecule that controls important physiological/pathophysiological functions. The underlying mechanism postulated to serve as an explanation of these effects is protein persulfidation (P-SSH, also known as S-sulfhydration), an oxidative posttranslational modification of cysteine thiols. Protein persulfidation has remained understudied due to its instability and chemical reactivity similar to other cysteine modifications, making it very difficult to selectively label. Recent developments of persulfide labeling techniques have started unraveling the role of this modification in (patho)physiology. PSSH levels are important for the cellular defense against oxidative injury, albeit they decrease with aging, leaving proteins vulnerable to oxidative damage. Aging is one of the main risk factors for many neurodegenerative diseases. Persulfidation has been shown to be dysregulated in Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, Huntington's disease, and Spinocerebellar ataxia 3. This article reviews the latest discoveries that link protein persulfidation, aging and neurodegeneration, and provides future directions for this research field that could result in development of targeted drug design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.670463</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is frequently presumed to be secondary to cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) and associated with cognitive decline. The cerebellum plays a key role in cognition and has dense connections with other brain regions. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate if cerebellar abnormalities could occur in CSVD patients with WMHs and the possible association with cognitive performances.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A total of 104 right-handed patients with WMHs were divided into the mild WMHs group (n = 39), moderate WMHs group (n = 37), and severe WMHs group (n = 28) according to the Fazekas scale, and 36 healthy controls were matched for sex ratio, age, education years, and acquired resting-state functional MRI. Analysis of voxel-based morphometry of gray matter volume (GMV) and seed-to-whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) was performed from the perspective of the cerebellum, and their correlations with neuropsychological variables were explored.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed a lower GMV in the bilateral cerebellum lobule VI and decreased FC between the left- and right-sided cerebellar lobule VI with the left anterior cingulate gyri in CSVD patients with WMHs. Both changes in structure and function were correlated with cognitive impairment in patients with WMHs.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our study revealed damaged GMV and FC in the cerebellum associated with cognitive impairment. This indicates that the cerebellum may play a key role in the modulation of cognitive function in CSVD patients with WMHs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.650740</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cytoplasmic ribonucleoproteins called stress granules (SGs) are considered as one of the main cellular solutions against stress. Their temporary presence ends with stress relief. Any factor such as chronic stress or mutations in the structure of the components of SGs that lead to their permanent presence can affect their interactions with pathological aggregations and increase the degenerative effects. SGs involved in RNA mechanisms are important factors in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal degeneration (FTD), and Alzheimer's diseases (AD). Although many studies have been performed in the field of SGs and neurodegenerative disorders, so far, no systematic studies have been executed in this field. The purpose of this study is to provide a comprehensive perspective of all studies about the role of SGs in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders with a focus on the protein ingredients of these granules. This scoping review is based on a six-stage methodology structure and the PRISMA guideline. A systematic search of seven databases for qualified articles was conducted until December 2020. Publications were screened independently by two reviewers and quantitative and qualitative analysis was performed on the extracted data. Bioinformatics analysis was used to plot the network and predict interprotein interactions. In addition, GO analysis was performed. A total of 48 articles were identified that comply the inclusion criteria. Most studies on neurodegenerative diseases have been conducted on ALS, AD, and FTD using human post mortem tissues. Human derived cell line studies have been used only in ALS. A total 29 genes of protein components of SGs have been studied, the most important of which are TDP-43, TIA-1, PABP-1. Bioinformatics studies have predicted 15 proteins to interact with the protein components of SGs, which may be the constituents of SGs. Understanding the interactions between SGs and pathological aggregations in neurodegenerative diseases can provide new targets for treatment of these disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/70339</link>
	<content:encoded>The dynamics and diversity of the appearance of genetic variants play an essential role in the evolution of the genome and the shaping of biodiversity. Recent population-wide genome sequencing surveys have highlighted the importance of loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) events and have shown that they are a neglected part of the genetic diversity landscape. To assess the extent, variability, and spectrum, we explored the accumulation of LOH events in 169 heterozygous diploid &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; mutation accumulation lines across nine genetic backgrounds. In total, we detected a large set of 22,828 LOH events across distinct genetic backgrounds with a heterozygous level ranging from 0.1 to 1%. LOH events are very frequent with a rate consistently much higher than the mutation rate, showing their importance for genome evolution. We observed that the interstitial LOH (I-LOH) events, resulting in internal short LOH tracts, were much frequent (n = 19,660) than the terminal LOH (T-LOH) events, &lt;i&gt;i.e.,&lt;/i&gt; tracts extending to the end of the chromosome (n = 3,168). However, the spectrum, the rate, and the fraction of the genome under LOH vary across genetic backgrounds. Interestingly, we observed that the more the ancestors were heterozygous, the more they accumulated T-LOH events. In addition, frequent short I-LOH tracts are a signature of the lines derived from hybrids with low spore fertility. Finally, we found lines showing almost complete homozygotization during vegetative progression. Overall, our results highlight that the variable dynamics of the LOH accumulation across distinct genetic backgrounds might lead to rapid differential genome evolution during vegetative growth.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/69454</link>
	<content:encoded>Targeting DNA repair pathway offers an important therapeutic strategy for Homo sapiens (human) cancers. However, the failure of DNA repair inhibitors to markedly benefit patients necessitates the development of new strategies. Here, we show that exosome component 1 (EXOSC1) promotes DNA damages and sensitizes human kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) cells to DNA repair inhibitor. Considering that endogenous source of mutation (ESM) constantly assaults genomic DNA and likely sensitize human cancer cells to the inhibitor, we first analyzed the statistical relationship between the expression of individual genes and the mutations for KIRC. Among the candidates, EXOSC1 most notably promoted DNA damages and subsequent mutations via preferentially cleaving C site(s) in single-stranded DNA. Consistently, EXOSC1 was more significantly correlated with C&amp;gt;A transversions in coding strands than these in template strands in human KIRC. Notably, KIRC patients with high EXOSC1 showed a poor prognosis, and EXOSC1 sensitized human cancer cells to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor. These results show that EXOSC1 acts as an ESM in KIRC, and targeting EXOSC1 might be a potential therapeutic strategy.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>We introduce Neurable's research on focus using our recently developed Enten EEG headphones. First we quantify Enten's performance on standard EEG protocols, including eyes-closed alpha rhythms, auditory evoked response and the P300 event-related potential paradigm. We show that Enten's performance is on-par with established industry-standard hardware. We then introduce a series of experimental tasks designed to mimic how focus might be maintained or disrupted in a real-world office setting. We show that (A) these tasks induce behavioral changes that reflect underlying changes in focus levels and (B) our proprietary algorithm detects these changes across a large number of sessions without needing to adjust the model per participant or recording session. Through manipulation of our experimental protocol, we show that our algorithm is not dependent on gross EMG artifacts and it is driven by changes in EEG. Finally, we evaluated the model's performance on the same subject across several days, and show that performance remained consistent over time. Our model correctly captured 80% {+/-} 4.1% of distractions present in our experiments with statistical significance. This indicates that our model generalizes across subjects, time points, and conditions. Our findings are based on EEG data collected from 132 participants across 337 sessions and 45 different experiments.</content:encoded>

Lung cancer is still a leading cause of death worldwide. In recent years, knowledge has been obtained of the mechanisms modulating ion channel kinetics and thus of cell bioelectric properties, which is promising for oncological biomarkers and targets. The complex interplay of channel expression and its consequences on malignant processes, however, is still insufficiently understood. We here introduce the first approach of an in-silico whole-cell ion current model of a cancer cell, in particular of the A549 human lung adenocarcinoma, including the main functionally expressed ion channels in the plasma membrane as so far known. This hidden Markov-based model represents the electrophysiology behind proliferation of the A549 cell, describing its rhythmic oscillation of the membrane potential able to trigger the transition between cell cycle phases, and it predicts membrane potential changes over the cell cycle provoked by targeted ion channel modulation. This first A549 in-silico cell model opens up a deeper insight and understanding of possible ion channel interactions in tumor development and progression, and is a valuable tool for simulating altered ion channel function in lung cancer electrophysiology.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QAN6p9QfX0M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We study the Witten-type topological field theory(W-TFT) of self-organized
criticality(SOC) for stochastic neural networks. The Parisi-Sourlas-Wu
quantization of general stochastic differential equations (SDEs) for neural
networks, the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin(BRST)-symmetry of the diffusion system
and the relation between spontaneous breaking and instantons connecting steady
states of the SDEs, as well as the sufficient and necessary condition on
pseudo-supersymmetric stochastic neural networks are obtained. Suppose neuronal
avalanche is a mechanism of cortical information processing and storage
\cite{Beggs}\cite{Plenz1}\cite{Plenz2} and the model of stochastic neural
networks\cite{Dayan} is correct, as well as the SOC system can be looked upon
as a W-TFT with spontaneously broken BRST symmetry. Then we should recover the
neuronal avalanches and spontaneously broken BRST symmetry from the model of
stochastic neural networks. We find that, provided the divergence of drift
coefficients is small and non-constant, the BRST symmetry for the model of
stochastic neural networks is spontaneously broken. That is, if the SOC of
brain neural networks system can be looked upon as a W-TFT with spontaneously
broken BRST symmetry, then the general model of stochastic neural networks
which be extensively used in neuroscience \cite{Dayan} is enough to describe
the SOC. On the other hand, using the Fokker-Planck equation, we show the
sufficient condition on diffusion so that the behavior of the stochastic neural
networks approximate to a stationary Markov process. Rhythms of the firing
rates of the neuronal networks arise from the process, meanwhile some
biological laws are conserved.

node-centric FC (nFC). Our exposition also constitutes a critique of the
edge-centric approach as currently applied to functional MRI (fMRI) time
series. The central argument is that the existing findings based on edge time
series can be derived from the static nFC under a null hypothesis that only
accounts for the observed static spatial correlations and not the temporal
ones. Challenging our analytic predictions against fMRI data from the Human
Connectome Project confirms that the nFC is sufficient to replicate the eFC
matrix, the edge communities, the large cofluctuations, and the corresponding
brain activity mode. We conclude that the temporal structure of the edge time
series has not so far been exploited sufficiently and encourage further work to
explore features that cannot be explained by the presented static null model.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Experimentally testable whole brain manifolds that recapitulate behavior. (arXiv:2106.10627v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10627</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We propose an algorithm grounded in dynamical systems theory that generalizes
manifold learning from a global state representation, to a network of local
interacting manifolds termed a Generative Manifold Network (GMN). Manifolds are
discovered using the convergent cross mapping (CCM) causal inference algorithm
which are then compressed into a reduced redundancy network. The representation
is a network of manifolds embedded from observational data where each
orthogonal axis of a local manifold is an embedding of a individually
identifiable neuron or brain area that has exact correspondence in the real
world. As such these can be experimentally manipulated to test hypotheses
derived from theory and data analysis. Here we demonstrate that this
representation preserves the essential features of the brain of flies,larval
zebrafish and humans. In addition to accurate near-term prediction, the GMN
model can be used to synthesize realistic time series of whole brain neuronal
activity and locomotion viewed over the long term. Thus, as a final validation
of how well GMN captures essential dynamic information, we show that the
artificially generated time series can be used as a training set to predict
out-of-sample observed fly locomotion, as well as brain activity in out of
sample withheld data not used in model building. Remarkably, the artificially
generated time series show realistic novel behaviors that do not exist in the
training data, but that do exist in the out-of-sample observational data. This
suggests that GMN captures inherently emergent properties of the network. We
suggest our approach may be a generic recipe for mapping time series
observations of any complex nonlinear network into a model that is able to
generate naturalistic system behaviors that identifies variables that have real
world correspondence and can be experimentally manipulated.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10575</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Gradient-based meta-learning and hyperparameter optimization have seen
significant progress recently, enabling practical end-to-end training of neural
networks together with many hyperparameters. Nevertheless, existing approaches
are relatively expensive as they need to compute second-order derivatives and
store a longer computational graph. This cost prevents scaling them to larger
network architectures. We present EvoGrad, a new approach to meta-learning that
draws upon evolutionary techniques to more efficiently compute hypergradients.
EvoGrad estimates hypergradient with respect to hyperparameters without
calculating second-order gradients, or storing a longer computational graph,
leading to significant improvements in efficiency. We evaluate EvoGrad on two
substantial recent meta-learning applications, namely cross-domain few-shot
learning with feature-wise transformations and noisy label learning with
MetaWeightNet. The results show that EvoGrad significantly improves efficiency
and enables scaling meta-learning to bigger CNN architectures such as from
ResNet18 to ResNet34.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10344</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Attention is an indispensable component of active vision. Contrary to the
widely accepted notion that temporal cortex processing primarily focusses on
passive object recognition, a series of very recent studies emphasize the role
of temporal cortex structures, specifically the superior temporal sulcus (STS)
and inferotemporal (IT) cortex, in guiding attention and implementing cognitive
programs relevant for behavioral tasks. The goal of this review is to advance
the hypothesis that the temporal cortex, classically thought to be only
involved in object recognition, entails necessary components to actively
participate in attentional control in a flexible task-dependent manner. First,
we will briefly discuss the general architecture of the temporal cortex with a
focus on the STS and IT cortex and their modulation with attention. Then we
will review evidence from behavioral and neurophysiological studies that
support their guidance of attention in the presence of cognitive control
signals. Next, we propose a mechanistic framework for executive control of
attention in the temporal cortex. Finally, we summarize the role of temporal
cortex in implementing cognitive programs and discuss how they contribute to
the dynamic nature of visual attention to ensure flexible behavior.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Integration of Simultaneous Resting-State Electroencephalography, Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and Eye-Tracker Methods to Determine and Verify Electroencephalography Vigilance Measure. (arXiv:1912.04975v2 [eess.SP] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04975</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background/Introduction: Concurrent electroencephalography and resting-state
functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) have been widely used for
studying the (presumably) awake and alert human brain with high
temporal/spatial resolution. Although rsfMRI scans are typically collected
while individuals are instructed to focus their eyes on a fixated cross,
objective and verified experimental measures to quantify degree of vigilance
are not readily available. Electroencephalography (EEG) is the modality
extensively used for estimating vigilance, especially during eyes-closed
resting state. However, pupil size measured using an eye-tracker device could
provide an indirect index of vigilance. Methods: Three 12-min resting scans
(eyes open, fixating on the cross) were collected from 10 healthy control
participants. We simultaneously collected EEG, fMRI, physiological, and
eye-tracker data and investigated the correlation between EEG features, pupil
size, and heart rate. Furthermore, we used pupil size and EEG features as
regressors to find their correlations with blood-oxygen-level-dependent fMRI
measures. Results: EEG frontal and occipital beta power (FOBP) correlates with
pupil size changes, an indirect index for locus coeruleus activity implicated
in vigilance regulation (r = 0.306, p &amp;lt; 0.001). Moreover, FOBP also correlated
with heart rate (r = 0.255, p &amp;lt; 0.001), as well as several brain regions in the
anticorrelated network, including the bilateral insula and inferior parietal
lobule. Discussion: In this study, we investigated whether simultaneous
EEG-fMRI combined with eye-tracker measurements can be used to determine EEG
signal feature associated with vigilance measures during eyes-open rsfMRI. Our
results support the conclusion that FOBP is an objective measure of vigilance
in healthy human subjects.

	<title>The Cerebellum: Can Dyssynergia of Vestibulosympathetic and Baroreflexes Cause Vestibular Syncope? The Hypothesis Based on the Velocity-Storage Function</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-021-01296-x</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The mechanism of vestibular syncope, the syncope occurring during the vertigo attacks, remains uncertain. This study aims to clarify the mechanism of vestibular syncope by pursuing the function of vestibular system in cardiovascular autonomic control and by defining neuro-hemodynamic changes in vestibular syncope. By integrating the velocity-storage (VS) circuit in the brainstem and cerebellum, we propose that the vestibular syncope develops as a result of dyssynergia of the vestibulosympathetic and baroreflexes in which centrally estimated downward inertial acceleration during the vertigo attacks acts as a trigger. Recognition of the vestibular disorders as a possible cause of syncope would allow proper managements for prevention of further syncope and related complications in patients with vestibular disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Effect of Unilateral Acoustic Trauma on Neuronal Firing Activity in the Inferior Colliculus of Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2021.684141</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural hyperactivity induced by sound exposure often correlates with the development of hyperacusis and/or tinnitus. In laboratory animals, hyperactivity is typically induced by unilateral sound exposure to preserve one ear for further testing of hearing performance. Most ascending fibers in the auditory system cross into the superior olivary complex and then ascend contralaterally. Therefore, unilateral exposure should be expected to mostly affect the contralateral side above the auditory brain stem. On the other hand, it is well known that a significant number of neurons have crossing fibers at every level of the auditory pathway, which may spread the effect of unilateral exposure onto the ipsilateral side. Here we demonstrate that unilateral sound exposure causes development of hyperactivity in both the contra and ipsilateral inferior colliculus in mice. We found that both the spontaneous firing rate and bursting activity were increased significantly compared to unexposed mice. The neurons with characteristic frequencies at or above the center frequency of exposure showed the greatest increase. Surprisingly, this increase was more pronounced in the ipsilateral inferior colliculus. This study highlights the importance of considering both ipsi- and contralateral effects in future studies utilizing unilateral sound exposure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Clinical Application of Machine Learning Models for Brain Imaging in Epilepsy: A Review</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.684825</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterized by recurrent and disabling seizures. An increasing number of clinical and experimental applications of machine learning (ML) methods for epilepsy and other neurological and psychiatric disorders are available. ML methods have the potential to provide a reliable and optimal performance for clinical diagnoses, prediction, and personalized medicine by using mathematical algorithms and computational approaches. There are now several applications of ML for epilepsy, including neuroimaging analyses. For precise and reliable clinical applications in epilepsy and neuroimaging, the diverse ML methodologies should be examined and validated. We review the clinical applications of ML models for brain imaging in epilepsy obtained from a PubMed database search in February 2021. We first present an overview of typical neuroimaging modalities and ML models used in the epilepsy studies and then focus on the existing applications of ML models for brain imaging in epilepsy based on the following clinical aspects: (i) distinguishing individuals with epilepsy from healthy controls, (ii) lateralization of the temporal lobe epilepsy focus, (iii) the identification of epileptogenic foci, (iv) the prediction of clinical outcomes, and (v) brain-age prediction. We address the practical problems and challenges described in the literature and suggest some future research directions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Small, Seeding-Competent Huntingtin Fibrils Are Prominent Aggregate Species in Brains of zQ175 Huntington’s Disease Knock-in Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.682172</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The deposition of mutant huntingtin (mHTT) protein aggregates in neurons of patients is a pathological hallmark of Huntington’s disease (HD). Previous investigations in cell-free and cell-based disease models showed mHTT exon-1 (mHTTex1) fragments with pathogenic polyglutamine (polyQ) tracts (&amp;gt;40 glutamines) to self-assemble into highly stable, β-sheet-rich protein aggregates with a fibrillar morphology. HD knock-in mouse models have not been extensively studied with regard to mHTT aggregation. They endogenously produce full-length mHTT with a pathogenic polyQ tract as well as mHTTex1 fragments. Here, we demonstrate that seeding-competent, fibrillar mHTT aggregates can be readily detected in brains of zQ175 knock-in HD mice. To do this, we applied a highly sensitive FRET-based protein amplification assay that is capable of detecting seeding-competent mHTT aggregate species down to the femtomolar range. Furthermore, we show that fibrillar structures with an average length of ∼200 nm can be enriched with aggregate-specific mouse and human antibodies from zQ175 mouse brain extracts through immunoprecipitations, confirming that such structures are formed in vivo. Together these studies indicate that small, fibrillar, seeding-competent mHTT structures are prominent aggregate species in brains of zQ175 mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The recent and growing focus on reproducibility in neuroimaging studies has led many major academic centers to use cloud-based imaging databases for storing, analyzing, and sharing complex imaging data. Flywheel is one such database platform that offers easily accessible, large-scale data management, along with a framework for reproducible analyses through containerized pipelines. The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) is the de facto standard for neuroimaging data, but curating neuroimaging data into BIDS can be a challenging and time-consuming task. In particular, standard solutions for BIDS curation are limited on Flywheel. To address these challenges, we developed “FlywheelTools,” a software toolbox for reproducible data curation and manipulation on Flywheel. FlywheelTools includes two elements: fw-heudiconv, for heuristic-driven curation of data into BIDS, and flaudit, which audits and inventories projects on Flywheel. Together, these tools accelerate reproducible neuroscience research on the widely used Flywheel platform.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Degree and Complexity of Non-conscious Emotional Information Processing – A Review of Masked Priming Studies</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.689369</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Whether and to what degree information can be processed non-consciously has been a matter of debate since the emergence of psychology as a science. Emotional information, in particular, has often been assumed to have a privileged status because of its relevance for well-being and survival (e.g., to detect a threat). Indeed, many studies have explored non-conscious processing of evaluative (i.e., “emotional” in a broad sense) or emotional (e.g., facial expressions) features using the “silver bullet” of non-consciousness research – the masked sequential priming paradigm. In its prototypical form, this paradigm involves the categorization of target stimuli according to valence (e.g., is the target positive or negative?). Each target is preceded by a briefly presented prime that is followed by a mask to constrain awareness. Non-conscious processing is inferred from subtle influences of the prime on target processing, that is, whether responses are faster if prime and target are valence-congruent or not. We will review this research with a focus on three questions: first, which methods are used in this area to establish non-conscious processing? Second, is there evidence for non-conscious extraction of evaluative information? Third, is there evidence for non-conscious processing beyond a simple valence (positive/negative) discrimination, for example, processing of emotion-specific information? We will highlight important current debates and potential directions in which the field will move in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Usefulness of Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy for the Assessment of Post-Stroke Depression</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.680847</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Post-stroke depression (PSD) is the most common mood disorder following stroke and is also the main factor that limits the recovery and rehabilitation of patients with stroke. The prevalence of PSD is ~30%. Since there is no gold standard for the diagnosis and evaluation of PSD, it is important to raise awareness of PSD and to establish methods for its evaluation, early diagnosis, and treatment. In the field of psychiatry, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has been used as a diagnostic tool for the measurement of oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb). This study aimed to assess whether fNIRS could be applied in the diagnosis and evaluation of PSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We recruited 45 patients with stroke, who were admitted to Nagasaki Kita Hospital between May 2015 and April 2019. The 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD17), which is considered to be a useful screening and evaluation tool for PSD, was used for the assessment of patients after stroke; moreover, oxy-Hb was measured in the pre-frontal cortex. The subjects were divided into two groups: the depressed group (n = 13) and the non-depressed group (n = 32). We evaluated the correlation between the oxy-Hb integral values and HAMD17 scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We investigated the relationship between the oxy-Hb integral values and HAMD17 total scores, and found a negative correlation between them (ρ = −0.331, P &amp;lt; 0.005). There was a significant difference in the oxy-Hb integral values during the activation task period between the depressed and non-depressed groups (3.16 ± 2.7 and 1.71 ± 2.4, respectively; P = 0.040). The results indicated that the patients of the depressed group showed lower oxy-Hb integral values and lower activation in the frontal lobe in comparison with the patients of the non-depressed group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The present study highlights that the measurement of oxy-Hb by using fNIRS is a useful methodology for the diagnosis of PSD in patients after stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neurofeedback Training of Auditory Selective Attention Enhances Speech-In-Noise Perception</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.676992</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Selective attention enhances cortical responses to attended sensory inputs while suppressing others, which can be an effective strategy for speech-in-noise (SiN) understanding. Emerging evidence exhibits a large variance in attentional control during SiN tasks, even among normal-hearing listeners. Yet whether training can enhance the efficacy of attentional control and, if so, whether the training effects can be transferred to performance on a SiN task has not been explicitly studied. Here, we introduce a neurofeedback training paradigm designed to reinforce the attentional modulation of auditory evoked responses. Young normal-hearing adults attended one of two competing speech streams consisting of five repeating words (“up”) in a straight rhythm spoken by a female speaker and four straight words (“down”) spoken by a male speaker. Our electroencephalography-based attention decoder classified every single trial using a template-matching method based on pre-defined patterns of cortical auditory responses elicited by either an “up” or “down” stream. The result of decoding was provided on the screen as online feedback. After four sessions of this neurofeedback training over 4 weeks, the subjects exhibited improved attentional modulation of evoked responses to the training stimuli as well as enhanced cortical responses to target speech and better performance during a post-training SiN task. Such training effects were not found in the Placebo Group that underwent similar attention training except that feedback was given only based on behavioral accuracy. These results indicate that the neurofeedback training may reinforce the strength of attentional modulation, which likely improves SiN understanding. Our finding suggests a potential rehabilitation strategy for SiN deficits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Influence of Visual Stimulation-Induced Passive Reproduction of Motor Images in the Brain on Motor Paralysis After Stroke</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.674139</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Finger flexor spasticity, which is commonly observed among patients with stroke, disrupts finger extension movement, consequently influencing not only upper limb function in daily life but also the outcomes of upper limb therapeutic exercise. Kinesthetic illusion induced by visual stimulation (KINVIS) has been proposed as a potential treatment for spasticity in patients with stroke. However, it remains unclear whether KINVIS intervention alone could improve finger flexor spasticity and finger extension movements without other intervention modalities. Therefore, the current study investigated the effects of a single KINVIS session on finger flexor spasticity, including its underlying neurophysiological mechanisms, and finger extension movements. To this end, 14 patients who experienced their first episode of stroke participated in this study. A computer screen placed over the patient’s forearm displayed a pre-recorded mirror image video of the patient’s non-paretic hand performing flexion–extension movements during KINVIS. The position and size of the artificial hand were adjusted appropriately to create a perception that the artificial hand was the patient’s own. Before and after the 20-min intervention, Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) scores and active range of finger extension movements of the paretic hand were determined. Accordingly, MAS scores and active metacarpophalangeal joint extension range of motion improved significantly after the intervention. Moreover, additional experimentation was performed using F-waves on eight patients whose spasticity was reduced by KINVIS to determine whether the same intervention also decreased spinal excitability. Our results showed no change in F-wave amplitude and persistence after the intervention. These results demonstrate the potential clinical significance of KINVIS as a novel intervention for improving finger flexor spasticity and extension movements, one of the most significant impairments among patients with stroke. The decrease in finger flexor spasticity following KINVIS may be attributed to neurophysiological changes not detectable by the F-wave, such as changes in presynaptic inhibition of Ia afferents. Further studies are certainly needed to determine the long-term effects of KINVIS on finger spasticity, as well as the neurophysiological mechanisms explaining the reduction in spasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Sweet Taste Is Complex: Signaling Cascades and Circuits Involved in Sweet Sensation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.667709</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sweetness is the preferred taste of humans and many animals, likely because sugars are a primary source of energy. In many mammals, sweet compounds are sensed in the tongue by the gustatory organ, the taste buds. Here, a group of taste bud cells expresses a canonical sweet taste receptor, whose activation induces Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; rise, cell depolarization and ATP release to communicate with afferent gustatory nerves. The discovery of the sweet taste receptor, 20 years ago, was a milestone in the understanding of sweet signal transduction and is described here from a historical perspective. Our review briefly summarizes the major findings of the canonical sweet taste pathway, and then focuses on molecular details, about the related downstream signaling, that are still elusive or have been neglected. In this context, we discuss evidence supporting the existence of an alternative pathway, independent of the sweet taste receptor, to sense sugars and its proposed role in glucose homeostasis. Further, given that sweet taste receptor expression has been reported in many other organs, the physiological role of these extraoral receptors is addressed. Finally, and along these lines, we expand on the multiple direct and indirect effects of sugars on the brain. In summary, the review tries to stimulate a comprehensive understanding of how sweet compounds signal to the brain upon taste bud cells activation, and how this gustatory process is integrated with gastro-intestinal sugar sensing to create a hedonic and metabolic representation of sugars, which finally drives our behavior. Understanding of this is indeed a crucial step in developing new strategies to prevent obesity and associated diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Early Screening of Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder Based on Electroencephalogram Signal Feature Selection With L1-Norm Regularization</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.656578</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Early screening is vital and helpful for implementing intensive intervention and rehabilitation therapy for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Research has shown that electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can reflect abnormal brain function of children with ASD, and screening with EEG signals has the characteristics of good real-time performance and high sensitivity. However, the existing EEG screening algorithms mostly focus on the data analysis in the resting state, and the extracted EEG features have some disadvantages such as weak representation capacity and information redundancy. In this study, we utilized the event-related potential (ERP) technique to acquire the EEG data of the subjects under positive and negative emotional stimulation and proposed an EEG Feature Selection Algorithm based on L1-norm regularization to perform screening of autism. The proposed EEG Feature Selection Algorithm includes the following steps: (1) extracting 20 EEG features from the raw data, (2) classification with support vector machine, (3) selecting appropriate EEG feature with L1-norm regularization according to the classification performance. The experimental results show that the accuracy for screening of children with ASD can reach 93.8% and 87.5% under positive and negative emotional stimulation and the proposed algorithm can effectively eliminate redundant features and improve screening accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Effects of Trait Anxiety on Error Processing and Post-error Adjustments: An Event-Related Potential Study With Stop-Signal Task</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.650838</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The present study aimed to use event-related potentials with the stop-signal task to investigate the effects of trait anxiety on inhibitory control, error monitoring, and post-error adjustments. The stop-signal reaction time (SSRT) was used to evaluate the behavioral competence of inhibitory control. Electrophysiological signals of error-related negativity (ERN) and error positivity (Pe) were used to study error perception and error awareness, respectively. Post-error slowing (PES) was applied to examine the behavioral adjustments after making errors. The results showed that SSRT and PES did not differ significantly between individuals with high trait anxiety (HTA) and those with low trait anxiety (LTA). However, individuals with HTA demonstrated reduced ERN amplitudes and prolonged Pe latencies than those with LTA. Prolonged Pe latencies were also significantly associated with poorer post-error adjustments. In conclusion, HTA led to reduced cortical responses to error monitoring. Furthermore, inefficient conscious awareness of errors might lead to maladaptive post-error adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Sex-Specific Associations Between Trauma Exposure, Pubertal Timing, and Anxiety in Black Children</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.636199</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent research has linked early life stress (ELS), such as trauma exposure, with early puberty. Early puberty has also been identified as a risk factor for poor mental health outcomes. However, these two paths have primarily been examined independently. In addition, more studies have examined these associations in girls than boys, and findings for boys remain mixed. We hypothesized that early puberty (relative to peers) would be positively associated with both prior trauma exposure and concurrent anxiety symptoms. We anticipated that these associations might differ by sex. We tested these hypotheses within a cross-sectional sample of 133 8- to 13-year-old Black girls and boys with trauma exposure. The association between trauma and accelerated pubertal timing was sex-specific: it was positive for girls and negative for boys. We stratified subsequent analyses by sex. Regression analyses indicated that early puberty relative to peers predicted more anxiety symptoms for girls but not boys, after accounting for trauma exposure. A statistical mediation analysis indicated that, for girls, the positive association between trauma exposure and anxiety was partially mediated by pubertal timing. These results indicate that trauma exposure may have sex-specific effects on pubertal timing and anxiety risk in Black children. We also found that, for girls, trauma may increase risk for adverse outcomes by prompting earlier puberty, which is linked to higher anxiety. These findings are consistent with cascading effects of trauma across development, and highlight the need for further study of sex-specific mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Role of the Right Hemisphere White Matter Tracts in Chronic Aphasic Patients After Damage of the Language Tracts in the Left Hemisphere</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.635750</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The involvement of the right hemisphere (RH) in language, and especially after aphasia resulting from left hemisphere (LH) lesions, has been recently highlighted. The present study investigates white matter structure in the right hemisphere of 25 chronic post-stroke aphasic patients after LH lesions in comparison with 24 healthy controls, focusing on the four cortico-cortical tracts that link posterior parietal and temporal language-related areas with Broca’s region in the inferior frontal gyrus of the LH: the Superior Longitudinal Fasciculi II and III (SLF II and SLF III), the Arcuate Fasciculus (AF), and the Temporo-Frontal extreme capsule Fasciculus (TFexcF). Additionally, the relationship of these RH white matter tracts to language performance was examined. The patients with post-stroke aphasia in the chronic phase and the healthy control participants underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) examination. The aphasic patients were assessed with standard aphasia tests. The results demonstrated increased axial diffusivity in the RH tracts of the aphasic patients. Patients were then divided according to the extent of the left hemisphere white matter loss. Correlations of language performance with radial diffusivity (RD) in the right hemisphere homologs of the tracts examined were demonstrated for the TFexcF, SLF III, and AF in the subgroup with limited damage to the LH language networks and only with the TFexcF in the subgroup with extensive damage. The results argue in favor of compensatory roles of the right hemisphere tracts in language functions when the LH networks are disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Fractional Anisotropy in Selected, Motor-Related White Matter Tracts and Its Cross-Sectional and Longitudinal Associations With Motor Function in Healthy Older Adults</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.621263</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;While it is well-known that deficits in motor performance and brain structural connectivity occur in the course of healthy aging, it is still unclear if and how these changes are related to each other. While some cross-sectional studies suggest that white matter (WM) microstructure is positively associated with motor function in healthy older adults, more evidence is needed. Moreover, longitudinal data is required to estimate whether similar associations can be found between trajectories of change in WM microstructure and motor function. The current study addresses this gap by investigating age-associations and longitudinal changes in WM microstructure and motor function, and the cross-sectional (level-level) and longitudinal (level-change, change-change) association between these two domains.&lt;/p&gt;Method&lt;p&gt;We used multiple-occasion data (covering 4 years) from a large sample (N = 231) of healthy older adults from the Longitudinal Healthy Aging Brain (LHAB) database. To measure WM microstructure, we used diffusion-weighted imaging data to compute mean FA in three selected WM tracts [forceps minor (FMIN); superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF); corticospinal tract (CST)]. Motor function was measured via two motor speed tests (grooved pegboard, finger tapping) and one motor strength test (grip force test), separately for the left and the right hand. The statistical analysis was conducted with longitudinal growth curve models in the structural equation modeling framework.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The results revealed longitudinal decline and negative cross-sectional age-associations for mean WM FA in the FMIN and SLF, and for motor function in all tests, with a higher vulnerability for left than right hand motor performance. Regarding cross-domain associations, we found a significant positive level-level correlation among mean WM FA in the FMIN with motor speed. Mean FA in SLF and CST was not correlated with motor performance measures, and none of the level-change or change-change associations were significant. Overall, our results (a) provide important insights into aging-related changes of fine motor abilities and FA in selected white matter tracts associated with motor control, (b) support previous cross-sectional work showing that neural control of movement in older adults also involves brain structures outside the core motor system and (c) align with the idea that, in healthy aging, compensatory mechanisms may be in place and longer time delays may be needed to reveal level-change or change-change associations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: IL-17 Inhibits Oligodendrocyte Progenitor Cell Proliferation and Differentiation by Increasing K+ Channel Kv1.3</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.679413</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Interleukin 17 (IL-17) is a signature cytokine of Th17 cells. IL-17 level is significantly increased in inflammatory conditions of the CNS, including but not limited to post-stroke and multiple sclerosis. IL-17 has been detected direct toxicity on oligodendrocyte (Ol) lineage cells and inhibition on oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) differentiation, and thus promotes myelin damage. The cellular mechanism of IL-17 in CNS inflammatory diseases remains obscure. Voltage-gated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (Kv) channel 1.3 is the predominant Kv channel in Ol and potentially involved in Ol function and cell cycle regulation. Kv1.3 of T cells involves in immunomodulation of inflammatory progression, but the role of Ol Kv1.3 in inflammation-related pathogenesis has not been fully investigated. We hypothesized that IL-17 induces myelin injury through Kv1.3 activation. To test the hypothesis, we studied the involvement of OPC/Ol Kv1.3 in IL-17-induced Ol/myelin injury in vitro and in vivo. Kv1.3 currents and channel expression gradually decreased during the OPC development. Application of IL-17 to OPC culture increased Kv1.3 expression, leading to a decrease of AKT activation, inhibition of proliferation and myelin basic protein reduction, which were prevented by a specific Kv1.3 blocker 5-(4-phenoxybutoxy) psoralen. IL-17-caused myelin injury was validated in LPC-induced demyelination mouse model, particularly in corpus callosum, which was also mitigated by aforementioned Kv1.3 antagonist. IL-17 altered Kv1.3 expression and resultant inhibitory effects on OPC proliferation and differentiation may by interrupting AKT phosphorylating activation. Taken together, our results suggested that IL-17 impairs remyelination and promotes myelin damage by Kv1.3-mediated Ol/myelin injury. Thus, blockade of Kv1.3 as a potential therapeutic strategy for inflammatory CNS disease may partially attribute to the direct protection on OPC proliferation and differentiation other than immunomodulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.663418</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a highly conserved neuropeptide that regulates neuronal physiology and transcription through Gs/Gq-coupled receptors. Its actions within hypothalamic, limbic, and mnemonic systems underlie its roles in stress regulation, affective processing, neuroprotection, and cognition. Recently, elevated PACAP levels and genetic disruption of PAC1 receptor signaling in humans has been linked to maladaptive threat learning and pathological stress and fear in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PACAP is positioned to integrate stress and memory in PTSD for which memory of the traumatic experience is central to the disorder. However, PACAP’s role in memory has received comparatively less attention than its role in stress. In this review, we consider the evidence for PACAP-PAC1 receptor signaling in learning and plasticity, discuss emerging data on sex differences in PACAP signaling, and raise key questions for further study toward elucidating the contribution of PACAP to adaptive and maladaptive fear learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Modulation of Neural Microcircuits That Control Complex Dynamics in Olfactory Networks</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.662184</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuromodulation influences neuronal processing, conferring neuronal circuits the flexibility to integrate sensory inputs with behavioral states and the ability to adapt to a continuously changing environment. In this original research report, we broadly discuss the basis of neuromodulation that is known to regulate intrinsic firing activity, synaptic communication, and voltage-dependent channels in the olfactory bulb. Because the olfactory system is positioned to integrate sensory inputs with information regarding the internal chemical and behavioral state of an animal, how olfactory information is modulated provides flexibility in coding and behavioral output. Herein we discuss how neuronal microcircuits control complex dynamics of the olfactory networks by homing in on a special class of local interneurons as an example. While receptors for neuromodulation and metabolic peptides are widely expressed in the olfactory circuitry, centrifugal serotonergic and cholinergic inputs modulate glomerular activity and are involved in odor investigation and odor-dependent learning. Little is known about how metabolic peptides and neuromodulators control specific neuronal subpopulations. There is a microcircuit between mitral cells and interneurons that is comprised of deep-short-axon cells in the granule cell layer. These local interneurons express pre-pro-glucagon (PPG) and regulate mitral cell activity, but it is unknown what initiates this type of regulation. Our study investigates the means by which PPG neurons could be recruited by classical neuromodulators and hormonal peptides. We found that two gut hormones, leptin and cholecystokinin, differentially modulate PPG neurons. Cholecystokinin reduces or increases spike frequency, suggesting a heterogeneous signaling pathway in different PPG neurons, while leptin does not affect PPG neuronal firing. Acetylcholine modulates PPG neurons by increasing the spike frequency and eliciting bursts of action potentials, while serotonin does not affect PPG neuron excitability. The mechanisms behind this diverse modulation are not known, however, these results clearly indicate a complex interplay of metabolic signaling molecules and neuromodulators that may fine-tune neuronal microcircuits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

In the absence of pharmacological treatment options, but with knowledge of the genetic cause underlying the pathophysiology, gene therapy holds promise for disease control. Consideration of leukodystrophies provide a case in point; we review cell type – specific expression pattern of the disease – causing genes and reflect on genetic and cellular treatment approaches including ex vivo hematopoietic stem cell gene therapies and in vivo approaches using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. We link recent advances in vectorology to glial targeting directed towards gene therapies for specific leukodystrophies and related developmental or neurometabolic disorders affecting the CNS white matter and frame strategies for therapy development in future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Dysregulation of Systemic Immunity in Aging and Dementia</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.652111</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuroinflammation and the tissue-resident innate immune cells, the microglia, respond and contribute to neurodegenerative pathology. Although microglia have been the focus of work linking neuroinflammation and associated dementias like Alzheimer’s Disease, the inflammatory milieu of brain is a conglomerate of cross-talk amongst microglia, systemic immune cells and soluble mediators like cytokines. Age-related changes in the inflammatory profile at the levels of both the brain and periphery are largely orchestrated by immune system cells. Strong evidence indicates that both innate and adaptive immune cells, the latter including T cells and B cells, contribute to chronic neuroinflammation and thus dementia. Neurodegenerative hallmarks coupled with more traditional immune system stimuli like infection or injury likely combine to trigger and maintain persistent microglial and thus brain inflammation. This review summarizes age-related changes in immune cell function, with special emphasis on lymphocytes as a source of inflammation, and discusses how such changes may potentiate both systemic and central nervous system inflammation to culminate in dementia. We recap the understudied area of AD-associated changes in systemic lymphocytes in greater detail to provide a unifying perspective of inflammation-fueled dementia, with an eye toward evidence of two-way communication between the brain parenchyma and blood immune cells. We focused our review on human subjects studies, adding key data from animal models as relevant.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Relaxin-3 Innervation From the Nucleus Incertus to the Parahippocampal Cortex of the Rat</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.674649</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spatial learning and memory processes depend on anatomical and functional interactions between the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex. A key neurophysiological component of these processes is hippocampal theta rhythm, which can be driven from subcortical areas including the pontine nucleus incertus (NI). The NI contains the largest population of neurons that produce and presumably release the neuropeptide, relaxin-3, which acts via the G&lt;sub&gt;i/o&lt;/sub&gt;-protein-coupled receptor, relaxin-family peptide 3 receptor (RXFP3). NI activation induces general arousal including hippocampal theta, and inactivation induces impairment of spatial memory acquisition or retrieval. The primary aim of this study was to map the NI/relaxin-3 innervation of the parahippocampal cortex (PHC), including the medial and lateral entorhinal cortex, endopiriform cortex, perirhinal, postrhinal, and ectorhinal cortex, the amygdalohippocampal transition area and posteromedial cortical amygdala. Retrograde tracer injections were placed in different parts of the medial and lateral entorhinal cortex, which produced prominent retrograde labeling in the ipsilateral NI and some labeling in the contralateral NI. Anterograde tracer injections into the NI and immunostaining for relaxin-3 produced fiber labeling in deep layers of all parahippocampal areas and some dispersed fibers in superficial layers. Double-labeling studies revealed that both hippocampal projecting and calcium-binding protein-positive (presumed GABAergic) neurons received a relaxin-3 NI innervation. Some of these fibers also displayed synaptophysin (Syn) immunoreactivity, consistent with the presence of the peptide at synapses; and relaxin-3-positive fibers containing Syn bouton-like staining were frequently observed in contact with hippocampal-projecting or calcium-binding protein-positive neuronal somata and more distal elements. Finally, in situ hybridization studies revealed that entorhinal neurons in the superficial layers, and to a lesser extent in deep layers, contain RXFP3 mRNA. Together, our data support functional actions of the NI/relaxin-3-parahippocampal innervation on processes related to memory, spatial navigation and contextual analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.687824</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: There is a strong need for short and effective methods to screen for cognitive impairment. Recent studies have created short forms of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (s-MoCA) in English-speaking populations. It is also important to develop a validated Chinese short version to detect cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Item response theory and computerized adaptive testing analytics were used to construct abbreviated MoCAs across a large neurological sample comprising 6,981 community-dwelling Chinese veterans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Six MoCA items with high discrimination and appropriate difficulty were included in the s-MoCA. The Chinese short versions (sensitivity 0.89/0.90, specificity 0.72/0.77) are similar in performance to the full MoCA in identifying cognitive impairment (sensitivity 0.91, specificity 0.82).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: These short variants of the MoCA may serve as quick and effective instruments when the original MoCA cannot be feasibly administered in clinical services with a high patient burden and limited cognitive testing resources.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Characterization of Lenticulostriate Arteries and Its Associations With Vascular Risk Factors in Community-Dwelling Elderly</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.685571</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Lenticulostriate arteries (LSAs) supply blood to important subcortical areas and are, therefore, essential for maintaining the optimal functioning of the brain’s most metabolically active nuclei. Past studies have demonstrated the potential for quantifying the morphology of LSAs as biomarkers of vascular fragility or underlying arteriopathies. Thus, the current study aims to evaluate the morphological features of LSAs, their potential value in cerebrovascular risk stratification, and their concordance with other vascular risk factors in community-dwelling elderly people. A total of 125 community-dwelling elderly subjects who underwent a brain MRI scan were selected from our prospectively collected imaging database. The morphological measures of LSAs were calculated on the vascular skeletons obtained by manual tracing, and the number of LSAs was counted. Additionally, imaging biomarkers of small vessel disease were evaluated, and the diameters of major cerebral arteries were measured. The effects of vascular risk factors on LSA morphometry, as well as the relationship between LSA measures and other imaging biomarkers, were investigated. We found that smokers had shorter (p = 0.04) and straighter LSAs (p &amp;lt; 0.01) compared to nonsmokers, and the presence of hypertension is associated with less tortuous LSAs (p = 0.03) in community-dwelling elderly. Moreover, the middle cerebral artery diameter was positively correlated with LSA count (r = 0.278, p = 0.025) and vessel tortuosity (r = 0.257, p = 0.04). The posterior cerebral artery diameter was positively correlated with vessel tortuosity and vessel length. Considering the scarcity of noninvasive methods for measuring small artery abnormalities in the brain, the LSA morphological measures may provide valuable information to better understand cerebral small vessel degeneration during aging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The COVID-19 pandemic will likely take years to control globally, and constant epidemic surveillance will be required to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2, especially considering the emergence of new variants that could hamper the effect of vaccination efforts. We developed a simple and robust - &lt;i&gt;Phone Screen Testing &lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;PoST&lt;/i&gt;) - method to detect positive SARS-CoV-2 individuals by RT-PCR testing of smartphone screen swab samples. We show that 81.3-100% of individuals with high-viral load SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal positive samples also test positive for &lt;i&gt;PoST&lt;/i&gt;, suggesting this method is effective in identifying COVID-19 contagious individuals. Furthermore, we successfully identified polymorphisms associated with SARS-CoV-2 Alpha, Beta and Gamma variants, in SARS-CoV-2 positive &lt;i&gt;PoST&lt;/i&gt; samples. Overall, we report that &lt;i&gt;PoST &lt;/i&gt;is a new non-invasive, cost-effective, and easy to implement smartphone-based smart alternative for SARS-CoV-2 testing, which could help to contain COVID-19 outbreaks and identification of variants of concern in the years to come.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/68830</link>
	<content:encoded>In order to regenerate tissues successfully, stem cells must detect injuries and restore missing cell types through largely unknown mechanisms. Planarian flatworms have an extensive stem cell population responsible for regenerating any organ after amputation. Here, we compare planarian stem cell responses to different injuries by either amputation of a single organ, the pharynx, or removal of tissues from other organs by decapitation. We find that planarian stem cells adopt distinct behaviors depending on what tissue is missing to target progenitor and tissue production towards missing tissues. Loss of non-pharyngeal tissues only increases non-pharyngeal progenitors, while pharynx removal selectively triggers division and expansion of pharynx progenitors. By pharmacologically inhibiting either mitosis or activation of the MAP kinase ERK, we identify a narrow window of time during which stem cell division and ERK signaling produces pharynx progenitors necessary for regeneration. These results indicate that planarian stem cells can tailor their output to match the regenerative needs of the animal.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/67577</link>
	<content:encoded>To advance our understanding of adaptation to temporally varying selection pressures, we identified signatures of seasonal adaptation occurring in parallel among &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; populations. Specifically, we estimated allele frequencies genome-wide from flies sampled early and late in the growing season from 20 widely dispersed populations. We identified parallel seasonal allele frequency shifts across North America and Europe, demonstrating that seasonal adaptation is a general phenomenon of temperate fly populations. Seasonally fluctuating polymorphisms are enriched in large chromosomal inversions and we find a broad concordance between seasonal and spatial allele frequency change. The direction of allele frequency change at seasonally variable polymorphisms can be predicted by weather conditions in the weeks prior to sampling, linking the environment and the genomic response to selection. Our results suggest that fluctuating selection is an important evolutionary force affecting patterns of genetic variation in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Neural dynamics of semantic categorization in semantic variant of Primary Progressive Aphasia</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63905</link>
	<content:encoded>Semantic representations are processed along a posterior-to-anterior gradient reflecting a shift from perceptual (e.g., &lt;i&gt;it has eight legs&lt;/i&gt;) to conceptual (e.g., &lt;i&gt;venomous spiders are rare&lt;/i&gt;) information. One critical region is the anterior temporal lobe (ATL): patients with semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA), a clinical syndrome associated with ATL neurodegeneration, manifest a deep loss of semantic knowledge. We test the hypothesis that svPPA patients perform semantic tasks by over-recruiting areas implicated in perceptual processing. We compared MEG recordings of svPPA patients and healthy controls during a categorization task. While behavioral performance did not differ, svPPA patients showed indications of greater activation over bilateral occipital cortices and superior temporal gyrus, and inconsistent engagement of frontal regions. These findings suggest a pervasive reorganization of brain networks in response to ATL neurodegeneration: the loss of this critical hub leads to a dysregulated (semantic) control system, and defective semantic representations are seemingly compensated via enhanced perceptual processing.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Dendrites are important determinants of the input-output relationship of single neurons, but their role in network computations is not well understood. Here, we used a combination of dendritic patch-clamp recordings and in silico modeling to determine how dendrites of parvalbumin (PV)- expressing basket cells contribute to network oscillations in the gamma frequency band. Simultaneous soma-dendrite recordings from PV basket cells in the dentate gyrus revealed that the slope, or gain, of the dendritic input-output relationship is exceptionally low, thereby reducing the cell's sensitivity to changes in its input. By simulating gamma oscillations in detailed network models, we demonstrate that the low gain is key to increase spike synchrony in PV neuron assemblies when cells are driven by spatially and temporally heterogeneous synaptic input. These results highlight the role of dendritic computations in synchronized network oscillations.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Prevalence of white matter pathways coming into a single diffusion MRI voxel orientation: the bottleneck issue in tractography</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.22.449454v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Characterizing and understanding the limitations of diffusion MRI fiber tractography is a prerequisite for methodological advances and innovations which will allow these techniques to accurately map the connections of the human brain. The so-called &quot;crossing fiber problem&quot; has received tremendous attention and has continuously triggered the community to develop novel approaches for disentangling distinctly oriented fiber populations. Perhaps an even greater challenge occurs when multiple white matter bundles converge within a single voxel, or throughout a single brain region, and share the same parallel orientation, before diverging and continuing towards their final cortical or sub-cortical terminations. These so-called &quot;bottleneck&quot; regions contribute to the ill-posed nature of the tractography process, and lead to both false positive and false negative estimated connections. Yet, as opposed to the extent of crossing fibers, a thorough characterization of bottleneck regions has not been performed. The aim of this study is to quantify the prevalence of bottleneck regions. To do this, we use diffusion tractography to segment known white matter bundles of the brain, and assign each bundle to voxels they pass through and to specific orientations within those voxels (i.e. fixels). We demonstrate that bottlenecks occur in greater than 50-70% of fixels in the white matter of the human brain. We find that all projection, association, and commissural fibers contribute to, and are affected by, this phenomenon, and show that even regions traditionally considered &quot;single fiber voxels&quot; often contain multiple fiber populations. Together, this study shows that a majority of white matter presents bottlenecks for tractography which may lead to incorrect or erroneous estimates of brain connectivity or quantitative tractography (i.e., tractometry), and underscores the need for a paradigm shift in the process of tractography and bundle segmentation for studying the fiber pathways of the human brain.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.22.449441v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Reinforcement allows organisms to learn which stimuli predict subsequent biological relevance. Hebbian mechanisms of synaptic plasticity are insufficient to account for reinforced learning because neuromodulators signaling biological relevance are delayed with respect to the neural activity associated with the stimulus. A theoretical solution is the concept of eligibility traces (eTraces), silent synaptic processes elicited by activity which upon arrival of a neuromodulator are converted into a lasting change in synaptic strength. Previously we demonstrated in visual cortical slices the Hebbian induction of eTraces and their conversion into LTP and LTD by the retroactive action of norepinephrine and serotonin Here we show in vivo in V1 that the induction of eTraces and their conversion to LTP/D by norepinephrine and serotonin respectively potentiates and depresses visual responses. We also show that the integrity of this process is crucial for ocular dominance plasticity, a canonical model of experience-dependent plasticity.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.22.449439v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Cortical macrostructure is influenced by circadian rhythm and sleep deprivation, yet the microstructural underpinnings of previous human brain MRI findings have remained unclear. The ratio between T1-weighted and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images (T1w/T2w ratio) has been linked to myelin levels and dendrite density, and may offer novel insight into the intracortical microstructure of the sleep deprived brain. Methods: We examined intracortical T1w/T2w ratio in 41 healthy young adults (26 women) before and after 32 hours of either sleep deprivation (n = 18) or a normal sleep-wake cycle (n = 23). Results: Linear models revealed significant group differences in T1w/T2w ratio change after 32 hours in four clusters, including bilateral effects in the insular, cingulate and superior temporal cortex, comprising regions involved in attentional, auditory and pain processing. Across clusters, the sleep deprived group showed an increased T1w/T2w ratio, while the normal sleep-wake group exhibited a reduced ratio. These changes were not explained by in-scanner head movement, and 95% of the effects across clusters remained significant after adjusting for cortical thickness and hydration. Conclusions: Compared with a normal sleep-wake cycle, 32 hours of sleep deprivation yields intracortical T1w/T2w ratio increases. While the intracortical changes detected by this study could reflect alterations in myelin or dendritic density, or both, histological analyses are needed to clarify the precise underlying cortical processes.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.22.449416v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The basal ganglia operate largely in closed parallel loops, including an associative circuit for goal-directed behavior originating from the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) and a somatosensory circuit important for habit formation originating from the dorsolateral striatum (DLS). An exception to this parallel circuit organization has been proposed to explain how information might be transferred between striatal subregions, for example from DMS to DLS during habit formation. The &quot;ascending spiral hypothesis&quot; proposes that DMS disinhibits dopamine signaling in DLS through a tri-synaptic, open-loop striato-nigro-striatal circuit. Here, we used transsynaptic and intersectional genetic tools to investigate both closed- and open-loop striato-nigro-striatal circuits. We found strong evidence for closed loops, which would allow striatal subregions to regulate their own dopamine release. We also found evidence for functional synapses in open loops. However, these synapses were unable to modulate tonic dopamine neuron firing, questioning the prominence of their role in mediating crosstalk between striatal subregions.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.22.449414v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Astronauts returning from spaceflight typically show transient declines in mobility and balance. These whole-body postural control behaviors have been investigated thoroughly, while study of the effects of spaceflight on other sensorimotor behaviors is prevalent. Here, we tested the effects of the spaceflight environment of microgravity on various sensorimotor and cognitive tasks during and after missions to the International Space Station (ISS). We obtained mobility (Functional Mobility Test), balance (Sensory Organization Test-5), bimanual coordination (bimanual Purdue Pegboard), cognitive-motor dual-tasking and various cognitive measures (Digit Symbol Substitution Test, Cube Rotation, Card Rotation, Rod and Frame Test) before, during and after 15 astronauts completed 6+ month missions aboard the ISS. We used linear mixed effect models to analyze performance changes due to entering the microgravity environment, behavioral adaptations aboard the ISS and subsequent recovery from microgravity. We identified declines in mobility and balance from pre- to post-flight, suggesting possible disruption and/or downweighting of vestibular inputs; these behaviors recovered to baseline levels within 30 days post-flight. We also identified bimanual coordination declines from pre- to post-flight and recovery to baseline levels within 30 days post-flight. There were no changes in dual-task performance during or following spaceflight. Cube rotation response time significantly improved from pre- to post-flight, suggestive of practice effects. There was a trend for better in-flight cube rotation performance on the ISS when crewmembers had their feet in foot loops on the 'floor' throughout the task. This suggests that tactile inputs to the foot sole aided orientation. Overall, these results suggest that sensory reweighting due to the microgravity environment of spaceflight affected sensorimotor performance, while cognitive performance was maintained. A shift from exocentric (gravity) spatial references on Earth towards an egocentric spatial reference may also occur aboard the ISS.

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Computational neural network provides naturalistic solution for recovery of finger dexterity after stroke</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.22.449412v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Finger dexterity is a fundamental movement skill of humans and the ability to individuate fingers imparts high motor flexibility. Disruption of dexterity due to brain injury imposes a detriment to quality of life, and thus understanding the neurological mechanisms responsible for recovery is imperative for neurorehabilitation. Two neuronal pathways have been proposed to play crucial roles in finger individuation: the corticospinal tract, originating from primary motor cortex and premotor areas, and the subcortical reticulospinal tract, originating from the reticular formation in the brainstem. Finger individuation in patients with lesions to these pathways may recover, however it remains an open question how the cortical-reticular network reorganizes and contributes to this recovery following a stroke. We explored the hypothesis that interactive connections between cortical and subcortical neurons reflect dynamics appropriate for generating outgoing commands for finger movement. To formalize this hypothesis, we developed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) representing the premotor planning input layer, cortical layer including excitatory and inhibitory neurons and reticular layer that control motoneurons eliciting unilateral flexion of two fingers. The ANN was trained to reproduce normal activity of finger individuation and strength. Analysis of the trained ANN revealed that the natural dynamical solution was a near-linear relationship between the force of the instructed and uninstructed finger, resembling individuation patterns in humans. We then applied a simulated stroke lesion to the ANN and explored the resulting finger dexterity at multiple stages post stroke. Analysis revealed: (1) increased unintended force produced by uninstructed fingers (i.e., enslaving) and (2) weakening of the force in the instructed finger immediately after stroke, (3) improved finger control during recovery that typically occurs early after stroke, and (4) association of this behavior with increased neural plasticity of the residual neurons, as reflected by strengthening of connectivity weights between premotor and focal cortical excitatory and inhibitory neurons, but reduction in connectivity in shared cortical neurons. Interestingly, the network solution predicted that the reticulospinal pathway also contributed to the improved behavior. Lastly, the ANN also predicts the effect of cortical lesion size on finger individuation. Our model provides a framework by which to understand a number of experimental findings. The model solution suggests that a key mechanism of finger individuation is establishment of an interactive relationship between cortical and subcortical regions, appropriate to produce desired finger movement.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Similar neuronal imprint and absence of cross-seeded partner fibrils in α-synuclein aggregates from MSA and Parkinson's disease brains</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.22.449410v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Aggregated alpha-synuclein (-syn) is a principal constituent of Lewy bodies (LBs) and glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) observed respectively inside neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD) and oligodendrocytes in multiple system atrophy (MSA). Yet, the cellular origin, the pathophysiological role, and the mechanism of formation of these inclusions bodies (IBs) remain to be elucidated. It has recently been proposed that -syn IBs eventually cause the demise of the host cell by virtue of the cumulative sequestration of partner proteins and organelles. In particular, the hypothesis of a local cross-seeding of other fibrillization-prone proteins like tau or TDP-43 has also been put forward. We submitted sarkosyl-insoluble extracts of post-mortem brain tissue from PD, MSA and control subjects to a comparative proteomic analysis to address these points. Our studies indicate that: i) -syn is by far the most enriched protein in PD and MSA extracts compared to controls; ii) PD and MSA extracts share a striking overlap of their sarkosyl-insoluble proteomes, consisting of a vast majority of mitochondrial and neuronal synaptic proteins, and (iii) other fibrillization-prone protein candidates possibly cross-seeded by -syn are neither found in PD nor MSA extracts. Thus, our results (i) support the idea that pre-assembled building blocks originating in neurons serve to the formation of GCIs in MSA, (ii) show no sign of amyloid cross-seeding in either synucleinopathy, and (iii) point to the sequestration of mitochondria and of neuronal synaptic components in both LBs and GCIs.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Electrophysiological correlates of perceptual prediction error are attenuated in dyslexia</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.22.449408v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>A perceptual adaptation deficit often accompanies reading difficulty in dyslexia, manifesting in poor perceptual learning of consistent stimuli and reduced neurophysiological adaptation to stimulus repetition. However, it is not known how adaptation deficits relate to differences in feedforward or feedback processes in the brain. Here we used electroencephalography (EEG) to interrogate the feedforward and feedback contributions to neural adaptation as adults with and without dyslexia viewed pairs of faces and words in a paradigm that manipulated whether there was a high probability of stimulus repetition versus a high probability of stimulus change. We measured three neural dependent variables: expectation (the difference between prestimulus EEG power with and without the expectation of stimulus repetition), feedforward repetition (the difference between event-related potentials (ERPs) evoked by an expected change and an unexpected repetition), and feedback-mediated prediction error (the difference between ERPs evoked by an unexpected change and an expected repetition). Expectation significantly modulated prestimulus theta- and alpha-band EEG in both groups. Unexpected repetitions of words, but not faces, also led to significant feedforward repetition effects in the ERPs of both groups. However, neural prediction error when an unexpected change occurred instead of an expected repetition was significantly weaker in dyslexia than the control group for both faces and words. These results suggest that the neural and perceptual adaptation deficits observed in dyslexia reflect the failure to effectively integrate perceptual predictions with feedforward sensory processing. In addition to reducing perceptual efficiency, the attenuation of neural prediction error signals would also be deleterious to the wide range of perceptual and procedural learning abilities that are critical for developing accurate and fluent reading skills.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Modelling the spatial and temporal constrains of the GABAergic influence on neuronal excitability</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.22.449394v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>GABA ({gamma}-amino butyric acid) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the adult brain that can mediate depolarizing responses during development or after neuropathological insults. Under which conditions GABAergic membrane depolarizations are sufficient to impose excitatory effects is hard to predict, as shunting inhibition and GABAergic effects on spatiotemporal filtering of excitatory inputs must be considered. To evaluate at which reversal potential a net excitatory effect was imposed by GABA (EGABAThr), we performed a detailed in-silico study using simple neuronal topologies and distinct spatiotemporal relations between GABAergic and glutamatergic inputs. These simulations revealed for GABAergic synapses located at the soma an EGABAThr close to action potential threshold (EAPThr), while with increasing dendritic distance EGABAThr shifted to positive values. The impact of GABA on AMPA-mediated inputs revealed a complex temporal and spatial dependency. EGABAThr depends on the temporal relation between GABA and AMPA inputs, with a striking negative shift in EGABAThr for AMPA inputs appearing after the GABA input. The spatial dependency between GABA and AMPA inputs revealed a complex profile, with EGABAThr being shifted to values negative to EAPThr for AMPA synapses located proximally to the GABA input, while for distally located AMPA synapses the dendritic distance had only a minor effect on EGABAThr. For tonic GABAergic conductances EGABAThr was negative to EAPThr over a wide range of gGABAtonic values. In summary, these results demonstrate that for several physiologically relevant situations EGABAThr is negative to EAPThr, suggesting that depolarizing GABAergic responses can mediate excitatory effects even if EGABA did not reach EAPThr.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.22.449393v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Analyses of cerebro-peripheral connectivity aim to quantify ongoing coupling between brain activity (measured by MEG/EEG) and peripheral signals such as muscle activity, continuous speech, or physiological rhythms (such as pupil dilation or respiration). Due to the distinct rhythmicity of these signals, undirected connectivity is typically assessed in the frequency domain. This leaves the investigator with two critical choices, namely a) the appropriate measure for spectral estimation (i.e., the transformation into the frequency domain) and b) the actual connectivity measure. As there is no consensus regarding best practice, a wide variety of methods has been applied. Here we systematically compare combinations of six standard spectral estimation methods (comprising fast Fourier and continuous wavelet transformation, bandpass filtering, and short-time Fourier transformation) and six connectivity measures (phase-locking value, Gaussian-Copula mutual information, Rayleigh test, weighted pairwise phase consistency, magnitude squared coherence, and entropy). We provide performance measures of each combination for simulated data (with precise control over true connectivity), a single-subject set of real MEG data, and a full group analysis of real MEG data. Our results show that, overall, wppc and gcmi tend to outperform other connectivity measures, while entropy was the only measure sensitive to bimodal deviations from a uniform phase distribution. For group analysis, choosing the appropriate spectral estimation method appeared to be more critical than the connectivity measure. We discuss practical implications (sampling rate, SNR, computation time, and data length) and aim to provide recommendations tailored to particular research questions.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Realistic retinal modeling unravels the differential role of excitation and inhibition to starburst amacrine cells in direction selectivity</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.22.449374v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Retinal direction-selectivity originates in starburst amacrine cells (SACs), which display a centrifugal preference, responding with greater depolarization to a stimulus expanding from soma to dendrites than to a collapsing stimulus. Various mechanisms were hypothesized to underlie SAC centrifugal preference, but dissociating them is experimentally challenging and the mechanisms remain debatable. To address this issue, we developed the Retinal Stimulation Modeling Environment (RSME), a multifaceted data-driven retinal model that encompasses detailed neuronal morphology and biophysical properties, retina-tailored connectivity scheme and visual input. Using a genetic algorithm, we demonstrated that spatiotemporally diverse excitatory inputs, sustained in the proximal and transient in the distal processes, are sufficient to generate experimentally validated centrifugal preference in a single SAC. Reversing these input kinetics did not produce any centrifugal preferring SAC. We then explored the contribution of SAC-SAC inhibitory connections in establishing the centrifugal preference. SAC inhibitory network enhanced the centrifugal preference, but failed to generate it in its absence. Embedding a direction selective ganglion cell (DSGC) in a SAC network showed that the known SAC-DSGC asymmetric connectivity by itself produces direction selectivity. Still, this selectivity is sharpened in a centrifugal preferring SAC network. Finally, we use RSME to demonstrate the contribution of SAC-SAC inhibitory connections in mediating direction selectivity and recapitulate recent experimental findings. Thus, using RSME, we obtained a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of SACs centrifugal preference and its contribution to direction selectivity.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Task complexity temporally extends the causal requirement for visual cortex in perception</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.22.449366v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The transformation of sensory inputs into behavioral outputs is characterized by an interplay between feedforward and feedback operations in cortical hierarchies. Even in simple sensorimotor transformations, recurrent processing is often expressed in primary cortices in a late phase of the cortical response to sensory stimuli. This late phase is engaged by attention and stimulus complexity, and also encodes sensory-independent factors, including movement and report-related variables. However, despite its pervasiveness, the nature and function of late activity in perceptual decision-making remain unclear. We tested whether the function of late activity depends on the complexity of a sensory change-detection task. Complexity was based on increasing processing requirements for the same sensory stimuli. We found that the temporal window in which V1 is necessary for perceptual decision-making was extended when we increased task complexity, independently of the presented visual stimulus. This window overlapped with the emergence of report-related activity and decreased noise correlations in V1. The onset of these co-occurring activity patterns was time-locked to and preceded reaction time, and predicted the reduction in behavioral performance obtained by optogenetically silencing late V1 activity (&amp;gt;200 ms after stimulus onset), a result confirmed by a second multisensory task with different requirements. Thus, although early visual response components encode all sensory information necessary to solve the task, V1 is not simply relaying information to higher-order areas transforming it into behavioral responses. Rather, task complexity determines the temporal extension of a loop of recurrent activity, which overlaps with report-related activity and determines how perceptual decisions are built.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.22.449317v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Brain development requires the formation of thousands of neurons and glia and their coordinated maturation to ensure correct circuit formation. Neuronal fate is determined by several layers of gene regulatory networks during neuronal lineage progression. Once specified, neurons must still undergo a critical maturation period, involving the stepwise expression of functional feature genes such as cell surface molecules, ion channels or neurotransmitter receptors. The precise mechanisms that govern neuronal maturation remain however poorly understood. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing combined with a conditional genetic strategy to select and analyse neural lineages and their young progeny at a restrictive timepoint to investigate the transcriptional trajectories in young developing secondary neurons in the Drosophila larval brain. Our findings reveal that neuron maturation starts very quickly after neuronal birth, and sub-divide the process of maturation into 3 distinct phases: Phase 1 is composed by immature neurons that have yet to start expressing mRNA of mature neuronal features; Phase 2 includes neurons that start transcribing but not translating maturation markers such as neurotransmitter genes; Phase 3 neurons start translating mature neuronal features, in a coordinated fashion with the animal developmental stage. This dataset represents a complete transcriptomic characterization of the neural lineages generated at this larval stage in the central brain and ventral nerve cord. Its analysis has also allowed for the characterization of a yet undefined transitional state, the immature ganglion mother cells, and has proven useful for the identification of known and novel fate regulators.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.22.449272v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In the visual system, signals from the two eyes are combined to form a coherent representation through the convergence of synaptic input populations onto individual cortical neurons. As individual synapses originate from either monocular (representing one eye) or binocular (representing both eyes) cortical networks, it has been unclear how these inputs are integrated coherently. Here, we imaged dendritic spines on layer 2/3 binocular cells in ferret visual cortex with in vivo two-photon microscopy to examine how monocular and binocular synaptic networks contribute to the interocular alignment of orientation tuning. We found that binocular synapses varied in degree of &quot;congruency&quot;, namely response correlation between left and right eye visual stimulation. Binocular congruent inputs were functionally distinct from binocular noncongruent and monocular inputs, exhibiting greater tuning selectivity and connection specificity. Using correlative light and electron microscopy, we found no difference in ultrastructural anatomy and instead, observed strength in numbers using a simple model simulating aggregate synaptic input. This model demonstrated a predominate contribution of binocular congruent inputs in sculpting somatic orientation preference and interocular response alignment. Our study suggests that, in layer 2/3 cortical neurons, a binocular network is responsible for forming a coherent representation in individual neurons through recurrent intracortical interactions.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.21.449346v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are powerful computational tools for a large variety of tasks (Goodfellow, 2016). Their architecture, composed of layers of repeated identical neural units, draws inspiration from visual neuroscience. However, biological circuits contain a myriad of additional details and complexity not translated to CNNs, including diverse neural cell types (Tasic, 2018). Many possible roles for neural cell types have been proposed, including: learning, stabilizing excitation and inhibition, and diverse normalization (Marblestone, 2016; Gouwens, 2019). Here we investigate whether neural cell types, instantiated as diverse activation functions in CNNs, can assist in the feed-forward computational abilities of neural circuits. Our heterogeneous cell type networks mix multiple activation functions within each activation layer. We assess the value of mixed activation functions by comparing image classification performance to that of homogeneous control networks with only one activation function per network. We observe that mixing activation functions can improve the image classification abilities of CNNs. Importantly, we find larger improvements when the activation functions are more diverse, and in more constrained networks. Our results suggest a feed-forward computational role for diverse cell types in biological circuits. Additionally, our results open new avenues for the development of more powerful CNNs.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.21.449343v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Hippocampal hyperactivity driven by GABAergic interneuron deficits and NMDA receptor hypofunction is associated with the hyperdopaminergic state often observed in schizophrenia. Previous research in the methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) rat model has demonstrated that repeated peripubertal diazepam administration can prevent the emergence of adult hippocampal hyperactivity, hyperdopaminergia, and associated psychosis-relevant behaviors. Here, we sought to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these promising effects of diazepam by characterizing hippocampal GABAA and NMDA receptors in MAM-treated rats exposed to either vehicle or diazepam peripubertally. Quantitative receptor autoradiography was used to measure receptor density in dorsal hippocampus CA1, ventral hippocampus CA1, and in ventral subiculum. Specifically, [3H]-Ro15-4513 was used to quantify the density of 5 GABAA receptors (5GABAAR), [3H]-flumazenil to quantify 1-3,5GABAAR, and [3H]-MK801 to quantify NMDA receptors. MAM rats exhibited anxiety and schizophrenia-relevant behaviors as measured by elevated plus maze and amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion (AIH), although diazepam only partially rescued these behaviors. 5GABAAR density was reduced in MAM-treated rats in all hippocampal sub-regions, and negatively correlated with AIH. Ventral hippocampus CA1 5GABAAR density was positively correlated with anxiety-like behavior. Dorsal hippocampus CA1 NMDA receptor density was increased in MAM-treated rats, and positively correlated with AIH. [3H]-Flumazenil revealed no significant effects. Finally, we found no significant effect of diazepam treatment on receptor densities, potentially related to the only partial rescue of schizophrenia-relevant phenotypes. Overall, our findings provide first evidence of 5GABAAR and NMDA receptor abnormalities in the MAM model, suggesting that more selective pharmacological agents may become a novel therapeutic mechanism in schizophrenia.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The blind spot is a region in the temporal monocular visual field in humans, which corresponds to a physiological scotoma within the nasal hemi-retina. This region has no photoreceptors, so is insensitive to visual stimulation. There is no corresponding perceptual scotoma because the visual stimulation is &quot;filled-in&quot; by the visual system. Investigations of visual perception in and around the blind spot allow us to investigate this filling-in process. However, because the location and size of the blind spot are individually variable, experimenters must first map the blind spot in every observer. We present an open-source tool, which runs in Psychopy software, to estimate the location and size of the blind spot psychophysically. The tool will ideally be used with an Eyelink eye-tracker (SR Research), but it can also run in standalone mode. Here, we explain the rationale for the tool and demonstrate its validity in normally-sighted observers. We develop a detailed map of the blind spot in one observer. Then, in a group of 12 observers, we propose a more efficient, pragmatic method to define a &quot;safe zone&quot; within the blind spot, for which the experimenter can be fully confident that visual stimuli will not be seen.

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Fatty acid dysregulation in the anterior cingulate cortex of depressed suicides with a history of child abuse</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.21.449337v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Child abuse (CA) strongly increases the lifetime risk of suffering from major depression and predicts an unfavorable course for the illness. Severe CA has been associated with a specific dysregulation of oligodendrocyte function and thinner myelin sheaths in the human anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) white matter. Given that myelin is extremely lipid-rich, it is plausible that these findings may be accompanied by a disruption of the lipid profile that composes the myelin sheath. This is important to explore since the composition of fatty acids (FA) in myelin phospholipids can influence its stability, permeability, and compactness. Therefore, the objective of this study was to quantify and compare FA concentrations in postmortem ACC white matter in the choline glycerophospholipid pool (ChoGpl), a key myelin phospholipid pool, between adult depressed suicides with a history of CA (DS-CA) matched depressed suicides without CA (DS) and healthy non-psychiatric controls (CTRL). Total lipids were extracted according to the Folch method and separated into respective classes using thin-layer chromatography. FA methyl esters from the ChoGpl fraction were quantified using gas chromatography. Our analysis revealed a strong age-related decrease in most FAs, and specific effects of CA in FAs from the arachidonic acid synthesis pathway, which was further validated with RNA-sequencing data. Furthermore, the concentration of most FAs was found to decrease with age. By extending the previous molecular level findings linking CA with altered myelination in the ACC, these results provide further insights regarding white matter alterations associated with early-life adversity.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: SPIKE-TRIGGERED INTRASPINAL MICROSTIMULATION IMPROVES MOTOR PERFORANCE IN AN AMBULATORY RAT MODEL OF SPINAL CORD INJURY</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.21.449323v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The purpose of this study was to determine if spike-triggered intraspinal microstimulation (ISMS) results in improved motor performance in an ambulatory rat model of spinal cord injury (SCI). Experiments were carried out in adult male Sprague Dawley rats with 175 kdyn moderate T8 contusion injury. Rats were randomly assigned to one of two groups: Control or Activity Dependent Stimulation (ADS) therapy. Four weeks post-SCI, all rats were implanted with a recording electrode in the left hindlimb motor cortex and a fine-wire, custom-made stimulating electrode in the contralateral lumbar spinal cord. Intracortical and intraspinal microstimulation were used to find sites of similar hip representation areas, which were paired together for ADS therapy. In the ADS therapy group, spike-stimulus conditioning was administered for 4 hours/day, 4 days/week, for 4 weeks via a tethered cable in a testing chamber. During therapy sessions, single-unit spikes were discriminated in real time in the hindlimb motor cortex and used to trigger stimulation in the spinal cord ventral horn. The optimal stimulus intensity (50% ISMS movement threshold) and spike-stimulus delay (10ms) determined in preliminary anesthetized preparations were used during ADS. Control rats were similarly implanted with electrodes but did not receive stimulation therapy. Motor performances of each rat were evaluated before SCI contusion, once a week post-SCI for four weeks (prior to electrode implantation), and once a week post-conditioning for four weeks. Behavioral testing included BBB scoring, Ledged Beam walking, Horizontal Ladder walking, treadmill kinematics via the DigiGait and TreadScan system, and open field walking using OptiTrack kinematic analysis. BBB scores were significantly improved in ADS rats compared to Control rats after 1 week of therapy. In the ADS therapy rats, BBB scores were significantly improved after two weeks of ADS therapy when compared to pre-therapy. Foot fault scores on the Horizontal Ladder were significantly lower in ADS rats compared to pre-therapy ADS and Control rats after 1 week of therapy and returned to pre-injury measures after three weeks of ADS therapy. The Ledged Beam test and kinematic analysis using the DigiGait and TreadScan system showed deficits after SCI in both ADS and Control rats but there were no significant differences between groups after 4 weeks of ADS therapy. These results show that activity dependent stimulation after spinal cord injury using spike-triggered ISMS enhances behavioral recovery of locomotor function as measured by the BBB score and the Horizontal Ladder task.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Power spectrum slope confounds estimation of instantaneous oscillatory frequency</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.21.449312v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Oscillatory neural dynamics are highly non-stationary and require methods capable of quantifying time-resolved changes in rhythmic activity in order to understand neural function. Recently, a method termed 'frequency sliding' was introduced to estimate the instantaneous frequency of oscillatory activity, providing a means of tracking temporal changes in the dominant frequency within a sub-band of field potential recordings. Here, the ability of frequency sliding to recover ground-truth oscillatory frequency in simulated data is tested while the exponent (slope) of the 1/fx component of the signal power spectrum is systematically varied, mimicking real electrophysiological data. The results show that 1) in the presence of 1/f activity, frequency sliding systematically underestimates the true frequency of the signal, 2) the magnitude of underestimation is correlated with the steepness of the slope, suggesting that, if unaccounted for, slope changes could be misinterpreted as frequency changes, 3) the impact of slope on frequency estimates interacts with oscillation amplitude, indicating that changes in oscillation amplitude alone may also influence instantaneous frequency estimates in the presence of strong 1/f activity; and 4) analysis parameters such as filter bandwidth and location also mediate the influence of slope on estimated frequency, indicating that these settings should be considered when interpreting estimates obtained via frequency sliding. The origin of these biases resides in the output of the filtering step of frequency sliding, whose energy is biased towards lower frequencies precisely because of the 1/f structure of the data. We discuss several strategies to mitigate these biases and provide a proof-of-principle for a 1/f normalization strategy.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Connectome-based model predicts individual psychopathic traits in college students</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.21.449277v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Psychopathic traits have been suggested to increase the risk of violations of socio-moral norms. Previous studies revealed that abnormal neural signatures are associated with elevated psychopathic traits; however, whether the intrinsic network architecture can predict psychopathic traits at the individual level remains unclear. Methods: The present study utilized connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) to investigate whether whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) can predict psychopathic traits in the general population. RS functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected from 84 college students with varying psychopathic traits measured by the Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy Scale (LSRP). Results: We found that RSFC of the negative networks predicted individual differences in total LSRP and secondary psychopathy scores but not primary psychopathy score. Particularly, nodes with the most connections in the predictive connectome anchored in the prefrontal cortex (e.g., anterior prefrontal cortex and orbitofrontal cortex) and limbic system (e.g., anterior cingulate cortex and insula). In addition, the connections between the occipital network (OCCN) and cingulo-opercular network (CON) served as a significant predictive connectome for total LSRP and secondary psychopathy score. Conclusion: CPM constituted by whole-brain RSFC significantly predicted psychopathic traits individually in the general population. The prefrontal cortex and limbic system at the anatomic level and the CON and OCCN at the functional network level plays a special role in the predictive model-reflecting atypical executive control and affective processing for individuals with elevated psychopathic traits. These findings may provide some implications for early detection and potential intervention of psychopathic tendency.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.21.449257v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) represents a complex neurodegenerative disorder with significant genetic heterogeneity. To date, both the genetic etiology and the underlying molecular mechanisms driving this disease remain poorly understood, although in recent years a number of studies have highlighted a number of genetic mutations causative for ALS. With these mutations pointing to potential pathways that may be affected within individuals with ALS, having the ability to generate human neurons and other disease relevant cells containing these mutations becomes even more critical if new therapies are to emerge. Recent developments with the advent of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) gene editing fields gave us the tools to introduce or correct a specific mutation at any site within the genome of an iPSC, and thus model the specific contribution of risk mutations. In this study we describe a rapid and efficient way to either introduce a mutation into a control line, or to correct a mutation, generating an isogenic control line from patient-derived iPSCs with a given mutation. The mutations introduced were the G93A mutation into SOD1 or H517Q into FUS, and the mutation corrected was a patient iPSC line with I114T in SOD1. A combination of small molecules and growth factors were used to guide a stepwise differentiation of the edited cells into motor neurons in order to demonstrate that disease-relevant cells could be generated for downstream applications. Through a combination of iPSCs and CRISPR editing, the cells generated here will provide fundamental insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying neuron degeneration in ALS.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.21.449247v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>While the anatomical properties of regenerated axons across spinal cord lesion sites have been studied extensively, little is known of how the functional properties of regenerated synapses compare to those in unlesioned animals. This comparison has been performed here in the lamprey, a model system for spinal injury research, in which functional locomotor recovery after spinal cord lesions is associated with axonal regeneration across the lesion site. Regenerated synapses below the lesion site did not differ to synapses from unlesioned axons with respect to the amplitude and duration of single excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). They also showed the same activity-dependent depression over spike trains. However, regenerated synapses did differ to unlesioned synapses as the estimated number of synaptic vesicles was greater and there was evidence for an increased postsynaptic quantal amplitude. For axons above the lesion site, the amplitude and duration of single synaptic inputs also did not differ significantly to unlesioned animals. However, in this case there was evidence of a reduction in release probability and inputs facilitated rather that depressed over spike trains. Synaptic inputs from single regenerated axons below the lesion site thus do not increase in amplitude to compensate for the reduced number of descending axons after functional recovery. However, the postsynaptic input is maintained at the unlesioned level using different synaptic properties. Conversely, the facilitation from the same initial amplitude above the lesion site will make the synaptic input over spike trains functionally stronger. This may help to increase propriospinal activity across the lesion site to compensate for the lesion-induced reduction in supraspinal inputs.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Pathogenesis of the inherited neurodegenerative disorder Huntington s Disease (HD) is complex and progressive, with a long presymptomatic phase in which subtle changes occur in the brain of gene carriers up to 15 years before the onset of symptoms. Thus, there is a need of early, functional biomarker to better understand disease progression and to evaluate treatment efficacy far from onset. In particular, recent studies have shown that white matter may be affected early in HD. In this study, we scanned longitudinally Ki140CAG mice with structural MRI, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer of glutamate (gluCEST) and Magnetization Transfer (MT) imaging, in order to assess white matter integrity over the life of this very progressive mouse model. Our results show early defects of diffusion properties in the anterior part of the corpus callosum, preceding gluCEST defects in the same region (-10.8% at 8 months, -19% at 12 months) that spread to adjacent regions. At 12 months, frontal (-7.3%) and piriform (-16.7%) cortices showed reduced gluCEST, as well as the pallidum (-21.0%). MT imaging showed reduced signal in the septum (-21.7%) at 12 months. Cortical and striatal atrophy then appear at 18 months. Vulnerability of the striatum and motor cortex, combined with alterations of anterior corpus callosum, seems to point out the pivotal role of white matter, in the pathogenesis of HD and the pertinence of gluCEST and DTI as biomarkers in HD.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.21.449164v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Emotional similarity refers to the tendency to group stimuli together because they evoke the same feelings in us, even when they look different and have different semantic meanings. It is still unclear which features define the similarity space of emotional categories. Additionally, whether emotional stimuli are perceived as more similar than neutral ones, and whether this difference is paralleled by differences in their neural representations, has never been investigated. We conducted a series of experiments to quantify behavioural similarity, and one that used fMRI and Representation similarity analysis to compute neural similarity. We hypothesised that the similarity between emotional stimuli will be greater than between non-emotional stimuli, paralleled by higher neural similarity among emotional stimuli. We tested these hypotheses with two measures of similarity and two different databases of complex negative and neutral pictures, the second of which allowed us to control semantic similarity. For the first time, we found a decoupling between subjective and objective measures of emotional similarity. Pictures taken from two distinct emotional and neutral categories were perceived as equally similar; however, their neural similarity was higher. This effect was detected in brain clusters localised in a constrained search volume. We conclude that features representing participants similarity space may have different weights in these regions than they do in explicit ratings.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Post-mortem MRI provides the opportunity to acquire high-resolution datasets to investigate neuroanatomy, and validate the origins of image contrast through microscopy comparisons. We introduce the Digital Brain Bank (open.win.ox.ac.uk/DigitalBrainBank), an interactive data discovery and release platform providing open access to curated, multimodal post-mortem neuroimaging datasets. Datasets span three themes - Digital Neuroanatomist: data for neuroanatomical investigations; Digital Brain Zoo: data for comparative neuroanatomy; Digital Pathologist: data for neuropathology investigations. The first Digital Brain Bank release includes fourteen distinctive whole-brain diffusion MRI datasets for structural connectivity investigations, alongside microscopy and complementary MRI modalities. This includes one of the highest-resolution whole-brain human diffusion MRI datasets ever acquired, whole-brain diffusion MRI in seven non-human primate species, and one of the largest post-mortem whole-brain cohort imaging studies in neurodegeneration. Taken together, the Digital Brain Bank provides a cross-scale, cross-species investigation framework facilitating the incorporation of post-mortem data into neuroimaging studies.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/g1HQjGTKbG8/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Felix Barber, Jiseon Min, Andrew W. Murray, Ariel Amir&lt;/p&gt;

Microbial populations show striking diversity in cell growth morphology and lifecycle; however, our understanding of how these factors influence the growth rate of cell populations remains limited. We use theory and simulations to predict the impact of asymmetric cell division, cell size regulation and single-cell stochasticity on the population growth rate. Our model predicts that coarse-grained noise in the single-cell growth rate λ decreases the population growth rate, as previously seen for symmetrically dividing cells. However, for a given noise in λ we find that dividing asymmetrically can enhance the population growth rate for cells with strong size control (between a “sizer” and an “adder”). To reconcile this finding with the abundance of symmetrically dividing organisms in nature, we propose that additional constraints on cell growth and division must be present which are not included in our model, and we explore the effects of selected extensions thereof. Further, we find that within our model, epigenetically inherited generation times may arise due to size control in asymmetrically dividing cells, providing a possible explanation for recent experimental observations in budding yeast. Taken together, our findings provide insight into the complex effects generated by non-canonical growth morphologies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/g1HQjGTKbG8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

It is computationally challenging to detect variation by aligning single-molecule sequencing (SMS) reads, or contigs from SMS assemblies. One approach to efficiently align SMS reads is sparse dynamic programming (SDP), where optimal chains of exact matches are found between the sequence and the genome. While straightforward implementations of SDP penalize gaps with a cost that is a linear function of gap length, biological variation is more accurately represented when gap cost is a concave function of gap length. We have developed a method, lra, that uses SDP with a concave-cost gap penalty, and used lra to align long-read sequences from PacBio and Oxford Nanopore (ONT) instruments as well as de novo assembly contigs. This alignment approach increases sensitivity and specificity for SV discovery, particularly for variants above 1kb and when discovering variation from ONT reads, while having runtime that are comparable (1.05-3.76×) to current methods. When applied to calling variation from &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; assembly contigs, there is a 3.2% increase in Truvari F1 score compared to minimap2+htsbox. lra is available in bioconda (https://anaconda.org/bioconda/lra) and github (https://github.com/ChaissonLab/LRA).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2xVBVLC1hG0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Examining the dynamics of Epstein-Barr virus shedding in the tonsils and the impact of HIV-1 coinfection on daily saliva viral loads</title>

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is transmitted by saliva and is a major cause of cancer, particularly in people living with HIV/AIDS. Here, we describe the frequency and quantity of EBV detection in the saliva of Ugandan adults with and without HIV-1 infection and use these data to develop a novel mathematical model of EBV infection in the tonsils. Eligible cohort participants were not taking antiviral medications, and those with HIV-1 infection had a CD4 count &amp;gt;200 cells/mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Over a 4-week period, participants provided daily oral swabs that we analysed for the presence and quantity of EBV. Compared with HIV-1 uninfected participants, HIV-1 coinfected participants had an increased risk of EBV detection in their saliva (IRR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.10–1.47) and higher viral loads in positive samples. We used these data to develop a stochastic, mechanistic mathematical model that describes the dynamics of EBV, infected cells, and immune response within the tonsillar epithelium to analyse potential factors that may cause EBV infection to be more severe in HIV-1 coinfected participants. The model, fit using Approximate Bayesian Computation, showed high fidelity to daily oral shedding data and matched key summary statistics. When evaluating how model parameters differed among participants with and without HIV-1 coinfection, results suggest HIV-1 coinfected individuals have higher rates of B cell reactivation, which can seed new infection in the tonsils and lower rates of an EBV-specific immune response. Subsequently, both these traits may explain higher and more frequent EBV detection in the saliva of HIV-1 coinfected individuals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/h-FIW7cLmaQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The P2 purinergic receptor family implicated in many physiological processes, including neurotransmission, mechanical adaptation and inflammation, consists of ATP-gated non-specific cation channels P2XRs and G-protein coupled receptors P2YRs. Different cells, including bone forming osteoblasts, express multiple P2 receptors; however, how P2X and P2Y receptors interact in generating cellular responses to various doses of [ATP] remains poorly understood. Using primary bone marrow and compact bone derived osteoblasts and BMP2-expressing C2C12 osteoblastic cells, we demonstrated conserved features in the P2-mediated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; responses to ATP, including a transition of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; response signatures from transient at low [ATP] to oscillatory at moderate [ATP], and back to transient at high [ATP], and a non-monotonic changes in the response magnitudes which exhibited two troughs at 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; M [ATP]. We identified P2Y2 and P2X7 receptors as predominantly contributing to these responses and constructed a mathematical model of P2Y2R-induced inositol trisphosphate (IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) mediated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release coupled to a Markov model of P2X7R dynamics to study this system. Model predictions were validated using parental and CRISPR/Cas9-generated P2Y2 and P2Y7 knockouts in osteoblastic C2C12-BMP cells. Activation of P2Y2 by progressively increasing [ATP] induced a transition from transient to oscillatory to transient Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; responses due to the biphasic nature of IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Rs and the interaction of SERCA pumps with IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Rs. At high [ATP], activation of P2X7R modulated the response magnitudes through an interplay between the biphasic nature of IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Rs and the desensitization kinetics of P2X7Rs. Moreover, we found that P2Y2 activity may alter the kinetics of P2X7 towards favouring naïve state activation. Finally, we demonstrated the functional consequences of lacking P2Y2 or P2X7 in osteoblast mechanotransduction. This study thus provides important insights into the biophysical mechanisms underlying ATP-dependent Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; response signatures, which are important in mediating bone mechanoadaptation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0oaZkVb-YpA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Tumour cell heterogeneity is a major barrier for efficient design of targeted anti-cancer therapies. A diverse distribution of phenotypically distinct tumour-cell subpopulations prior to drug treatment predisposes to non-uniform responses, leading to the elimination of sensitive cancer cells whilst leaving resistant subpopulations unharmed. Few strategies have been proposed for quantifying the variability associated to individual cancer-cell heterogeneity and minimizing its undesirable impact on clinical outcomes. Here, we report a computational approach that allows the rational design of combinatorial therapies involving epigenetic drugs against chromatin modifiers. We have formulated a stochastic model of a bivalent transcription factor that allows us to characterise three different qualitative behaviours, namely: bistable, high- and low-gene expression. Comparison between analytical results and experimental data determined that the so-called bistable and high-gene expression behaviours can be identified with undifferentiated and differentiated cell types, respectively. Since undifferentiated cells with an aberrant self-renewing potential might exhibit a cancer/metastasis-initiating phenotype, we analysed the efficiency of combining epigenetic drugs against the background of heterogeneity within the bistable sub-ensemble. Whereas single-targeted approaches mostly failed to circumvent the therapeutic problems represented by tumour heterogeneity, combinatorial strategies fared much better. Specifically, the more successful combinations were predicted to involve modulators of the histone H3K4 and H3K27 demethylases KDM5 and KDM6A/UTX. Those strategies involving the H3K4 and H3K27 methyltransferases MLL2 and EZH2, however, were predicted to be less effective. Our theoretical framework provides a coherent basis for the development of an &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; platform capable of identifying the epigenetic drugs combinations best-suited to therapeutically manage non-uniform responses of heterogenous cancer cell populations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1sjLZ8UdrgE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Cellular force generation and force transmission are of fundamental importance for numerous biological processes and can be studied with the methods of Traction Force Microscopy (TFM) and Monolayer Stress Microscopy. Traction Force Microscopy and Monolayer Stress Microscopy solve the inverse problem of reconstructing cell-matrix tractions and inter- and intra-cellular stresses from the measured cell force-induced deformations of an adhesive substrate with known elasticity. Although several laboratories have developed software for Traction Force Microscopy and Monolayer Stress Microscopy computations, there is currently no software package available that allows non-expert users to perform a full evaluation of such experiments. Here we present pyTFM, a tool to perform Traction Force Microscopy and Monolayer Stress Microscopy on cell patches and cell layers grown in a 2-dimensional environment. pyTFM was optimized for ease-of-use; it is open-source and well documented (hosted at https://pytfm.readthedocs.io/) including usage examples and explanations of the theoretical background. pyTFM can be used as a standalone Python package or as an add-on to the image annotation tool &lt;i&gt;ClickPoints&lt;/i&gt;. In combination with the &lt;i&gt;ClickPoints&lt;/i&gt; environment, pyTFM allows the user to set all necessary analysis parameters, select regions of interest, examine the input data and intermediary results, and calculate a wide range of parameters describing forces, stresses, and their distribution. In this work, we also thoroughly analyze the accuracy and performance of the Traction Force Microscopy and Monolayer Stress Microscopy algorithms of pyTFM using synthetic and experimental data from epithelial cell patches.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Qmm2fhn5cA4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Synaptic plasticity is a cellular model for learning and memory. However, the expression mechanisms underlying presynaptic forms of plasticity are not well understood. Here, we investigate functional and structural correlates of presynaptic potentiation at large hippocampal mossy fiber boutons induced by the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin. We performed 2-photon imaging of the genetically encoded glutamate sensor iGlu&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; that revealed an increase in the surface area used for glutamate release at potentiated terminals. Time-gated stimulated emission depletion microscopy revealed no change in the coupling distance between P/Q-type calcium channels and release sites mapped by Munc13-1 cluster position. Finally, by high-pressure freezing and transmission electron microscopy analysis, we found a fast remodeling of synaptic ultrastructure at potentiated boutons: Synaptic vesicles dispersed in the terminal and accumulated at the active zones, while active zone density and synaptic complexity increased. We suggest that these rapid and early structural rearrangements might enable long-term increase in synaptic strength.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/epQIgyneSMY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>We confirmed the presence of von Economo neurons in the frontoinsular cortex of all animals.

Abstract
With rates of psychiatric illnesses such as depression continuing to rise, additional preclinical models are needed to facilitate translational neuroscience research. In the current study, the raccoon (Procyon lotor) was investigated due to its similarities with primate brains, including comparable proportional neuronal densities, cortical magnification of the forepaw area, and cortical gyrification. Specifically, we report on the cytoarchitectural characteristics of raccoons profiled as high, intermediate, or low solvers in a multiaccess problem‐solving task. Isotropic fractionation indicated that high‐solvers had significantly more cells in the hippocampus (HC) than the other solving groups; further, a nonsignificant trend suggested that this increase in cell profile density was due to increased nonneuronal (e.g., glial) cells. Group differences were not observed in the cellular density of the somatosensory cortex. Thionin‐based staining confirmed the presence of von Economo neurons (VENs) in the frontoinsular cortex, although no impact of solving ability on VEN cell profile density levels was observed. Elongated fusiform cells were quantified in the HC dentate gyrus where high‐solvers were observed to have higher levels of this cell type than the other solving groups. In sum, the current findings suggest that varying cytoarchitectural phenotypes contribute to cognitive flexibility. Additional research is necessary to determine the translational value of cytoarchitectural distribution patterns on adaptive behavioral outcomes associated with cognitive performance and mental health.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The apparent dichotomy between information-processing and dynamical
approaches to complexity science forces researchers to choose between two
diverging sets of tools and explanations, creating conflict and often hindering
scientific progress. Nonetheless, given the shared theoretical goals between
both approaches, it is reasonable to conjecture the existence of underlying
common signatures that capture interesting behaviour in both dynamical and
information-processing systems. Here we argue that a pragmatic use of
Integrated Information Theory (IIT), originally conceived in theoretical
neuroscience, can provide a potential unifying framework to study complexity in
general multivariate systems. Furthermore, by leveraging metrics put forward by
the integrated information decomposition ($\Phi$ID) framework, our results
reveal that integrated information can effectively capture surprisingly
heterogeneous signatures of complexity -- including metastability and
criticality in networks of coupled oscillators as well as distributed
computation and emergent stable particles in cellular automata -- without
relying on idiosyncratic, ad-hoc criteria. These results show how an agnostic
use of IIT can provide important steps towards bridging the gap between
informational and dynamical approaches to complex systems.

from the number of different blocks, which can vary a lot in Minecraft, and
enable the generation of larger levels. Finally, we demonstrate that changing

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10112</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Supervised deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) are currently one of
the best computational models that can explain how the primate ventral visual
stream solves object recognition. However, embodied cognition has not been
considered in the existing visual processing models. From the ecological
standpoint, humans learn to recognize objects by interacting with them,
allowing better classification, specialization, and generalization. Here, we
ask if computational models under the embodied learning framework can explain
mechanisms underlying object recognition in the primate visual system better
than the existing supervised models? To address this question, we use
reinforcement learning to train neural network models to play a 3D computer
game and we find that these reinforcement learning models achieve neural
response prediction accuracy scores in the early visual areas (e.g., V1 and V2)
in the levels that are comparable to those accomplished by the supervised
neural network model. In contrast, the supervised neural network models yield
better neural response predictions in the higher visual areas, compared to the
reinforcement learning models. Our preliminary results suggest the future
direction of visual neuroscience in which deep reinforcement learning should be
included to fill the missing embodiment concept.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fitting network models to neural activity is becoming an important tool in
neuroscience. A popular approach is to model a brain area with a probabilistic
recurrent spiking network whose parameters maximize the likelihood of the
recorded activity. Although this is widely used, we show that the resulting
model does not produce realistic neural activity and wrongly estimates the
connectivity matrix when neurons that are not recorded have a substantial
impact on the recorded network. To correct for this, we suggest to augment the
log-likelihood with terms that measure the dissimilarity between simulated and
recorded activity. This dissimilarity is defined via summary statistics
commonly used in neuroscience, and the optimization is efficient because it
relies on back-propagation through the stochastically simulated spike trains.
We analyze this method theoretically and show empirically that it generates
more realistic activity statistics and recovers the connectivity matrix better
than other methods.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Meta-control of social learning strategies. (arXiv:2106.10015v1 [cs.SI])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10015</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Social learning, copying other's behavior without actual experience, offers a
cost-effective means of knowledge acquisition. However, it raises the
fundamental question of which individuals have reliable information: successful
individuals versus the majority. The former and the latter are known
respectively as success-based and conformist social learning strategies. We
show here that while the success-based strategy fully exploits the benign
environment of low uncertainly, it fails in uncertain environments. On the
other hand, the conformist strategy can effectively mitigate this adverse
effect. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that meta-control of
individual and social learning strategies provides effective and
sample-efficient learning in volatile and uncertain environments. Simulations
on a set of environments with various levels of volatility and uncertainty
confirmed our hypothesis. The results imply that meta-control of social
learning affords agents the leverage to resolve environmental uncertainty with
minimal exploration cost, by exploiting others' learning as an external
knowledge base.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;``Rotating Snakes'' is a visual illusion in which a stationary design is
perceived to move dramatically. In the current study, the mechanism that
generates perception of motion was analyzed using a combination of
psychophysics experiments and deep neural network models that mimic human
vision. We prepared three- and four-color illusion-like designs with a wide
range of luminance and measured their strength of induced rotational motion. As
a result, we discovered the fundamental law that the effect of the four-color
snake rotation illusion was successfully enhanced by the combination of two
``perceptual motion vectors'' produced by the two ``three-color'' designs. In
years to come, deep neural network technology will be one of the most effective
tools not only for engineering applications but also for human perception
research.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: A Fresh Approach to Evaluate Performance in Distributed Parallel Genetic Algorithms. (arXiv:2106.09922v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09922</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This work proposes a novel approach to evaluate and analyze the behavior of
multi-population parallel genetic algorithms (PGAs) when running on a cluster
of multi-core processors. In particular, we deeply study their numerical and
computational behavior by proposing a mathematical model representing the
observed performance curves. In them, we discuss the emerging mathematical
descriptions of PGA performance instead of, e.g., individual isolated results
subject to visual inspection, for a better understanding of the effects of the
number of cores used (scalability), their migration policy (the migration gap,
in this paper), and the features of the solved problem (type of encoding and
problem size). The conclusions based on the real figures and the numerical
models fitting them represent a fresh way of understanding their speed-up,
running time, and numerical effort, allowing a comparison based on a few
meaningful numeric parameters. This represents a set of conclusions beyond the
usual textual lessons found in past works on PGAs. It can be used as an
estimation tool for the future performance of the algorithms and a way of
finding out their limitations.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Effective Model Sparsification by Scheduled Grow-and-Prune Methods. (arXiv:2106.09857v1 [cs.CV])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09857</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep neural networks (DNNs) are effective in solving many real-world
problems. Larger DNN models usually exhibit better quality (e.g., accuracy) but
their excessive computation results in long training and inference time. Model
sparsification can reduce the computation and memory cost while maintaining
model quality. Most existing sparsification algorithms unidirectionally remove
weights, while others randomly or greedily explore a small subset of weights in
each layer. The inefficiency of the algorithms reduces the achievable sparsity
level. In addition, many algorithms still require pre-trained dense models and
thus suffer from large memory footprint and long training time. In this paper,
we propose a novel scheduled grow-and-prune (GaP) methodology without
pre-training the dense models. It addresses the shortcomings of the previous
works by repeatedly growing a subset of layers to dense and then pruning back
to sparse after some training. Experiments have shown that such models can
match or beat the quality of highly optimized dense models at 80% sparsity on a
variety of tasks, such as image classification, objective detection, 3D object
part segmentation, and translation. They also outperform other state-of-the-art
(SOTA) pruning methods, including pruning from pre-trained dense models. As an
example, a 90% sparse ResNet-50 obtained via GaP achieves 77.9% top-1 accuracy
on ImageNet, improving the SOTA results by 1.5%.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Dual-Teacher Class-Incremental Learning With Data-Free Generative Replay. (arXiv:2106.09835v1 [cs.CV])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09835</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This paper proposes two novel knowledge transfer techniques for
class-incremental learning (CIL). First, we propose data-free generative replay
(DF-GR) to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in CIL by using synthetic samples
from a generative model. In the conventional generative replay, the generative
model is pre-trained for old data and shared in extra memory for later
incremental learning. In our proposed DF-GR, we train a generative model from
scratch without using any training data, based on the pre-trained
classification model from the past, so we curtail the cost of sharing
pre-trained generative models. Second, we introduce dual-teacher information
distillation (DT-ID) for knowledge distillation from two teachers to one
student. In CIL, we use DT-ID to learn new classes incrementally based on the
pre-trained model for old classes and another model (pre-)trained on the new
data for new classes. We implemented the proposed schemes on top of one of the
state-of-the-art CIL methods and showed the performance improvement on
CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets.

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.688673</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the complex neural circuits that underpin brain function and behavior has been a long-standing goal of neuroscience. Yet this is no small feat considering the interconnectedness of neurons and other cell types, both within and across brain regions. In this review, we describe recent advances in mouse molecular genetic engineering that can be used to integrate information on brain activity and structure at regional, cellular, and subcellular levels. The convergence of structural inputs can be mapped throughout the brain in a cell type-specific manner by antero- and retrograde viral systems expressing various fluorescent proteins and genetic switches. Furthermore, neural activity can be manipulated using opto- and chemo-genetic tools to interrogate the functional significance of this input convergence. Monitoring neuronal activity is obtained with precise spatiotemporal resolution using genetically encoded sensors for calcium changes and specific neurotransmitters. Combining these genetically engineered mapping tools is a compelling approach for unraveling the structural and functional brain architecture of complex behaviors and malfunctioned states of neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Long Non-coding RNA LINC01119 Promotes Neuropathic Pain by Stabilizing BDNF Transcript</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.673669</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuropathic pain (NP) is caused by primary injury or dysfunction of the peripheral and the central nervous system. Long non-coding RNAs were critical regulators involved in nervous system diseases, however, the precise regulatory mechanism remains unclear. This study aims to uncover the essential role of LINC01119 in NP progression and further clarify the underlying regulatory mechanism at post-transcriptional level. LINC01119 was significantly upregulated in rats of spare nerve injury (SNI) group compared to sham group. Functionally, silencing of LINC01119 significantly alleviated the neuropathic pain-induced hypersensitivity and reduced the increase in IL−6, IL−1β, and TNF−α caused by SNI. Mechanistically, Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was identified as the functional target of LINC01119. Besides, an RNA binding protein, ELAVL1 could directly interact with LINC01119, and this formed LINC01119- ELAVL1 complex binds to BDNF mRNA, strengthening its RNA stability and increasing the expression level of BDNF at both transcript and protein levels. Clinically, serum LINC01119 was verified as a promising diagnostic biomarker for NP patients. LINC01119 induces NP progression via binding with ELAVL1 and increasing BDNF mRNA stability and expression level. Therefore, LINC01119 may serve as a promising diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for NP treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.683426</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep learning implementations using convolutional neural nets have recently demonstrated promise in many areas of medical imaging. In this article we lay out the methods by which we have achieved consistently high quality, high throughput computation of intra-cranial segmentation from whole head magnetic resonance images, an essential but typically time-consuming bottleneck for brain image analysis. We refer to this output as “production-level” because it is suitable for routine use in processing pipelines. Training and testing with an extremely large archive of structural images, our segmentation algorithm performs uniformly well over a wide variety of separate national imaging cohorts, giving Dice metric scores exceeding those of other recent deep learning brain extractions. We describe the components involved to achieve this performance, including size, variety and quality of ground truth, and appropriate neural net architecture. We demonstrate the crucial role of appropriately large and varied datasets, suggesting a less prominent role for algorithm development beyond a threshold of capability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are two related currently incurable neurodegenerative diseases. ALS is characterized by degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons causing relentless paralysis of voluntary muscles, whereas in FTD, progressive atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain results in deterioration of cognitive functions, language, personality, and behavior. In contrast to Alzheimer’s disease (AD), ALS and FTD still lack a specific neurochemical biomarker reflecting neuropathology ex vivo. However, in the past 10 years, considerable progress has been made in the characterization of neurofilament light chain (NFL) as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood biomarker for both diseases. NFL is a structural component of the axonal cytoskeleton and is released into the CSF as a consequence of axonal damage or degeneration, thus behaving in general as a relatively non-specific marker of neuroaxonal pathology. However, in ALS, the elevation of its CSF levels exceeds that observed in most other neurological diseases, making it useful for the discrimination from mimic conditions and potentially worthy of consideration for introduction into diagnostic criteria. Moreover, NFL correlates with disease progression rate and is negatively associated with survival, thus providing prognostic information. In FTD patients, CSF NFL is elevated compared with healthy individuals and, to a lesser extent, patients with other forms of dementia, but the latter difference is not sufficient to enable a satisfying diagnostic performance at individual patient level. However, also in FTD, CSF NFL correlates with several measures of disease severity. Due to technological progress, NFL can now be quantified also in peripheral blood, where it is present at much lower concentrations compared with CSF, thus allowing less invasive sampling, scalability, and longitudinal measurements. The latter has promoted innovative studies demonstrating longitudinal kinetics of NFL in presymptomatic individuals harboring gene mutations causing ALS and FTD. Especially in ALS, NFL levels are generally stable over time, which, together with their correlation with progression rate, makes NFL an ideal pharmacodynamic biomarker for therapeutic trials. In this review, we illustrate the significance of NFL as biomarker for ALS and FTD and discuss unsolved issues and potential for future developments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.661504</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objectives To characterize subcortical nuclei by multi-parametric quantitative magnetic resonance imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials and Methods: The following quantitative multiparametric MR data of five healthy volunteers were acquired on a 7T MRI system: 3D gradient echo (GRE) data for the calculation of quantitative susceptibility maps (QSM), GRE sequences with and without off-resonant magnetic transfer pulse for magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) calculation, a magnetization−prepared 2 rapid acquisition gradient echo sequence for T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; mapping, and (after a coil change) a density-adapted 3D radial pulse sequence for &lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;Na imaging. First, all data were co-registered to the GRE data, volumes of interest (VOIs) for 21 subcortical structures were drawn manually for each volunteer, and a combined voxel-wise analysis of the four MR contrasts (QSM, MTR, T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;Na) in each structure was conducted to assess the quantitative, MR value-based differentiability of structures. Second, a machine learning algorithm based on random forests was trained to automatically classify the groups of multi-parametric voxel values from each VOI according to their association to one of the 21 subcortical structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results The analysis of the integrated multimodal visualization of quantitative MR values in each structure yielded a successful classification among nuclei of the ascending reticular activation system (ARAS), the limbic system and the extrapyramidal system, while classification among (epi-)thalamic nuclei was less successful. The machine learning-based approach facilitated quantitative MR value-based structure classification especially in the group of extrapyramidal nuclei and reached an overall accuracy of 85% regarding all selected nuclei.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion Multimodal quantitative MR enabled excellent differentiation of a wide spectrum of subcortical nuclei with reasonable accuracy and may thus enable sensitive detection of disease and nucleus-specific MR-based contrast alterations in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Parametric Estimation of Reference Signal Intensity for Semi-Quantification of Tau Deposition: A Flortaucipir and [18F]-APN-1607 Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.598234</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Tau positron emission tomography (PET) imaging can reveal the pathophysiology and neurodegeneration that occurs in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in vivo. The standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) is widely used for semi-quantification of tau deposition but is susceptible to disturbance from the reference region and the partial volume effect (PVE). To overcome this problem, we applied the parametric estimation of reference signal intensity (PERSI) method—which was previously evaluated for flortaucipir imaging—to two tau tracers, flortaucipir and [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]-APN-1607.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Two cohorts underwent tau PET scanning. Flortaucipir PET imaging data for cohort I (65 healthy controls [HCs], 60 patients with mild cognitive impairment [MCI], and 12 AD patients) were from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative database. [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]-APN-1607 ([&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]-PM-PBB3) PET imaging data were for Cohort II, which included 21 patients with a clinical diagnosis of amyloid PET-positive AD and 15 HCs recruited at Huashan Hospital. We used white matter (WM) postprocessed by PERSI (PERSI-WM) as the reference region and compared this with the traditional semi-quantification method that uses the whole cerebellum as the reference. SUVRs were calculated for regions of interest including the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes; anterior and posterior cingulate; precuneus; and Braak I/II (entorhinal cortex and hippocampus). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and effect sizes were used to compare the two methods in terms of ability to discriminate between different clinical groups.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;In both cohorts, regional SUVR determined using the PERSI-WM method was superior to using the cerebellum as reference region for measuring tau retention in AD patients (e.g., SUVR of the temporal lobe: flortaucipir, 1.08 ± 0.17 and [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]-APN-1607, 1.57 ± 0.34); and estimates of the effect size and areas under the ROC curve (AUC) indicated that it also increased between-group differences (e.g., AUC of the temporal lobe for HC vs AD: flortaucipir, 0.893 and [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]-APN-1607: 0.949).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The PERSI-WM method significantly improves diagnostic discrimination compared to conventional approach of using the cerebellum as a reference region and can mitigate the PVE; it can thus enhance the efficacy of semi-quantification of multiple tau tracers in PET scanning, making it suitable for large-scale clinical application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Prefrontal Theta-Phase Synchronized Brain Stimulation With Real-Time EEG-Triggered TMS</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.691821</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Theta-band neuronal oscillations in the prefrontal cortex are associated with several cognitive functions. Oscillatory phase is an important correlate of excitability and phase synchrony mediates information transfer between neuronal populations oscillating at that frequency. The ability to extract and exploit the prefrontal theta rhythm in real time in humans would facilitate insight into neurophysiological mechanisms of cognitive processes involving the prefrontal cortex, and development of brain-state-dependent stimulation for therapeutic applications.&lt;/p&gt;Objectives&lt;p&gt;We investigate individual source-space beamforming-based estimation of the prefrontal theta oscillation as a method to target specific phases of the ongoing theta oscillations in the human dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) with real-time EEG-triggered transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Different spatial filters for extracting the prefrontal theta oscillation from EEG signals are compared and additional signal quality criteria are assessed to take into account the dynamics of this cortical oscillation.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Twenty two healthy participants were recruited for anatomical MRI scans and EEG recordings with 18 composing the final analysis. We calculated individual spatial filters based on EEG beamforming in source space. The extracted EEG signal was then used to simulate real-time phase-detection and quantify the accuracy as compared to post-hoc phase estimates. Different spatial filters and triggering parameters were compared. Finally, we validated the feasibility of this approach by actual real-time triggering of TMS pulses at different phases of the prefrontal theta oscillation.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Higher phase-detection accuracy was achieved using individualized source-based spatial filters, as compared to an average or standard Laplacian filter, and also by detecting and avoiding periods of low theta amplitude and periods containing a phase reset. Using optimized parameters, prefrontal theta-phase synchronized TMS of DMPFC was achieved with an accuracy of ±55°.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This study demonstrates the feasibility of triggering TMS pulses during different phases of the ongoing prefrontal theta oscillation in real time. This method is relevant for brain state-dependent stimulation in human studies of cognition. It will also enable new personalized therapeutic repetitive TMS protocols for more effective treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Groupitizing Improves Estimation of Numerosity of Auditory Sequences</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.687321</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Groupitizing is a recently described phenomenon of numerosity perception where clustering items of a set into smaller “subitizable” groups improves discrimination. Groupitizing is thought to be rooted on the subitizing system, with which it shares several properties: both phenomena accelerate counting and decrease estimation thresholds irrespective of stimulus format (for both simultaneous and sequential numerosity perception) and both rely on attention. As previous research on groupitizing has been almost completely limited to vision, the current study investigates whether it generalizes to other sensory modalities. Participants estimated the numerosity of a series of tones clustered either by proximity in time or by similarity in frequency. We found that compared with unstructured tone sequences, grouping lowered auditory estimation thresholds by up to 20%. The groupitizing advantage was similar across different grouping conditions, temporal proximity and tone frequency similarity. These results mirror the groupitizing effect for visual stimuli, suggesting that, like subitizing, groupitizing is an a-modal phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Changes in Corticospinal Circuits During Premovement Facilitation in Physiological Conditions</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.684013</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Changes in corticospinal excitability have been well documented in the preparatory period before movement, however, their mechanisms and physiological role have not been entirely elucidated. We aimed to investigate the functional changes of excitatory corticospinal circuits during a reaction time (RT) motor task (thumb abduction) in healthy subjects (HS). 26 HS received single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the primary motor cortex (M1). After a visual go signal, we calculated RT and delivered TMS at three intervals (50, 100, and 150 ms) within RT and before movement onset, recording motor evoked potentials (MEP) from the abductor pollicis brevis (APB) and the task-irrelevant abductor digiti minimi (ADM). We found that TMS increased MEP&lt;sub&gt;APB&lt;/sub&gt; amplitude when delivered at 150, 100, and 50 ms before movement onset, demonstrating the occurrence of premovement facilitation (PMF). MEP increase was greater at the shorter interval (MEP&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) and restricted to APB (no significant effects were detected recording from ADM). We also reported time-dependent changes of the RT and a TMS side-dependent effect on MEP amplitude (greater on the dominant side). In conclusion, we here report changes of RT and side-dependent, selective and facilitatory effects on the MEP&lt;sub&gt;APB&lt;/sub&gt; amplitude when TMS is delivered before movement onset (PMF), supporting the role of excitatory corticospinal mechanisms at the basis of the selective PMF of the target muscle during the RT protocol.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Impairment and Compensation in Dexterous Upper-Limb Function After Stroke. From the Direct Consequences of Pyramidal Tract Lesions to Behavioral Involvement of Both Upper-Limbs in Daily Activities</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.662006</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Impairments in dexterous upper limb function are a significant cause of disability following stroke. While the physiological basis of movement deficits consequent to a lesion in the pyramidal tract is well demonstrated, specific mechanisms contributing to optimal recovery are less apparent. Various upper limb interventions (motor learning methods, neurostimulation techniques, robotics, virtual reality, and serious games) are associated with improvements in motor performance, but many patients continue to experience significant limitations with object handling in everyday activities. Exactly how we go about consolidating adaptive motor behaviors through the rehabilitation process thus remains a considerable challenge. An important part of this problem is the ability to successfully distinguish the extent to which a given gesture is determined by the neuromotor impairment and that which is determined by a compensatory mechanism. This question is particularly complicated in tasks involving manual dexterity where prehensile movements are contingent upon the task (individual digit movement, grasping, and manipulation…) and its objective (placing, two step actions…), as well as personal factors (motivation, acquired skills, and life habits…) and contextual cues related to the environment (presence of tools or assistive devices…). Presently, there remains a lack of integrative studies which differentiate processes related to structural changes associated with the neurological lesion and those related to behavioral change in response to situational constraints. In this text, we shall question the link between impairments, motor strategies and individual performance in object handling tasks. This scoping review will be based on clinical studies, and discussed in relation to more general findings about hand and upper limb function (manipulation of objects, tool use in daily life activity). We shall discuss how further quantitative studies on human manipulation in ecological contexts may provide greater insight into compensatory motor behavior in patients with a neurological impairment of dexterous upper-limb function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neural Correlates of Attentional Modulation of Prepulse Inhibition</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.649566</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Prepulse inhibition (PPI) refers to the suppression of the startle reflex when the intense startling stimulus is shortly (20–500 ms) preceded by a weak non-startling stimulus (prepulse). Although the main neural correlates of PPI lie in the brainstem, previous research has revealed that PPI can be top-down modulated by attention. However, in the previous attend-to-prepulse PPI paradigm, only continuous prepulse but not discrete prepulse (20 ms) could elicit attentional modulation of PPI. Also, the relationship between the attentional enhancement of PPI and the changes in early cortical representations of prepulse signals is unclear. This study develops a novel attend-to-prepulse PPI task, when the discrete prepulse is set at 150 ms at a lead interval of 270 ms, and reveals that the PPI with attended prepulse is larger than the PPI with ignored prepulse. In addition, the early cortical representations (N1/P2 complex) of the prepulse show dissociation between the attended and ignored prepulse. N1 component is enhanced by directed attention, and the attentional increase of the N1 component is positively correlated with the attentional enhancement of PPI, whereas the P2 component is not affected by attentional modulation. Thus, directed attention to the prepulse can enhance both PPI and the early cortical representation of the prepulse signal (N1).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: General and Specific Effects of Stereo Learning</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.535512</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Technological advancements in virtual reality challenge the human vision, especially stereopsis, a function, which characterizes how two eyes coordinate to form a unified three-dimensional (3D) representation of the external world and is found to be deficient in 30% of the normal population. Although a few previous studies have consistently found that the perceptual learning of stereopsis significantly improved stereoacuity, an underlying mechanism of stereo learning remains heavily debated. Here, we trained subjects with normal stereo vision (assessed with the FLY Stereo Acuity Test) to judge stereopsis containing three types of binocular disparity orders (i.e., zero-, first-, and second-order), aiming to systematically examine the characteristics and plasticity of stereo learning. Thirty subjects were randomly assigned to the three training groups (each for the zero-, first-, or second-order disparity separately). The disparity thresholds were measured before and after training. The disparity threshold was measured in 10 additional control subjects only at the pre- and post-training phase. Stereoscopic images were displayed through a shutter goggle, which is synchronized to a monitor. We found that the training significantly improved the zero-, first-, and second-order disparity threshold by 52.42, 36.28, and 14.9% in the zero-order training condition; 30.44, 63.74, and 21.07% in the first-order training condition; and 30.77, 25.19, and 75.12% in the second-order training condition, respectively. There was no significant improvement in the control group. Interestingly, the greatest improvements in the first- and second-order disparity threshold were found in the corresponding disparity training group; on the contrary, the improvements in the zero-order disparity threshold were comparable across all the three disparity training groups. Our findings demonstrated both general (related to the zero-order disparity) and specific improvements (related to the first- and second-order disparity) in stereo learning, suggesting that stereo training occurs at different visual processing stages and its effects might depend on the specific training sites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The deep lasso algorithm (dlasso) is introduced as a neural version of the statistical linear lasso algorithm that holds benefits from both methodologies: feature selection and automatic optimization of the parameters (including the regularization parameter). This last property makes dlasso particularly attractive for feature selection on small samples. In the two first conducted experiments, it was observed that dlasso is capable of obtaining better performance than its non-neuronal version (traditional lasso), in terms of predictive error and correct variable selection. Once that dlasso performance has been assessed, it is used to determine whether it is possible to predict the severity of symptoms in children with ADHD from four scales that measure family burden, family functioning, parental satisfaction, and parental mental health. Results show that dlasso is able to predict parents' assessment of the severity of their children's inattention from only seven items from the previous scales. These items are related to parents' satisfaction and degree of parental burden.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.657151</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spike sorting is used to classify the spikes (action potentials acquired by physiological electrodes), aiming to identify their respective firing units. Now it has been developed to classify the spikes recorded by multi-electrode arrays (MEAs), with the improvement of micro-electrode technology. However, how to improve classification accuracy and maintain low time complexity simultaneously becomes a difficulty. A fast and accurate spike sorting approach named HTsort is proposed for high-density multi-electrode arrays in this paper. Several improvements have been introduced to the traditional pipeline that is composed of threshold detection and clustering method. First, the divide-and-conquer method is employed to utilize electrode spatial information to achieve pre-clustering. Second, the clustering method HDBSCAN (hierarchical density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise) is used to classify spikes and detect overlapping events (multiple spikes firing simultaneously). Third, the template merging method is used to merge redundant exported templates according to the template similarity and the spatial distribution of electrodes. Finally, the template matching method is used to resolve overlapping events. Our approach is validated on simulation data constructed by ourselves and publicly available data and compared to other state-of-the-art spike sorters. We found that the proposed HTsort has a more favorable trade-off between accuracy and time consumption. Compared with MountainSort and SpykingCircus, the time consumption is reduced by at least 40% when the number of electrodes is 64 and below. Compared with HerdingSpikes, the classification accuracy can typically improve by more than 10%. Meanwhile, HTsort exhibits stronger robustness against background noise than other sorters. Our more sophisticated spike sorter would facilitate neurophysiologists to complete spike sorting more quickly and accurately.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.684762</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Much remains unknown about mechanisms sustaining the various stages in the life cycle of neurotropic viruses. An understanding of those mechanisms operating before their replication and propagation could advance the development of effective anti-viral strategies. Here, we review our current knowledge of strategies used by neurotropic viruses to undergo bidirectional movement along axons. We discuss how the invasion strategies used by specific viruses might influence their mode of interaction with selected components of the host’s fast axonal transport (FAT) machinery, including specialized membrane-bounded organelles and microtubule-based motor proteins. As part of this discussion, we provide a critical evaluation of various reported interactions among viral and motor proteins and highlight limitations of some in vitro approaches that led to their identification. Based on a large body of evidence documenting activation of host kinases by neurotropic viruses, and on recent work revealing regulation of FAT through phosphorylation-based mechanisms, we posit a potential role of host kinases on the engagement of viruses in retrograde FAT. Finally, we briefly describe recent evidence linking aberrant activation of kinase pathways to deficits in FAT and neuronal degeneration in the context of human neurodegenerative diseases. Based on these findings, we speculate that neurotoxicity elicited by viral infection may involve deregulation of host kinases involved in the regulation of FAT and other cellular processes sustaining neuronal function and survival.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Altered Grooming Syntax and Amphetamine-Induced Dopamine Release in EAAT3 Overexpressing Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.661478</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The excitatory amino acid transporter EAAT3 plays an important role in the neuronal uptake of glutamate regulating the activation of glutamate receptors. Polymorphisms in the gene-encoding EAAT3 have been associated with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), although the mechanisms underlying this relationship are still unknown. We recently reported that mice with increased EAAT3 expression in forebrain neurons (EAAT3&lt;sup&gt;glo&lt;/sup&gt;/CMKII) display behavioral and synaptic features relevant to OCD, including increased grooming, higher anxiety-like behavior and altered cortico-striatal synaptic function. The dopamine neurotransmitter system is implicated in ritualistic behaviors. Indeed, dopaminergic neurons express EAAT3, and mice lacking EAAT3 exhibit decreased dopamine release and decreased expression of the dopamine D1 receptor. Moreover, EAAT3 plays a role on the effect of the psychostimulant amphetamine. As such, we sought to determine if the OCD-like behavior in EAAT3&lt;sup&gt;glo&lt;/sup&gt;/CMKII mice is accompanied by altered nigro-striatal dopaminergic transmission. The aim of this study was to analyze dopamine transmission both in basal conditions and after an acute challenge of amphetamine, using behavioral, neurochemical, molecular, and cellular approaches. We found that in basal conditions, EAAT3&lt;sup&gt;glo&lt;/sup&gt;/CMKII mice performed more grooming events and that they remained in phase 1 of the grooming chain syntax compared with control littermates. Administration of amphetamine increased the number of grooming events in control mice, while EAAT3&lt;sup&gt;glo&lt;/sup&gt;/CMKII mice remain unaffected. Interestingly, the grooming syntax of amphetamine-control mice resembled that of EAAT3&lt;sup&gt;glo&lt;/sup&gt;/CMKII mice in basal conditions. Using in vivo microdialysis, we found decreased basal dopamine levels in EAAT3&lt;sup&gt;glo&lt;/sup&gt;/CMKII compared with control mice. Unexpectedly, we found that after acute amphetamine, EAAT3&lt;sup&gt;glo&lt;/sup&gt;/CMKII mice had a higher release of dopamine compared with that of control mice, suggesting that EAAT3 overexpression leads to increased dopamine releasability. To determine postsynaptic effect of EAAT3 overexpression over dopamine transmission, we performed Western blot analysis of dopaminergic proteins and found that EAAT3&lt;sup&gt;glo&lt;/sup&gt;/CMKII mice have higher expression of D2 receptors, suggesting a higher inhibition of the indirect striatal pathway. Together, the data indicate that EAAT3 overexpression impacts on dopamine transmission, making dopamine neurons more sensitive to the effect of amphetamine and leading to a disbalance between the direct and indirect striatal pathways that favors the performance of repetitive behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Connecting Neuroinflammation and Neurodegeneration in Multiple Sclerosis: Are Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells a Nexus of Disease?</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.654284</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The pathology in neurodegenerative diseases is often accompanied by inflammation. It is well-known that many cells within the central nervous system (CNS) also contribute to ongoing neuroinflammation, which can promote neurodegeneration. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is both an inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease in which there is a complex interplay between resident CNS cells to mediate myelin and axonal damage, and this communication network can vary depending on the subtype and chronicity of disease. Oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cell of the CNS, and their precursors, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), are often thought of as the targets of autoimmune pathology during MS and in several animal models of MS; however, there is emerging evidence that OPCs actively contribute to inflammation that directly and indirectly contributes to neurodegeneration. Here we discuss several contributors to MS disease progression starting with lesion pathology and murine models amenable to studying particular aspects of disease. We then review how OPCs themselves can play an active role in promoting neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, and how other resident CNS cells including microglia, astrocytes, and neurons can impact OPC function. Further, we outline the very complex and pleiotropic role(s) of several inflammatory cytokines and other secreted factors classically described as solely deleterious during MS and its animal models, but in fact, have many neuroprotective functions and promote a return to homeostasis, in part via modulation of OPC function. Finally, since MS affects patients from the onset of disease throughout their lifespan, we discuss the impact of aging on OPC function and CNS recovery. It is becoming clear that OPCs are not simply a bystander during MS progression and uncovering the active roles they play during different stages of disease will help uncover potential new avenues for therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Application of Brain Organoid Technology in Stroke Research: Challenges and Prospects</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.646921</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Stroke is a neurological disease responsible for significant morbidity and disability worldwide. However, there remains a dearth of effective therapies. The failure of many therapies for stroke in clinical trials has promoted the development of human cell-based models, such as brain organoids. Brain organoids differ from pluripotent stem cells in that they recapitulate various key features of the human central nervous system (CNS) in three-dimensional (3D) space. Recent studies have demonstrated that brain organoids could serve as a new platform to study various neurological diseases. However, there are several limitations, such as the scarcity of glia and vasculature in organoids, which are important for studying stroke. Herein, we have summarized the application of brain organoid technology in stroke research, such as for modeling and transplantation purposes. We also discuss methods to overcome the limitations of brain organoid technology, as well as future prospects for its application in stroke research. Although there are many difficulties and challenges associated with brain organoid technology, it is clear that this approach will play a critical role in the future exploration of stroke treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Characterization of Individual Projections Reveal That Neuromasts of the Zebrafish Lateral Line are Innervated by Multiple Inhibitory Efferent Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.666109</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The zebrafish lateral line is a sensory system used to detect changes in water flow. It is comprized of clusters of superficial hair cells called neuromasts. Modulation occurs via excitatory and inhibitory efferent neurons located in the brain. Using mosaic transgenic labeling we provide an anatomical overview of the lateral line projections made by individual inhibitory efferent neurons in 5-day old zebrafish larvae. For each hemisphere we estimate there to be six inhibitory efferent neurons located in two different nuclei. Three distinct cell types were classified based on their projections; to the anterior lateral line around the head, to the posterior lateral line along the body, or to both. Our analyses corroborate previous studies employing back-fills, but our transgenic labeling allowed a more thorough characterization of their morphology. We found that individual inhibitory efferent cells connect to multiple neuromasts and that a single neuromast is connected by multiple inhibitory efferent cells. The efferent axons project to the sensory ganglia and follow the sensory axon tract along the lateral line. Time-lapse imaging revealed that inhibitory efferent axons do not migrate with the primordium as the primary sensory afferent does, but follow with an 8–14 h lag. These data bring new insights into the formation of a sensory circuit and support the hypothesis that different classes of inhibitory efferent cells have different functions. Our findings provide a foundation for future studies focussed toward unraveling how and when sensory perception is modulated by different efferent cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Older Compared With Younger Adults Performed 467 Fewer Sit-to-Stand Trials, Accompanied by Small Changes in Muscle Activation and Voluntary Force</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.679282</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Repetitive sit-to-stand (rSTS) is a fatigue perturbation model to examine the age-effects on adaptability in posture and gait, yet the age-effects on muscle activation during rSTS per se are unclear. We examined the effects of age and exhaustive rSTS on muscle activation magnitude, onset, and duration during ascent and descent phases of the STS task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Healthy older (n = 12) and younger (n = 11) adults performed rSTS, at a controlled frequency dictated by a metronome (2 s for cycle), to failure or for 30 min. We assessed muscle activation magnitude, onset, and duration of plantar flexors, dorsiflexors, knee flexors, knee extensors, and hip stabilizers during the initial and late stages of rSTS. Before and after rSTS, we measured maximal voluntary isometric knee extension force, and rate of perceived exertion, which was also recorded during rSTS task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Older vs. younger adults generated 35% lower maximum voluntary isometric knee extension force. During the initial stage of rSTS, older vs. younger adults activated the dorsiflexor 60% higher, all 5 muscle groups 37% longer, and the hip stabilizers 80% earlier. Older vs. younger adults completed 467 fewer STS trials and, at failure, their rate of perceived exertion was ~17 of 20 on the Borg scale. At the end of the rSTS, maximum voluntary isometric knee extension force decreased 16% similarly in older and younger, as well as the similar age groups decline in activation of the dorsiflexor and knee extensor muscles (all p &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: By performing 467 fewer STS trials, older adults minimized the potential effects of fatigability on muscle activation, voluntary force, and motor function. Such a sparing effect may explain the minimal changes in gait after rSTS reported in previous studies, suggesting a limited scope of this perturbation model to probe age-effects on muscle adaptation in functional tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Assessing Nigrostriatal Dopaminergic Pathways via 123I-FP-CIT SPECT in Dementia With Lewy Bodies in a Psychiatric Patient Cohort</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.672956</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;(123)-I-2-ß-carbomethoxy-3ß-(4-iodophenyl)-N-(3-fluoropropyl) nortro- pane single photon emission computed tomography (123I-FP-CIT SPECT) was validated to distinguish Alzheimer’s dementia from dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) by European medical agencies. Little evidence exists that validates 123 I-FP-CIT SPECT as a supplementary method to diagnose probable DLB in a psychiatric cohort of patients with psychiatric symptomatology and suspected DLB. We aim to elucidate differences in the clinical phenotype of DLB between those patients with and those without a positive 123 I-FP-CIT SPECT indicating a nigrostriatal deficit.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;To investigate this, we included 67 patients from the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at University Medical Center Göttingen (UMG) in our study who had undergone 123I-FP-CIT SPECT in the Department of Nuclear Medicine (UMG) by evaluating their patient files.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;55% with a positive-123I-FP-CIT SPECT and probable DLB after the 123I-FP-CIT SPECT exhibited psychiatric features. The number of probable DLB patients in those exhibiting psychiatric symptoms was higher post-123I-FP-CIT SPECT than pre-123I-FP-CIT SPECT assessed cross-sectionally over a 6-year period (p &amp;lt; 0.05). In addition, prodromal DLB and prodromal DLB patients with a psychiatric-phenotype yielded higher numbers post-123I-FP-CIT SPECT than pre-123I-FP-CIT SPECT (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Furthermore, we discovered no phenotypical differences between those DLB patients with a positive and those with a negative 123I-FP-CIT SPECT. 123I-FP-CIT SPECT-positive DLB patients in our psychiatric cohort revealed a psychiatric onset more often (52%); DLB was less often characterized by an MCI onset (26%) (p &amp;lt; 0.005).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusions&lt;p&gt;Our findings support 123I-FP-CIT SPECT as an adjuvant tool for improving the diagnosis of probable DLB and prodromal DLB in a cohort of psychiatric patients with often concomitant psychiatric symptomatology. The psychiatric-onset is more frequent than an MCI-onset in DLB patients presenting nigrostriatal dysfunction, giving us an indication of the relevance of deep clinical phenotyping in memory clinics that includes the assessment of psychopathology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Role of the transcriptional regulator SP140 in resistance to bacterial infections via repression of type I interferons</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/67290</link>
	<content:encoded>Type I interferons (IFNs) are essential for anti-viral immunity, but often impair protective immune responses during bacterial infections. An important question is how type I IFNs are strongly induced during viral infections, and yet are appropriately restrained during bacterial infections. The &lt;i&gt;Super susceptibility to tuberculosis 1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Sst1&lt;/i&gt;) locus in mice confers resistance to diverse bacterial infections. Here we provide evidence that &lt;i&gt;Sp140&lt;/i&gt; is a gene encoded within the &lt;i&gt;Sst1&lt;/i&gt; locus that represses type I IFN transcription during bacterial infections. We generated &lt;i&gt;Sp140&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice and find they are susceptible to infection by &lt;i&gt;Legionella pneumophila&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt;. Susceptibility of &lt;i&gt;Sp140&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice to bacterial infection was rescued by crosses to mice lacking the type I IFN receptor (&lt;i&gt;Ifnar&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;). Our results implicate &lt;i&gt;Sp140&lt;/i&gt; as an important negative regulator of type I IFNs that is essential for resistance to bacterial infections.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66522</link>
	<content:encoded>Increasing age is the strongest predictor of risk of COVID-19 severity and mortality. Immunometabolic switch from glycolysis to ketolysis protects against inflammatory damage and influenza infection in adults. To investigate how age compromises defense against coronavirus infection, and whether a pro-longevity ketogenic-diet (KD) impacts immune-surveillance, we developed an aging model of natural murine beta coronavirus (mCoV) infection with mouse hepatitis virus strain-A59 (MHV-A59).  When inoculated intranasally, mCoV is pneumotropic and recapitulates several clinical hallmarks of COVID-19 infection. Aged mCoV-A59-infected mice have increased mortality and higher systemic inflammation in the heart, adipose tissue and hypothalamus, including neutrophilia and loss of γδ T cells in lungs. Activation of ketogenesis in aged mice expands tissue protective γδ T cells, deactivates the NLRP3 inflammasome and decreases pathogenic monocytes in lungs of infected aged mice. These data establish harnessing of the ketogenic immunometabolic checkpoint as a potential treatment against coronavirus infection in the aged.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66304</link>
	<content:encoded>Sleep is important for brain plasticity, but its exact function remains mysterious. An influential but controversial idea is that a crucial function of sleep is to drive widespread downscaling of excitatory synaptic strengths. Here we used real-time sleep classification, &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; measurements of postsynaptic strength, and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; optogenetic monitoring of thalamocortical synaptic efficacy to ask whether sleep and wake states can constitutively drive changes in synaptic strength within the neocortex of juvenile rats. We found that miniature EPSC amplitudes onto L4 and L2/3 pyramidal neurons were stable across sleep and wake dense epochs in both primary visual (V1) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Further, chronic monitoring of thalamocortical synaptic efficacy in V1 of freely behaving animals revealed stable responses across even prolonged periods of natural sleep and wake. Together these data demonstrate that sleep does not drive widespread downscaling of synaptic strengths during the highly plastic critical period in juvenile animals. Whether this remarkable stability across sleep and wake generalizes to the fully mature nervous system remains to be seen.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: The EMT transcription factor Snai1 maintains myocardial wall integrity by repressing intermediate filament gene expression</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66143</link>
	<content:encoded>The transcription factor Snai1, a well-known regulator of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, has been implicated in early cardiac morphogenesis as well as in cardiac valve formation. However, a role for Snai1 in regulating other aspects of cardiac morphogenesis has not been reported. Using genetic, transcriptomic, and chimeric analyses in zebrafish, we find that Snai1b is required in cardiomyocytes for myocardial wall integrity. Loss of &lt;i&gt;snai1b&lt;/i&gt; increases the frequency of cardiomyocyte extrusion away from the cardiac lumen. Extruding cardiomyocytes exhibit increased actomyosin contractility basally as revealed by enrichment of p-myosin and α-catenin epitope α-18, as well as disrupted intercellular junctions. Transcriptomic analysis of wild-type and &lt;i&gt;snai1b&lt;/i&gt; mutant hearts revealed the dysregulation of intermediate filament genes, including &lt;i&gt;desmin b&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;desmb&lt;/i&gt;) upregulation. Cardiomyocyte-specific &lt;i&gt;desmb&lt;/i&gt; overexpression caused increased cardiomyocyte extrusion, recapitulating the &lt;i&gt;snai1b&lt;/i&gt; mutant phenotype. Altogether, these results indicate that Snai1 maintains the integrity of the myocardial epithelium, at least in part by repressing &lt;i&gt;desmb&lt;/i&gt; expression.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65921</link>
	<content:encoded>In the adult heart, the epicardium becomes activated after injury, contributing to cardiac healing by secretion of paracrine factors. Here, we analyzed by single-cell RNA sequencing combined with RNA in situ hybridization and lineage tracing of Wilms tumor protein 1-positive (WT1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) cells, the cellular composition, location, and hierarchy of epicardial stromal cells (EpiSC) in comparison to activated myocardial fibroblasts/stromal cells in infarcted mouse hearts. We identified 11 transcriptionally distinct EpiSC populations, which can be classified into three groups, each containing a cluster of proliferating cells. Two groups expressed cardiac specification markers and sarcomeric proteins suggestive of cardiomyogenic potential. Transcripts of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and HIF-responsive genes were enriched in EpiSC consistent with an epicardial hypoxic niche. Expression of paracrine factors was not limited to WT1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells but was a general feature of activated cardiac stromal cells. Our findings provide the cellular framework by which myocardial ischemia may trigger in EpiSC the formation of cardioprotective/regenerative responses.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65279</link>
	<content:encoded>Long-term flight depends heavily on intensive energy metabolism in animals; however, the neuroendocrine mechanisms underlying efficient substrate utilization remain elusive. Here, we report that the adipokinetic hormone/corazonin-related peptide (ACP) can facilitate muscle lipid utilization in a famous long-term migratory flighting species, &lt;i&gt;Locusta migratoria&lt;/i&gt;. By peptidomic analysis and RNAi screening, we identified brain-derived ACP as a key flight-related neuropeptide. &lt;i&gt;ACP&lt;/i&gt; gene expression increased notably upon sustained flight. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of &lt;i&gt;ACP &lt;/i&gt;gene and ACP receptor gene (&lt;i&gt;ACPR&lt;/i&gt;) significantly abated prolonged flight of locusts. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses further revealed that genes and metabolites involved in fatty acid transport and oxidation were notably downregulated in the flight muscle of ACP mutants. Finally, we demonstrated that a fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) mediated the effects of ACP in regulating muscle lipid metabolism during long-term flight in locusts. Our results elucidated a previously undescribed neuroendocrine mechanism underlying efficient energy utilization associated with long-term flight.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.21.449237v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Visual hallucinations in Parkinsons disease (PD) are transient, suggesting a change in dynamic brain states. However, the causes underlying these dynamic brain changes are not known. Methods: Focusing on fundamental network properties of integration and segregation, we used rsfMRI to examine alterations in temporal dynamics in PD patients with hallucinations (n=16) compared to those without hallucinations (n=75) and a group of normal controls (n=32). We used network control theory to examine how structural connectivity guides transitions between functional states. We then studied the brain regions most involved in these state transitions, and examined corresponding neurotransmitter density profiles and receptor gene expression in health. Results: There were significantly altered temporal dynamics in PD with hallucinations, with an increased proportion of time spent in the Segregated state compared to non-hallucinators and controls; less between-state transitions; and increased dwell time in the Segregated state. The energy cost needed to transition from integrated-to-segregated state was lower in PD-hallucinators compared to non-hallucinators. This was primarily driven by subcortical and transmodal cortical brain regions, including the thalamus and default mode network regions. The regional energy needed to transition from integrated-to-segregated state was significantly correlated with regional neurotransmitter density and gene expression profiles for serotoninergic (including 5HT2A), GABAergic, noradrenergic and cholinergic but not dopaminergic density profiles. Conclusions: We describe the patterns of temporal functional dynamics in PD-hallucinations, and link these with neurotransmitter systems involved in early sensory and complex visual processing. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into visual hallucinations in PD and highlighting potential therapeutic targets.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.21.449236v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Psychopathic traits have been demonstrated to be associated with different types of morality; however, the neuropsychological mechanism underlying the relationship between psychopathic traits and morality remains unclear. Our study examined the effective connectivity (EC) of psychopathic traits-related brain regions and its association to concern with different moral foundations by combining behavioral measures with resting-state fMRI. We administered the Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy Scale (LSRP) and Moral Foundation Questionnaire (MFQ) to 78 college students after resting-state fMRI scanning. Our results showed that total and primary psychopathic traits score predicted concern with the Harm foundation. The EC from the posterior insula to the amygdala was negatively correlated with psychopathic traits and positively with concern with the Harm foundation. Altered posterior insula-amygdala EC partially mediated the relationship between psychopathic traits and concern with the Harm foundation. Our findings indicated that individuals with elevated psychopathic traits may have atypical processes in recognizing and integrating bodily state information into emotional responses, leading to less concern for harm-related morality. The study deepened our understanding of the neuropsychological mechanism underlying the relationship between psychopathic traits and morality and may have implications for the prevention of higher psychopathic traits individuals from committing serious transgressions.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: miR-128 as a Regulator of Synaptic Properties in 5xFAD Mice Hippocampal Neurons</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-021-01862-2</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by progressive synaptic dysfunction, deterioration of neuronal transmission, and consequently neuronal death. Although there is no treatment for AD, exposure to enriched environment (EE) in mice, as well as physical and mental activity in human subjects have been shown to have a protective effect by slowing the disease’s progression and reducing AD-like cognitive impairment. However, the molecular mechanism of this mitigating effect is still not understood. One of the mechanisms that has recently been shown to be involved in neuronal degeneration is microRNAs (miRNAs) regulation, which act as a post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. miR-128 has been shown to be significantly altered in individuals with AD and in mice following exposure to EE. Here, we focused on elucidating the possible role of miR-128 in AD pathology and found that miR-128 regulates the expression of two proteins essential for synaptic transmission, SNAP-25, and synaptotagmin1 (Syt1). Clinically relevant, in 5xFAD mouse model for AD, this miRNA’s expression was found as downregulated, resembling the alteration found in the hippocampi of individuals with AD. Interestingly, exposing WT mice to EE also resulted in downregulation of miR-128 expression levels, although EE and AD conditions demonstrate opposing effects on neuronal functioning and synaptic plasticity. We also found that miR-128 expression downregulation in primary hippocampal cultures from 5xFAD mice results in increased neuronal network activity and neuronal excitability. Altogether, our findings place miR-128 as a synaptic player that may contribute to synaptic functioning and plasticity through regulation of synaptic protein expression and function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The interaction of the cerebellum with cerebral cortical dynamics is still poorly understood. In this paper, dynamical causal modeling is used to examine the interaction between cerebellum and cerebral cortex as indexed by MRI resting-state functional connectivity in three large-scale networks on healthy young adults (N = 200; Human Connectome Project dataset). These networks correspond roughly to default mode, task positive, and motor as determined by prior cerebellar functional gradient analyses. We find uniform interactions within all considered networks from cerebellum to cerebral cortex, providing support for the notion of a universal cerebellar transform. Our results provide a foundation for future analyses to quantify and further investigate whether this is a property that is unique to the interactions from cerebellum to cerebral cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Mechanisms of Ischemic Stroke in Patients with Cancer: A Prospective Study</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26129?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
The objective of this study was to examine the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke with cancer.


Methods
We conducted a prospective cross‐sectional study from 2016 to 2020 at 2 hospitals. We enrolled 3 groups of 50 adult participants each. The main group included patients with active solid tumor cancer and acute ischemic stroke. The control groups included patients with acute ischemic stroke only or active cancer only. The patients with stroke‐only and patients with cancer‐only were matched to the patients with cancer‐plus‐stroke by age, sex, and cancer type, if applicable. The outcomes were prespecified hematological biomarkers and transcranial Doppler microemboli detection. Hematological biomarkers included markers of coagulation (D‐dimer and thrombin‐antithrombin), platelet function (P‐selectin), and endothelial integrity (thrombomodulin, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule‐1 [sICAM‐1], and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule‐1 [sVCAM‐1]). Hematological biomarkers were compared between groups using the Kruskal‐Wallis and Wilcoxon Rank‐Sum tests. In multivariable linear regression models, we adjusted for race, number of stroke risk factors, smoking, stroke severity, and antithrombotic use. Transcranial Doppler microemboli presence was compared between groups using chi‐square tests.


Results
Levels of all study biomarkers were different between groups. In univariate between‐group comparisons, patients with cancer‐plus‐stroke had higher levels of D‐dimer, sICAM‐1, sVCAM‐1, and thrombomodulin than both control groups; higher levels of thrombin‐antithrombin than patients with cancer‐only; and higher levels of P‐selectin than patients with stroke‐only. Findings were similar in multivariable analyses. Transcranial Doppler microemboli were detected in 32% of patients with cancer‐plus‐stroke, 16% of patients with stroke‐only, and 6% of patients with cancer‐only (p = 0.005).


Interpretation
Patients with cancer‐related stroke have higher markers of coagulation, platelet, and endothelial dysfunction, and more circulating microemboli, than matched controls. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:159–169</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Mutations in HID1 Cause Syndromic Infantile Encephalopathy and Hypopituitarism</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26127?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Precursors of peptide hormones undergo posttranslational modifications within the trans‐Golgi network (TGN). Dysfunction of proteins involved at different steps of this process cause several complex syndromes affecting the central nervous system (CNS). We aimed to clarify the genetic cause in a group of patients characterized by hypopituitarism in combination with brain atrophy, thin corpus callosum, severe developmental delay, visual impairment, and epilepsy.


Methods
Whole exome sequencing was performed in seven individuals of six unrelated families with these features. Postmortem histopathological and HID1 expression analysis of brain tissue and pituitary gland were conducted in one patient. Functional consequences of the homozygous HID1 variant p.R433W were investigated by Seahorse XF Assay in fibroblasts of two patients.


Results
Bi‐allelic variants in the gene HID1 domain‐containing protein 1 (HID1) were identified in all patients. Postmortem examination confirmed cerebral atrophy with enlarged lateral ventricles. Markedly reduced expression of pituitary hormones was found in pituitary gland tissue. Colocalization of HID1 protein with the TGN was not altered in fibroblasts of patients compared to controls, while the extracellular acidification rate upon stimulation with potassium chloride was significantly reduced in patient fibroblasts compared to controls.


Interpretation
Our findings indicate that mutations in HID1 cause an early infantile encephalopathy with hypopituitarism as the leading presentation, and expand the list of syndromic CNS diseases caused by interference of TGN function. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:149–164</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: α4β2* Nicotinic Cholinergic Receptor Target Engagement in Parkinson Disease Gait–Balance Disorders</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26102?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Attentional deficits following degeneration of brain cholinergic systems contribute to gait–balance deficits in Parkinson disease (PD). As a step toward assessing whether α4β2* nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) stimulation improves gait–balance function, we assessed target engagement of the α4β2* nAChR partial agonist varenicline.


Methods
Nondemented PD participants with cholinergic deficits were identified with [18F]fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol positron emission tomography (PET). α4β2* nAChR occupancy after subacute oral varenicline treatment was measured with [18F]flubatine PET. With a dose selected from the nAChR occupancy experiment, varenicline effects on gait, balance, and cognition were assessed in a double‐masked placebo‐controlled crossover study. Primary endpoints were normal pace gait speed and a measure of postural stability.


Results
Varenicline doses (0.25mg per day, 0.25mg twice daily [b.i.d.], 0.5mg b.i.d., and 1.0mg b.i.d.) produced 60 to 70% receptor occupancy. We selected 0.5mg orally b.i.d for the crossover study. Thirty‐three participants completed the crossover study with excellent tolerability. Varenicline had no significant impact on the postural stability measure and caused slower normal pace gait speed. Varenicline narrowed the difference in normal pace gait speed between dual task and no dual task gait conditions, reduced dual task cost, and improved sustained attention test performance. We obtained identical conclusions in 28 participants with treatment compliance confirmed by plasma varenicline measurements.


Interpretation
Varenicline occupied α4β2* nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, was tolerated well, enhanced attention, and altered gait performance. These results are consistent with target engagement. α4β2* agonists may be worth further evaluation for mitigation of gait and balance disorders in PD. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:130–142</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Characterization of Extracranial Giant Cell Arteritis with Intracranial Involvement and its Rapidly Progressive Subtype</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26101?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
The objective of this study was to characterize patients with extracranial giant cell arteritis with intracranial involvement.


Methods
In a multicenter retrospective study, we included 31 patients with systemic giant cell arteritis (GCA) with intracranial involvement. Clinical characteristics, pattern of arterial involvement, and cytokine profiles were assessed. Patients with GCA without intracranial involvement (n = 17), and with intracranial atherosclerosis (n = 25) served as controls.


Results
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was elevated in 18 patients (69.2%) with and in 16 patients (100%) without intracranial involvement (p = 0.02). Headache was complained by 15 patients (50.0%) with and 13 patients (76.5%) without intracranial involvement (p = 0.03). Posterior circulation arteries were affected in 26 patients (83.9%), anterior circulation arteries in 17 patients (54.8%), and both territories in 12 patients (38.7%). Patients with GCA had vertebral artery stenosis proximal and, in contrast, patients with atherosclerosis distal to the origin of posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). Among patients with GCA with intracranial involvement, 11 patients (37.9%) had a rapid progressive disease course characterized by short‐term recurrent ischemic events. The median modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at follow‐up in these patients was 4 (interquartile range [IQR] = 2.0–6.0) and 4 patients (36.4%) died. Vessel wall expression of IL‐6 and IL‐17 was significantly increased in patients with rapid progressive course.


Interpretation
Typical characteristics of GCA, headache, and an elevated ESR, are frequently absent in patients with intracranial involvement. However, differentiation of intracranial GCA from atherosclerosis can be facilitated by the typical pattern of vertebral artery stenosis. About one‐third of patients with intracranial GCA had a rapid progressive course with poor outcome. IL‐17 and IL‐6 may represent potential future treatment targets.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Encephalitis with Autoantibodies against the Glutamate Kainate Receptors GluK2</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26098?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
The objective of this study was to report the identification of antibodies against the glutamate kainate receptor subunit 2 (GluK2‐abs) in patients with autoimmune encephalitis, and describe the clinical‐immunological features and antibody effects.


Methods
Two sera from 8 patients with similar rat brain immunostaining were used to precipitate the antigen from neuronal cultures. A cell‐based assay (CBA) with GluK2‐expressing HEK293 cells was used to assess 596 patients with different neurological disorders, and 23 healthy controls. GluK2‐ab effects were determined by confocal microscopy in cultured neurons and electrophysiology in GluK2‐expressing HEK293 cells.


Results
Patients’ antibodies precipitated GluK2. GluK2 antibody‐specificity was confirmed by CBA, immunoprecipitation, GluK2‐immunoabsorption, and GluK2 knockout brain immunohistochemistry. In 2 of 8 samples, antibodies reacted with additional GluK2 epitopes present in GluK1 or GluK3; in both, the reactivity was abrogated after GluK2 immuno‐absorption. Six of 8 patients developed acute encephalitis and clinical or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of predominant cerebellar involvement (4 presenting as cerebellitis, which in 2 patients caused obstructive hydrocephalus), and 2 patients had other syndromes (1 with cerebellar symptoms). One of the samples showed mild reactivity with non‐kainate receptors (alpha‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazolepropionic acid receptors [AMPAR] and N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptors [NMDAR]) leading to identify 6 additional cases with GluK2‐abs among patients with anti‐AMPAR (5/71) or anti‐NMDAR encephalitis (1/73). GluK2‐abs internalized GluK2 in HEK293 cells and neurons; these antibody‐effects were reversible in neurons. A significant reduction of GluK2‐mediated currents was observed in cells treated with patients’ GluK2 serum following the time frame of antibody‐mediated GluK2 internalization.


Interpretation
GluK2‐abs associate with an encephalitis with prominent clinicoradiological cerebellar involvement. The antibody effects are predominantly mediated by internalization of GluK2. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:107–123</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Preservation of Brain Activity in Unresponsive Patients Identifies MCS Star</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26095?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Brain‐injured patients who are unresponsive at the bedside (ie, vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome – VS/UWS) may present brain activity similar to patients in minimally conscious state (MCS). This peculiar condition has been termed “non‐behavioural MCS” or “MCS*”. In the present study we aimed to investigate the proportion and underlying brain characteristics of patients in MCS*.


Methods
Brain 18F‐fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG‐PET) was acquired on 135 brain‐injured patients diagnosed in prolonged VS/UWS (n = 48) or MCS (n = 87). From an existing database, relative metabolic preservation in the fronto‐parietal network (measured with standardized uptake value) was visually inspected by three experts. Patients with hypometabolism of the fronto‐parietal network were labelled “VS/UWS”, while its (partial) preservation either confirmed the behavioural diagnosis of “MCS” or, in absence of behavioural signs of consciousness, suggested a diagnosis of “MCS*”. Clinical outcome at 1‐year follow‐up, functional connectivity, grey matter atrophy, and regional brain metabolic patterns were investigated in the three groups (VS/UWS, MCS* and MCS).


Results
67% of behavioural VS/UWS presented a partial preservation of brain metabolism (ie, MCS*). Compared to VS/UWS patients, MCS* patients demonstrated a better outcome, global functional connectivity and grey matter preservation more compatible with the diagnosis of MCS. MCS* patients presented lower brain metabolism mostly in the posterior brain regions compared to MCS patients.


Interpretation
MCS* is a frequent phenomenon that is associated with better outcome and better brain preservation than the diagnosis of VS/UWS. Complementary exams should be provided to all unresponsive patients before taking medical decisions. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:89–100</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Genomewide Association Studies of LRRK2 Modifiers of Parkinson's Disease</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26094?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
The aim of this study was to search for genes/variants that modify the effect of LRRK2 mutations in terms of penetrance and age‐at‐onset of Parkinson's disease.


Methods
We performed the first genomewide association study of penetrance and age‐at‐onset of Parkinson's disease in LRRK2 mutation carriers (776 cases and 1,103 non‐cases at their last evaluation). Cox proportional hazard models and linear mixed models were used to identify modifiers of penetrance and age‐at‐onset of LRRK2 mutations, respectively. We also investigated whether a polygenic risk score derived from a published genomewide association study of Parkinson's disease was able to explain variability in penetrance and age‐at‐onset in LRRK2 mutation carriers.


Results
A variant located in the intronic region of CORO1C on chromosome 12 (rs77395454; p value = 2.5E‐08, beta = 1.27, SE = 0.23, risk allele: C) met genomewide significance for the penetrance model. Co‐immunoprecipitation analyses of LRRK2 and CORO1C supported an interaction between these 2 proteins. A region on chromosome 3, within a previously reported linkage peak for Parkinson's disease susceptibility, showed suggestive associations in both models (penetrance top variant: p value = 1.1E‐07; age‐at‐onset top variant: p value = 9.3E‐07). A polygenic risk score derived from publicly available Parkinson's disease summary statistics was a significant predictor of penetrance, but not of age‐at‐onset.


Interpretation
This study suggests that variants within or near CORO1C may modify the penetrance of LRRK2 mutations. In addition, common Parkinson's disease associated variants collectively increase the penetrance of LRRK2 mutations. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:82–94</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Investigation of Autosomal Genetic Sex Differences in Parkinson's Disease</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26090?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder. Men are on average ~ 1.5 times more likely to develop PD compared to women with European ancestry. Over the years, genomewide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous genetic risk factors for PD, however, it is unclear whether genetics contribute to disease etiology in a sex‐specific manner.


Methods
In an effort to study sex‐specific genetic factors associated with PD, we explored 2 large genetic datasets from the International Parkinson's Disease Genomics Consortium and the UK Biobank consisting of 13,020 male PD cases, 7,936 paternal proxy cases, 89,660 male controls, 7,947 female PD cases, 5,473 maternal proxy cases, and 90,662 female controls. We performed GWAS meta‐analyses to identify distinct patterns of genetic risk contributing to disease in male versus female PD cases.


Results
In total, 19 genomewide significant regions were identified and no sex‐specific effects were observed. A high genetic correlation between the male and female PD GWAS were identified (rg = 0.877) and heritability estimates were identical between male and female PD cases (~ 20%).


Interpretation
We did not detect any significant genetic differences between male or female PD cases. Our study does not support the notion that common genetic variation on the autosomes could explain the difference in prevalence of PD between males and females cases at least when considering the current sample size under study. Further studies are warranted to investigate the genetic architecture of PD explained by X and Y chromosomes and further evaluate environmental effects that could potentially contribute to PD etiology in male versus female patients.

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26085?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
This multilanguage study used simple speech recording and high‐end pattern analysis to provide sensitive and reliable noninvasive biomarkers of prodromal versus manifest α‐synucleinopathy in patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) and early‐stage Parkinson disease (PD).


Methods
We performed a multicenter study across the Czech, English, German, French, and Italian languages at 7 centers in Europe and North America. A total of 448 participants (337 males), including 150 with iRBD (mean duration of iRBD across language groups 0.5–3.4 years), 149 with PD (mean duration of disease across language groups 1.7–2.5 years), and 149 healthy controls were recorded; 350 of the participants completed the 12‐month follow‐up. We developed a fully automated acoustic quantitative assessment approach for the 7 distinctive patterns of hypokinetic dysarthria.


Results
No differences in language that impacted clinical parkinsonian phenotypes were found. Compared with the controls, we found significant abnormalities of an overall acoustic speech severity measure via composite dysarthria index for both iRBD (p = 0.002) and PD (p &amp;lt; 0.001). However, only PD (p &amp;lt; 0.001) was perceptually distinct in a blinded subjective analysis. We found significant group differences between PD and controls for monopitch (p &amp;lt; 0.001), prolonged pauses (p &amp;lt; 0.001), and imprecise consonants (p = 0.03); only monopitch was able to differentiate iRBD patients from controls (p = 0.004). At the 12‐month follow‐up, a slight progression of overall acoustic speech impairment was noted for the iRBD (p = 0.04) and PD (p = 0.03) groups.


Interpretation
Automated speech analysis might provide a useful additional biomarker of parkinsonism for the assessment of disease progression and therapeutic interventions. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:62–75</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Cerebrovascular Neuroprotection after Acute Concussion in Adolescents</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26082?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
To assess acute cerebrovascular function in concussed adolescents (14–21 years of age), whether it is related to resting cerebral hemodynamics, and whether it recovers chronically.


Methods
Cerebral vasoreactivity and autoregulation, based on middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity, was assessed in 28 concussed participants (≤14 days of injury) and 29 matched controls. The participants in the concussion group returned for an 8‐week follow‐up assessment. Over the course of those 8‐weeks, participants recorded aerobic exercise frequency and duration.


Results
Between groups, demographic, clinical, and hemodynamic variables were not significantly different. Vasoreactivity was significantly higher in the concussed group (p = 0.02). Within the concussed group, 60% of the variability in resting cerebral blood flow velocity was explained by vasoreactivity and two components of autoregulation – falling slope and effectiveness of autoregulation (adjusted R2 = 0.60, p &amp;lt; 0.001). Moreover, lower mean arterial pressure, lower responses to increases in arterial pressure, and lower vasoreactivity were significantly associated with larger symptom burden (adjusted R2 = 0.72, p &amp;lt; 0.01). By the 8‐week timepoint, symptom burden, but not vasoreactivity, improved in all but four concussed participants (p &amp;lt; 0.01). 8‐week change in vasoreactivity was positively associated with aerobic exercise volume (adjusted R2 = 0.19, p = 0.02).


Interpretation
Concussion resulted in changes in cerebrovascular regulatory mechanisms, which in turn explained the variability in resting cerebral blood flow velocity and acute symptom burden. Furthermore, these alterations persisted chronically despite symptom resolution, but was positively modified by aerobic exercise volume. These findings provide a mechanistic framework for further investigation into underlying cerebrovascular related symptomatology. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:43–51</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Foslevodopa/Foscarbidopa: A New Subcutaneous Treatment for Parkinson's Disease</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26073?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
The aim was to demonstrate that continuous s.c. infusion of a soluble levodopa (LD)/carbidopa (CD) phosphate prodrug combination effectively delivers stable LD exposure via a minimally invasive and convenient mode and has the potential to treat Parkinson's disease (PD) patients who are not well controlled on oral medication.


Methods
Foslevodopa and foscarbidopa were prepared and the equilibrium solubility and chemical stability examined in aqueous media with different values of pH. Solutions of foslevodopa/foscarbidopa (ratios ranging from 4:1 to 20:1) were prepared by dissolving pH‐adjusted lyophilized materials in water and infused s.c. in healthy volunteers for ≤72 hours. Frequent blood samples were collected to measure LD and CD exposure, and safety was monitored throughout the study.


Results
Foslevodopa/foscarbidopa (ABBV‐951) demonstrates high water solubility and excellent chemical stability near physiological pH, enabling continuous s.c. infusion therapy. After s.c. infusion, a stable LD pharmacokinetic (PK) profile was maintained for ≤72 hours, and the infusion was well tolerated.


Interpretation
Preparation of foslevodopa and foscarbidopa enables preclinical and clinical PK, safety, and tolerability studies in support of their advancement for the treatment of PD. In phase 1 clinical trials, foslevodopa/foscarbidopa demonstrates consistent and stable LD plasma exposure, supporting further studies of this treatment as a potentially transformational option for those suffering from PD.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Common X‐Chromosome Variants Are Associated with Parkinson Disease Risk</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26051?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
The objective of this study was to identify genetic variants on the X‐chromosome associated with Parkinson disease (PD) risk.


Methods
We performed an X‐chromosome–wide association study (XWAS) of PD risk by meta‐analyzing results from sex‐stratified analyses. To avoid spurious associations, we designed a specific harmonization pipeline for the X‐chromosome and focused on a European ancestry sample. We included 11,142 cases, 280,164 controls, and 5,379 proxy cases, based on parental history of PD. Additionally, we tested the association of significant variants with (1) PD risk in an independent replication with 1,561 cases and 2,465 controls and (2) putamen volume in 33,360 individuals from the UK Biobank.


Results
In the discovery meta‐analysis, we identified rs7066890 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06–1.14, p = 2.2 × 10−9), intron of GPM6B, and rs28602900 (OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.07–1.14, p = 1.6 × 10−8) in a high gene density region including RPL10, ATP6A1, FAM50A, and PLXNA3. The rs28602900 association with PD was replicated (OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.03–1.30, p = 0.016) and shown to colocalize with a significant expression quantitative locus (eQTL) regulating RPL10 expression in the putamen and other brain tissues in the Genotype‐Tissue Expression Project. Additionally, the rs28602900 locus was found to be associated with reduced brain putamen volume. No results reached genome‐wide significance in the sex‐stratified analyses.


Interpretation
We report the first XWAS of PD and identify 2 genome‐wide significant loci. The rs28602900 association was replicated in an independent PD dataset and showed concordant effects in its association with putamen volume. Critically, rs26802900 is a significant eQTL of RPL10. These results support a role for ribosomal proteins in PD pathogenesis and show that the X‐chromosome contributes to PD genetic risk. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:22–34</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Endosome Dysregulation in Down Syndrome: A Potential Contributor to Alzheimer Disease Pathology</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26042?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Intracellular protein trafficking via the endosomes plays a key role in the maintenance of normal neuronal function. Although many diseases of the central nervous system exhibit specific pathological hallmarks, abnormalities of the endosome system are common traits for several of them, including Alzheimer disease (AD). Three main routes originate from the endosomes: the recycling, degradation, and retrograde pathways. Studies have shown that the majority of Down syndrome subjects develop AD pathology and manifest altered morphology and number of endosomes, and abnormalities in lysosome acidification and exosome secretion, suggesting that dysfunction of one of these pathways could play a functional role in the AD‐like phenotype of the syndrome. Two of the major endosomal routes are mediated by the retromer complex, a multimeric system responsible for transport of cargo from the endosome to the trans‐Golgi network or to the cell membrane. Recently, a new endosome system structurally related to the retromer, called “retriever,” has been reported. Whereas we know a great deal about the neuropathophysiology of the retromer complex, no precise pathogenic role for the retriever has yet been identified. Here, we will review the neurobiology of the endosome system and its role as key player in the development of AD‐like pathology in Down syndrome. Additionally, we will discuss current knowledge on these two main endosome systems, retromer and retriever, and their potential as novel therapeutic targets. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:4–14</content:encoded>

The advent of high-throughput metagenomic sequencing has prompted the development of efficient taxonomic profiling methods allowing to measure the presence, abundance and phylogeny of organisms in a wide range of environmental samples. Multivariate sequence-derived abundance data further has the potential to enable inference of ecological associations between microbial populations, but several technical issues need to be accounted for, like the compositional nature of the data, its extreme sparsity and overdispersion, as well as the frequent need to operate in under-determined regimes.
The ecological network reconstruction problem is frequently cast into the paradigm of Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs) for which efficient structure inference algorithms are available, like the graphical lasso and neighborhood selection. Unfortunately, GGMs or variants thereof can not properly account for the extremely sparse patterns occurring in real-world metagenomic taxonomic profiles. In particular, structural zeros (as opposed to sampling zeros) corresponding to true absences of biological signals fail to be properly handled by most statistical methods.
We present here a zero-inflated log-normal graphical model (available at https://github.com/vincentprost/Zi-LN) specifically aimed at handling such “biological” zeros, and demonstrate significant performance gains over state-of-the-art statistical methods for the inference of microbial association networks, with most notable gains obtained when analyzing taxonomic profiles displaying sparsity levels on par with real-world metagenomic datasets.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AYAqogm1C3o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The genetic alterations that underlie cancer development are highly tissue-specific with the majority of driving alterations occurring in only a few cancer types and with alterations common to multiple cancer types often showing a tissue-specific functional impact. This tissue-specificity means that the biology of normal tissues carries important information regarding the pathophysiology of the associated cancers, information that can be leveraged to improve the power and accuracy of cancer genomic analyses. Research exploring the use of normal tissue data for the analysis of cancer genomics has primarily focused on the paired analysis of tumor and adjacent normal samples. Efforts to leverage the general characteristics of normal tissue for cancer analysis has received less attention with most investigations focusing on understanding the tissue-specific factors that lead to individual genomic alterations or dysregulated pathways within a single cancer type. To address this gap and support scenarios where adjacent normal tissue samples are not available, we explored the genome-wide association between the transcriptomes of 21 solid human cancers and their associated normal tissues as profiled in healthy individuals. While the average gene expression profiles of normal and cancerous tissue may appear distinct, with normal tissues more similar to other normal tissues than to the associated cancer types, when transformed into relative expression values, i.e., the ratio of expression in one tissue or cancer relative to the mean in other tissues or cancers, the close association between gene activity in normal tissues and related cancers is revealed. As we demonstrate through an analysis of tumor data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and normal tissue data from the Human Protein Atlas, this association between tissue-specific and cancer-specific expression values can be leveraged to improve the prognostic modeling of cancer, the comparative analysis of different cancer types, and the analysis of cancer and normal tissue pairs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vvB0Lh3g_K0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Ion dynamics at the energy-deprived tripartite synapse</title>

The anatomical and functional organization of neurons and astrocytes at ‘tripartite synapses’ is essential for reliable neurotransmission, which critically depends on ATP. In low energy conditions, synaptic transmission fails, accompanied by a breakdown of ion gradients, changes in membrane potentials and cell swelling. The resulting cellular damage and cell death are causal to the often devastating consequences of an ischemic stroke. The severity of ischemic damage depends on the age and the brain region in which a stroke occurs, but the reasons for this differential vulnerability are far from understood. In the present study, we address this question by developing a comprehensive biophysical model of a glutamatergic synapse to identify key determinants of synaptic failure during energy deprivation. Our model is based on fundamental biophysical principles, includes dynamics of the most relevant ions, i.e., Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and glutamate, and is calibrated with experimental data. It confirms the critical role of the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase in maintaining ion gradients, membrane potentials and cell volumes. Our simulations demonstrate that the system exhibits two stable states, one physiological and one pathological. During energy deprivation, the physiological state may disappear, forcing a transit to the pathological state, which can be reverted when blocking voltage-gated Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels. Our model predicts that the transition to the pathological state is favoured if the extracellular space fraction is small. A reduction in the extracellular space volume fraction, as, e.g. observed with ageing, will thus promote the brain’s susceptibility to ischemic damage. Our work provides new insights into the brain’s ability to recover from energy deprivation, with translational relevance for diagnosis and treatment of ischemic strokes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/auw_fiGsK9k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The search for potential antibody-based diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics for pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has focused almost exclusively on the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Coronavirus membrane (M), ORF3a, and ORF8 proteins are humoral immunogens in other coronaviruses (CoVs) but remain largely uninvestigated for SARS-CoV-2. Here, we use ultradense peptide microarray mapping to show that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces robust antibody responses to epitopes throughout the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, particularly in M, in which 1 epitope achieved excellent diagnostic accuracy. We map 79 B cell epitopes throughout the SARS-CoV-2 proteome and demonstrate that antibodies that develop in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection bind homologous peptide sequences in the 6 other known human CoVs. We also confirm reactivity against 4 of our top-ranking epitopes by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Illness severity correlated with increased reactivity to 9 SARS-CoV-2 epitopes in S, M, N, and ORF3a in our population. Our results demonstrate previously unknown, highly reactive B cell epitopes throughout the full proteome of SARS-CoV-2 and other CoV proteins.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/IhHbcSX1zJQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The subject-verb-object (SVO) word order prevalent in English is shared by
about $42\%$ of world languages. Another $45\%$ of all languages follow the SOV
order, $9\%$ the VSO order, and fewer languages use the three remaining
permutations. None of the many extant explanations of this phenomenon take into
account the difficulty of implementing these permutations in the brain. We
propose a plausible model of sentence generation inspired by the recently
proposed Assembly Calculus framework of brain function. Our model results in a
natural explanation of the uneven frequencies. Estimating the parameters of
this model yields predictions of the relative difficulty of dis-inhibiting one
brain area from another. Our model is based on the standard syntax tree, a
simple binary tree with three leaves. Each leaf corresponds to one of the three
parts of a basic sentence. The leaves can be activated through lock and unlock
operations and the sequence of activation of the leaves implements a specific
word order. More generally, we also formulate and algorithmically solve the
problems of implementing a permutation of the leaves of any binary tree, and of
selecting the permutation that is easiest to implement on a given binary tree.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09408</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Analyzing the relation between intelligence and neural activity is of the
utmost importance in understanding the working principles of the human brain in
health and disease. In existing literature, functional brain connectomes have
been used successfully to predict cognitive measures such as intelligence
quotient (IQ) scores in both healthy and disordered cohorts using machine
learning models. However, existing methods resort to flattening the brain
connectome (i.e., graph) through vectorization which overlooks its topological
properties. To address this limitation and inspired from the emerging graph
neural networks (GNNs), we design a novel regression GNN model (namely RegGNN)
for predicting IQ scores from brain connectivity. On top of that, we introduce
a novel, fully modular sample selection method to select the best samples to
learn from for our target prediction task. However, since such deep learning
architectures are computationally expensive to train, we further propose a
\emph{learning-based sample selection} method that learns how to choose the
training samples with the highest expected predictive power on unseen samples.
For this, we capitalize on the fact that connectomes (i.e., their adjacency
matrices) lie in the symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix cone. Our results
on full-scale and verbal IQ prediction outperforms comparison methods in autism
spectrum disorder cohorts and achieves a competitive performance for
neurotypical subjects using 3-fold cross-validation. Furthermore, we show that
our sample selection approach generalizes to other learning-based methods,
which shows its usefulness beyond our GNN architecture.

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.655980</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In arboreal environments, substrate orientation determines the biomechanical strategy for postural maintenance and locomotion. In this study, we investigated possible neuronal correlates of these mechanisms in an ancestral primate model, the gray mouse lemur. We conducted telemetric recordings of electrocorticographic activity in left primary motor cortex of two mouse lemurs moving on a branch-like small-diameter pole, fixed horizontally, or vertically. Analysis of cortical oscillations in high β (25–35 Hz) and low γ (35–50 Hz) bands showed stronger resting power on horizontal than vertical substrate, potentially illustrating sensorimotor processes for postural maintenance. Locomotion on horizontal substrate was associated with stronger event-related desynchronization than vertical substrate, which could relate to locomotor adjustments and/or derive from differences in baseline activity. Spectrograms of cortical activity showed modulation throughout individual locomotor cycles, with higher values in the first than second half cycle. However, substrate orientation did not significantly influence these variations. Overall, these results confirm that specific cortical mechanisms are solicited during arboreal locomotion, whereby mouse lemurs adjust cortical activity to substrate orientation during static posture and locomotion, and modulate this activity throughout locomotor cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Riboflavin Inhibits Histamine-Dependent Itch by Modulating Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.643483</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Riboflavin, also known as vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, isfound in foods and is used as a dietary supplement. Its deficiency (also called ariboflavinosis) results in some skin lesions and inflammations, such as stomatitis, cheilosis, oily scaly skin rashes, and itchy, watery eyes. Various therapeutic effects of riboflavin, such as anticancer, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-nociceptive effects, are well known. Although some studies have identified the clinical effect of riboflavin on skin problems, including itch and inflammation, its underlying mechanism of action remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of the effects of riboflavin on histamine-dependent itch based on behavioral tests and electrophysiological experiments. Riboflavin significantly reduced histamine-induced scratching behaviors in mice and histamine-induced discharges in single-nerve fiber recordings, while it did not alter motor function in the rotarod test. In cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, riboflavin showed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the histamine- and capsaicin-induced inward current. Further tests wereconducted to determine whether two endogenous metabolites of riboflavin, flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), have similar effects to those of riboflavin. Here, FMN, but not FAD, significantly inhibited capsaicin-induced currents and itching responses caused by histamine. In addition, in transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)-transfected HEK293 cells, both riboflavin and FMN blocked capsaicin-induced currents, whereas FAD did not. These results revealed that riboflavin inhibits histamine-dependent itch by modulating TRPV1 activity. This study will be helpful in understanding how riboflavin exerts antipruritic effects and suggests that it might be a useful drug for the treatment of histamine-dependent itch.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: The Paraventricular Thalamus as a Critical Node of Motivated Behavior via the Hypothalamic-Thalamic-Striatal Circuit</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2021.706713</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this review, we highlight evidence that supports a role for the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) in motivated behavior. We include a neuroanatomical and neurochemical overview, outlining what is known of the cellular makeup of the region and its most prominent afferent and efferent connections. We discuss how these connections and distinctions across the anterior-posterior axis correspond to the perceived function of the PVT. We then focus on the hypothalamic-thalamic-striatal circuit and the neuroanatomical and functional placement of the PVT within this circuit. In this regard, the PVT is ideally positioned to integrate information regarding internal states and the external environment and translate it into motivated actions. Based on data that has emerged in recent years, including that from our laboratory, we posit that orexinergic (OX) innervation from the lateral hypothalamus (LH) to the PVT encodes the incentive motivational value of reward cues and thereby alters the signaling of the glutamatergic neurons projecting from the PVT to the shell of the nucleus accumbens (NAcSh). The PVT-NAcSh pathway then modulates dopamine activity and resultant cue-motivated behaviors. As we and others apply novel tools and approaches to studying the PVT we will continue to refine the anatomical, cellular, and functional definitions currently ascribed to this nucleus and further elucidate its role in motivated behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Available evidence suggests that the pathology usually begins in the gut and olfactory mucosa, spreading to the brain via the vagus and olfactory nerves, by a prion-like mechanism. A causal relationship has not been established, but gut dysbiosis is prevalent in PD and may lead to intestinal inflammation and barrier dysfunction. Additionally, epidemiological data indicate a link between inflammatory bowel diseases and PD. Calprotectin and zonulin are markers of intestinal inflammation and barrier permeability, respectively. We evaluated their serum and fecal levels in 22 patients with sporadic PD and 16 unmatched healthy controls. Mean calprotectin was higher in PD, both in serum (14.26 mcg/ml ± 4.50 vs. 5.94 mcg/ml ± 3.80, p = 0.0125) and stool (164.54 mcg/g ± 54.19 vs. 56.19 mcg/g ± 35.88, p = 0.0048). Mean zonulin was also higher in PD serum (26.69 ng/ml ± 3.55 vs. 19.43 ng/ml ± 2.56, p = 0.0046) and stool (100.19 ng/ml ± 28.25 vs. 37.3 ng/ml ± 13.26, p = 0.0012). Calprotectin was above the upper reference limit in 19 PD serums and 6 controls (OR = 10.56, 95% CI = 2.17–51.42, p = 0.0025) and in 20 PD stool samples and 4 controls (OR = 30, 95% CI = 4.75–189.30, p = 0.000045). Increased zonulin was found only in the stool samples of 8 PD patients. Despite the small sample size, our findings are robust, complementing and supporting other recently published results. The relation between serum and fecal calprotectin and zonulin levels and sporadic PD warrants further investigation in larger cohorts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Rabbit PrP Is Partially Resistant to in vitro Aggregation Induced by Different Biological Cofactors</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.689315</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Prion diseases have been described in humans and other mammals, including sheep, goats, cattle, and deer. Since mice, hamsters, and cats are susceptible to prion infection, they are often used to study the mechanisms of prion infection and conversion. Mammals, such as horses and dogs, however, do not naturally contract the disease and are resistant to infection, while others, like rabbits, have exhibited low susceptibility. Infection involves the conversion of the cellular prion protein (PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;) to the scrapie form (PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt;), and several cofactors have already been identified as important adjuvants in this process, such as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), lipids, and nucleic acids. The molecular mechanisms that determine transmissibility between species remain unclear, as well as the barriers to transmission. In this study, we examine the interaction of recombinant rabbit PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; (RaPrP) with different biological cofactors such as GAGs (heparin and dermatan sulfate), phosphatidic acid, and DNA oligonucleotides (A1 and D67) to evaluate the importance of these cofactors in modulating the aggregation of rabbit PrP and explain the animal’s different degrees of resistance to infection. We used spectroscopic and chromatographic approaches to evaluate the interaction with cofactors and their effect on RaPrP aggregation, which we compared with murine PrP (MuPrP). Our data show that all cofactors induce RaPrP aggregation and exhibit pH dependence. However, RaPrP aggregated to a lesser extent than MuPrP in the presence of any of the cofactors tested. The binding affinity with cofactors does not correlate with these low levels of aggregation, suggesting that the latter are related to the stability of PrP at acidic pH. The absence of the N-terminus affected the interaction with cofactors, influencing the efficiency of aggregation. These findings demonstrate that the interaction with polyanionic cofactors is related to rabbit PrP being less susceptible to aggregation in vitro and that the N-terminal domain is important to the efficiency of conversion, increasing the interaction with cofactors. The decreased effect of cofactors in rabbit PrP likely explains its lower propensity to prion conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurogenesis: The Potential Role of Inflammation in Modulating Endogenous Hippocampal Neurogenesis After Spinal Cord Injury</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.682259</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Currently there are approximately 291,000 people suffering from a spinal cord injury (SCI) in the United States. SCI is associated with traumatic changes in mobility and neuralgia, as well as many other long-term chronic health complications, including metabolic disorders, diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, osteoporosis, and elevated inflammatory markers. Due to medical advances, patients with SCI survive much longer than previously. This increase in life expectancy exposes them to novel neurological complications such as memory loss, cognitive decline, depression, and Alzheimer’s disease. In fact, these usually age-associated disorders are more prevalent in people living with SCI. A common factor of these disorders is the reduction in hippocampal neurogenesis. Inflammation, which is elevated after SCI, plays a major role in modulating hippocampal neurogenesis. While there is no clear consensus on the mechanism of the decline in hippocampal neurogenesis and cognition after SCI, we will examine in this review how SCI-induced inflammation could modulate hippocampal neurogenesis and provoke age-associated neurological disorders. Thereafter, we will discuss possible therapeutic options which may mitigate the influence of SCI associated complications on hippocampal neurogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Whole-Brain Functional Network Connectivity Abnormalities in Affective and Non-Affective Early Phase Psychosis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.682110</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Psychosis disorders share overlapping symptoms and are characterized by a wide-spread breakdown in functional brain integration. Although neuroimaging studies have identified numerous connectivity abnormalities in affective and non-affective psychoses, whether they have specific or unique connectivity abnormalities, especially within the early stage is still poorly understood. The early phase of psychosis is a critical period with fewer chronic confounds and when treatment intervention may be most effective. In this work, we examined whole-brain functional network connectivity (FNC) from both static and dynamic perspectives in patients with affective psychosis (PAP) or with non-affective psychosis (PnAP) and healthy controls (HCs). A fully automated independent component analysis (ICA) pipeline called “Neuromark” was applied to high-quality functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data with 113 early-phase psychosis patients (32 PAP and 81 PnAP) and 52 HCs. Relative to the HCs, both psychosis groups showed common abnormalities in static FNC (sFNC) between the thalamus and sensorimotor domain, and between subcortical regions and the cerebellum. PAP had specifically decreased sFNC between the superior temporal gyrus and the paracentral lobule, and between the cerebellum and the middle temporal gyrus/inferior parietal lobule. On the other hand, PnAP showed increased sFNC between the fusiform gyrus and the superior medial frontal gyrus. Dynamic FNC (dFNC) was investigated using a combination of a sliding window approach, clustering analysis, and graph analysis. Three reoccurring brain states were identified, among which both psychosis groups had fewer occurrences in one antagonism state (state 2) and showed decreased network efficiency within an intermediate state (state 1). Compared with HCs and PnAP, PAP also showed a significantly increased number of state transitions, indicating more unstable brain connections in affective psychosis. We further found that the identified connectivity features were associated with the overall positive and negative syndrome scale, an assessment instrument for general psychopathology and positive symptoms. Our findings support the view that subcortical-cortical information processing is disrupted within five years of the initial onset of psychosis and provide new evidence that abnormalities in both static and dynamic connectivity consist of shared and unique features for the early affective and non-affective psychoses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Seizures and Interictal Epileptiform Activity in the Rat Collagenase Model for Intracerebral Hemorrhage</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.682036</link>
	<content:encoded>Aims&lt;p&gt;Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a known risk factor for the development of acute symptomatic as well as late unprovoked seizures. The underlying pathophysiology of post-ICH seizures is incompletely understood and there are no reliable predictive biomarkers. An animal model to study post-ICH seizures is currently lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate (1) the occurrence of seizures and interictal epileptiform activity in the ICH rat collagenase model using long-term video-EEG monitoring (VEM) and (2) whether seizure occurrence was associated with interictal epileptiform activity and histological features.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with epidural electrodes. After 1 week of baseline VEM, collagenase was injected in left striatum to induce an ICH. VEM was continued for 180 days to assess the occurrence of post-ICH seizures and interictal epileptiform activity (spikes and epileptiform discharges). At the end of the experiment, animals were euthanized for histological characterization of the hemorrhagic lesion, using cresyl violet, Prussian blue and immunofluorescence staining.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Acute symptomatic seizures occurred in 4/12 animals between 46 and 80 h after ICH induction. Late unprovoked seizures were present in 2/12 animals and started at 90 and 103 days post-ICH. Animals with late unprovoked seizures did not have acute symptomatic seizures. All electrographic seizures were accompanied by clear behavioral changes. Interictal spikes and epileptiform discharges were observed in all animals but occurred more frequently in rats with late seizures (p = 0.019 and p &amp;lt; 0.001, respectively). Animals with acute symptomatic seizures had more extended hemorrhagic lesions and hemosiderin deposits in the piriform cortex.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Both acute symptomatic and late unprovoked seizures were observed in the rat collagenase model. Interictal epileptiform activity was more frequently seen in animals with late seizures. Rats with acute symptomatic seizures showed more extensive lesions and hemosiderin deposits in the piriform cortex. This model could be used to further explore possible biomarkers for epileptogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Squalamine and Its Derivatives Modulate the Aggregation of Amyloid-β and α-Synuclein and Suppress the Toxicity of Their Oligomers</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.680026</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The aberrant aggregation of proteins is a key molecular event in the development and progression of a wide range of neurodegenerative disorders. We have shown previously that squalamine and trodusquemine, two natural products in the aminosterol class, can modulate the aggregation of the amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) and of α-synuclein (αS), which are associated with Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. In this work, we expand our previous analyses to two squalamine derivatives, des-squalamine and α-squalamine, obtaining further insights into the mechanism by which aminosterols modulate Aβ and αS aggregation. We then characterize the ability of these small molecules to alter the physicochemical properties of stabilized oligomeric species in vitro and to suppress the toxicity of these aggregates to varying degrees toward human neuroblastoma cells. We found that, despite the fact that these aminosterols exert opposing effects on Aβ and αS aggregation under the conditions that we tested, the modifications that they induced to the toxicity of oligomers were similar. Our results indicate that the suppression of toxicity is mediated by the displacement of toxic oligomeric species from cellular membranes by the aminosterols. This study, thus, provides evidence that aminosterols could be rationally optimized in drug discovery programs to target oligomer toxicity in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.676220</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The human pupil behavior has gained increased attention due to the discovery of the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells and the afferent pupil control path’s role as a biomarker for cognitive processes. Diameter changes in the range of 10&lt;sup&gt;–2&lt;/sup&gt; mm are of interest, requiring reliable and characterized measurement equipment to accurately detect neurocognitive effects on the pupil. Mostly commercial solutions are used as measurement devices in pupillometry which is associated with high investments. Moreover, commercial systems rely on closed software, restricting conclusions about the used pupil-tracking algorithms. Here, we developed an open-source pupillometry platform consisting of hardware and software competitive with high-end commercial stereo eye-tracking systems. Our goal was to make a professional remote pupil measurement pipeline for laboratory conditions accessible for everyone. This work’s core outcome is an integrated cross-platform (macOS, Windows and Linux) pupillometry software called PupilEXT, featuring a user-friendly graphical interface covering the relevant requirements of professional pupil response research. We offer a selection of six state-of-the-art open-source pupil detection algorithms (Starburst, Swirski, ExCuSe, ElSe, PuRe and PuReST) to perform the pupil measurement. A developed 120-fps pupillometry demo system was able to achieve a calibration accuracy of 0.003 mm and an averaged temporal pupil measurement detection accuracy of 0.0059 mm in stereo mode. The PupilEXT software has extended features in pupil detection, measurement validation, image acquisition, data acquisition, offline pupil measurement, camera calibration, stereo vision, data visualization and system independence, all combined in a single open-source interface, available at https://github.com/openPupil/Open-PupilEXT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.660187</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis, many studies have been conducted on inter-subject variability as well as intra-subject reproducibility. These studies indicate that fMRI could have unique characteristics for individuals. In this study, we hypothesized that the dynamic information during 1 min of fMRI was unique and repetitive enough for each subject, so we applied long short-term memory (LSTM) using initial time points of dynamic resting-state fMRI for individual identification. Siamese network is used to obtain robust individual identification performance without additional learning on a new dataset. In particular, by adding a new structure called region of interest–wise average pooling (RAP), individual identification performance could be improved, and key intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) for individual identification were also identified. The average performance of individual identification was 97.88% using the test dataset in eightfold cross-validation analysis. Through the visualization of features learned by Siamese LSTM with RAP, ICNs spanning the parietal region were observed as the key ICNs in identifying individuals. These results suggest the key ICNs in fMRI could represent individual uniqueness.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.629297</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Pericytes are perivascular multipotent cells located on capillaries. Although pericytes are discovered in the nineteenth century, recent studies have found that pericytes play an important role in maintaining the blood—brain barrier (BBB) and regulating the neurovascular system. In the neurovascular unit, pericytes perform their functions by coordinating the crosstalk between endothelial, glial, and neuronal cells. Dysfunction of pericytes can lead to a variety of diseases, including stroke and other neurological disorders. Recent studies have suggested that pericytes can serve as a therapeutic target in ischemic stroke. In this review, we first summarize the biology and functions of pericytes in the central nervous system. Then, we focus on the role of dysfunctional pericytes in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke. Finally, we discuss new therapies for ischemic stroke based on targeting pericytes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: 3D Segmentation of Perivascular Spaces on T1-Weighted 3 Tesla MR Images With a Convolutional Autoencoder and a U-Shaped Neural Network</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.641600</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We implemented a deep learning (DL) algorithm for the 3-dimensional segmentation of perivascular spaces (PVSs) in deep white matter (DWM) and basal ganglia (BG). This algorithm is based on an autoencoder and a U-shaped network (U-net), and was trained and tested using T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from a large database of 1,832 healthy young adults. An important feature of this approach is the ability to learn from relatively sparse data, which gives the present algorithm a major advantage over other DL algorithms. Here, we trained the algorithm with 40 T1-weighted MRI datasets in which all “visible” PVSs were manually annotated by an experienced operator. After learning, performance was assessed using another set of 10 MRI scans from the same database in which PVSs were also traced by the same operator and were checked by consensus with another experienced operator. The Sorensen-Dice coefficients for PVS voxel detection in DWM (resp. BG) were 0.51 (resp. 0.66), and 0.64 (resp. 0.71) for PVS cluster detection (volume threshold of 0.5 within a range of 0 to 1). Dice values above 0.90 could be reached for detecting PVSs larger than 10 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and 0.95 for PVSs larger than 15 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. We then applied the trained algorithm to the rest of the database (1,782 individuals). The individual PVS load provided by the algorithm showed a high agreement with a semi-quantitative visual rating done by an independent expert rater, both for DWM and for BG. Finally, we applied the trained algorithm to an age-matched sample from another MRI database acquired using a different scanner. We obtained a very similar distribution of PVS load, demonstrating the interoperability of this algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Did My Hand Move in a Mirror? Body Ownership Induced by the Mirror Hand Illusion</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.684873</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Although the illusion that the mirror image of a hand or limb could be recognized as a part of one’s body behind the mirror, the effect of adding tactile stimulation to this illusion remains unknown. We, therefore, examined how the timing of tactile stimulation affects the induction of body ownership on the mirror image. Twenty-one healthy, right-handed participants (mean age = 23.0 ± 1.0 years, no medical history of neurological and/or psychiatric disorders) were enrolled and a crossover design was adopted in this study. Participants’ right and left hands were placed on the front and back sides of the mirror, respectively, then they were asked to keep looking at their right hand in the mirror. All participants experienced two experiments; one was with tactile stimulation that was synchronized with the movement of a mirror image (synchronous condition), and the other one was with tactile stimulation that was not synchronized (asynchronous condition). The qualitative degree of body ownership for the mirrored hand was evaluated by a questionnaire. Proprioceptive drift (PD), an illusory shift of the felt position of the real hand toward the mirrored hand was used for quantitative evaluation of body ownership and measured at “baseline,” “immediately after stimulation,” “2 min after stimulation,” and “4 min after stimulation.” The results of the questionnaire revealed that some items of body ownership rating were higher in the synchronous condition than in the asynchronous condition (p &amp;lt; 0.05). We found that PD occurred from immediately after to 4 min after stimulation in both conditions (p &amp;lt; 0.01) and there was no difference in the results between the conditions. From the dissociation of these results, we interpreted that body ownership could be elicited by different mechanisms depending on the task demand. Our results may contribute to the understanding of the multisensory integration mechanism of visual and tactile stimulation during mirror illusion induction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Over the Right Posterior Superior Temporal Sulcus Promotes the Feature Discrimination Processing</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.663789</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Attention is the dynamic process of allocating limited resources to the information that is most relevant to our goals. Accumulating studies have demonstrated the crucial role of frontal and parietal areas in attention. However, the effect of posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) in attention is still unclear. To address this question, in this study, we measured transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-induced event-related potentials (ERPs) to determine the extent of involvement of the right pSTS in attentional processing. We hypothesized that TMS would enhance the activation of the right pSTS during feature discrimination processing. We recruited 21 healthy subjects who performed the dual-feature delayed matching task while undergoing single-pulse sham or real TMS to the right pSTS 300 ms before the second stimulus onset. The results showed that the response time was reduced by real TMS of the pSTS as compared to sham stimulation. N270 amplitude was reduced during conflict processing, and the time-varying network analysis revealed increased connectivity between the frontal lobe and temporo-parietal and occipital regions. Thus, single-pulse TMS of the right pSTS enhances feature discrimination processing and task performance by reducing N270 amplitude and increasing connections between the frontal pole and temporo-parietal and occipital regions. These findings provide evidence that the right pSTS facilitates feature discrimination by accelerating the formation of a dynamic network.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.653069</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Education programs have been central to reestablishing social norms, rebuilding public educational institutions, and addressing public attitudes toward mental illness in Liberia following a protracted civil war and the Ebola epidemic. The aim of this study was to determine if a program combining an understanding of neuroscience with mental health literacy content could increase teachers’ awareness of students’ mental health issues and produce changes in teacher attitudes and classroom practices. A tiered Training-of-Trainers approach was employed. The first workshop trained 24 Liberian secondary science teachers in the neurobiology of learning, memory, emotions, stress and adolescent brain development. A Leadership Team formed from eight of the Tier I participants then adapted the curriculum, added in more mental health literacy content and led four Tier II workshops and four follow-up Refresher sessions. Participants completed a neuroscience knowledge test and surveys assessing stigma, general perceptions of people with mental illness, and burnout. A subset of Tier II teachers participated in a structured interview at the Refresher time point. Teachers in both tiers acquired basic neuroscience knowledge. Tier I, but not Tier II teachers significantly improved their surveyed attitudes toward people with mental illness. No changes were found in overall teacher burnout. Despite these survey results, the interviewed Tier II teachers self-reported behavioral changes in how they approached their teaching and students in their classrooms. Interviewees described how they now understood social and emotional challenges students might be experiencing and recognized abnormal behaviors as having a biopsychosocial basis. Teachers reported reduced use of verbal and corporal punishment and increased positive rewards systems, such as social and emotional support for students through building relationships. Refresher discussions concurred with the interviewees. In contrast to previous teacher mental health literacy programs which did not bring about a change in helping behaviors, this pilot program may have been successful in changing teacher knowledge and self-reported behaviors, improving teacher–student relationships and decreasing harsh discipline. The combination of basic neuroscience concepts with training on how to recognize mental health issues and refer students should be investigated further as a strategy to promote teacher mental health literacy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: ERP Mismatch Negativity Amplitude and Asymmetry Reflect Phonological and Rapid Automatized Naming Skills in English-Speaking Kindergartners</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.624617</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The mismatch negativity (MMN), an electrophysiological response to an oddball auditory stimulus, is related to reading ability in many studies. There are conflicting findings regarding exactly how the MMN relates to risk or actual diagnosis of dyslexia/reading impairment, perhaps due to the heterogeneity of abilities in children with reading impairment. In this study, 166 English-speaking kindergarten children oversampled for dyslexia risk completed behavioral assessments and a speech-syllable MMN paradigm. We examined how early and late MMN mean amplitude and laterality were related to two established predictors of reading ability: phonological awareness (PA) and rapid automatized naming (RAN). In bootstrapped group analyses, late MMN amplitude was significantly greater in children with typical PA ability than low PA ability. In contrast, laterality of the early and late MMN was significantly different in children with low versus typical RAN ability. Continuous analyses controlling for child age, non-verbal IQ, and letter and word identification abilities showed the same associations between late MMN amplitude with PA and late MMN laterality with RAN. These findings suggest that amplitude of the MMN may relate to phonological representations and ability to manipulate them, whereas MMN laterality may reflect differences in brain processes that support automaticity needed for reading.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Dose-Response Effects of Acute Aerobic Exercise Intensity on Inhibitory Control in Children With Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.617596</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The present study aimed to examine whether the effect of acute aerobic exercise on inhibitory control of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is moderated by exercise intensity. Using a within-subjects design, 25 children with ADHD completed a flanker task with concurrent collection of electroencephalography (EEG) data after three different intensities of treadmill running. The results showed that low- and moderate-intensity exercises resulted in shorter reaction times (RTs) relative to vigorous-intensity exercise during the incompatible condition of the flanker task regardless of task congruency. A P3 congruency effect was observed following low- and vigorous-intensity exercises but not after moderate-intensity exercise. The mean alpha power, a measure of cortical arousal, increased following low- and moderate-intensity exercises but decreased following vigorous-intensity exercise. In addition, the change in arousal level after moderate-intensity exercise was negatively correlated with RT during incompatible flanker tasks. The current findings suggest that children with ADHD have better inhibitory control following both low- and moderate-intensity exercises relative to vigorous aerobic exercise, which could be characterized by an optimal state of cortical arousal.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Variability in cTBS Aftereffects Attributed to the Interaction of Stimulus Intensity With BDNF Val66Met Polymorphism</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.585533</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: To evaluate whether a common polymorphism (Val66Met) in the gene for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)—a gene thought to influence plasticity—contributes to inter-individual variability in responses to continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS), and explore whether variability in stimulation-induced plasticity among Val66Met carriers relates to differences in stimulation intensity (SI) used to probe plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were collected from 33 healthy individuals (11 Val66Met) prior to cTBS (baseline) and in 10 min intervals immediately following cTBS for a total of 30 min post-cTBS (0 min post-cTBS, 10 min post-cTBS, 20 min post cTBS, and 30 min post-cTBS) of the left primary motor cortex. Analyses assessed changes in cortical excitability as a function of BDNF (Val66Val vs. Val66Met) and SI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: For both BDNF groups, MEP-suppression from baseline to post-cTBS time points decreased as a function of increasing SI. However, the effect of SI on MEPs was more pronounced for Val66Met vs. Val66Val carriers, whereby individuals probed with higher vs. lower SIs resulted in paradoxical cTBS aftereffects (MEP-facilitation), which persisted at least 30 min post-cTBS administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: cTBS aftereffects among BDNF Met allele carriers are more variable depending on the SI used to probe cortical excitability when compared to homozygous Val allele carriers, which could, to some extent, account for the inconsistency of previously reported cTBS effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significance: These data provide insight into the sources of cTBS response variability, which can inform how best to stratify and optimize its use in investigational and clinical contexts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Computational Evidence for a Competitive Thalamocortical Model of Spikes and Spindle Activity in Rolandic Epilepsy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.680549</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Rolandic epilepsy (RE) is the most common idiopathic focal childhood epilepsy syndrome, characterized by sleep-activated epileptiform spikes and seizures and cognitive deficits in school age children. Recent evidence suggests that this disease may be caused by disruptions to the Rolandic thalamocortical circuit, resulting in both an abundance of epileptiform spikes and a paucity of sleep spindles in the Rolandic cortex during non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM); electrographic features linked to seizures and cognitive symptoms, respectively. The neuronal mechanisms that support the competitive shared thalamocortical circuitry between pathological epileptiform spikes and physiological sleep spindles are not well-understood. In this study we introduce a computational thalamocortical model for the sleep-activated epileptiform spikes observed in RE. The cellular and neuronal circuits of this model incorporate recent experimental observations in RE, and replicate the electrophysiological features of RE. Using this model, we demonstrate that: (1) epileptiform spikes can be triggered and promoted by either a reduced NMDA current or h-type current; and (2) changes in inhibitory transmission in the thalamic reticular nucleus mediates an antagonistic dynamic between epileptiform spikes and spindles. This work provides the first computational model that both recapitulates electrophysiological features and provides a mechanistic explanation for the thalamocortical switch between the pathological and physiological electrophysiological rhythms observed during NREM sleep in this common epileptic encephalopathy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Human Schwann Cell Transplantation for Spinal Cord Injury: Prospects and Challenges in Translational Medicine</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.690894</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The benefits of transplanting cultured Schwann cells (SCs) for the treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI) have been systematically investigated in experimental animals since the early 1990s. Importantly, human SC (hSC) transplantation for SCI has advanced to clinical testing and safety has been established via clinical trials conducted in the USA and abroad. However, multiple barriers must be overcome to enable accessible and effective treatments for SCI patients. This review presents available information on hSC transplantation for SCI with the intention to uncover gaps in our knowledge and discuss areas for future development. To this end, we introduce the historical progression of the work that supports existing and prospective clinical initiatives and explain the reasons for the choice of hSCs while also addressing their limitations as cell therapy products. A search of the relevant literature revealed that rat SCs have served as a preclinical model of reference since the onset of investigations, and that hSC transplants are relatively understudied, possibly due to the sophisticated resources and expertise needed for the traditional processing of hSC cultures from human nerves. In turn, we reason that additional experimentation and a reexamination of the available data are needed to understand the therapeutic value of hSC transplants taking into consideration that the manufacturing of the hSCs themselves may require further development for extended uses in basic research and clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Poly (ADP-ribose) Interacts With Phosphorylated α-Synuclein in Post Mortem PD Samples</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.704041</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Poly (ADP-ribose) (PAR) is a negatively charged polymer that is biosynthesized by Poly (ADP-ribose) Polymerase-1 (PARP-1) and regulates various cellular processes. Alpha-synuclein (αSyn) is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) that has been directly implicated with driving the onset and progression of Parkinson’s disease (PD). The mechanisms by which α-synuclein (αSyn) elicits its neurotoxic effects remain unclear, though it is well established that the main components of Lewy bodies (LBs) and Lewy neurites (LNs) in PD patients are aggregated hyperphosphorylated (S129) forms of αSyn (pαSyn). In the present study, we used immunofluorescence-based assays to explore if PARP-1 enzymatic product (PAR) promotes the aberrant cytoplasmic accumulation of pαSyn. We also performed quantitative measurements using in situ proximity ligation assays (PLA) on a transgenic murine model of α-synucleinopathy (M83-SNCA&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;A53T) and post mortem PD/PDD patient samples to characterize PAR–pαSyn interactions. Additionally, we used bioinformatic approaches and site-directed mutagenesis to identify PAR-binding regions on αSyn. In summary, our studies show that PAR–pαSyn interactions are predominantly observed in PD-relevant transgenic murine models of αSyn pathology and post mortem PD/PDD patient samples. Moreover, we confirm that the interactions between PAR and αSyn involve electrostatic forces between negatively charged PAR and lysine residues on the N-terminal region of αSyn.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The strategies of classifying APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 variants varied substantially in the previous studies. We aimed to re-evaluate these variants systematically according to the American college of medical genetics and genomics and the association for molecular pathology (ACMG-AMP) guidelines. In our study, APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 variants were collected by searching Alzforum and PubMed database with keywords “PSEN1,” “PSEN2,” and “APP.” These variants were re-evaluated based on the ACMG-AMP guidelines. We compared the number of pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants of APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2. In total, 66 APP variants, 323 PSEN1 variants, and 63 PSEN2 variants were re-evaluated in our study. 94.91% of previously reported pathogenic variants were re-classified as pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants, while 5.09% of them were variants of uncertain significance (VUS). PSEN1 carried the most prevalent pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants, followed by APP and PSEN2. Significant statistically difference was identified among these three genes when comparing the number of pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants (P &amp;lt; 2.2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;–16&lt;/sup&gt;). Most of the previously reported pathogenic variants were re-classified as pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants while the others were re-evaluated as VUS, highlighting the importance of interpreting APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 variants with caution according to ACMG-AMP guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.687456</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aim: Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease that causes 60–70% of all cases of dementia. This study is to provide a novel method that can identify AD more accurately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We first propose a VGG-inspired network (VIN) as the backbone network and investigate the use of attention mechanisms. We proposed an Alzheimer's Disease VGG-Inspired Attention Network (ADVIAN), where we integrate convolutional block attention modules on a VIN backbone. Also, 18-way data augmentation is proposed to avoid overfitting. Ten runs of 10-fold cross-validation are carried out to report the unbiased performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The sensitivity and specificity reach 97.65 ± 1.36 and 97.86 ± 1.55, respectively. Its precision and accuracy are 97.87 ± 1.53 and 97.76 ± 1.13, respectively. The F1 score, MCC, and FMI are obtained as 97.75 ± 1.13, 95.53 ± 2.27, and 97.76 ± 1.13, respectively. The AUC is 0.9852.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The proposed ADVIAN gives better results than 11 state-of-the-art methods. Besides, experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of 18-way data augmentation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.653340</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: There is a lack of study comprehensively comparing the effects of all existing types of interventions on global cognition among patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aims: To conduct a network meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of different types of interventions in improving global cognition among MCI patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in MCI patients were included. Two authors independently screened the studies and extracted the data. Random-effects network meta-analysis was used to synthesize the data. Results were summarized as mean difference (MD) and corresponding 95% CIs of MMSE in forest plots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Fifty RCTs with 5,944 MCI patients met the inclusion criteria and 49 were included in the network meta-analysis. Compared with the control group, cognition-based intervention (MD = 0.80, 95% CI 0.04–1.57), physical exercise (MD = 1.92, 95% CI 1.19–2.64), combined physical exercise and cognition-based intervention (MD = 1.86, 95% CI 0.60–3.12), and antioxidants (MD = 0.94, 95% CI 0.04–1.83) had positive effects on MMSE in participants with MCI. There was no significant difference between all other interventions included and the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: This study suggested that cognition-based intervention, physical exercise, combined physical exercise and cognition-based intervention, and antioxidants could be among the most effective interventions on global cognition in older adults with MCI. The availability, acceptability, and cost-effectiveness of interventions should also be taken into consideration when selecting interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Registration: PROSPERO CRD42020171985.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Interneuron specific gamma synchronization indexes cue uncertainty and prediction errors in lateral prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/69111</link>
	<content:encoded>Inhibitory interneurons are believed to realize critical gating functions in cortical circuits, but it has been difficult to ascertain the content of gated information for well characterized interneurons in primate cortex. Here, we address this question by characterizing putative interneurons in primate prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex while monkeys engaged in attention demanding reversal learning. We find that subclasses of narrow spiking neurons have a relative suppressive effect on the local circuit indicating they are inhibitory interneurons. One of these interneuron subclasses showed prominent firing rate modulations and (35-45 Hz) gamma synchronous spiking during periods of uncertainty in both, lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) and in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). In LPFC this interneuron subclass activated when the uncertainty of attention cues was resolved during flexible learning, whereas in ACC it fired and gamma-synchronized when outcomes were uncertain and prediction errors were high during learning. Computational modeling of this interneuron-specific gamma band activity in simple circuit motifs suggests it could reflect a soft winner-take-all gating of information having high degree of uncertainty. Together, these findings elucidate an electrophysiologically-characterized interneuron subclass in the primate, that forms gamma synchronous networks in two different areas when resolving uncertainty during adaptive goal-directed behavior.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Protective lung tissue-resident memory CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;T cells (Trm) form after influenza A virus (IAV) infection. We show that IAV infection of mice generates CD69&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD103&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;and other memory CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;T cell populations in lung-draining mediastinal lymph nodes (mLNs) from circulating naive or memory CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;T cells. Repeated antigen exposure, mimicking seasonal IAV infections, generates quaternary memory (4M) CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;T cells that protect mLN from viral infection better than 1M CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;T cells. Better protection by 4M CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;T cells associates with enhanced granzyme A/B expression and stable maintenance of mLN CD69&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD103&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;4M CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;T cells, vs the steady decline of CD69&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD103&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;1M CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;T cells, paralleling the durability of protective CD69&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD103&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;4M vs 1M in the lung after IAV infection. Coordinated upregulation in canonical Trm-associated genes occurs in circulating 4M vs 1M populations without the enrichment of canonical downregulated Trm genes. Thus, repeated antigen exposure arms circulating memory CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;T cells with enhanced capacity to form long-lived populations of Trm that enhance control of viral infections of the mLN.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: A bidirectional corticoamygdala circuit for the encoding and retrieval of detailed reward memories</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/68617</link>
	<content:encoded>Adaptive reward-related decision making often requires accurate and detailed representation of potential available rewards. Environmental reward-predictive stimuli can facilitate these representations, allowing one to infer which specific rewards might be available and choose accordingly. This process relies on encoded relationships between the cues and the sensory-specific details of the reward they predict. Here we interrogated the function of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and its interaction with the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) in the ability to learn such stimulus-outcome associations and use these memories to guide decision making. Using optical recording and inhibition approaches, Pavlovian cue-reward conditioning, and the outcome-selective Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer (PIT) test in male rats, we found that the BLA is robustly activated at the time of stimulus-outcome learning and that this activity is necessary for sensory-specific stimulus-outcome memories to be encoded, so they can subsequently influence reward choices. Direct input from the lOFC was found to support the BLA in this function. Based on prior work, activity in BLA projections back to the lOFC was known to support the use of stimulus-outcome memories to influence decision making. By multiplexing optogenetic and chemogenetic inhibition we performed a serial circuit disconnection and found that the lOFCàBLA and BLAàlOFC pathways form a functional circuit regulating the encoding (lOFCàBLA) and subsequent use (BLAàlOFC) of the stimulus-dependent, sensory-specific reward memories that are critical for adaptive, appetitive decision making.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66095</link>
	<content:encoded>Lung cancer with loss-of-function of the LKB1 tumor suppressor is a common aggressive subgroup with no effective therapies. LKB1&lt;i&gt;-&lt;/i&gt;deficiency induces constitutive activation of cAMP/CREB-mediated transcription by a family of three CREB-regulated transcription coactivators (CRTC1-3). However, the significance and mechanism of CRTC activation in promoting the aggressive phenotype of LKB1-null cancer remain poorly characterized. Here we observed overlapping CRTC expression patterns and mild growth phenotypes of individual CRTC-knockouts in lung cancer, suggesting functional redundancy of CRTC1-3. We consequently designed a dominant-negative mutant (dnCRTC) to block all three CRTCs to bind and co-activate CREB. Expression of dnCRTC efficiently inhibited the aberrantly activated cAMP/CREB-mediated oncogenic transcriptional program induced by LKB1-deficiency, and specifically blocked the growth of human and murine LKB1-inactivated lung cancer. Collectively, this study provides direct proof for an essential role of the CRTC-CREB activation in promoting the malignant phenotypes of LKB1-null lung cancer and proposes the CRTC-CREB interaction interface as a novel therapeutic target.</content:encoded>

Here we investigated the effect of psychosocial experiences on gene expression in peripheral blood immune cells of children with asthma in Metro Detroit. Using RNA-sequencing and a new machine learning approach, we identified transcriptional signatures of 19 variables including psychosocial factors, blood cell composition and asthma symptoms. Importantly, we found 169 genes associated with asthma or allergic disease that are regulated by psychosocial factors, and 344 significant gene-environment interactions for gene expression levels. These results demonstrate that immune gene expression mediates the link between negative psychosocial experiences and asthma risk.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61407</link>
	<content:encoded>Caveolae-associated protein 3 (cavin3) is inactivated in most cancers. We characterized how cavin3 affects the cellular proteome using genome-edited cells together with label-free quantitative proteomics. These studies revealed a prominent role for cavin3 in DNA repair, with BRCA1 and BRCA1 A-complex components being downregulated on cavin3 deletion. Cellular and cell-free expression assays revealed a direct interaction between BRCA1 and cavin3 that occurs when cavin3 is released from caveolae that are disassembled in response to UV and mechanical stress. Overexpression and RNAi-depletion revealed that cavin3 sensitized various cancer cells to UV-induced apoptosis. Supporting a role in DNA repair, cavin3-deficient cells were sensitive to PARP inhibition, where concomitant depletion of 53BP1 restored BRCA1-dependent sensitivity to PARP inhibition. We conclude that cavin3 functions together with BRCA1 in multiple cancer-related pathways. The loss of cavin3 function may provide tumor cell survival by attenuating apoptotic sensitivity and hindering DNA repair under chronic stress conditions.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: The linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex LUBAC generates heterotypic ubiquitin chains</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60660</link>
	<content:encoded>The linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) is the only known ubiquitin ligase for linear/Met1-linked ubiquitin chain formation. One of the LUBAC components, HOIL-1L, was recently shown to catalyse oxyester bond formation between ubiquitin and some substrates. However, oxyester bond formation in the context of LUBAC has not been directly observed. Here, we present the first 3D reconstruction of human LUBAC obtained by electron microscopy and report its generation of heterotypic ubiquitin chains containing linear linkages with oxyester-linked branches. We found that this event depends on HOIL-1L catalytic activity. By cross-linking mass spectrometry showing proximity between the catalytic RBR domains, a coordinated ubiquitin relay mechanism between the HOIP and HOIL-1L ligases is suggested. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, these heterotypic chains were induced by TNF, which is reduced in cells expressing an HOIL-1L catalytic inactive mutant. In conclusion, we demonstrate that LUBAC assembles heterotypic ubiquitin chains by the concerted action of HOIP and HOIL-1L.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Prenatal androgen influences on the brain: A review, critique, and illustration of research on congenital adrenal hyperplasia</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24900?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Sex hormones, especially androgens, contribute to sex and gender differences in the brain and behavior. Organizational effects are particularly important because they are thought to be permanent, reflecting hormone exposure during sensitive periods of development. In human beings, they are often studied with natural experiments in which sex hormones are dissociated from other biopsychosocial aspects of development, such as genes and experiences. Indeed, the greatest evidence for organizational effects on sex differences in human behavior comes from studies of females with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), who have heightened prenatal androgen exposure, female‐typical rearing, and masculinized toy play, activity and career interests, spatial skills, and some personal characteristics. Interestingly, however, neuroimaging studies of females with CAH have revealed few neural mechanisms underlying these hormone‐behavior links, with the exception of emotion processing; studies have instead shown reduced gray matter volumes and reduced white matter integrity most consistent with other disease‐related processes. The goals of this narrative review are to: (a) describe methods for studying prenatal androgen influences, while offering a brief overview of behavioral outcomes; (b) provide a critical methodological review of neuroimaging research on females with CAH; (c) present an illustrative analysis that overcomes methodological limitations of previous work, focusing on person‐specific neural reward networks (and their associations with sensation seeking) in women with CAH and their unaffected sisters in order to inform future research questions and approaches that are most likely to reveal organizational hormone effects on brain structure and function.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Contact tracing efficiency, transmission heterogeneity, and accelerating COVID-19 epidemics</title>

Simultaneously controlling COVID-19 epidemics and limiting economic and societal impacts presents a difficult challenge, especially with limited public health budgets. Testing, contact tracing, and isolating/quarantining is a key strategy that has been used to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 and other pathogens. However, manual contact tracing is a time-consuming process and as case numbers increase a smaller fraction of cases’ contacts can be traced, leading to additional virus spread. Delays between symptom onset and being tested (and receiving results), and a low fraction of symptomatic cases being tested and traced can also reduce the impact of contact tracing on transmission. We examined the relationship between increasing cases and delays and the pathogen reproductive number R&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;, and the implications for infection dynamics using deterministic and stochastic compartmental models of SARS-CoV-2. We found that R&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; increased sigmoidally with the number of cases due to decreasing contact tracing efficacy. This relationship results in accelerating epidemics because R&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; initially increases, rather than declines, as infections increase. Shifting contact tracers from locations with high and low case burdens relative to capacity to locations with intermediate case burdens maximizes their impact in reducing R&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; (but minimizing total infections may be more complicated). Contact tracing efficacy decreased sharply with increasing delays between symptom onset and tracing and with lower fraction of symptomatic infections being tested. Finally, testing and tracing reductions in R&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; can sometimes greatly delay epidemics due to the highly heterogeneous transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. These results demonstrate the importance of having an expandable or mobile team of contact tracers that can be used to control surges in cases. They also highlight the synergistic value of high capacity, easy access testing and rapid turn-around of testing results, and outreach efforts to encourage symptomatic cases to be tested immediately after symptom onset.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qiGNt_DK1WU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: SDImpute: A statistical block imputation method based on cell-level and gene-level information for dropouts in single-cell RNA-seq data</title>

The single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies obtain gene expression at single-cell resolution and provide a tool for exploring cell heterogeneity and cell types. As the low amount of extracted mRNA copies per cell, scRNA-seq data exhibit a large number of dropouts, which hinders the downstream analysis of the scRNA-seq data. We propose a statistical method, SDImpute (Single-cell RNA-seq Dropout Imputation), to implement block imputation for dropout events in scRNA-seq data. SDImpute automatically identifies the dropout events based on the gene expression levels and the variations of gene expression across similar cells and similar genes, and it implements block imputation for dropouts by utilizing gene expression unaffected by dropouts from similar cells. In the experiments, the results of the simulated datasets and real datasets suggest that SDImpute is an effective tool to recover the data and preserve the heterogeneity of gene expression across cells. Compared with the state-of-the-art imputation methods, SDImpute improves the accuracy of the downstream analysis including clustering, visualization, and differential expression analysis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HUPLdU61RI0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Yeh, Sylvia K. Plevritis, Jeanne S. Mandelblatt, for the Breast Working Group of the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) &lt;/p&gt;

Since 2000, the National Cancer Institute’s Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) modeling teams have developed and applied microsimulation and statistical models of breast cancer. Here, we illustrate the use of collaborative breast cancer multilevel systems modeling in CISNET to demonstrate the flexibility of systems modeling to address important clinical and policy-relevant questions. Challenges and opportunities of future systems modeling are also summarized. The 6 CISNET breast cancer models embody the key features of systems modeling by incorporating numerous data sources and reflecting tumor, person, and health system factors that change over time and interact to affect the burden of breast cancer. Multidisciplinary modeling teams have explored alternative representations of breast cancer to reveal insights into breast cancer natural history, including the role of overdiagnosis and race differences in tumor characteristics. The models have been used to compare strategies for improving the balance of benefits and harms of breast cancer screening based on personal risk factors, including age, breast density, polygenic risk, and history of Down syndrome or a history of childhood cancer. The models have also provided evidence to support the delivery of care by simulating outcomes following clinical decisions about breast cancer treatment and estimating the relative impact of screening and treatment on the United States population. The insights provided by the CISNET breast cancer multilevel modeling efforts have informed policy and clinical guidelines. The 20 years of CISNET modeling experience has highlighted opportunities and challenges to expanding the impact of systems modeling. Moving forward, CISNET research will continue to use systems modeling to address cancer control issues, including modeling structural inequities affecting racial disparities in the burden of breast cancer. Future work will also leverage the lessons from team science, expand resource sharing, and foster the careers of early stage modeling scientists to ensure the sustainability of these efforts.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/R5smLGeS-Sk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Effectively designing and evaluating public health responses to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic requires accurate estimation of the prevalence of COVID-19 across the United States (US). Equipment shortages and varying testing capabilities have however hindered the usefulness of the official reported positive COVID-19 case counts. We introduce four complementary approaches to estimate the cumulative incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 in each state in the US as well as Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia, using a combination of excess influenza-like illness reports, COVID-19 test statistics, COVID-19 mortality reports, and a spatially structured epidemic model. Instead of relying on the estimate from a single data source or method that may be biased, we provide multiple estimates, each relying on different assumptions and data sources. Across our four approaches emerges the consistent conclusion that on April 4, 2020, the estimated case count was 5 to 50 times higher than the official positive test counts across the different states. Nationally, our estimates of COVID-19 symptomatic cases as of April 4 have a likely range of 2.3 to 4.8 million, with possibly as many as 7.6 million cases, up to 25 times greater than the cumulative confirmed cases of about 311,000. Extending our methods to May 16, 2020, we estimate that cumulative symptomatic incidence ranges from 4.9 to 10.1 million, as opposed to 1.5 million positive test counts. The proposed combination of approaches may prove useful in assessing the burden of COVID-19 during resurgences in the US and other countries with comparable surveillance systems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/s1IFpuDJwGg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

More than 1.6 million Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) tests were administered daily in the United States at the peak of the epidemic, with a significant focus on individual treatment. Here, we show that objective-driven, strategic sampling designs and analyses can maximize information gain at the population level, which is necessary to increase situational awareness and predict, prepare for, and respond to a pandemic, while also continuing to inform individual treatment. By focusing on specific objectives such as individual treatment or disease prediction and control (e.g., via the collection of population-level statistics to inform lockdown measures or vaccine rollout) and drawing from the literature on capture–recapture methods to deal with nonrandom sampling and testing errors, we illustrate how public health objectives can be achieved even with limited test availability when testing programs are designed a priori to meet those objectives.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ioJn_S3Md0o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Comprehensive glycoproteomics shines new light on the complexity and extent of glycosylation in archaea</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/3LiSINPzrjQ/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Stefan Schulze, Friedhelm Pfeiffer, Benjamin A. Garcia, Mechthild Pohlschroder&lt;/p&gt;

Glycosylation is one of the most complex posttranslational protein modifications. Its importance has been established not only for eukaryotes but also for a variety of prokaryotic cellular processes, such as biofilm formation, motility, and mating. However, comprehensive glycoproteomic analyses are largely missing in prokaryotes. Here, we extend the phenotypic characterization of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-glycosylation pathway mutants in &lt;i&gt;Haloferax volcanii&lt;/i&gt; and provide a detailed glycoproteome for this model archaeon through the mass spectrometric analysis of intact glycopeptides. Using in-depth glycoproteomic datasets generated for the wild-type (WT) and mutant strains as well as a reanalysis of datasets within the Archaeal Proteome Project (ArcPP), we identify the largest archaeal glycoproteome described so far. We further show that different &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-glycosylation pathways can modify the same glycosites under the same culture conditions. The extent and complexity of the &lt;i&gt;Hfx&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;volcanii N&lt;/i&gt;-glycoproteome revealed here provide new insights into the roles of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-glycosylation in archaeal cell biology.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/3LiSINPzrjQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Response thresholds alone cannot explain empirical patterns of division of labor in social insects</title>

The effects of heterogeneity in group composition remain a major hurdle to our understanding of collective behavior across disciplines. In social insects, division of labor (DOL) is an emergent, colony-level trait thought to depend on colony composition. Theoretically, behavioral response threshold models have most commonly been employed to investigate the impact of heterogeneity on DOL. However, empirical studies that systematically test their predictions are lacking because they require control over colony composition and the ability to monitor individual behavior in groups, both of which are challenging. Here, we employ automated behavioral tracking in 120 colonies of the clonal raider ant with unparalleled control over genetic, morphological, and demographic composition. We find that each of these sources of variation in colony composition generates a distinct pattern of behavioral organization, ranging from the amplification to the dampening of inherent behavioral differences in heterogeneous colonies. Furthermore, larvae modulate interactions between adults, exacerbating the apparent complexity. Models based on threshold variation alone only partially recapitulate these empirical patterns. However, by incorporating the potential for variability in task efficiency among adults and task demand among larvae, we account for all the observed phenomena. Our findings highlight the significance of previously overlooked parameters pertaining to both larvae and workers, allow the formulation of theoretical predictions for increasing colony complexity, and suggest new avenues of empirical study.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/7Frc4eP-AYw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Erythrocyte adenosine A2B receptor prevents cognitive and auditory dysfunction by promoting hypoxic and metabolic reprogramming</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/JKRydZnMyQc/article</link>

Reisz, George Edwards III, Fred A. Perreira, Rodney E. Kellems, Claudio Soto, Angelo D’Alessandro, Yang Xia&lt;/p&gt;

Hypoxia drives aging and promotes age-related cognition and hearing functional decline. Despite the role of erythrocytes in oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) transport, their role in the onset of aging and age-related cognitive decline and hearing loss (HL) remains undetermined. Recent studies revealed that signaling through the erythrocyte adenosine A2B receptor (ADORA2B) promotes O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; release to counteract hypoxia at high altitude. However, nothing is known about a role for erythrocyte ADORA2B in age-related functional decline. Here, we report that loss of murine erythrocyte–specific ADORA2B (e&lt;i&gt;Adora2b&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;) accelerates early onset of age-related impairments in spatial learning, memory, and hearing ability. &lt;i&gt;eAdora2b-/-&lt;/i&gt; mice display the early aging-like cellular and molecular features including the proliferation and activation of microglia and macrophages, elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and attenuation of hypoxia-induced glycolytic gene expression to counteract hypoxia in the hippocampus (HIP), cortex, or cochlea. Hypoxia sufficiently accelerates early onset of cognitive and cochlear functional decline and inflammatory response in e&lt;i&gt;Adora2b&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Mechanistically, erythrocyte ADORA2B-mediated activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and bisphosphoglycerate mutase (BPGM) promotes hypoxic and metabolic reprogramming to enhance production of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG), an erythrocyte-specific metabolite triggering O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; delivery. Significantly, this finding led us to further discover that murine erythroblast ADORA2B and BPGM mRNA levels and erythrocyte BPGM activity are reduced during normal aging. Overall, we determined that erythrocyte ADORA2B–BPGM axis is a key component for anti-aging and anti-age–related functional decline.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/JKRydZnMyQc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Polygenic Risk Score for Alzheimer's Disease in Caribbean Hispanics</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26131?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) assess the individual genetic propensity to a condition by combining sparse information scattered across genetic loci, often displaying small effect sizes. Most PRSs are constructed in European‐ancestry populations, limiting their use in other ethnicities. Here we constructed and validated a PRS for late‐onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD) in Caribbean Hispanics (CH).


Methods
We used a CH discovery (n = 4,312) and independent validation sample (n = 1,850) to construct an ancestry‐specific PRS (“CH‐PRS”) and evaluated its performance alone and with other predictors using the area under curve (AUC) and logistic regression (strength of association with LOAD and statistical significance). We tested if CH‐PRS predicted conversion to LOAD in a subsample with longitudinal data (n = 1,239). We also tested the CH‐PRS in an independent replication CH cohort (n = 200) and brain autopsy cohort (n = 33). Finally, we tested the effect of ancestry on PRS by using European and African American discovery cohorts to construct alternative PRSs (“EUR‐PRS”, “AA‐PRS”).


Results
The full model (LOAD ~ CH‐PRS + sex + age + APOE‐ɛ4), achieved an AUC = 74% (ORCH‐PRS = 1.51 95%CI = 1.36–1.68), raising to &amp;gt;75% in APOE‐ɛ4 non‐carriers. CH‐PRS alone achieved an AUC = 72% in the autopsy cohort, raising to AUC = 83% in full model. Higher CH‐PRS was significantly associated with clinical LOAD in the replication CH cohort (OR = 1.61, 95%CI = 1.19–2.17) and significantly predicted conversion to LOAD (HR = 1.93, CI = 1.70–2.20) in the longitudinal subsample. EUR‐PRS and AA‐PRS reached lower prediction accuracy (AUC = 58% and 53%, respectively).


Interpretation
Enriching diversity in genetic studies is critical to provide an effective PRS in profiling LOAD risk across populations. ANN NEUROL 2021</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Maturation of Heterogeneity in Afferent Synapse Ultrastructure in the Mouse Cochlea</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2021.678575</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Auditory nerve fibers (ANFs) innervating the same inner hair cell (IHC) may have identical frequency tuning but different sound response properties. In cat and guinea pig, ANF response properties correlate with afferent synapse morphology and position on the IHC, suggesting a causal structure-function relationship. In mice, this relationship has not been fully characterized. Here we measured the emergence of synaptic morphological heterogeneities during maturation of the C57BL/6J mouse cochlea by comparing postnatal day 17 (p17, ∼3 days after hearing onset) with p34, when the mouse cochlea is mature. Using serial block face scanning electron microscopy and three-dimensional reconstruction we measured the size, shape, vesicle content, and position of 70 ribbon synapses from the mid-cochlea. Several features matured over late postnatal development. From p17 to p34, presynaptic densities (PDs) and post-synaptic densities (PSDs) became smaller on average (PDs: 0.75 to 0.33; PSDs: 0.58 to 0.31 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and less round as their short axes shortened predominantly on the modiolar side, from 770 to 360 nm. Membrane-associated synaptic vesicles decreased in number from 53 to 30 per synapse from p17 to p34. Anatomical coupling, measured as PSD to ribbon distance, tightened predominantly on the pillar side. Ribbons became less spherical as long-axes lengthened only on the modiolar side of the IHC, from 372 to 541 nm. A decreasing gradient of synaptic ribbon size along the modiolar-pillar axis was detected only at p34 after aligning synapses of adjacent IHCs to a common reference frame (median volumes in nm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;: modiolar 4.87; pillar 2.38). The number of ribbon-associated synaptic vesicles scaled with ribbon size (range 67 to 346 per synapse at p34), thus acquiring a modiolar-pillar gradient at p34, but overall medians were similar at p17 (120) and p34 (127), like ribbon surface area (0.36 vs. 0.34 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). PD and PSD morphologies were tightly correlated to each other at individual synapses, more so at p34 than p17, but not to ribbon morphology. These observations suggest that PDs and PSDs mature according to different cues than ribbons, and that ribbon size may be more influenced by cues from the IHC than the surrounding tissue.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Visualizing Synaptic Multi-Protein Patterns of Neuronal Tissue With DNA-Assisted Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2021.671288</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The development of super-resolution microscopy (SRM) has widened our understanding of biomolecular structure and function in biological materials. Imaging multiple targets within a single area would elucidate their spatial localization relative to the cell matrix and neighboring biomolecules, revealing multi-protein macromolecular structures and their functional co-dependencies. SRM methods are, however, limited to the number of suitable fluorophores that can be imaged during a single acquisition as well as the loss of antigens during antibody washing and restaining for organic dye multiplexing. We report the visualization of multiple protein targets within the pre- and postsynapse in 350–400 nm thick neuronal tissue sections using DNA-assisted single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). In a single labeling step, antibodies conjugated with short DNA oligonucleotides visualized multiple targets by sequential exchange of fluorophore-labeled complementary oligonucleotides present in the imaging buffer. This approach avoids potential effects on structural integrity when using multiple rounds of immunolabeling and eliminates chromatic aberration, because all targets are imaged using a single excitation laser wavelength. This method proved robust for multi-target imaging in semi-thin tissue sections with a lateral resolution better than 25 nm, paving the way toward structural cell biology with single-molecule SRM.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Synaptic Plasticity and Oscillations in Alzheimer’s Disease: A Complex Picture of a Multifaceted Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.696476</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain plasticity is widely accepted as the core neurophysiological basis of memory and is generally defined by activity-dependent changes in synaptic efficacy, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). By using diverse induction protocols like high-frequency stimulation (HFS) or spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), such crucial cognition-relevant plastic processes are shown to be impaired in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In AD, the severity of the cognitive impairment also correlates with the level of disruption of neuronal network dynamics. Currently under debate, the named amyloid hypothesis points to amyloid-beta peptide 1–42 (Aβ42) as the trigger of the functional deviations underlying cognitive impairment in AD. However, there are missing functional mechanistic data that comprehensively dissect the early subtle changes that lead to synaptic dysfunction and subsequent neuronal network collapse in AD. The convergence of the study of both, mechanisms underlying brain plasticity, and neuronal network dynamics, may represent the most efficient approach to address the early triggering and aberrant mechanisms underlying the progressive clinical cognitive impairment in AD. Here we comment on the emerging integrative roles of brain plasticity and network oscillations in AD research and on the future perspectives of research in this field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation of the PHF-1 Epitope of Tau Protein Induce Local Conformational Changes of the C-Terminus and Modulate Tau Self-Assembly Into Fibrillar Aggregates</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.661368</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Phosphorylation of the neuronal microtubule-associated Tau protein plays a critical role in the aggregation process leading to the formation of insoluble intraneuronal fibrils within Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brains. In recent years, other posttranslational modifications (PTMs) have been highlighted in the regulation of Tau (dys)functions. Among these PTMs, the O-β-linked N-acetylglucosaminylation (O-GlcNAcylation) modulates Tau phosphorylation and aggregation. We here focus on the role of the PHF-1 phospho-epitope of Tau C-terminal domain that is hyperphosphorylated in AD (at pS396/pS404) and encompasses S400 as the major O-GlcNAc site of Tau while two additional O-GlcNAc sites were found in the extreme C-terminus at S412 and S413. Using high resolution NMR spectroscopy, we showed that the O-GlcNAc glycosylation reduces phosphorylation of PHF-1 epitope by GSK3β alone or after priming by CDK2/cyclin A. Furthermore, investigations of the impact of PTMs on local conformation performed in small peptides highlight the role of S404 phosphorylation in inducing helical propensity in the region downstream pS404 that is exacerbated by other phosphorylations of PHF-1 epitope at S396 and S400, or O-GlcNAcylation of S400. Finally, the role of phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation of PHF-1 epitope was probed in in-vitro fibrillization assays in which O-GlcNAcylation slows down the rate of fibrillar assembly while GSK3β phosphorylation stimulates aggregation counteracting the effect of glycosylation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Broad Influence of Mutant Ataxin-3 on the Proteome of the Adult Brain, Young Neurons, and Axons Reveals Central Molecular Processes and Biomarkers in SCA3/MJD Using Knock-In Mouse Model</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.658339</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3/MJD) is caused by CAG expansion mutation resulting in a long polyQ domain in mutant ataxin-3. The mutant protein is a special type of protease, deubiquitinase, which may indicate its prominent impact on the regulation of cellular proteins levels and activity. Yet, the global model picture of SCA3 disease progression on the protein level, molecular pathways in the brain, and neurons, is largely unknown. Here, we investigated the molecular SCA3 mechanism using an interdisciplinary research paradigm combining behavioral and molecular aspects of SCA3 in the knock-in ki91 model. We used the behavior, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and brain tissue examination to correlate the disease stages with brain proteomics, precise axonal proteomics, neuronal energy recordings, and labeling of vesicles. We have demonstrated that altered metabolic and mitochondrial proteins in the brain and the lack of weight gain in Ki91 SCA3/MJD mice is reflected by the failure of energy metabolism recorded in neonatal SCA3 cerebellar neurons. We have determined that further, during disease progression, proteins responsible for metabolism, cytoskeletal architecture, vesicular, and axonal transport are disturbed, revealing axons as one of the essential cell compartments in SCA3 pathogenesis. Therefore we focus on SCA3 pathogenesis in axonal and somatodendritic compartments revealing highly increased axonal localization of protein synthesis machinery, including ribosomes, translation factors, and RNA binding proteins, while the level of proteins responsible for cellular transport and mitochondria was decreased. We demonstrate the accumulation of axonal vesicles in neonatal SCA3 cerebellar neurons and increased phosphorylation of SMI-312 positive adult cerebellar axons, which indicate axonal dysfunction in SCA3. In summary, the SCA3 disease mechanism is based on the broad influence of mutant ataxin-3 on the neuronal proteome. Processes central in our SCA3 model include disturbed localization of proteins between axonal and somatodendritic compartment, early neuronal energy deficit, altered neuronal cytoskeletal structure, an overabundance of various components of protein synthesis machinery in axons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: DeepNavNet: Automated Landmark Localization for Neuronavigation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.670287</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Functional neurosurgery requires neuroimaging technologies that enable precise navigation to targeted structures. Insufficient image resolution of deep brain structures necessitates alignment to a brain atlas to indirectly locate targets within preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Indirect targeting through atlas-image registration is innately imprecise, increases preoperative planning time, and requires manual identification of anterior and posterior commissure (AC and PC) reference landmarks which is subject to human error. As such, we created a deep learning-based pipeline that consistently and automatically locates, with submillimeter accuracy, the AC and PC anatomical landmarks within MRI volumes without the need for an atlas. Our novel deep learning pipeline (DeepNavNet) regresses from MRI scans to heatmap volumes centered on AC and PC anatomical landmarks to extract their three-dimensional coordinates with submillimeter accuracy. We collated and manually labeled the location of AC and PC points in 1128 publicly available MRI volumes used for training, validation, and inference experiments. Instantiations of our DeepNavNet architecture, as well as a baseline model for reference, were evaluated based on the average 3D localization errors for the AC and PC points across 311 MRI volumes. Our DeepNavNet model significantly outperformed a baseline and achieved a mean 3D localization error of 0.79 ± 0.33 mm and 0.78 ± 0.33 mm between the ground truth and the detected AC and PC points, respectively. In conclusion, the DeepNavNet model pipeline provides submillimeter accuracy for localizing AC and PC anatomical landmarks in MRI volumes, enabling improved surgical efficiency and accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Identifying Internet Addiction and Evaluating the Efficacy of Treatment Based on Functional Connectivity Density: A Machine Learning Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.665578</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Although mounting neuroimaging studies have greatly improved our understanding of the neurobiological mechanism underlying internet addiction (IA), the results based on traditional group-level comparisons are insufficient in guiding individual clinical practice directly. Specific neuroimaging biomarkers are urgently needed for IA diagnosis and the evaluation of therapy efficacy. Therefore, this study aimed to develop support vector machine (SVM) models to identify IA and assess the efficacy of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) based on unbiased functional connectivity density (FCD). Resting-state fMRI data were acquired from 27 individuals with IA before and after 8-week CBT sessions and 30 demographically matched healthy controls (HCs). The discriminative FCDs were computed as the features of the support vector classification (SVC) model to identify individuals with IA from HCs, and the changes in these discriminative FCDs after treatment were further used as features of the support vector regression (SVR) model to evaluate the efficacy of CBT. Based on the informative FCDs, our SVC model successfully differentiated individuals with IA from HCs with an accuracy of 82.5% and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.91. Our SVR model successfully evaluated the efficacy of CBT using the FCD change ratio with a correlation efficient of 0.59. The brain regions contributing to IA classification and CBT efficacy assessment were the left inferior frontal cortex (IFC), middle frontal cortex (MFC) and angular gyrus (AG), the right premotor cortex (PMC) and middle cingulate cortex (MCC), and the bilateral cerebellum, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and superior frontal cortex (SFC). These findings confirmed the FCDs of hyperactive impulsive habit system, hypoactive reflecting system and sensitive interoceptive reward awareness system as potential neuroimaging biomarkers for IA, which might provide objective indexes for the diagnosis and efficacy evaluation of IA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Changes of Regional Neural Activity Homogeneity in Preclinical Alzheimer’s Disease: Compensation and Dysfunction</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.646414</link>
	<content:encoded>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is the preclinical stage of Alzheimer’s disease and may develop into amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Finding suitable biomarkers is the key to accurately identifying SCD. Previous resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) studies on SCD patients showed functional connectivity disorders. Our goal was to explore whether local neurological homogeneity changes in SCD patients, the relationship between these changes and cognitive function, and similarities of neurological homogeneity changes between SCD and aMCI patients.&lt;/p&gt;Materials and Methods&lt;p&gt;37 cases of the healthy control (HC) group, 39 cases of the SCD group, and 28 cases of the aMCI group were included. Participants underwent rs-fMRI examination and a set of neuropsychological test batteries. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) was calculated and compared between groups. ReHo values were extracted from meaningful regions in the SCD group, and the correlation between ReHo values with the performance of neuropsychological tests was analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Our results showed significant changes in the ReHo among groups. In the SCD group compared with the HC group, part of the parietal lobe, frontal lobe, and occipital lobe showed decreased ReHo, and the temporal lobe, part of the parietal lobe and the frontal lobe showed increased ReHo. The increased area of ReHo was negatively correlated with the decreased area, and was related to decrease on multiple neuropsychological tests performance. Simultaneously, the changed areas of ReHo in SCD patients are similar to aMCI patients, while aMCI group’s neuropsychological test performance was significantly lower than that of the SCD group.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;There are significant changes in local neurological homogeneity in SCD patients, and related to the decline of cognitive function. The increase of neurological homogeneity in the temporal lobe and adjacent area is negatively correlated with cognitive function, reflecting compensation for local neural damage. These changes in local neurological homogeneity in SCD patients are similar to aMCI patients, suggesting similar neuropathy in these two stages. However, the aMCI group’s cognitive function was significantly worse than that of the SCD group, suggesting that this compensation is limited. In summary, regional neural activity homogeneity may be a potential biomarker for identifying SCD and measuring the disease severity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Low-Expressing Synucleinopathy Mouse Models Based on Oligomer-Forming Mutations and C-Terminal Truncation of α-Synuclein</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.643391</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;α-synuclein (αSyn) is the main protein component of Lewy bodies, intracellular inclusions found in the brain of Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients. Neurotoxic αSyn species are broadly modified post-translationally and, in patients with genetic forms of PD, carry genetically encoded amino acid substitutions. Mutations and C-terminal truncation can increase αSyn oligomerization and fibrillization. Although several genetic mouse models based on αSyn mutations and/or truncations exist, there is still a lack of mouse models for synucleinopathies not relying on overexpression. We report here two synucleinopathy mouse models, which are based on a triple alanine to proline mutation and a C-terminal truncation of αSyn, but do not overexpress the mutant protein when compared to the endogenous mouse protein. We knocked hαSyn&lt;sup&gt;TP&lt;/sup&gt; or hαSyn&lt;sup&gt;Δ119&lt;/sup&gt; (h stands for “human”) into the murine αSyn locus. hαSyn&lt;sup&gt;TP&lt;/sup&gt; is a structure-based mutant with triple alanine to proline substitutions that favors oligomers, is neurotoxic and evokes PD-like symptoms in Drosophila melanogaster. hαSyn&lt;sup&gt;Δ119&lt;/sup&gt; lacks 21 amino acids at the C-terminus, favors fibrillary aggregates and occurs in PD. Knocking-in of hαSyn&lt;sup&gt;TP&lt;/sup&gt; or hαSyn&lt;sup&gt;Δ119&lt;/sup&gt; into the murine αSyn locus places the mutant protein under the control of the endogenous regulatory elements while simultaneously disrupting the mαSyn gene. Mass spectrometry revealed that hαSyn&lt;sup&gt;TP&lt;/sup&gt; and hαSyn&lt;sup&gt;Δ119&lt;/sup&gt; mice produced 12 and 10 times less mutant protein, compared to mαSyn in wild type mice. We show phenotypes in 1 and 1.5 years old hαSyn&lt;sup&gt;TP&lt;/sup&gt; and hαSyn&lt;sup&gt;Δ119&lt;/sup&gt; mice, despite the lower levels of hαSyn&lt;sup&gt;TP&lt;/sup&gt; and hαSyn&lt;sup&gt;Δ119&lt;/sup&gt; expression. Direct comparison of the two mouse models revealed many commonalities but also aspects unique to each model. Commonalities included strong immunoactive state, impaired olfaction and motor coordination deficits. Neither model showed DAergic neuronal loss. Impaired climbing abilities at 1 year of age and a deviant gait pattern at 1.5 years old were specific for hαSyn&lt;sup&gt;Δ119&lt;/sup&gt; mice, while a compulsive behavior was exclusively detected in hαSyn&lt;sup&gt;TP&lt;/sup&gt; mice starting at 1 year of age. We conclude that even at very moderate levels of expression the two αSyn variants evoke measurable and progressive deficiencies in mutant mice. The two transgenic mouse models can thus be suitable to study αSyn-variant-based pathology in vivo and test new therapeutic approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Naturalistic stimuli such as movies, music, and spoken and written stories elicit strong emotions and allow brain imaging of emotions in close-to-real-life conditions. Emotions are multi-component phenomena: relevant stimuli lead to automatic changes in multiple functional components including perception, physiology, behavior, and conscious experiences. Brain activity during naturalistic stimuli reflects all these changes, suggesting that parsing emotion-related processing during such complex stimulation is not a straightforward task. Here, I review affective neuroimaging studies that have employed naturalistic stimuli to study emotional processing, focusing especially on experienced emotions. I argue that to investigate emotions with naturalistic stimuli, we need to define and extract emotion features from both the stimulus and the observer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Dual Task Effects on Speed and Accuracy During Cognitive and Upper Limb Motor Tasks in Adults With Stroke Hemiparesis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.671541</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Adults with stroke need to perform cognitive–motor dual tasks during their day-to-day activities. However, they face several challenges owing to their impaired motor and cognitive functions.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;This case-controlled pilot study investigates the speed and accuracy tradeoffs in adults with stroke while performing cognitive–upper limb motor dual tasks.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Ten adults with stroke and seven similar-aged controls participated in this study. The participants used a robotic arm for the single motor task and participated in either the serial sevens (S7) or the controlled oral word association test (COWAT) for single-cognitive task. For the dual task, the participants performed the motor and cognitive components simultaneously. Their speed and accuracy were measured for the motor and cognitive tasks, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Two-sample t-statistics indicated that the participants with stroke exhibited a lower motor accuracy in the cross task than in the circle task. The cognitive speed and motor accuracy registered by the subjects with stroke in the dual task significantly decreased. There was a negative linear correlation between motor speed and accuracy in the subjects with stroke when the COWAT task was performed in conjunction with the cross task (ρ = −0.6922, p = 0.0388).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusions&lt;p&gt;This study proves the existence of cognitive–upper limb motor interference in adults with stroke while performing dual tasks, based on the observation that their performance during one or both dual tasks deteriorated compared to that during the single task. Both speed and accuracy were complementary parameters that may indicate clinical effectiveness in motor and cognitive outcomes in individuals with stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Well-known effects of neurotrophic factors are related to supporting the survival and functioning of various neuronal populations in the body. However, these proteins seem to also play less well-documented roles in glial cells, thus, influencing neuroinflammation. This article summarizes available data on the effects of glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family ligands (GFLs), proteins providing trophic support to dopaminergic, sensory, motor and many other neuronal populations, in non-neuronal cells contributing to the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain. The paper also contains our own limited data describing the effects of small molecules targeting GFL receptors on the expression of the satellite glial marker IBA1 in dorsal root ganglia of rats with surgery- and diabetes-induced neuropathy. In our experiments activation of GFLs receptors with either GFLs or small molecule agonists downregulated the expression of IBA1 in this tissue of experimental animals. While it can be a secondary effect due to a supportive role of GFLs in neuronal cells, growing body of evidence indicates that GFL receptors are expressed in glial and peripheral immune system cells. Thus, targeting GFL receptors with either proteins or small molecules may directly suppress the activation of glial and immune system cells and, therefore, reduce neuroinflammation. As neuroinflammation is considered to be an important contributor to the process of neurodegeneration these data further support research efforts to modulate the activity of GFL receptors in order to develop disease-modifying treatments for neurodegenerative disorders and neuropathic pain that target both neuronal and glial cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Self-Regulation of Cerebral Metabolism and Its Neuroprotective Effect After Hypoxic-Ischemic Injury: Evidence From 1H-MRS</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.672412</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-MRS technology can be used to non-invasively detect the content of cerebral metabolites, to assess the severity of hypoxic-ischemic (HI) injury, and to predict the recovery of compromised neurological function. However, changes to the cerebral self-regulation process after HI are still unclear. This study investigated the changes in cerebral metabolites and the potential relationship with the number of neurons and neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPC) using &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-MRS, and finally clarifies the self-regulation of cerebral metabolism and neuroprotection after HI injury. Newborn Yorkshire pigs (28 males, 1.0–1.5 kg) aged 3–5 days were used for the HI model in this study. The pigs were randomly divided into the HI group (n = 24) and the control group (n = 4), then the experimental group was subdivided according to different recovery time after HI into the following groups: 0–2 h (n = 4), 2–6 h (n = 4), 6–12 h (n = 4), 12–24 h (n = 4), 24–48 h (n = 4), and 48–72 h (n = 4). Following the HI timepoints, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-MRS scans were performed and processed using LCModel software, and brain tissue was immunohistochemically stained for Nestin and NeuN. Immunofluorescence staining of creatine phosphokinase-BB (CK-BB), N-acetylaspartylglutamate synthetase (NAAGS), glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCP-II), glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC), glutathione synthase (GS), and excitatory amino acid carrier 1 (EAAC1) was then performed. The &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-MRS results showed that cerebral N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG), glutathione (GSH), and creatine (Cr) content reached their peaks at 12–24 h, which was consistent with the recovery time of hippocampal NSPCs and neurons, indicating a potential neuroprotective effect of NAAG, GSH, and Cr after HI injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Long-Term Increase in Cholesterol Is Associated With Better Cognitive Function: Evidence From a Longitudinal Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.691423</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Higher visit-to-visit cholesterol has been associated with cognitive decline. However, the association between long-term increase or decrease in cholesterol and cognitive decline remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A total of 4,915 participants aged ≥45 years with normal cognition in baseline were included. The participants were divided into four groups, namely low–low, low–high, high–low, and high–high, according to the diagnostic thresholds of total cholesterol (TC), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (NHDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) after 4 years of follow-up. Cognitive function was assessed by episodic memory and mental intactness. Binary logistic regression was used to analyse the association of cholesterol variation with cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Among the participants, 979 (19.9%) experienced global cognitive decline. The odds ratio (OR) of global cognitive and memory function decline were remarkably lower in participants in the low–high NHDL-C group than those in the low–low group [OR and 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.50 [0.26–0.95] for global cognitive decline, 0.45 [0.25–0.82] for memory function decline]. The lower OR was also significant in females (OR [95% CI]: 0.38 [0.17–0.87] for global cognitive decline; 0.44 [0.19–0.97] for memory function decline) and participants without cardiovascular disease (OR [95% CI]: 0.31 [0.11–0.87] for global cognitive decline; 0.34 [0.14–0.83] for memory function decline). The increases in other cholesterol were also negatively associated with the risk of cognitive decline although not significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: A longitudinal increase in NHDL-C may be protective for cognition in females or individuals without cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Regional Spontaneous Neural Activity Alterations in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Meta-Analysis of Resting-State Functional MRI Studies</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.678359</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) studies have revealed inconsistent regional spontaneous neural activity alterations in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim of our meta-analysis was to identify concordant regional spontaneous neural activity abnormalities in patients with T2DM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A systematic search was conducted to identify voxel-based rs-fMRI studies comparing T2DM patients with healthy controls. The permutation of subject images seed-based d mapping (SDM) was used to quantitatively estimate the regional spontaneous neural activity abnormalities in patients with T2DM. Metaregression was conducted to examine the associations between clinical characteristics and functional alterations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A total of 16 studies with 19 datasets including 434 patients with T2DM and 391 healthy controls were included. Patients with T2DM showed hypoactivity in the right medial superior frontal gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus, and left lingual gyrus, whereas hyperactivity in the right cerebellum. Metaregression analysis identified negative correlation between regional activity in the medial superior frontal and anterior cingulate gyri and illness duration of patients with T2DM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The patterns of regional spontaneous neural activity alterations, characterized by hypoactivity in the medial pre-frontal cortex, visual cortex, and superior temporal gyrus, whereas hyperactivity in the cerebellum, might represent the underlying neuropathological mechanisms of T2DM.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Niacin Enhancement for Parkinson’s Disease: An Effectiveness Trial</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.667032</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We previously reported that individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD) present with lower vitamin B3 levels compared to controls. It may be related to carbidopa interaction, defective tryptophan metabolism, and stresses of night sleep disorder. Vitamin B3 is the energy source for all cells by producing NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in redox reactions of oxidative phosphorylation. Thus, some symptoms of PD such as fatigue, sleep dysfunction, and mood changes may be related to the deficiency of vitamin B3. Here, we conducted an effectiveness trial to determine the effect of 12 months of low-dose niacin (a vitamin B3 derivative) enhancement in PD individuals. An average of 9 ± 6-point improvement in the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) III (motor) score was observed after 12 months of daily niacin compared to the expected decline in score (effect size = 0.78, 95% CI = 7–11). Additionally, secondary outcome measures improved. Notably, handwriting size increased, fatigue perception decreased, mood improved, frontal beta rhythm during quiet stance increased, and stance postural sway amplitude and range of acceleration decreased. Set shifting, however, as measured by the Trail Making-B test, worsened from 66 to 96 s. Other measures did not change after 12 months, but it is not clear whether this represents a positive benefit of the vitamin. For example, while the quality of night sleep remained the same, there was a trend towards a decrease in the frequency of awakening episodes. These results suggest that niacin enhancement has the potential to maintain or improve quality of life in PD and slow disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Prognostic Factors in COVID-19 Patients With New Neurological Manifestations: A Retrospective Cohort Study in a Romanian Neurology Department</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.645611</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: The emerging Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a serious public health issue due to its rapid spreading, high mortality rate and lack of specific treatment. Given its unpredictable clinical course, risk assessment, and stratification for severity of COVID-19 are required. Apart from serving as admission criteria, prognostic factors might guide future therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aim: We aimed to compare clinical features and biological parameters between elderly (age ≥ 65 years) and non-elderly (age &amp;lt;65 years) patients with COVID-19 and new neurological symptoms/conditions. We also aimed to determine factors independently associated with all-cause in-hospital mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: All consecutive patients with COVID-19 and new neurological symptoms/conditions admitted in our Neurology Department between April 1 and August 23, 2020 were enrolled in this observational retrospective cohort study. Patient characteristics such as demographic data, comorbidities, biological parameters, imaging findings and clinical course were recorded. All-cause in-hospital mortality was the main outcome, whereas COVID-19 severity, hospitalization duration and the levels of supplemental oxygen were the secondary outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: One hundred forty-eight patients were included, out of which 54.1% were women. The average age was 59.84 ± 19.06 years and 47.3% were elderly, the majority having cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities. In the elderly group, the most frequent neurological symptoms/manifestations responsible for hospitalization were stroke symptoms followed by confusion, whereas in the non-elderly, headache prevailed. The final neurological diagnosis significantly varied between the two groups, with acute cerebrovascular events and acute confusional state in dementia most commonly encountered in the elderly (65.71 and 14.28%, respectively) and secondary headache attributed to SARS-CoV-2 infection often experienced by the non-elderly (38.46%). The elderly had statistically significant higher median values of white blood cell (8,060 vs. 6,090/μL) and neutrophil count (6,060 vs. 4,125/μL), C-reactive protein (29.2 vs. 5.72 mg/L), ferritin (482 vs. 187 mg/dL), fibrinogen (477 vs. 374 mg/dL), D-dimer (1.16 vs. 0.42), prothrombin time (151.15 vs. 13.8/s), aspartate transaminase (26.8 vs. 20.8 U/l), creatinine (0.96 vs. 0.77 mg/dL), and blood urea nitrogen level (51.1 vs. 27.65 mg/dL), as well as lower median value of hemoglobin (13.05 vs. 13.9 g/dL) and lymphocyte count (1,245 vs. 1,670/μL). Moreover, advanced age was significantly associated with more extensive lung involvement (25 vs. 10%) and higher fatality rate (40 vs. 9%). Overall, the mortality rate was 23.6%. Age as well as neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and activated partial thromboplastin time levels were independently associated with mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Older age, higher neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and activated partial thromboplastin time levels are independent predictors of mortality in COVID-19 patients with new neurological manifestations/conditions at admission.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/69619</link>
	<content:encoded>Human bromodomain-containing BET family members are promising targets for therapy of cancer and immunoinflammatory diseases, but their mechanisms of action and functional redundancies are poorly understood. Bdf1/2, yeast homologues of the human BET factors, were previously proposed to target transcription factor TFIID to acetylated histone H4, analogous to bromodomains that are present within the largest subunit of metazoan TFIID. We investigated the genome-wide roles of Bdf1/2 and found that their important contributions to transcription extend beyond TFIID function, as transcription of many genes is more sensitive to Bdf1/2 than to TFIID depletion. Bdf1/2 co-occupy the majority of yeast promoters and affect preinitiation complex formation through recruitment of TFIID, Mediator and basal transcription factors to chromatin. Surprisingly, we discovered that hypersensitivity of genes to Bdf1/2 depletion results from combined defects in transcription initiation and early elongation, a striking functional similarity to human BET proteins, most notably Brd4. Our results establish Bdf1/2 as critical for yeast transcription and provide important mechanistic insights into the function of BET proteins in all eukaryotes.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: A signal capture and proofreading mechanism for the KDEL-receptor explains selectivity and dynamic range in ER retrieval</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/68380</link>
	<content:encoded>ER proteins of widely differing abundance are retrieved from the Golgi by the KDEL-receptor. Abundant ER proteins tend to have KDEL rather than HDEL signals, whereas ADEL and DDEL are not used in most organisms. Here, we explore the mechanism of selective retrieval signal capture by the KDEL-receptor and how HDEL binds with ten-fold higher affinity than KDEL. Our results show the carboxyl-terminus of the retrieval signal moves along a ladder of arginine residues as it enters the binding pocket of the receptor. Gatekeeper residues D50 and E117 at the entrance of this pocket exclude ADEL and DDEL sequences. D50N/E117Q mutation of human KDEL-receptors changes the selectivity to ADEL and DDEL. However, further analysis of HDEL, KDEL and RDEL-bound receptor structures shows that affinity differences are explained by interactions between the variable -4 H/K/R position of the signal and W120, rather than D50 or E117. Together, these findings explain KDEL-receptor selectivity, and how signal variants increase dynamic range to support efficient ER retrieval of low and high abundance proteins.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>We generated homozygous mice that have a base pair missense mutation (208T &amp;gt; C) (Cdh23erl2/erl2) and a single base pair deletion (235G) (Cdh23V2J2/V2J2) in the Cdh23 gene at exon 5 on the CBA/CaJ background using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. The two mutant mice exhibit hearing impairment involving a broad frequency range. In addition, Cdh23V2J2/V2J2 mice show signs of vestibular dysfunction in open field behavior and swimming tests. Our results suggest an interaction between the erl locus and the C57BL/6J background, which exacerbates hearing loss in Cdh23erl/erl mice. Moreover, our study confirms that the Cdh23 gene is essential for normal hearing and balance.

Abstract
Different mutations in the cadherin 23 (CDH23) gene in different genetic backgrounds have been linked to either syndromic or nonsyndromic forms of deafness in humans. We previously reported a progressive hearing loss (HL) mouse model, the Cdh23erl/erl mouse, which carries a 208T &amp;gt; C mutation causing an amino acid substitution at S70P in C57BL/6J mice. To investigate the differences in Cdh23 mutation‐related HL in different genetic backgrounds, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate homozygous mice in the CBA/CaJ background that have the same base pair missense mutation (208T &amp;gt; C) (Cdh23erl2/erl2) as Cdh23erl/erl mice in the C57BL/6J background or a single base pair deletion (235G) (Cdh23V2J2/V2J2) in the Cdh23 gene at exon 5. The two mutant mice exhibit hearing impairment across a broad range of frequencies. The progression of HL in Cdh23erl2/erl2 mice is slower than that in Cdh23erl/erl mice. We also found structural abnormalities in the stereocilia of cochlear hair cells in Cdh23erl2/erl2 and Cdh23V2J2/V2J2 mice. Cdh23V2J2/V2J2 mice show signs of vestibular dysfunction in open field behavior and swimming tests. In addition, we observed hair bundle defects in vestibular hair cells in Cdh23V2J2/V2J2 mice. Our results suggest an interaction between the erl locus and the C57BL/6J background that exacerbates HL in Cdh23erl/erl mice. Moreover, our study confirms that the Cdh23 gene is essential for normal hearing and balance. These two novel mutant mouse strains provide excellent models for studying CDH23 mutation‐related deafness in humans.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The study reviews research regarding sex differences in the long‐term behavioral and cognitive outcomes of preterm children, discussing the role of several potential mediators. Original data on healthy preterm adolescents who were administered visuo‐spatial tasks support female disadvantage in the visuo‐cognitive domain.

Abstract
This article presents a revision of the literature regarding the influence of sex differences on the recovery and long‐term behavioral and cognitive outcomes of preterm children. After initial discussion of some methodological concerns, the literature regarding the concept of “male disadvantage,” which is often used when talking about early neurological and psychomotor outcomes in preterm children, is presented. Subsequently, the literature data on sex‐related differences in preterm children are discussed, focusing on their influence on the developmental pathways of cognition, language, executive function, behavior and affect, and response to rehabilitation therapies. Finally, evidence about brain structural and connectivity correlates of sex differences in the brain of preterm survivors is taken into account. Although visuo‐spatial and visuo‐perceptual functioning is widely studied in the preterm child and is strongly sex specific, little to no data are available regarding male–female differences in preterm children and the interaction effect between sex and preterm birth. For this reason, original data analyses of male–female differences in visuo‐spatial performance from a small sample of preterm children are also presented.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Our analyses revealed lower concentration of NAA in the left DLPFC in participants with SHE compared with controls. These findings shed light on some of the neurobiochemical mechanisms of SHE and enrich our knowledge about MRI‐negative SHE patients.

Abstract
Sleep‐related hypermotor epilepsy (SHE) is a focal epilepsy whose neurobiological underpinnings remain poorly understood. The present study aimed to identify possible neurochemical alterations in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in participants with SHE using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS). Thirty‐nine participants with SHE (mean age, 30.7 years ± 11.3 [standard deviation], 24 men) and 59 controls (mean age, 29.4 years ± 10.4, 29 men) were consecutively and prospectively recruited and underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging and 1H MRS in the bilateral DLPFCs. Brain concentrations of metabolites, including N‐acetyl aspartate (NAA), myo‐inositol (mI), choline, creatine, the sum of glutamate and glutamine, glutathione (GSH) and γ‐aminobutyric acid, were estimated with LCModel and corrected for the partial volume effect of cerebrospinal fluid using tissue segmentation. ANCOVA analyses revealed lower concentration of NAA in the left DLPFC in participants with SHE compared with controls. A significant difference of NAA concentration between DLPFC in the two hemispheres (left &amp;gt; right) was observed only in the control group. We further confirmed a higher GSH concentration in men than in women in SHE participants, which probably indicates that men are more susceptible to this disease. The mI concentration in the right DLPFC was negatively correlated with epilepsy duration. This study demonstrates that DLPFC is an important brain region involved in the pathophysiology of SHE, in which both neurons and astrocytes appear impaired, and the elevated GSH level may suggest an abnormality related to oxidative stress.</content:encoded>

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. Synaptic dysfunction is an established early symptom, which correlates strongly with cognitive decline, and is hypothesised to mediate the diverse neuronal network abnormalities observed in AD. However, how synaptic dysfunction contributes to network pathology and cognitive impairment in AD remains elusive. Here, we present a grid-cell-to-place-cell transformation model of long-term CA1 place cell dynamics to interrogate the effect of synaptic loss on network function and environmental representation. Synapse loss modelled after experimental observations in the APP/PS1 mouse model was found to induce firing rate alterations and place cell abnormalities that have previously been observed in AD mouse models, including enlarged place fields and lower across-session stability of place fields. Our results support the hypothesis that synaptic dysfunction underlies cognitive deficits, and demonstrate how impaired environmental representation may arise in the early stages of AD. We further propose that dysfunction of excitatory and inhibitory inputs to CA1 pyramidal cells may cause distinct impairments in place cell function, namely reduced stability and place map resolution.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TTutxNiPYhY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

We describe an approach for integrating distance restraints from Double Electron-Electron Resonance (DEER) spectroscopy into Rosetta with the purpose of modeling alternative protein conformations from an initial experimental structure. Fundamental to this approach is a multilateration algorithm that harnesses sets of interconnected spin label pairs to identify optimal rotamer ensembles at each residue that fit the DEER decay in the time domain. Benchmarked relative to data analysis packages, the algorithm yields comparable distance distributions with the advantage that fitting the DEER decay and rotamer ensemble optimization are coupled. We demonstrate this approach by modeling the protonation-dependent transition of the multidrug transporter PfMATE to an inward facing conformation with a deviation to the experimental structure of less than 2Å C&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; RMSD. By decreasing spin label rotamer entropy, this approach engenders more accurate Rosetta models that are also more closely clustered, thus setting the stage for more robust modeling of protein conformational changes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/92OznlMzWTY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: A network modelling approach to assess non-pharmaceutical disease controls in a worker population: An application to SARS-CoV-2</title>

As part of a concerted pandemic response to protect public health, businesses can enact non-pharmaceutical controls to minimise exposure to pathogens in workplaces and premises open to the public. Amendments to working practices can lead to the amount, duration and/or proximity of interactions being changed, ultimately altering the dynamics of disease spread. These modifications could be specific to the type of business being operated. We use a data-driven approach to parameterise an individual-based network model for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 amongst the working population, stratified into work sectors. The network is comprised of layered contacts to consider the risk of spread in multiple encounter settings (workplaces, households, social and other). We analyse several interventions targeted towards working practices: mandating a fraction of the population to work from home; using temporally asynchronous work patterns; and introducing measures to create ‘COVID-secure’ workplaces. We also assess the general role of adherence to (or effectiveness of) isolation and test and trace measures and demonstrate the impact of all these interventions across a variety of relevant metrics. The progress of the epidemic can be significantly hindered by instructing a significant proportion of the workforce to work from home. Furthermore, if required to be present at the workplace, asynchronous work patterns can help to reduce infections when compared with scenarios where all workers work on the same days, particularly for longer working weeks. When assessing COVID-secure workplace measures, we found that smaller work teams and a greater reduction in transmission risk reduced the probability of large, prolonged outbreaks. Finally, following isolation guidance and engaging with contact tracing without other measures is an effective tool to curb transmission, but is highly sensitive to adherence levels. In the absence of sufficient adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions, our results indicate a high likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 spreading widely throughout a worker population. Given the heterogeneity of demographic attributes across worker roles, in addition to the individual nature of controls such as contact tracing, we demonstrate the utility of a network model approach to investigate workplace-targeted intervention strategies and the role of test, trace and isolation in tackling disease spread.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ew1J7OITDFc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Three-dimensional topology optimization model to simulate the external shapes of bone</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/1KwC2dsWD7s/article</link>

Elucidation of the mechanism by which the shape of bones is formed is essential for understanding vertebrate development. Bones support the body of vertebrates by withstanding external loads, such as those imposed by gravity and muscle tension. Many studies have reported that bone formation varies in response to external loads. An increased external load induces bone synthesis, whereas a decreased external load induces bone resorption. This relationship led to the hypothesis that bone shape adapts to external load. In fact, by simulating this relationship through topology optimization, the internal trabecular structure of bones can be successfully reproduced, thereby facilitating the study of bone diseases. In contrast, there have been few attempts to simulate the external structure of bones, which determines vertebrate morphology. However, the external shape of bones may be reproduced through topology optimization because cells of the same type form both the internal and external structures of bones. Here, we constructed a three-dimensional topology optimization model to attempt the reproduction of the external shape of teleost vertebrae. In teleosts, the internal structure of the vertebral bodies is invariable, exhibiting an hourglass shape, whereas the lateral structure supporting the internal structure differs among species. Based on the anatomical observations, we applied different external loads to the hourglass-shaped part. The simulations produced a variety of three-dimensional structures, some of which exhibited several structural features similar to those of actual teleost vertebrae. In addition, by adjusting the geometric parameters, such as the width of the hourglass shape, we reproduced the variation in the teleost vertebrae shapes. These results suggest that a simulation using topology optimization can successfully reproduce the external shapes of teleost vertebrae. By applying our topology optimization model to various bones of vertebrates, we can understand how the external shape of bones adapts to external loads.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1KwC2dsWD7s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Ten simple rules for making a vocabulary FAIR</title>

We present ten simple rules that support converting a legacy vocabulary—a list of terms available in a print-based glossary or in a table not accessible using web standards—into a FAIR vocabulary. Various pathways may be followed to publish the FAIR vocabulary, but we emphasise particularly the goal of providing a globally unique resolvable identifier for each term or concept. A standard representation of the concept should be returned when the individual web identifier is resolved, using SKOS or OWL serialised in an RDF-based representation for machine-interchange and in a web-page for human consumption. Guidelines for vocabulary and term metadata are provided, as well as development and maintenance considerations. The rules are arranged as a stepwise recipe for creating a FAIR vocabulary based on the legacy vocabulary. By following these rules you can achieve the outcome of converting a legacy vocabulary into a standalone FAIR vocabulary, which can be used for unambiguous data annotation. In turn, this increases data interoperability and enables data integration.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v57TH_5xTuQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Numerical evaluation reveals the effect of branching morphology on vessel transport properties during angiogenesis</title>

Blood flow governs transport of oxygen and nutrients into tissues. Hypoxic tissues secrete VEGFs to promote angiogenesis during development and in tissue homeostasis. In contrast, tumors enhance pathologic angiogenesis during growth and metastasis, suggesting suppression of tumor angiogenesis could limit tumor growth. In line with these observations, various factors have been identified to control vessel formation in the last decades. However, their impact on the vascular transport properties of oxygen remain elusive. Here, we take a computational approach to examine the effects of vascular branching on blood flow in the growing vasculature. First of all, we reconstruct a 3D vascular model from the 2D confocal images of the growing vasculature at postnatal day 5 (P5) mouse retina, then simulate blood flow in the vasculatures, which are obtained from the gene targeting mouse models causing hypo- or hyper-branching vascular formation. Interestingly, hyper-branching morphology attenuates effective blood flow at the angiogenic front, likely promoting tissue hypoxia. In contrast, vascular hypo-branching enhances blood supply at the angiogenic front of the growing vasculature. Oxygen supply by newly formed blood vessels improves local hypoxia and decreases VEGF expression at the angiogenic front during angiogenesis. Consistent with the simulation results indicating improved blood flow in the hypo-branching vasculature, VEGF expression around the angiogenic front is reduced in those mouse retinas. Conversely, VEGF expression is enhanced in the angiogenic front of hyper-branching vasculature. Our results indicate the importance of detailed flow analysis in evaluating the vascular transport properties of branching morphology of the blood vessels.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_KLELEfXE_8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Neuronal selectivity to complex vocalization features emerges in the superficial layers of primary auditory cortex</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/_owryd6p9aM/article</link>

Early in auditory processing, neural responses faithfully reflect acoustic input. At higher stages of auditory processing, however, neurons become selective for particular call types, eventually leading to specialized regions of cortex that preferentially process calls at the highest auditory processing stages. We previously proposed that an intermediate step in how nonselective responses are transformed into call-selective responses is the detection of informative call features. But how neural selectivity for informative call features emerges from nonselective inputs, whether feature selectivity gradually emerges over the processing hierarchy, and how stimulus information is represented in nonselective and feature-selective populations remain open question. In this study, using unanesthetized guinea pigs (GPs), a highly vocal and social rodent, as an animal model, we characterized the neural representation of calls in 3 auditory processing stages—the thalamus (ventral medial geniculate body (vMGB)), and thalamorecipient (L4) and superficial layers (L2/3) of primary auditory cortex (A1). We found that neurons in vMGB and A1 L4 did not exhibit call-selective responses and responded throughout the call durations. However, A1 L2/3 neurons showed high call selectivity with about a third of neurons responding to only 1 or 2 call types. These A1 L2/3 neurons only responded to restricted portions of calls suggesting that they were highly selective for call features. Receptive fields of these A1 L2/3 neurons showed complex spectrotemporal structures that could underlie their high call feature selectivity. Information theoretic analysis revealed that in A1 L4, stimulus information was distributed over the population and was spread out over the call durations. In contrast, in A1 L2/3, individual neurons showed brief bursts of high stimulus-specific information and conveyed high levels of information per spike. These data demonstrate that a transformation in the neural representation of calls occurs between A1 L4 and A1 L2/3, leading to the emergence of a feature-based representation of calls in A1 L2/3. Our data thus suggest that observed cortical specializations for call processing emerge in A1 and set the stage for further mechanistic studies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/_owryd6p9aM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Some implications of postnatal hippocampal development</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23369?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
It is well established that in most species, the hippocampus shows extensive postnatal development. This delayed maturation has a number of implications, which can be thought of in three categories. First, the late maturation has the direct effect of depriving the developing organism of at least some of the functions of the hippocampus, in particular place learning, context coding and in humans, episodic memory. Second, such learning that does occur very early in life, prior to hippocampal maturation, will largely bear the imprint and properties of those brain systems that, unlike the hippocampus, are fully functional early in life. Third, the active state of development of hippocampus in the first weeks and months of life render this structure susceptible to disruption by environmental and/or chromosomal factors. In this article, I discuss my efforts, with many colleagues over the past 40 years, to understand each of these implications.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: The emergent relationship between temporoparietal junction and anosognosia in Alzheimer's disease</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24904?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Anosognosia and impairment of insight are characteristic features of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which can lead to delays in appropriate medical care and significant family discord. The default mode network (DMN), a distributed but highly connected network of brain regions more active during rest than during task, is integrally involved in awareness. DMN dysfunction is common in AD, and disrupted communication between memory‐related and self‐related DMN networks is associated with anosognosia in AD patients. In addition, the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) is a key region of the “social brain” and also contributes to representations of the self. The exact classification of the TPJ within the DMN is unclear, though connections between the TPJ and DMN have been highlighted in multiple avenues of research. Here we discuss the relationship between the TPJ, DMN, and AD, as well as the potential involvement of the TPJ in anosognosia in AD. We review past and present findings to raise attention to the TPJ, with a specific emphasis on neuroimaging technologies which suggest a pivotal role of the TPJ within large‐scale brain networks linked to anosognosia in AD.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Loss of BAF Complex in Developing Cortex Perturbs Radial Neuronal Migration in a WNT Signaling-Dependent Manner</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.687581</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Radial neuronal migration is a key neurodevelopmental event indispensable for proper cortical laminar organization. Cortical neurons mainly use glial fiber guides, cell adhesion dynamics, and cytoskeletal remodeling, among other discrete processes, to radially trek from their birthplace to final layer positions. Dysregulated radial migration can engender cortical mis-lamination, leading to neurodevelopmental disorders. Epigenetic factors, including chromatin remodelers have emerged as formidable regulators of corticogenesis. Notably, the chromatin remodeler BAF complex has been shown to regulate several aspects of cortical histogenesis. Nonetheless, our understanding of how BAF complex regulates neuronal migration is limited. Here, we report that BAF complex is required for neuron migration during cortical development. Ablation of BAF complex in the developing mouse cortex caused alteration in the cortical gene expression program, leading to loss of radial migration-related factors critical for proper cortical layer formation. Of note, BAF complex inactivation in cortex caused defective neuronal polarization resulting in diminished multipolar-to-bipolar transition and eventual disruption of radial migration of cortical neurons. The abnormal radial migration and cortical mis-lamination can be partly rescued by downregulating WNT signaling hyperactivity in the BAF complex mutant cortex. By implication, the BAF complex modulates WNT signaling to establish the gene expression program required for glial fiber-dependent neuronal migration, and cortical lamination. Overall, BAF complex has been identified to be crucial for cortical morphogenesis through instructing multiple aspects of radial neuronal migration in a WNT signaling-dependent manner.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.682247</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles which significantly affects people’s life quality. Recently, AD has been found to be closely related to autophagy. The aim of this study was to identify autophagy-related genes associated with the pathogenesis of AD from multiple types of microarray and sequencing datasets using bioinformatics methods and to investigate their role in the pathogenesis of AD in order to identify novel strategies to prevent and treat AD. Our results showed that the autophagy-related genes were significantly downregulated in AD and correlated with the pathological progression. Furthermore, enrichment analysis showed that these autophagy-related genes were regulated by the transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2A (MEF2A), which had been confirmed using si-MEF2A. Moreover, the single-cell sequencing data suggested that MEF2A was highly expressed in microglia. Methylation microarray analysis showed that the methylation level of the enhancer region of MEF2A in AD was significantly increased. In conclusion, our results suggest that AD related to the increased methylation level of MEF2A enhancer reduces the expression of MEF2A and downregulates the expression of autophagy-related genes which are closely associated with AD pathogenesis, thereby inhibiting autophagy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Altered Functional Connectivity of Insular Subregions in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.676624</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Diabetes-related brain damage can lead to cognitive decline and increase the risk of depression, but the neuropathological mechanism of this phenomenon remains unclear. Different insular subregions have obvious functional heterogeneity, which is related to many aspects of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)-related brain damage. However, little is known about changes in functional connectivity (FC) in insular subregions in patients with T2DM. Therefore, we aimed to investigate FC between different insular subregions and clinical/cognitive variables in patients with T2DM. Fifty-seven patients with T2DM and 55 healthy controls (HCs) underwent a neuropsychological assessment and resting-state FC examination. We defined three insular subregions, including the bilateral dorsal anterior insula (dAI), bilateral ventral anterior insula (vAI), and bilateral posterior insula (PI). We examined differences in FC between insular subregions and the whole brain in patients with T2DM compared with HCs. A correlation analysis was performed to examine the relationship between FC and clinical/cognitive variables. Compared with HCs, patients with T2DM showed significantly decreased FC between the dAI and the right inferior frontal gyrus, right superior/middle temporal gyrus, right hippocampus, and right precentral gyrus. FC between the vAI and the right supramarginal gyrus, as well as the PI and the right precentral/postcentral gyrus, was reduced in the T2DM group compared with the control group. In the T2DM group, we showed a significant negative correlation between glycated hemoglobin concentration and FC in the dAI and right hippocampus (r = −0.428, P = 0.001) after Bonferroni correction. We conclude that different insular subregions present distinct FC patterns with functional regions and that abnormal FC in these insular subregions may affect cognitive, emotional, and sensorimotor functions in patients with T2DM.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Reassessment of Pioglitazone for Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.666958</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is a quintessential ‘unmet medical need’, accounting for ∼65% of progressive cognitive impairment among the elderly, and 700,000 deaths in the United States in 2020. In 2019, the cost of caring for Alzheimer’s sufferers was $244B, not including the emotional and physical toll on caregivers. In spite of this dismal reality, no treatments are available that reduce the risk of developing AD or that offer prolonged mitiagation of its most devestating symptoms. This review summarizes key aspects of the biology and genetics of Alzheimer’s disease, and we describe how pioglitazone improves many of the patholophysiological determinants of AD. We also summarize the results of pre-clinical experiments, longitudinal observational studies, and clinical trials. The results of animal testing suggest that pioglitazone can be corrective as well as protective, and that its efficacy is enhanced in a time- and dose-dependent manner, but the dose-effect relations are not monotonic or sigmoid. Longitudinal cohort studies suggests that it delays the onset of dementia in individuals with pre-existing type 2 diabetes mellitus, which small scale, unblinded pilot studies seem to confirm. However, the results of placebo-controlled, blinded clinical trials have not borne this out, and we discuss possible explanations for these discrepancies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Multi-Channel 4D Parametrized Atlas of Macro- and Microstructural Neonatal Brain Development</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.661704</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Structural (also known as anatomical) and diffusion MRI provide complimentary anatomical and microstructural characterization of early brain maturation. However, the existing models of the developing brain in time include only either structural or diffusion MRI channels. Furthermore, there is a lack of tools for combined analysis of structural and diffusion MRI in the same reference space. In this work, we propose a methodology to generate a multi-channel (MC) continuous spatio-temporal parametrized atlas of the brain development that combines multiple MRI-derived parameters in the same anatomical space during 37–44 weeks of postmenstrual age range. We co-align structural and diffusion MRI of 170 normal term subjects from the developing Human Connectomme Project using MC registration driven by both T2-weighted and orientation distribution functions channels and fit the Gompertz model to the signals and spatial transformations in time. The resulting atlas consists of 14 spatio-temporal microstructural indices and two parcellation maps delineating white matter tracts and neonatal transient structures. In order to demonstrate applicability of the atlas for quantitative region-specific studies, a comparison analysis of 140 term and 40 preterm subjects scanned at the term-equivalent age is performed using different MRI-derived microstructural indices in the atlas reference space for multiple white matter regions, including the transient compartments. The atlas and software will be available after publication of the article&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Fast and High-Resolution Neonatal Brain MRI Through Super-Resolution Reconstruction From Acquisitions With Variable Slice Selection Direction</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.636268</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The brain of neonates is small in comparison to adults. Imaging at typical resolutions such as one cubic mm incurs more partial voluming artifacts in a neonate than in an adult. The interpretation and analysis of MRI of the neonatal brain benefit from a reduction in partial volume averaging that can be achieved with high spatial resolution. Unfortunately, direct acquisition of high spatial resolution MRI is slow, which increases the potential for motion artifact, and suffers from reduced signal-to-noise ratio. The purpose of this study is thus that using super-resolution reconstruction in conjunction with fast imaging protocols to construct neonatal brain MRI images at a suitable signal-to-noise ratio and with higher spatial resolution than can be practically obtained by direct Fourier encoding. We achieved high quality brain MRI at a spatial resolution of isotropic 0.4 mm with 6 min of imaging time, using super-resolution reconstruction from three short duration scans with variable directions of slice selection. Motion compensation was achieved by aligning the three short duration scans together. We applied this technique to 20 newborns and assessed the quality of the images we reconstructed. Experiments show that our approach to super-resolution reconstruction achieved considerable improvement in spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio, while, in parallel, substantially reduced scan times, as compared to direct high-resolution acquisitions. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach allowed for fast and high-quality neonatal brain MRI for both scientific research and clinical studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Metabolic waste clearance is essential to maintain body homeostasis, in which the lymphatic system plays a vital role. Conversely, in recent years, studies have identified the glial–lymphatic system in the brain, which primarily comprises the inflow of fluid along the para-arterial space. Aquaporin-4 mediates the convection of interstitial fluid in the brain and outflow along the paravenous space. β-Amyloid deposition is a characteristic pathological change in Alzheimer’s disease, and some studies have found that the glial–lymphatic system plays an important role in its clearance. Thus, the glial–lymphatic system may influence Alzheimer’s disease severity and outcome; therefore, this review summarizes the current and available research on the glial–lymphatic system and Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurogenesis: Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis and Affective Disorders: New Neurons for Psychic Well-Being</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.594448</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A paradigm shift in neuroscience was the discovery that new neurons are constantly produced in the adult mammalian brain of several species, including Homo sapiens. These new-born cells are formed in some main neurogenic niches, including the subventricular zone (SVZ) at the margin of the lateral ventricle and subgranular zone (SGZ) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). In the DG, neuroblasts derive from SGZ progenitors and migrate to the hippocampal granular layer becoming adult granule cells, which are integrated into functional adult circuits. It has been confirmed that adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) is a long-lasting phenomenon in the human brain. The functions of hippocampal new-born cells are not fully established. Experimental studies suggest that they have unique electrophysiological properties, including hyperexcitability, which enable them to regulate adult granule cells. Their specific function depends on the anatomical hippocampal location along the hippocampal dorsal-ventral axis. Dorsal hippocampus plays a more defined role on spatial learning and contextual information, while the ventral hippocampus is more related to emotional behavior, stress resilience and social interaction. Several reports suggest a role for AHN in pattern separation, cognitive flexibility, forgetting and reversal learning. It has been proposed that deficits in AHN might impair normal DG function, including pattern separation and cognitive flexibility, which could play a role on the etiology of affective disorders, such as depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In this paper, we review recent scientific evidence suggesting that impairment of AHN may underlie the pathophysiology of affective disorders even in humans and that neurogenesis-inspired therapies may be a promising approach to reduce symptoms of affective disorders in humans.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.680295</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objectives: To evaluate the value of fast ripples (FRs) (200–500 Hz) recorded with stereo-electroencephalograph (SEEG) in the localization of epileptogenic tubers in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Seventeen TSC patients who underwent preoperative SEEG examination and resective epilepsy surgery were retrospectively enrolled. They were divided into two groups according to the seizure control at 1-year postoperative follow-up. The occurrence frequencies of FRs were automatically counted, and the FR rate was calculated. The high FR rate was defined as FR rate ≧0.5. According to different positions, the contacts’ locations were divided into three groups: inner of the tubers, the junction region of the tubers, and out of the tubers. The influence factors of postoperative seizure freedom were also analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Twelve patients reached postoperative seizure freedom at 1-year follow-up. In total, FRs were found in 24.2% of the contacts and 67.1% of the tubers in all assessed patients. There were 47 high FR rate contacts localized in the junction region of the tubers, which was 62.7% of the 75 high FR rate contacts in total and was 8.4% of the total 561 contacts localized in the junction region of the tubers. Total removal of epileptogenic tubers and total resection of the high FR rate tubers/contacts were associated with postoperative seizure freedom (P &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: FRs could be extensively detected in TSC patients using SEEG, and high FR rate contacts were mostly localized in the junction region of the epileptogenic tuber, which could aid in the localization of epileptogenic tubers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Double Two-State Opsin Model With Autonomous Parameter Inference</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.688331</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Optogenetics has a lot of potential to become an effective neuromodulative therapy for clinical applications. Selecting the correct opsin is crucial to have an optimal optogenetic tool. With computational modeling, the neuronal response to the current dynamics of an opsin can be extensively and systematically tested. Unlike electrical stimulation where the effect is directly defined by the applied field, the stimulation in optogenetics is indirect, depending on the selected opsin's non-linear kinetics. With the continuous expansion of opsin possibilities, computational studies are difficult due to the need for an accurate model of the selected opsin first. To this end, we propose a double two-state opsin model as alternative to the conventional three and four state Markov models used for opsin modeling. Furthermore, we provide a fitting procedure, which allows for autonomous model fitting starting from a vast parameter space. With this procedure, we successfully fitted two distinctive opsins (ChR2(H134R) and MerMAID). Both models are able to represent the experimental data with great accuracy and were obtained within an acceptable time frame. This is due to the absence of differential equations in the fitting procedure, with an enormous reduction in computational cost as result. The performance of the proposed model with a fit to ChR2(H134R) was tested, by comparing the neural response in a regular spiking neuron to the response obtained with the non-instantaneous, four state Markov model (4SB), derived by Williams et al. (2013). Finally, a computational speed gain was observed with the proposed model in a regular spiking and sparse Pyramidal-Interneuron-Network-Gamma (sPING) network simulation with respect to the 4SB-model, due to the former having two differential equations less. Consequently, the proposed model allows for computationally efficient optogenetic neurostimulation and with the proposed fitting procedure will be valuable for further research in the field of optogenetics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Calcineurin Participation in Hebbian and Homeostatic Plasticity Associated With Extinction</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.685838</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In nature, animals need to adapt to constant changes in their environment. Learning and memory are cognitive capabilities that allow this to happen. Extinction, the reduction of a certain behavior or learning previously established, refers to a very particular and interesting type of learning that has been the basis of a series of therapies to diminish non-adaptive behaviors. In recent years, the exploration of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this type of learning has received increasing attention. Hebbian plasticity (the activity-dependent modification of the strength or efficacy of synaptic transmission), and homeostatic plasticity (the homeostatic regulation of plasticity) constitute processes intimately associated with memory formation and maintenance. Particularly, long-term depression (LTD) has been proposed as the underlying mechanism of extinction, while the protein phosphatase calcineurin (CaN) has been widely related to both the extinction process and LTD. In this review, we focus on the available evidence that sustains CaN modulation of LTD and its association with extinction. Beyond the classic view, we also examine the interconnection among extinction, Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity, as well as emergent evidence of the participation of kinases and long-term potentiation (LTP) on extinction learning, highlighting the importance of the balance between kinases and phosphatases in the expression of extinction. Finally, we also integrate data that shows the association between extinction and less-studied phenomena, such as synaptic silencing and engram formation that open new perspectives in the field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deafness is known to occur in more than 400 syndromes and accounts for almost 30% of hereditary hearing loss. The molecular mechanisms underlying such syndromic deafness remain unclear. Furthermore, deafness has been a common feature in patients with three main syndromes, the BÖrjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome, Wildervanck syndrome, and Congenital Generalized Hirsutism, all of which are characterized by loss-of-function mutations in the Fgf13 gene. Whether the pathogenesis of deafness in these syndromes is associated with the Fgf13 mutation is not known. To elucidate its role in auditory function, we generated a mouse line with conditional knockout of the Fgf13 gene in the inner ear (Fgf13 cKO). FGF13 is expressed predominantly in the organ of Corti, spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), stria vascularis, and the supporting cells. Conditional knockout of the gene in the inner ear led to sensorineural deafness with low amplitude and increased latency of wave I in the auditory brainstem response test but had a normal distortion product otoacoustic emission threshold. Fgf13 deficiency resulted in decreased SGN density from the apical to the basal region without significant morphological changes and those in the number of hair cells. TUNEL and caspase-3 immunocytochemistry assays showed that apoptotic cell death mediated the loss of SGNs. Further detection of apoptotic factors through qRT-PCR suggested the activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in SGNs. Together, this study reveals a novel role for Fgf13 in auditory function, and indicates that the gene could be a potential candidate for understanding deafness. These findings may provide new perspectives on the molecular mechanisms and novel therapeutic targets for treatment deafness.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Microbial communities have become a major research focus due to their importance for biogeochemical cycles, biomedicine and biotechnological applications. While some biotechnological applications, such as anaerobic digestion, make use of naturally arising microbial communities, the rational design of microbial consortia for bio-based production processes has recently gained much interest. One class of synthetic microbial consortia is based on specifically designed strains of one species. A common design principle for these consortia is based on division of labor, where the entire production pathway is divided between the different strains to reduce the metabolic burden caused by product synthesis. We first show that classical division of labor does not automatically reduce the metabolic burden when metabolic flux per biomass is analyzed. We then present ASTHERISC (Algorithmic Search of THERmodynamic advantages in Single-species Communities), a new computational approach for designing multi-strain communities of a single-species with the aim to divide a production pathway between different strains such that the thermodynamic driving force for product synthesis is maximized. ASTHERISC exploits the fact that compartmentalization of segments of a product pathway in different strains can circumvent thermodynamic bottlenecks arising when operation of one reaction requires a metabolite with high and operation of another reaction the same metabolite with low concentration. We implemented the ASTHERISC algorithm in a dedicated program package and applied it on &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; core and genome-scale models with different settings, for example, regarding number of strains or demanded product yield. These calculations showed that, for each scenario, many target metabolites (products) exist where a multi-strain community can provide a thermodynamic advantage compared to a single strain solution. In some cases, a production with sufficiently high yield is thermodynamically only feasible with a community. In summary, the developed ASTHERISC approach provides a promising new principle for designing microbial communities for the bio-based production of chemicals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AsBjj8YyUk8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Collective dynamics in multicellular systems such as biological organs and tissues plays a key role in biological development, regeneration, and pathological conditions. Collective tissue dynamics—understood as population behaviour arising from the interplay of the constituting discrete cells—can be studied with on- and off-lattice agent-based models. However, classical on-lattice agent-based models, also known as cellular automata, fail to replicate key aspects of collective migration, which is a central instance of collective behaviour in multicellular systems. To overcome drawbacks of classical on-lattice models, we introduce an on-lattice, agent-based modelling class for collective cell migration, which we call biological lattice-gas cellular automaton (BIO-LGCA). The BIO-LGCA is characterised by synchronous time updates, and the explicit consideration of individual cell velocities. While rules in classical cellular automata are typically chosen ad hoc, rules for cell-cell and cell-environment interactions in the BIO-LGCA can also be derived from experimental cell migration data or biophysical laws for individual cell migration. We introduce elementary BIO-LGCA models of fundamental cell interactions, which may be combined in a modular fashion to model complex multicellular phenomena. We exemplify the mathematical mean-field analysis of specific BIO-LGCA models, which allows to explain collective behaviour. The first example predicts the formation of clusters in adhesively interacting cells. The second example is based on a novel BIO-LGCA combining adhesive interactions and alignment. For this model, our analysis clarifies the nature of the recently discovered invasion plasticity of breast cancer cells in heterogeneous environments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vilLL9K1a5s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: What’s not in the news headlines or titles of Alzheimer disease articles? #InMice</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/Vyr7Oq10CKM/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Marcia Triunfol, Fabio C. Gouveia&lt;/p&gt;

There is increasing scrutiny around how science is communicated to the public. For instance, a Twitter account @justsaysinmice (with 70.4K followers in January 2021) was created to call attention to news headlines that omit that mice, not humans, are the ones for whom the study findings apply. This is the case of many headlines reporting on Alzheimer disease (AD) research. AD is characterized by a degeneration of the human brain, loss of cognition, and behavioral changes, for which no treatment is available. Around 200 rodent models have been developed to study AD, even though AD is an exclusively human condition that does not occur naturally in other species and appears impervious to reproduction in artificial animal models, an information not always disclosed. It is not known what prompts writers of news stories to either omit or acknowledge, in the story’s headlines, that the study was done in mice and not in humans. Here, we raised the hypothesis that how science is reported by scientists plays a role on the news reporting. To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether an association exists between articles’ titles and news’ headlines regarding the omission, or not, of mice. To this end, we analyzed a sample of 623 open-access scientific papers indexed in PubMed in 2018 and 2019 that used mice either as models or as the biological source for experimental studies in AD research. We found a significant association (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) between articles’ titles and news stories’ headlines, revealing that when authors omit the species in the paper’s title, writers of news stories tend to follow suit. We also found that papers not mentioning mice in their titles are more newsworthy and significantly more tweeted than papers that do. Our study shows that science reporting may affect media reporting and asks for changes in the way we report about findings obtained with animal models used to study human diseases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Vyr7Oq10CKM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Roles and Transcriptional Responses of Inhibitory Neurons in Learning and Memory</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.689952</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Increasing evidence supports a model whereby memories are encoded by sparse ensembles of neurons called engrams, activated during memory encoding and reactivated upon recall. An engram consists of a network of cells that undergo long-lasting modifications of their transcriptional programs and connectivity. Ground-breaking advancements in this field have been made possible by the creative exploitation of the characteristic transcriptional responses of neurons to activity, allowing both engram labeling and manipulation. Nevertheless, numerous aspects of engram cell-type composition and function remain to be addressed. As recent transcriptomic studies have revealed, memory encoding induces persistent transcriptional and functional changes in a plethora of neuronal subtypes and non-neuronal cells, including glutamatergic excitatory neurons, GABAergic inhibitory neurons, and glia cells. Dissecting the contribution of these different cellular classes to memory engram formation and activity is quite a challenging yet essential endeavor. In this review, we focus on the role played by the GABAergic inhibitory component of the engram through two complementary lenses. On one hand, we report on available physiological evidence addressing the involvement of inhibitory neurons to different stages of memory formation, consolidation, storage and recall. On the other, we capitalize on a growing number of transcriptomic studies that profile the transcriptional response of inhibitory neurons to activity, revealing important clues on their potential involvement in learning and memory processes. The picture that emerges suggests that inhibitory neurons are an essential component of the engram, likely involved in engram allocation, in tuning engram excitation and in storing the memory trace.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Conceptual and Methodological Pitfalls in Experimental Studies: An Overview, and the Case of Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.684977</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The main goal of scientific research is to uncover new knowledge to understand reality. In the field of life sciences, the aim of translational research—to transfer results “from bench to bedside”—has to contend with the problem that the knowledge acquired at the “bench” is often not reproducible at the “bedside,” raising the question whether scientific discoveries truly mirror the real world. As a result, researchers constantly struggle to overcome the dichotomy between methodological problems and expectations, as funding agencies and industries demand expandable and quick results whereas patients, who are uninterested in the epistemological dispute, only ask for an effective cure. Despite the numerous attempts made to address reproducibility and reliability issues, some essential pitfalls of scientific investigations are often overlooked. Here, we discuss some limitations of the conventional scientific method and how researcher cognitive bias and conceptual errors have the potential to steer an experimental study away from the search for the vera causa of a phenomenon. As an example, we focus on Alzheimer’s disease research and on some problems that may have undermined most of the clinical trials conducted to investigate it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Mammalian Neuronal mRNA Transport Complexes: The Few Knowns and the Many Unknowns</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2021.692948</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are transported into neurites to provide templates for the assembly of local protein networks. These networks enable a neuron to configure different cellular domains for specialized functions. According to current evidence, mRNAs are mostly transported in rather small packages of one to three copies, rarely containing different transcripts. This opens up fascinating logistic problems: how are hundreds of different mRNA cargoes sorted into distinct packages and how are they coupled to and released from motor proteins to produce the observed mRNA distributions? Are all mRNAs transported by the same transport machinery, or are there different adaptors or motors for different transcripts or classes of mRNAs? A variety of often indirect evidence exists for the involvement of proteins in mRNA localization, but relatively little is known about the essential activities required for the actual transport process. Here, we summarize the different types of available evidence for interactions that connect mammalian mRNAs to motor proteins to highlight at which point further research is needed to uncover critical missing links. We further argue that a combination of discovery approaches reporting direct interactions, in vitro reconstitution, and fast perturbations in cells is an ideal future strategy to unravel essential interactions and specific functions of proteins in mRNA transport processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Central Nervous System-Endogenous TLR7 and TLR9 Induce Different Immune Responses and Effects on Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.685645</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Innate receptors, including Toll like receptors (TLRs), are implicated in pathogenesis of CNS inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). TLR response to pathogens or endogenous signals includes production of immunoregulatory mediators. One of these, interferon (IFN)β, a Type I IFN, plays a protective role in MS and EAE. We have previously shown that intrathecal administration of selected TLR ligands induced IFNβ and infiltration of blood-derived myeloid cells into the central nervous system (CNS), and suppressed EAE in mice. We have now extended these studies to evaluate a potential therapeutic role for CNS-endogenous TLR7 and TLR9. Intrathecal application of Imiquimod (TLR7 ligand) or CpG oligonucleotide (TLR9 ligand) into CNS of otherwise unmanipulated mice induced IFNβ expression, with greater magnitude in response to CpG. CD45+ cells in the meninges were identified as source of IFNβ. Intrathecal CpG induced infiltration of monocytes, neutrophils, CD4+ T cells and NK cells whereas Imiquimod did not recruit blood-derived CD45+ cells. CpG, but not Imiquimod, had a beneficial effect on EAE, when given at time of disease onset. This therapeutic effect of CpG on EAE was not seen in mice lacking the Type I IFN receptor. In mice with EAE treated with CpG, the proportion of monocytes was significantly increased in the CNS. Infiltrating cells were predominantly localized to spinal cord meninges and demyelination was significantly reduced compared to non-treated mice with EAE. Our findings show that TLR7 and TLR9 signaling induce distinct inflammatory responses in the CNS with different outcome in EAE and point to recruitment of blood-derived cells and IFNβ induction as possible mechanistic links between TLR9 stimulation and amelioration of EAE. The protective role of TLR9 signaling in the CNS may have application in treatment of diseases such as MS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: [18F]FDG PET/CT Studies in Transgenic Hualpha-Syn (A53T) Parkinson’s Disease Mouse Model of α-Synucleinopathy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.676257</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transgenic mice line M83 that express the A53T mutant α–synuclein protein at six times the level of endogenous mice α–synuclein are a model of α-synucleinopathy found in Parkinson’s disease (PD).

We report findings on metabolic changes using [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG PET/CT in the Hualpha-Syn (A53T) PD mouse model in comparison to non-carrier mice. Whole-body PET/CT imaging of male and female mice were carried out 2 h after [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG ip administration under 3% isoflurane anesthesia. Brain images were analyzed with PET images coregistered to a mouse brain MRI template. Hualpha-Syn (A53T) mice had significantly lower [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG uptake in several brain regions compared to the no-carrier mice. Significant hind limb muscle and lower spinal cord [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG hypometabolism at 9 months of age in A53T PD mice was also indicative of neurodegenerative disease, with a progressive motoric dysfunction leading to death. Significant decrease (up to 30%) in [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG uptake were observed in 9-month old male and female Hualpha-Syn (A53) mice. This is consistent with the cortical hypometabolism in PD patients. Hualpha-Syn (A53) mice may thus be a suitable model for studies related to PD α-synucleinopathy for the discovery of new biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.667932</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this study, we propose a complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor with a self-resetting system demonstrating a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to detect small intrinsic signals such as a hemodynamic reaction or neural activity in a mouse brain. The photodiode structure was modified from N-well/P-sub to P+/N-well/P-sub to increase the photodiode capacitance to reduce the number of self-resets required to decrease the unstable stage. Moreover, our new relay board was used for the first time. As a result, an effective SNR of over 70 dB was achieved within the same pixel size and fill factor. The unstable state was drastically reduced. Thus, we will be able to detect neural activity. With its compact size, this device has significant potential to become an intrinsic signal detector in freely moving animals. We also demonstrated in vivo imaging with image processing by removing additional noise from the self-reset operation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.663174</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Flexible polymer neural probes are an attractive emerging approach for invasive brain recordings, given that they can minimize the risks of brain damage or glial scaring. However, densely packed electrode sites, which can facilitate neuronal data analysis, are not widely available in flexible probes. Here, we present a new flexible polyimide neural probe, based on standard and low-cost lithography processes, which has 32 closely spaced 10 μm diameter gold electrode sites at two different depths from the probe surface arranged in a matrix, with inter-site distances of only 5 μm. The double-layer design and fabrication approach implemented also provides additional stiffening just sufficient to prevent probe buckling during brain insertion. This approach avoids typical laborious augmentation strategies used to increase flexible probes’ mechanical rigidity while allowing a small brain insertion footprint. Chemical composition analysis and metrology of structural, mechanical, and electrical properties demonstrated the viability of this fabrication approach. Finally, in vivo functional assessment tests in the mouse cortex were performed as well as histological assessment of the insertion footprint, validating the biological applicability of this flexible neural probe for acquiring high quality neuronal recordings with high signal to noise ratio (SNR) and reduced acute trauma.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Bundle-Specific Axon Diameter Index as a New Contrast to Differentiate White Matter Tracts</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.646034</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the central nervous system of primates, several pathways are characterized by different spectra of axon diameters. In vivo methods, based on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, can provide axon diameter index estimates non-invasively. However, such methods report voxel-wise estimates, which vary from voxel-to-voxel for the same white matter bundle due to partial volume contributions from other pathways having different microstructure properties. Here, we propose a novel microstructure-informed tractography approach, COMMIT&lt;sub&gt;AxSize&lt;/sub&gt;, to resolve axon diameter index estimates at the streamline level, thus making the estimates invariant along trajectories. Compared to previously proposed voxel-wise methods, our formulation allows the estimation of a distinct axon diameter index value for each streamline, directly, furnishing a complementary measure to the existing calculation of the mean value along the bundle. We demonstrate the favourable performance of our approach comparing our estimates with existing histologically-derived measurements performed in the corpus callosum and the posterior limb of the internal capsule. Overall, our method provides a more robust estimation of the axon diameter index of pathways by jointly estimating the microstructure properties of the tissue and the macroscopic organisation of the white matter connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: A Quick and Easy Way to Estimate Entropy and Mutual Information for Neuroscience</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.596443</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Calculations of entropy of a signal or mutual information between two variables are valuable analytical tools in the field of neuroscience. They can be applied to all types of data, capture non-linear interactions and are model independent. Yet the limited size and number of recordings one can collect in a series of experiments makes their calculation highly prone to sampling bias. Mathematical methods to overcome this so-called “sampling disaster” exist, but require significant expertise, great time and computational costs. As such, there is a need for a simple, unbiased and computationally efficient tool for estimating the level of entropy and mutual information. In this article, we propose that application of entropy-encoding compression algorithms widely used in text and image compression fulfill these requirements. By simply saving the signal in PNG picture format and measuring the size of the file on the hard drive, we can estimate entropy changes through different conditions. Furthermore, with some simple modifications of the PNG file, we can also estimate the evolution of mutual information between a stimulus and the observed responses through different conditions. We first demonstrate the applicability of this method using white-noise-like signals. Then, while this method can be used in all kind of experimental conditions, we provide examples of its application in patch-clamp recordings, detection of place cells and histological data. Although this method does not give an absolute value of entropy or mutual information, it is mathematically correct, and its simplicity and broad use make it a powerful tool for their estimation through experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: A Network Architecture for Bidirectional Neurovascular Coupling in Rat Whisker Barrel Cortex</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.638700</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurovascular coupling is typically considered as a master-slave relationship between the neurons and the cerebral vessels: the neurons demand energy which the vessels supply in the form of glucose and oxygen. In the recent past, both theoretical and experimental studies have suggested that the neurovascular coupling is a bidirectional system, a loop that includes a feedback signal from the vessels influencing neural firing and plasticity. An integrated model of bidirectionally connected neural network and the vascular network is hence required to understand the relationship between the informational and metabolic aspects of neural dynamics. In this study, we present a computational model of the bidirectional neurovascular system in the whisker barrel cortex and study the effect of such coupling on neural activity and plasticity as manifest in the whisker barrel map formation. In this model, a biologically plausible self-organizing network model of rate coded, dynamic neurons is nourished by a network of vessels modeled using the biophysical properties of blood vessels. The neural layer which is designed to simulate the whisker barrel cortex of rat transmits vasodilatory signals to the vessels. The feedback from the vessels is in the form of available oxygen for oxidative metabolism whose end result is the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) necessary to fuel neural firing. The model captures the effect of the feedback from the vascular network on the neuronal map formation in the whisker barrel model under normal and pathological (Hypoxia and Hypoxia-Ischemia) conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aminoglycosides, a class of clinically important drugs, are widely used worldwide against gram-negative bacterial infections. However, there is growing evidence that aminoglycosides can cause hearing loss or balance problems. In this article, we mainly introduce the main mechanism of ototoxicity induced by aminoglycosides. Genetic analysis showed that the susceptibility of aminoglycosides was attributable to mutations in mtDNA, especially A1555G and C1494T mutations in 12S rRNA. In addition, the overexpression of NMDA receptors and the formation of free radicals also play an important role. Understanding the mechanism of ototoxicity induced by aminoglycosides is helpful to develop new therapeutic methods to protect hearing. In this article, the prevention methods of ototoxicity induced by aminoglycosides were introduced from the upstream and downstream aspects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.689332</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Huntington disease (HD) is a monogenic disease that results in a combination of motor, psychiatric and cognitive symptoms. HD is caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene, which results in the production of a pathogenic mutant HTT protein (mHTT). Although there is no cure at present for HD, a number of RNA-targeting therapies have recently entered clinical trials which aim to lower mHTT production through the use of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and RNAi. However, many of these treatment strategies are non-selective in that they cannot differentiate between non-pathogenic wild type HTT (wtHTT) and the mHTT variant. As HD patients are already born with decreased levels of wtHTT, these genetic therapies may result in critically low levels of wtHTT. The consequence of wtHTT reduction in the adult brain is currently under debate, and here we argue that wtHTT loss is not well-tolerated at the synaptic level. Synaptic dysfunction is an extremely sensitive measure of subsequent cell death, and is known to precede neurodegeneration in numerous brain diseases including HD. The present review focuses on the prominent role of wtHTT at the synapse and considers the consequences of wtHTT loss on both pre- and postsynaptic function. We discuss how wtHTT is implicated in virtually all major facets of synaptic neurotransmission including anterograde and retrograde transport of proteins to/from terminal buttons and dendrites, neurotransmitter release, endocytic vesicle recycling, and postsynaptic receptor localization and recycling. We conclude that wtHTT presence is essential for proper synaptic function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

We developed the novel software package named “Astral” to analyse intercellular communication in astrocytic networks based on live-cell calcium imaging. Our method for analysing calcium imaging data does not require the assignment of regions of interest. The package contains two applications: the core processing pipeline for detecting and quantifying Ca&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; events, and the auxiliary visualization tool for controlling data quality. Our method allows for the network-wide quantification of Ca&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; events and the analysis of their intercellular propagation. In a set of proof-of-concept experiments, we examined Ca&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; events in flat monolayers of primary astrocytes and confirmed that inter-astrocytic interactions depend on the permeability of gap junctions and connexin hemichannels. The Astral tool is particularly useful for studying astrocyte-neuronal interactions on the network level. We demonstrate that compared with purely astrocytic cultures, spontaneous generation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; events in astrocytes that were co-cultivated with neurons was significantly increased. Interestingly, the increased astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; activity after long-term co-cultivation with neurons was driven by the enhanced formation of gap junctions and connexin hemichannels but was not affected by silencing neuronal activity. Our data indicate the necessity for systematic investigation of astrocyte-neuronal interactions at the network level. For this purpose, the Astral software offers a powerful tool for processing and quantifying calcium imaging data.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Developmental Changes in Peripherin-eGFP Expression in Spiral Ganglion Neurons</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.678113</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The two types of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), types I and II, innervate inner hair cells and outer hair cells, respectively, within the mammalian cochlea and send another process back to cochlear nuclei in the hindbrain. Studying these two neuronal types has been made easier with the identification of unique molecular markers. One of these markers, peripherin, was shown using antibodies to be present in all SGNs initially but becomes specific to type II SGNs during maturation. We used mice with fluorescently labeled peripherin (Prph-eGFP) to examine peripherin expression in SGNs during development and in aged mice. Using these mice, we confirm the initial expression of Prph-eGFP in both types I and II neurons and eventual restriction to only type II perikarya shortly after birth. However, while Prph-eGFP is uniquely expressed within type II cell bodies by P8, both types I and II peripheral and central processes continue to express Prph-eGFP for some time before becoming downregulated. Only at P30 was there selective type II Prph-eGFP expression in central but not peripheral processes. By 9 months, only the type II cell bodies and more distal central processes retain Prph-eGFP expression. Our results show that Prph-eGFP is a reliable marker for type II SGN cell bodies beyond P8; however, it is not generally a suitable marker for type II processes, except for central processes beyond P30. How the changes in Prph-eGFP expression relate to subsequent protein expression remains to be explored.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Microglial Implications in SARS-CoV-2 Infection and COVID-19: Lessons From Viral RNA Neurotropism and Possible Relevance to Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.670298</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Since December 2019, humankind has been experiencing a ravaging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak, the second coronavirus pandemic in a decade after the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) disease in 2012. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 results in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is responsible for over 3.1 million deaths worldwide. With the emergence of a second and a third wave of infection across the globe, and the rising record of multiple reinfections and relapses, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows no sign of abating. In addition, it is now evident that SARS-CoV-2 infection presents with neurological symptoms that include early hyposmia, ischemic stroke, meningitis, delirium and falls, even after viral clearance. This may suggest chronic or permanent changes to the neurons, glial cells, and/or brain vasculature in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19. Within the central nervous system (CNS), microglia act as the central housekeepers against altered homeostatic states, including during viral neurotropic infections. In this review, we highlight microglial responses to viral neuroinfections, especially those with a similar genetic composition and route of entry as SARS-CoV-2. As the primary sensor of viral infection in the CNS, we describe the pathogenic and neuroinvasive mechanisms of RNA viruses and SARS-CoV-2 vis-à-vis the microglial means of viral recognition. Responses of microglia which may culminate in viral clearance or immunopathology are also covered. Lastly, we further discuss the implication of SARS-CoV-2 CNS invasion on microglial plasticity and associated long-term neurodegeneration. As such, this review provides insight into some of the mechanisms by which microglia could contribute to the pathophysiology of post-COVID-19 neurological sequelae and disorders, including Parkinson’s disease, which could be pervasive in the coming years given the growing numbers of infected and re-infected individuals globally.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Investigation of a Model-Based Working Memory Training With and Without Distractor Inhibition and Its Comparative Efficacy: A Randomized Controlled Trial on Healthy Old Adults</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.682474</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Various working memory (WM) trainings have been tested, but differences in experimental designs, the lack of theoretical background, and the need of identifying task-related processes such as filtering efficiency limit conclusions about their comparative efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: In this study, we compared the efficacy of a model-based WM training with (MB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and without (MB) distractor inhibition on improving WM capacity to a dual n-back and active control condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: This randomized clinical trial included 123 healthy elderly adults (78 women, 45 men; aged 64.1 ± 8.3 years). All groups underwent 12 40-min training sessions over 3 weeks and four cognitive testing sessions. The first two sessions served as double baseline to account for practice effects. Primary outcome was WM capacity post-training measured by complex span tasks. Near and far transfer was assessed by simple span, n-back, visuospatial and verbal learning, processing speed, and reasoning tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Due to preliminary termination (COVID-19), 93 subjects completed the post-training and 60 subjects the follow-up session. On a whole group level, practice effects occurred from prebaseline to baseline in WM capacity (b = 4.85, t&lt;sub&gt;(103)&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.01, p &amp;lt; 0.001, r = 0.37). Linear mixed-effects models revealed a difference in WM capacity post-training between MB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and MB (b = −9.62, t&lt;sub&gt;(82)&lt;/sub&gt; = −2.52, p = 0.014, r = 0.27) and a trend difference between MB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and dual n-back (b = −7.59, t&lt;sub&gt;(82)&lt;/sub&gt; = −1.87, p = 0.065, r = 0.20) and control training (b = −7.08, t&lt;sub&gt;(82)&lt;/sub&gt; = −1.86, p = 0.067, r = 0.20). Univariate analyses showed an increase between pre- and post-training for WM capacity within MB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (t&lt;sub&gt;(22)&lt;/sub&gt; = −3.34, p &amp;lt; 0.05) only. There was no difference between groups pre- and post-training regarding near and far transfer. Univariate analyses showed improved visuospatial learning within MB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (t&lt;sub&gt;(21)&lt;/sub&gt; = −3.8, p &amp;lt; 0.05), improved processing speed (t&lt;sub&gt;(23)&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.19, p&amp;lt; 0.05) and n-back performance (t&lt;sub&gt;(23)&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.12, p &amp;lt; 0.05) in MB, and improved n-back performance (t&lt;sub&gt;(25)&lt;/sub&gt; = 3.83, p &amp;lt; 0.001) in the dual n-back training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: A model-based WM training including filtering efficacy may be a promising approach to increase WM capacity and needs further investigation in randomized controlled studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Age-Related Alterations in DTI Metrics in the Human Brain—Consequences for Age Correction</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.682109</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Over the life span, the diffusion metrics in brain MRI show different, partly nonlinear changes. These age-dependent changes also seem to exhibit regional differences with respect to the brain anatomy. The age correction of a study cohort's diffusion metrics might thus require consideration of age-related factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Diffusion tensor imaging data sets were acquired from 219 healthy participants at ages between 19 and 81 years. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and axial and radial diffusivity (AD and RD, respectively) maps were analyzed by a tract of interest-based fiber tracking approach. To describe diffusion metrics as a function of the participant age, linear splines were used to perform curve fitting in 21 specific tract systems covering different functional areas and diffusion directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In the majority of tracts, an interpolation with a change of alteration rate during adult life described the diffusion properties more accurately than a linear model. Consequently, the diffusion properties remained relatively stable until a decrease (of FA) or increase (of MD, AD, and RD) started at a region-specific time point, whereas a uniform change of diffusion properties was observed only in a few tracts. Single tracts, e.g., located in the cerebellum, remained nearly unaltered throughout the ages between 19 and 81 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Age corrections of diffusion properties should not be applied to all white matter regions and all age spans in the same way. Therefore, we propose three different approaches for age correction based on fiber tracking techniques, i.e., no correction for areas that do not experience age-related changes and two variants of an age correction depending on the age range of the cohort and the tracts considered.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Alix: A Candidate Serum Biomarker of Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.669612</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common fatal neurodegenerative disease of the elderly worldwide. The identification of AD biomarkers will allow for earlier diagnosis and thus earlier intervention. The aim of this study was to find such biomarkers. It was observed that the expression of Alix was significantly decreased in brain tissues and serum samples from AD patients compared to the controls. A significant correlation between Alix levels and cognitive decline was observed (r = 0.80; p &amp;lt; 0.001) as well as a significant negative correlation between Alix and Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; in serum levels (r =−0.60, p &amp;lt; 0.001). The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis showed the area under the curve (AUC) of Alix was 0.80, and the optimal cut-off point of 199.5 pg/ml was selected with the highest sum of sensitivity and specificity. The diagnostic accuracy for serum Alix was 74%, with 76% sensitivity and 71% specificity respectively, which could differentiate AD from controls. In addition, the expression of Alix was found to be significantly decreased in AD compared to vascular dementia (VaD). ROC analysis between AD and VaD showed that the AUC was 0.777, which could be indicative of the role of serum Alix as a biomarker in the differential diagnosis between AD and VaD. Most surprisingly, the decreased expression of Alix was attenuated after the treatment of Memantine in different AD animal models. In conclusion, our results indicate the possibility of serum Alix as a novel and non-invasive biomarker for AD for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Role of Neuron and Glia in Alzheimer’s Disease and Associated Vascular Dysfunction</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.653334</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Amyloidogenicity and vascular dysfunction are the key players in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), involving dysregulated cellular interactions. An intricate balance between neurons, astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes and vascular cells sustains the normal neuronal circuits. Conversely, cerebrovascular diseases overlap neuropathologically with AD, and glial dyshomeostasis promotes AD-associated neurodegenerative cascade. While pathological hallmarks of AD primarily include amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, microvascular disorders, altered cerebral blood flow (CBF), and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability induce neuronal loss and synaptic atrophy. Accordingly, microglia-mediated inflammation and astrogliosis disrupt the homeostasis of the neuro-vascular unit and stimulate infiltration of circulating leukocytes into the brain. Large-scale genetic and epidemiological studies demonstrate a critical role of cellular crosstalk for altered immune response, metabolism, and vasculature in AD. The glia associated genetic risk factors include APOE, TREM2, CD33, PGRN, CR1, and NLRP3, which correlate with the deposition and altered phagocytosis of Aβ. Moreover, aging-dependent downregulation of astrocyte and microglial Aβ-degrading enzymes limits the neurotrophic and neurogenic role of glial cells and inhibits lysosomal degradation and clearance of Aβ. Microglial cells secrete IGF-1, and neurons show a reduced responsiveness to the neurotrophic IGF-1R/IRS-2/PI3K signaling pathway, generating amyloidogenic and vascular dyshomeostasis in AD. Glial signals connect to neural stem cells, and a shift in glial phenotype over the AD trajectory even affects adult neurogenesis and the neurovascular niche. Overall, the current review informs about the interaction of neuronal and glial cell types in AD pathogenesis and its critical association with cerebrovascular dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Neuropeptides as potential modulators of behavioral transitions in the ant Cataglyphis nodus</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25166?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>We highlighted the spatial distribution of the neuropeptides allatostatin‐A, corazonin, and tachykinin in the brain of Cataglyphis nodus desert ants. We further show behavioral‐stage‐related changes in allatostatin‐A and corazonin expression patterns. The results suggest that these neuropeptides are highly promising candidate modulators for major behavioral transitions of the ants.







Abstract
Age‐related behavioral plasticity is a major prerequisite for the ecological success of insect societies. Although ecological aspects of behavioral flexibility have been targeted in many studies, the underlying intrinsic mechanisms controlling the diverse changes in behavior along the individual life history of social insects are not completely understood. Recently, the neuropeptides allatostatin‐A, corazonin, and tachykinin have been associated with the regulation of behavioral transitions in social insects. Here, we investigated changes in brain localization and expression of these neuropeptides following major behavioral transitions in Cataglyphis nodus ants. Our immunohistochemical analyses in the brain revealed that the overall branching pattern of neurons immunoreactive (ir) for the three neuropeptides is largely independent of the behavioral stages. Numerous allatostatin‐A‐ and tachykinin‐ir neurons innervate primary sensory neuropils and high‐order integration centers of the brain. In contrast, the number of corazonergic neurons is restricted to only four neurons per brain hemisphere with cell bodies located in the pars lateralis and axons extending to the medial protocerebrum and the retrocerebral complex. Most interestingly, the cell‐body volumes of these neurons are significantly increased in foragers compared to freshly eclosed ants and interior workers. Quantification of mRNA expression levels revealed a stage‐related change in the expression of allatostatin‐A and corazonin mRNA in the brain. Given the presence of the neuropeptides in major control centers of the brain and the neurohemal organs, these mRNA‐changes strongly suggest an important modulatory role of both neuropeptides in the behavioral maturation of Cataglyphis ants.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>We have developed a method for the longitudinal intravital observation of changes in peripheral nerve fibers. This method provides a high‐resolution approach for investigating epidermal and dermal nerve terminals as well as nerve plexuses and were extremely stable for at least 28 days. Using the SNI model, we found that the degeneration of the peripheral nerve terminals and plexuses over 2–3 days was aligned closely with the initiation of mechanical hypersensitivity. In addition, we obtained clear images of sprouting in the lateral part of the paw, which may be related to the maintenance of neuropathic pain symptoms.







Abstract
Neuropathic pain is pain caused by damage to the somatosensory nervous system. Both degenerating injured nerves and neighboring sprouting nerves can contribute to neuropathic pain. However, the mesoscale changes in cutaneous nerve fibers over time after the loss of the parent nerve has not been investigated in detail. In this study, we followed the changes in nerve fibers longitudinally in the toe tips of mice that had undergone spared nerve injury (SNI). Nav1.8‐tdTomato, Thy1‐GFP and MrgD‐GFP mice were used to observe the small and large cutaneous nerve fibers. We found that peripheral nerve plexuses degenerated within 3 days of nerve injury, and free nerve endings in the epidermis degenerated within 2 days. The timing of degeneration paralleled the initiation of mechanical hypersensitivity. We also found that some of the Nav1.8‐positive nerve plexuses and free nerve endings in the fifth toe survived, and sprouting occurred mostly from 7 to 28 days. The timing of the sprouting of nerve fibers in the fifth toe paralleled the maintenance phase of mechanical hypersensitivity. Our results support the hypotheses that both injured and intact nerve fibers participate in neuropathic pain, and that, specifically, nerve degeneration is related to the initiation of evoked pain and nerve sprouting is related to the maintenance of evoked pain.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: As above, so below: Whole transcriptome profiling demonstrates strong molecular similarities between avian dorsal and ventral pallial subdivisions</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25159?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>In 2013, our group examined the expression profiles of 50 genes to develop the continuum hypothesis of avian brain organization. It states that the subdivisions of the dorsal pallium develop continuously with those of the ventral pallium, resulting in a “partial mirror image” organization around the vestigial ventricle divide. However, these claims were challenged due to the small number of genes profiled. The present study uses RNA sequencing to profile the whole transcriptome (~20,000 genes) of the principal subdivisions of the avian telencephalon and confirms the remarkable molecularly similarities between the dorsal and ventral pallium. We recommend adopting a hierarchal nomenclature to reflect these robust molecular similarities.







Abstract
Over the last two decades, beginning with the Avian Brain Nomenclature Forum in 2000, major revisions have been made to our understanding of the organization and nomenclature of the avian brain. However, there are still unresolved questions on avian pallial organization, particularly whether the cells above the vestigial ventricle represent distinct populations to those below it or similar populations. To test these two hypotheses, we profiled the transcriptomes of the major avian pallial subdivisions dorsal and ventral to the vestigial ventricle boundary using RNA sequencing and a new zebra finch genome assembly containing about 22,000 annotated, complete genes. We found that the transcriptomes of neural populations above and below the ventricle were remarkably similar. Each subdivision in dorsal pallium (Wulst) had a corresponding molecular counterpart in the ventral pallium (dorsal ventricular ridge). In turn, each corresponding subdivision exhibited shared gene co‐expression modules that contained gene sets enriched in functional specializations, such as anatomical structure development, synaptic transmission, signaling, and neurogenesis. These findings are more in line with the continuum hypothesis of avian brain subdivision organization above and below the vestigial ventricle space, with the pallium as a whole consisting of four major cell populations (intercalated pallium, mesopallium, hyper‐nidopallium, and arcopallium) instead of seven (hyperpallium apicale, interstitial hyperpallium apicale, intercalated hyperpallium, hyperpallium densocellare, mesopallium, nidopallium, and arcopallium). We suggest adopting a more streamlined hierarchical naming system that reflects the robust similarities in gene expression, neural connectivity motifs, and function. These findings have important implications for our understanding of overall vertebrate brain evolution.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Controlling for activity‐dependent genes and behavioral states is critical for determining brain relationships within and across species</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25157?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>In 2016, Puelles et al. sought to determine the relationship of avian and mammalian pallial regions using the expression profile of the NR4A2 nuclear orphan receptor, concluding that the lateral avian mesopallium was most like the mammalian claustrum, not layer 2 of the cortex as found by Suzuki and Hirata (Frontiers in Neuroanatomy, 2014, 8, 783). However, we found that the NR4A2 expression patterns were characteristic of an activity‐dependent gene. Looking at different behavioral contexts in the zebra finch, we found induced expression of NR4A2 in regions across the pallium associated with visual, somatosensory, and motor activity, confounding and contradicting previous findings. Accordingly, we do not believe NR4A2 is a suitable gene for assessing homologous brain anatomy without understanding the animal's behavioral state.







Abstract
The genetic profile of vertebrate pallia has long driven debate on homology across distantly related clades. Based on an expression profile of the orphan nuclear receptor NR4A2 in mouse and chicken brains, Puelles et al. (The Journal of Comparative Neurology, 2016, 524, 665–703) concluded that the avian lateral mesopallium is homologous to the mammalian claustrum, and the medial mesopallium homologous to the insula cortex. They argued that their findings contradict conclusions by Jarvis et al. (The Journal of Comparative Neurology, 2013, 521, 3614–3665) and Chen et al. (The Journal of Comparative Neurology, 2013, 521, 3666–3701) that the hyperpallium densocellare is instead a mesopallium cell population, and by Suzuki and Hirata (Frontiers in Neuroanatomy, 2014, 8, 783) that the avian mesopallium is homologous to mammalian cortical layers 2/3. Here, we find that NR4A2 is an activity‐dependent gene and cannot be used to determine brain organization or species relationships without considering behavioral state. Activity‐dependent NR4A2 expression has been previously demonstrated in the rodent brain, with the highest induction occurring within the claustrum, amygdala, deep and superficial cortical layers, and hippocampus. In the zebra finch, we find that NR4A2 is constitutively expressed in the arcopallium, but induced in parts of the mesopallium, and in sparse cells within the hyperpallium, depending on animal stimulus or behavioral state. Basal and induced NR4A2 expression patterns do not discount the previously named avian hyperpallium densocellare as dorsal mesopallium and conflict with proposed homology between the avian mesopallium and mammalian claustrum/insula at the exclusion of other brain regions. Broadly, these findings highlight the importance of controlling for behavioral state and neural activity to genetically define brain cell population relationships within and across species.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Long‐term stress is linked to depression in humans. We used a rat learned helplessness model of depression to study the effects on synaptic proteins important for plasticity. With quantitative immunogold EM we show an increase in NMDA receptor subunit GluN2B in the PSD of excitatory synapses in CA1 area of hippocampus.







Abstract
Major depressive disorder involves changes in synaptic structure and function, but the molecular underpinnings of these changes are still not established. In an initial pilot experiment, whole‐brain synaptosome screening with quantitative western blotting was performed to identify synaptic proteins that may show concentration changes in a congenital rat learned helplessness model of depression. We found that the N‐methyl‐d‐aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subunits GluN2A/GluN2B, activity‐regulated cytoskeleton‐associated protein (Arc) and syntaxin‐1 showed significant concentration differences between congenitally learned helpless (LH) and nonlearned helpless (NLH) rats. Having identified these three proteins, we then performed more elaborate quantitative immunogold electron microscopic analyses of the proteins in a specific synapse type in the dorsal hippocampus: the Schaffer collateral synapse in the CA1 region. We expanded the setup to include also unstressed wild‐type (WT) rats. The concentrations of the proteins in the LH and NLH groups were compared to WT animals. In this specific synapse, we found that the concentration of NMDARs was increased in postsynaptic spines in both LH and NLH rats. The concentration of Arc was significantly increased in postsynaptic densities in LH animals as well as in presynaptic cytoplasm of NLH rats. The concentration of syntaxin‐1 was significantly increased in both presynaptic terminals and postsynaptic spines in LH animals, while pre‐ and postsynaptic syntaxin‐1 concentrations were significantly decreased in NLH animals. These protein changes suggest pathways by which synaptic plasticity may be increased in dorsal hippocampal Schaffer collateral synapses during depression, corresponding to decreased synaptic stability.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Expression of cell markers and transcription factors in the avian retina compared with that in the marmoset retina</title>

	<content:encoded>Haverkamp et al. use various cell markers to study the buzzard, pigeon, and marmoset retina. They compare marker expression, cell densities, and the cellular organization of foveae.







Abstract
In the vertebrate retina, amacrine and ganglion cells represent the most diverse cell classes. They can be classified into different cell types by several features, such as morphology, light responses, and gene expression profile. Although birds possess high visual acuity (similar to primates that we used here for comparison) and tetrachromatic color vision, data on the expression of transcription factors in retinal ganglion cells of birds are largely missing. In this study, we tested various transcription factors, known to label subpopulations of cells in mammalian retinae, in two avian species: the common buzzard (Buteo buteo), a raptor with exceptional acuity, and the domestic pigeon (Columba livia domestica), a good navigator and widely used model for visual cognition. Staining for the transcription factors Foxp2, Satb1 and Satb2 labeled most ganglion cells in the avian ganglion cell layer. CtBP2 was established as marker for displaced amacrine cells, which allowed us to reliably distinguish ganglion cells from displaced amacrine cells and assess their densities in buzzard and pigeon. When we additionally compared the temporal and central fovea of the buzzard with the fovea of primates, we found that the cellular organization in the pits was different in primates and raptors. In summary, we demonstrate that the expression of transcription factors is a defining feature of cell types not only in the retina of mammals but also in the retina of birds. The markers, which we have established, may provide useful tools for more detailed studies on the retinal circuitry of these highly visual animals.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
In one species of shore crab (Brachyura, Varunidae), a center that supports long‐term visual habituation and that matches the reniform body's morphology has been claimed as a homolog of the insect mushroom body despite lacking traits that define it as such. The discovery in a related species of shore crab of a mushroom body possessing those defining traits renders that interpretation unsound. Two phenotypically distinct, coexisting centers cannot both be homologs of the insect mushroom body. The present commentary outlines the history of research leading to misidentification of the reniform body as a mushroom body. One conclusion is that if both centers support learning and memory, this would be viewed as a novel and fascinating attribute of the pancrustacean brain.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The central complex is an insect brain area controlling spatial orientation. Immunolabeling in 20 species ranging from firebrats to flies shows that the cellular distribution of the dopamine‐synthesizing enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase in the central complex is largely conserved but reveals additional novel cell types in flies and water striders.







Abstract
Dopamine acts as a neurohormone and neurotransmitter in the insect nervous system and controls a variety of physiological processes. Dopaminergic neurons also innervate the central complex (CX), a multisensory center of the insect brain involved in sky compass navigation, goal‐directed locomotion and sleep control. To infer a possible influence of evolutionary history and lifestyle on the neurochemical architecture of the CX, we have studied the distribution of neurons immunoreactive to tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate‐limiting enzyme in dopamine biosynthesis. Analysis of representatives from 12 insect orders ranging from firebrats to flies revealed high conservation of immunolabeled neurons. One type of TH‐immunoreactive neuron was found in all species studied. The neurons have somata in the pars intercerebralis, arborizations in the lateral accessory lobes, and axonal ramifications in the central body and noduli. In all pterygote species, a second type of tangential neuron of the upper division of the central body was TH‐immunoreactive. The neurons have cell bodies near the calyces and arborizations in the superior protocerebrum. Both types of neuron showed species‐specific variations in cell number and in the innervated areas outside and inside the CX. Additional neurons were found in only two taxa: one type of columnar neuron showed TH immunostaining in the water strider Gerris lacustris, but not in other Heteroptera, and a tritocerebral neuron innervating the protocerebral bridge was immunolabeled in Diptera. The data show largely taxon‐specific variations of a common ground pattern of putatively dopaminergic neurons that may be commonly involved in state‐dependent modulation of CX function.</content:encoded>

Specific interaction between the start codon, 5’-AUG-3’, and the anticodon, 5’-CAU-3’, ensures accurate initiation of translation. Recent studies show that several near-cognate start codons (e.g. GUG and CUG) can play a role in initiating translation in eukaryotes. However, the mechanism allowing initiation through mismatched base-pairs at the ribosomal decoding site is still unclear at an atomic level. In this work, we propose an extended simulation-based method to evaluate free energy profiles, through computing the distance between each base-pair of the triplet interactions involved in recognition of start codons in eukaryotic translation pre-initiation complex. Our method provides not only the free energy penalty for mismatched start codons relative to the AUG start codon, but also the preferred pathways of transitions between bound and unbound states, which has not been described by previous studies. To verify the method, the binding dynamics of cognate (AUG) and near-cognate start codons (CUG and GUG) were simulated. Evaluated free energy profiles agree with experimentally observed changes in initiation frequencies from respective codons. This work proposes for the first time how a G:U mismatch at the first position of codon (GUG)-anticodon base-pairs destabilizes the accommodation in the initiating eukaryotic ribosome and how initiation at a CUG codon is nearly as strong as, or sometimes stronger than, that at a GUG codon. Our method is expected to be applied to study the affinity changes for various mismatched base-pairs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tPecjyTY_U4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;i&gt;Campylobacter jejuni&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;C. jejuni&lt;/i&gt;) causes gastroenteritis following the consumption of contaminated poultry meat, resulting in a large health and economic burden worldwide. Phage therapy is a promising technique for eradicating &lt;i&gt;C. jejuni&lt;/i&gt; from poultry flocks and chicken carcasses. However, &lt;i&gt;C. jejuni&lt;/i&gt; can resist infections by some phages through stochastic, phase-variable ON/OFF switching of the phage receptors mediated by simple sequence repeats (SSR). While selection strength and exposure time influence the evolution of SSR-mediated phase variation (PV), phages offer a more complex evolutionary environment as phage replication depends on having a permissive host organism. Here, we build and explore several continuous culture bacteria-phage computational models, each analysing different phase-variable scenarios calibrated to the experimental SSR rates of &lt;i&gt;C. jejuni&lt;/i&gt; loci and replication parameters for the F336 phage. We simulate the evolution of PV rates via the adaptive dynamics framework for varying levels of selective pressures that act on the phage-resistant state. Our results indicate that growth reducing counter-selection on a single PV locus results in the stable maintenance of the phage, while compensatory selection between bacterial states affects the evolutionary stable mutation rates (i.e. very high and very low mutation rates are evolutionarily disadvantageous), whereas, in the absence of either selective pressure the evolution of PV rates results in mutation rates below the basal values. Contrastingly, a biologically-relevant model with two phase-variable loci resulted in phage extinction and locking of the bacteria into a phage-resistant state suggesting that another counter-selective pressure is required, for instance the use of a distinct phage whose receptor is an F336-phage-resistant state. We conclude that a delicate balance between counter-selection and phage-attack can result in both the evolution of phase-variable phage receptors and persistence of PV-receptor-specific phage.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PTygv1_RlsE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Neonatal invasive disease caused by Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is responsible for much acute mortality and long-term morbidity. To guide development of better prevention strategies, including maternal vaccines that protect neonates against GBS, it is necessary to estimate the burden of this condition globally and in different regions. Here, we present a Bayesian model that estimates country-specific invasive GBS (iGBS) disease incidence in children aged 0 to 6 days. The model combines different types of epidemiological data, each of which has its own limitations: GBS colonization prevalence in pregnant women, risk of iGBS disease in children born to GBS-colonized mothers and direct estimates of iGBS disease incidence where available. In our analysis, we present country-specific maternal GBS colonization prevalence after adjustment for GBS detection assay used in epidemiological studies. We then integrate these results with other epidemiological data and estimate country-level incidence of iGBS disease including in countries with no studies that directly estimate incidence. We are able to simultaneously estimate two key epidemiological quantities: the country-specific incidence of early-onset iGBS disease, and the risk of iGBS disease in babies born to GBS-colonized women. Overall, we believe our method will contribute to a more comprehensive quantification of the global burden of this disease, inform cost-effectiveness assessments of potential maternal GBS vaccines and identify key areas where data are necessary.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jrzDICINQ5g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Understanding the relationships between biological processes is paramount to unravel pathophysiological mechanisms. These relationships can be modeled with Transfer Functions (TFs), with no need of &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; hypotheses as to the shape of the transfer function. Here we present Iliski, a software dedicated to TFs computation between two signals. It includes different pre-treatment routines and TF computation processes: deconvolution, deterministic and non-deterministic optimization algorithms that are adapted to disparate datasets. We apply Iliski to data on neurovascular coupling, an ensemble of cellular mechanisms that link neuronal activity to local changes of blood flow, highlighting the software benefits and caveats in the computation and evaluation of TFs. We also propose a workflow that will help users to choose the best computation according to the dataset. Iliski is available under the open-source license CC BY 4.0 on GitHub (https://github.com/alike-aydin/Iliski) and can be used on the most common operating systems, either within the MATLAB environment, or as a standalone application.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fSbhMDOSwQ8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Rapid microstructural plasticity in the cortical semantic network following a short language learning session</title>

Despite the clear importance of language in our life, our vital ability to quickly and effectively learn new words and meanings is neurobiologically poorly understood. Conventional knowledge maintains that language learning—especially in adulthood—is slow and laborious. Furthermore, its structural basis remains unclear. Even though behavioural manifestations of learning are evident near instantly, previous neuroimaging work across a range of semantic categories has largely studied neural changes associated with months or years of practice. Here, we address rapid neuroanatomical plasticity accompanying new lexicon acquisition, specifically focussing on the learning of action-related language, which has been linked to the brain’s motor systems. Our results show that it is possible to measure and to externally modulate (using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of motor cortex) cortical microanatomic reorganisation after mere minutes of new word learning. Learning-induced microstructural changes, as measured by diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) and machine learning-based analysis, were evident in prefrontal, temporal, and parietal neocortical sites, likely reflecting integrative lexico-semantic processing and formation of new memory circuits immediately during the learning tasks. These results suggest a structural basis for the rapid neocortical word encoding mechanism and reveal the causally interactive relationship of modal and associative brain regions in supporting learning and word acquisition.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/L4Qros8z-X0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: A Novel Multisystem Proteinopathy Caused by a Missense ANXA11 Variant</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26136?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Protein misfolding plays a central role not only in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but also in other conditions, such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD), inclusion body myopathy (hIBM) or Paget's disease of bone. The concept of multisystem proteinopathies (MSP) was created to account for those rare families that segregate at least 2 out of these 4 conditions in the same pedigree. The calcium‐dependent phospholipid‐binding protein annexin A11 was recently associated to ALS in European pedigrees. Herein, we describe in detail 3 Brazilian families presenting hIBM (isolated or in combination with ALS/FTD) caused by the novel p.D40Y change in the gene encoding annexin A11 (ANXA11).


Methods
We collected clinical, genetic, pathological and skeletal muscle imaging from 11 affected subjects. Neuroimaging was also obtained from 8 patients and 8 matched controls.


Results
Clinico‐radiological phenotype of this novel hIBM reveals a slowly progressive predominant limb‐girdle syndrome, but with frequent axial (ptosis/dropped head) and distal (medial gastrocnemius) involvement as well. Muscle pathology identified numerous rimmed vacuoles with positive annexin A11, TDP‐43 and p62 inclusions, but no inflammation. Central nervous system was also involved: two patients had FTD, but diffusion tensor imaging uncovered multiple areas of cerebral white matter damage in the whole group (including the corticospinal tracts and frontal subcortical regions).


Interpretation
These findings expand the phenotypic spectrum related to ANXA11. This gene should be considered the cause of a novel multisystem proteinopathy (MSP type 6), rather than just ALS. ANN NEUROL 2021</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Axonal Transport and Local Translation of mRNA in Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.697973</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Since neurons have long neurites including axons, it is crucial for the axons to transport many intracellular substances such as proteins and mitochondria in order to maintain their morphology and function. In addition, mRNAs have also been shown to be transported within axons. RNA-binding proteins form complexes with mRNAs, and regulate transport of the mRNAs to axons, as well as locally translate them into proteins. Local translation of mRNAs actively occurs during the development and damage of neurons, and plays an important role in axon elongation, regeneration, and synapse formation. In recent years, it has been reported that impaired axonal transport and local translation of mRNAs may be involved in the pathogenesis of some neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we discuss the significance of mRNA axonal transport and their local translation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia, spinal muscular atrophy, Alzheimer’s disease, and fragile X syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Wnt-Frizzled Signaling Regulates Activity-Mediated Synapse Formation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.683035</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The formation of synapses is a tightly regulated process that requires the coordinated assembly of the presynaptic and postsynaptic sides. Defects in synaptogenesis during development or in the adult can lead to neurodevelopmental disorders, neurological disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. In order to develop therapeutic approaches for these neurological conditions, we must first understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate synapse formation. The Wnt family of secreted glycoproteins are key regulators of synapse formation in different model systems from invertebrates to mammals. In this review, we will discuss the role of Wnt signaling in the formation of excitatory synapses in the mammalian brain by focusing on Wnt7a and Wnt5a, two Wnt ligands that play an in vivo role in this process. We will also discuss how changes in neuronal activity modulate the expression and/or release of Wnts, resulting in changes in the localization of surface levels of Frizzled, key Wnt receptors, at the synapse. Thus, changes in neuronal activity influence the magnitude of Wnt signaling, which in turn contributes to activity-mediated synapse formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) is complex and diverse. Over the decades, our understanding of NDD has been limited to pathological features. However, recent advances in gene sequencing have facilitated elucidation of NDD at a deeper level.

The current review describes the history of evolution of gene editing tools, with the aim of improving overall understanding of this technology, and focuses on the four most common NDD disorders to demonstrate the potential future applications and research directions of gene editing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Multimodal Simulation of a Novel Device for a Safe and Effective External Ventricular Drain Placement</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.690705</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;External ventricular drain (EVD) placement is mandatory for several pathologies. The misplacement rate of the EVD varies widely in literature, ranging from 12.3 to 60%. The purpose of this simulation study is to provide preliminary data about the possibility of increasing the safety of one of the most common life-saving procedures in neurosurgery by testing a new device for EVD placement.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We used a novel guide for positioning the ventricular catheter (patent RM2014A000376). The trajectory was assessed using 25 anonymized head CT scans. The data sets were used to conduct three-dimensional computer-based and combined navigation and augmented reality-based simulations using plaster models. The data set inclusion criteria were volumetric head CT scan, without midline shift, of patients older than 18. Evans’ index was used to quantify the ventricle’s size. We excluded patients with slit ventricles, midline shift, skull fractures, or complex skull malformations. The proximal end of the device was tested on the cadaver.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The cadaveric tests proved that a surgeon could use the device without any external help. The multimodal simulation showed Kakarla grade 1 in all cases but one (grade 2) on both sides, after right and left EVD placement. The mean Evans’ index was 0.28. The geometric principles that explain the device’s efficacy can be summarized by studying the properties of circumference and chord. The contact occurs, for each section considered, at the extreme points of the chord. Its axis, perpendicular to the plane tangent to the spherical surface at the entry point, corresponds to the direction of entry of the catheter guided by the instrument.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;According to our multimodal simulation on cadavers, 3D computer-based simulation, 3D plaster modeling, 3D neuronavigation, and augmented reality, the device promises to offer safer and effective EVD placement. Further validation in future clinical studies is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: MRIES: A Matlab Toolbox for Mapping the Responses to Intracranial Electrical Stimulation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.652841</link>
	<content:encoded>Propose&lt;p&gt;Directed cortical responses to intracranial electrical stimulation are a good standard for mapping inter-regional direct connectivity. Cortico-cortical evoked potential (CCEP), elicited by single pulse electrical stimulation (SPES), has been widely used to map the normal and abnormal brain effective network. However, automated processing of CCEP datasets and visualization of connectivity results remain challenging for researchers and clinicians. In this study, we develop a Matlab toolbox named MRIES (Mapping the Responses to Intracranial Electrical Stimulation) to automatically process CCEP data and visualize the connectivity results.&lt;/p&gt;Method&lt;p&gt;The MRIES integrates the processing pipeline of the CCEP datasets and various methods for connectivity calculation based on low- and high-frequency signals with stimulation artifacts removed. The connectivity matrices are saved in different folders for visualization. Different visualization patterns (connectivity matrix, circle map, surface map, and volume map) are also integrated to the graphical user interface (GUI), which makes it easy to intuitively display and compare different connectivity measurements. Furthermore, one sample CCEP data set collected from eight epilepsy patients is used to validate the MRIES toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;Result&lt;p&gt;We show the GUI and visualization functions of MRIES using one example CCEP data that has been described in a complete tutorial. We applied this toolbox to the sample CCEP data set to investigate the direct connectivity between the medial temporal lobe and the insular cortex. We find bidirectional connectivity between MTL and insular that are consistent with the findings of previous studies.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;MRIES has a friendly GUI and integrates the full processing pipeline of CCEP data and various visualization methods. The MRIES toolbox, tutorial, and example data can be freely downloaded. As an open-source package, MRIES is expected to improve the reproducibility of CCEP findings and facilitate clinical translation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Cortical Electrical Stimulation Ameliorates Traumatic Brain Injury-Induced Sensorimotor and Cognitive Deficits in Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.693073</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Individuals with different severities of traumatic brain injury (TBI) often suffer long-lasting motor, sensory, neurological, or cognitive disturbances. To date, no neuromodulation-based therapies have been used to manage the functional deficits associated with TBI. Cortical electrical stimulation (CES) has been increasingly developed for modulating brain plasticity and is considered to have therapeutic potential in TBI. However, the therapeutic value of such a technique for TBI is still unclear. Accordingly, an animal model of this disease would be helpful for mechanistic insight into using CES as a novel treatment approach in TBI. The current study aims to apply a novel CES scheme with a theta-burst stimulation (TBS) protocol to identify the therapeutic potential of CES in a weight drop-induced rat model of TBI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: TBI rats were divided into the sham CES treatment group and CES treatment group. Following early and long-term CES intervention (starting 24 h after TBI, 1 session/day, 5 days/week) in awake TBI animals for a total of 4 weeks, the effects of CES on the modified neurological severity score (mNSS), sensorimotor and cognitive behaviors and neuroinflammatory changes were identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We found that the 4-week CES intervention significantly alleviated the TBI-induced neurological, sensorimotor, and cognitive deficits in locomotor activity, sensory and recognition memory. Immunohistochemically, we found that CES mitigated the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) activation in the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: These findings suggest that CES has significant benefits in alleviating TBI-related symptoms and represents a promising treatment for TBI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Oxytocinergic Feedback Circuitries: An Anatomical Basis for Neuromodulation of Social Behaviors</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.688234</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Oxytocin (OT) is a neuropeptide produced by hypothalamic neurons and is known to modulate social behavior among other functions. Several experiments have shown that OT modulates neuronal activity in many brain areas, including sensory cortices. OT neurons thus project axons to various cortical and subcortical structures and activate neuronal subpopulations to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, and in turn, increases the saliency of social stimuli. Less is known about the origin of inputs to OT neurons, but recent studies show that cells projecting to OT neurons are often located in regions where the OT receptor (OTR) is expressed. Thus, we propose the existence of reciprocal connectivity between OT neurons and extrahypothalamic OTR neurons to tune OT neuron activity depending on the behavioral context. Furthermore, the latest studies have shown that OTR-expressing neurons located in social brain regions also project to other social brain regions containing OTR-expressing neurons. We hypothesize that OTR-expressing neurons across the brain constitute a common network coordinated by OT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Modulatory Effects of Monoamines and Perineuronal Nets on Output of Cerebellar Purkinje Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.661899</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Classically, the cerebellum has been thought to play a significant role in motor coordination. However, a growing body of evidence for novel neural connections between the cerebellum and various brain regions indicates that the cerebellum also contributes to other brain functions implicated in reward, language, and social behavior. Cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) make inhibitory GABAergic synapses with their target neurons: other PCs and Lugaro/globular cells via PC axon collaterals, and neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) via PC primary axons. PC-Lugaro/globular cell connections form a cerebellar cortical microcircuit, which is driven by serotonin and noradrenaline. PCs’ primary outputs control not only firing but also synaptic plasticity of DCN neurons following the integration of excitatory and inhibitory inputs in the cerebellar cortex. Thus, strong PC-mediated inhibition is involved in cerebellar functions as a key regulator of cerebellar neural networks. In this review, we focus on physiological characteristics of GABAergic transmission from PCs. First, we introduce monoaminergic modulation of GABAergic transmission at synapses of PC-Lugaro/globular cell as well as PC-large glutamatergic DCN neuron, and a Lugaro/globular cell-incorporated microcircuit. Second, we review the physiological roles of perineuronal nets (PNNs), which are organized components of the extracellular matrix and enwrap the cell bodies and proximal processes, in GABA release from PCs to large glutamatergic DCN neurons and in cerebellar motor learning. Recent evidence suggests that alterations in PNN density in the DCN can regulate cerebellar functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Multi-structure Cortical States Deduced From Intracellular Representations of Fixed Tactile Input Patterns</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.677568</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The brain has a never-ending internal activity, whose spatiotemporal evolution interacts with external inputs to constrain their impact on brain activity and thereby how we perceive them. We used reproducible touch-related spatiotemporal sensory inputs and recorded intracellularly from rat (Sprague-Dawley, male) neocortical neurons to characterize this interaction. The synaptic responses, or the summed input of the networks connected to the neuron, varied greatly to repeated presentations of the same tactile input pattern delivered to the tip of digit 2. Surprisingly, however, these responses tended to sort into a set of specific time-evolving response types, unique for each neuron. Further, using a set of eight such tactile input patterns, we found each neuron to exhibit a set of specific response types for each input provided. Response types were not determined by the global cortical state, but instead likely depended on the time-varying state of the specific subnetworks connected to each neuron. The fact that some types of responses recurred indicates that the cortical network had a non-continuous landscape of solutions for these tactile inputs. Therefore, our data suggest that sensory inputs combine with the internal dynamics of the brain networks, thereby causing them to fall into one of the multiple possible perceptual attractor states. The neuron-specific instantiations of response types we observed suggest that the subnetworks connected to each neuron represent different components of those attractor states. Our results indicate that the impact of cortical internal states on external inputs is substantially more richly resolvable than previously shown.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Shifted Dynamics of Glucose Metabolism in the Hippocampus During Aging</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.700306</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aging is a process that adversely affects brain functions such as cognition. Brain activity is highly energy consuming, with glucose serving as the main energy source under normal circumstances. Whether the dynamics of glucose metabolism change with aging is not well understood. This study sought to investigate the activity-dependent changes in glucose metabolism of the mouse hippocampus during aging. In brief, after 1 h of contextual exploration in an enriched environmental condition or 1 h in a familiar home cage condition, metabolites were measured from the hippocampus of both young adult and aged mice with metabolomic profiling. Compared to the home cage context, the enriched contextual exploration condition resulted in changes in the concentration of 11 glucose metabolism-related metabolites in the young adult hippocampus. In contrast, glucose metabolism-related metabolite changes were more apparent in the aged group altered by contextual exploration when compared to those in the home cage condition. Importantly, in the aged groups, several key metabolites involved in glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and ketone body metabolism accumulated, suggesting the less efficient metabolization of glucose-based energy resources. Altogether, the analyses revealed that in the aged mice altered by enriched contextual exploration, the glucose resource seems to be unable to provide enough energy for hippocampal function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.695108</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aberrant cortical spike-local field potential (LFP) coupling leads to abnormal basal ganglia activity, disruption of cortical function, and impaired movement in Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, the primary motor cortex mediated plasticity mechanism underlying behavioral improvement by exercise intervention was investigated. Exercise alleviates motor dysfunction and induces neuroplasticity in PD. In this study, Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were injected with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) to induce unilateral nigrostriatal dopamine depletion. Two weeks later, a 4-week exercise intervention was initiated in the PD + exercise (Ex) group. Multichannel recording technology recorded spikes and LFPs in rat motor cortices, and balanced ability tests evaluated behavioral performance. The balanced ability test showed that the total crossing time/front leg error/input latency time was significantly lower in PD + Ex rats than in PD rats (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Scalograms and LFP power spectra indicated increased beta-range LFP power in lesioned hemispheres, with exercise reducing LFP power spectral density. Spike-triggered LFP waveform averages showed strong phase-locking in PD motor cortex cells, and exercise reduced spike-LFP synchronization. Our results suggest that exercise can suppress overexcitability of LFPs and minimize spike-LFP synchronization in the motor cortex, leading to motor-improving effects in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;The estimated absolute cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk level is known to be a useful surrogate marker for future cognitive impairment; however, evidence regarding its predictive validity in terms of cognitive subtypes is limited. We aimed to examine subtype-dependent differences in the associations between absolute CVD risk and the incidence of cognitive impairment in a community-dwelling older Japanese cohort.&lt;/p&gt;Methods and Results&lt;p&gt;This study comprised 1,641 cognitively intact older Japanese participants without CVDs at baseline. We estimated absolute CVD risk using WHO region-specific risk estimation charts and included age, sex, diabetes mellitus, smoking, systolic blood pressure, and total cholesterol at baseline, and the CVD risk level was stratified into the three following risk categories: low (&amp;lt;10%), moderate (10 to &amp;lt;20%), and high (≥20%). Objective cognitive screening was performed using a multicomponent neurocognitive test at baseline and follow-up, and the incidence of cognitive impairment over 48 ± 2 months was determined. The incidence of cognitive impairment in low-, moderate-, and high-CVD risk participants was 1.2, 3.0, and 5.4%, respectively, for amnestic subtypes and 5.8, 10.1, and 14.0%, respectively, for non-amnestic subtypes. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, the absolute CVD risk level was significantly associated with non-amnestic impairment but not with amnestic impairment.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusions&lt;p&gt;The absolute CVD risk estimated using region-specific risk estimation charts in old age is useful to predict incidence of cognitive impairment. Strategies to screen populations at risk of cognitive impairment and to prevent progression to dementia should be cognitive subtype-specific.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Motor Sequence Learning Deficits in Idiopathic Parkinson’s Disease Are Associated With Increased Substantia Nigra Activity</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.685168</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have shown that persons with Parkinson’s disease (pwPD) share specific deficits in learning new sequential movements, but the neural substrates of this impairment remain unclear. In addition, the degree to which striatal dopaminergic denervation in PD affects the cortico-striato-thalamo-cerebellar motor learning network remains unknown. We aimed to answer these questions using fMRI in 16 pwPD and 16 healthy age-matched control subjects while they performed an implicit motor sequence learning task. While learning was absent in both pwPD and controls assessed with reaction time differences between sequential and random trials, larger error-rates during the latter suggest that at least some of the complex sequence was encoded. Moreover, we found that while healthy controls could improve general task performance indexed by decreased reaction times across both sequence and random blocks, pwPD could not, suggesting disease-specific deficits in learning of stimulus-response associations. Using fMRI, we found that this effect in pwPD was correlated with decreased activity in the hippocampus over time. Importantly, activity in the substantia nigra (SN) and adjacent bilateral midbrain was specifically increased during sequence learning in pwPD compared to healthy controls, and significantly correlated with sequence-specific learning deficits. As increased SN activity was also associated (on trend) with higher doses of dopaminergic medication as well as disease duration, the results suggest that learning deficits in PD are associated with disease progression, indexing an increased drive to recruit dopaminergic neurons in the SN, however, unsuccessfully. Finally, there were no differences between pwPD and controls in task modulation of the cortico-striato-thalamo-cerebellar network. However, a restricted nigral-striatal model showed that negative modulation of SN to putamen connection was larger in pwPD compared to controls during random trials, while no differences between the groups were found during sequence learning. We speculate that learning-specific SN recruitment leads to a relative increase in SN- &amp;gt; putamen connectivity, which returns to a pathological reduced state when no learning takes place.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Learning by Insight-Like Sudden Comprehension as a Potential Strategy to Improve Memory Encoding in Older Adults</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.661346</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Several cognitive functions show a decline with advanced age, most prominently episodic memory. Problem-solving by insight represents a special associative form of problem-solving that has previously been shown to facilitate long-term memory formation. Recent neuroimaging evidence suggests that the encoding network involved in insight-based memory formation is largely hippocampus-independent. This may represent a potential advantage in older adults, as the hippocampus is one of the earliest brain structures to show age-related volume loss and functional impairment. Here, we investigated the potential beneficial effects of learning by insight in healthy older (60–79 years) compared to young adults (19–28 years). To this end, we compared later memory performance for verbal riddles encoded incidentally via induced insight-like sudden comprehension in both age groups. We employed a variant of the Compound Remote Associate Task (CRAT) for incidental encoding, during which participants were instructed to judge the solvability of items. In a 24-h delayed surprise memory test, participants attempted to solve previously encountered items and additionally performed a recognition memory test. During this test, older adults correctly solved an equal proportion of new CRA items compared to young adults and both age groups reported a similar frequency of Aha! experiences. While overall memory performance was better in young participants (higher proportion of correctly solved and correctly recognized old CRA items), older participants exhibited a stronger beneficial effect of insight-like sudden comprehension on later recognition memory for CRA items. Our results suggest that learning via insight might constitute a promising approach to improve memory function in old age.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Mild Cognitive Impairment and Neurofeedback: A Randomized Controlled Trial</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.657646</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background and Objectives: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is often a precursor of dementia, and in particular of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) which is the most common cause of dementia. Individuals with amnestic MCI are several-fold more likely to develop AD than the general population. Therefore, MCI comprises a well-detectable, early stage time-point for therapeutic intervention and strategic prevention. Based on common electroencephalographical (EEG) pattern changes seen in individuals with MCI, we postulated that EEG-based neurofeedback could help improve the memory performance of patients with MCI. Memory performance is of particular importance in these patients, since memory decline is the most prominent symptom in most patients with MCI, and is the most predictive symptom for cognitive deterioration and the development of AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: In order to improve the memory performance of patients with MCI we used a system of EEG-based neurofeedback in an attempt to reverse alterations of the EEG that are known to be common in patients with MCI. Our protocol comprised the provision of positive feedback in order to enhance the activity level of the upper alpha band. Participants were divided to two groups receiving either neurofeedback training to enhance the upper alpha frequency (Experimental group) or random feedbacks (Sham group)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We witnessed a significant improvement in memory performance in subjects in the experimental group compared to those in the sham group. This improvement was maintained for at least 1 month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Neurofeedback may be a promising and affordable novel approach for treating the decline in memory witnessed in patients with MCI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Mind-Body Exercise Modulates Locus Coeruleus and Ventral Tegmental Area Functional Connectivity in Individuals With Mild Cognitive Impairment</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.646807</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a common global health problem. Recently, the potential of mind-body intervention for MCI has drawn the interest of investigators. This study aims to comparatively explore the modulation effect of Baduanjin, a popular mind-body exercise, and physical exercise on the cognitive function, as well as the norepinephrine and dopamine systems using the resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) method in patients with MCI. 69 patients were randomized to the Baduanjin, brisk walking, or healthy education control group for 6 months. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were applied at baseline and at the end of the experiment. Results showed that (1) compared to the brisk walking, the Baduanjin significantly increased MoCA scores; (2) Baduanjin significantly increased the right locus coeruleus (LC) and left ventral tegmental area (VTA) rsFC with the right insula and right amygdala compared to that of the control group; and the right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) compared to that of the brisk walking group; (3) the increased right LC-right insula rsFC and right LC-right ACC rsFC were significantly associated with the corresponding MoCA score after 6-months of intervention; (4) both exercise groups experienced an increased effective connectivity from the right ACC to the left VTA compared to the control group; and (5) Baduanjin group experienced an increase in gray matter volume in the right ACC compared to the control group. Our results suggest that Baduanjin can significantly modulate intrinsic functional connectivity and the influence of the norepinephrine (LC) and dopamine (VTA) systems. These findings may shed light on the mechanisms of mind-body intervention and aid the development of new treatments for MCI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Temporal Integration of Text Transcripts and Acoustic Features for Alzheimer's Diagnosis Based on Spontaneous Speech</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.642647</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Advances in machine learning (ML) technology have opened new avenues for detection and monitoring of cognitive decline. In this study, a multimodal approach to Alzheimer's dementia detection based on the patient's spontaneous speech is presented. This approach was tested on a standard, publicly available Alzheimer's speech dataset for comparability. The data comprise voice samples from 156 participants (1:1 ratio of Alzheimer's to control), matched by age and gender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials and Methods: A recently developed Active Data Representation (ADR) technique for voice processing was employed as a framework for fusion of acoustic and textual features at sentence and word level. Temporal aspects of textual features were investigated in conjunction with acoustic features in order to shed light on the temporal interplay between paralinguistic (acoustic) and linguistic (textual) aspects of Alzheimer's speech. Combinations between several configurations of ADR features and more traditional bag-of-n-grams approaches were used in an ensemble of classifiers built and evaluated on a standardised dataset containing recorded speech of scene descriptions and textual transcripts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Employing only semantic bag-of-n-grams features, an accuracy of 89.58% was achieved in distinguishing between Alzheimer's patients and healthy controls. Adding temporal and structural information by combining bag-of-n-grams features with ADR audio/textual features, the accuracy could be improved to 91.67% on the test set. An accuracy of 93.75% was achieved through late fusion of the three best feature configurations, which corresponds to a 4.7% improvement over the best result reported in the literature for this dataset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The proposed combination of ADR audio and textual features is capable of successfully modelling temporal aspects of the data. The machine learning approach toward dementia detection achieves best performance when ADR features are combined with strong semantic bag-of-n-grams features. This combination leads to state-of-the-art performance on the AD classification task.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Exploring the Key Genes and Identification of Potential Diagnosis Biomarkers in Alzheimer’s Disease Using Bioinformatics Analysis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.602781</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the major threats of the twenty-first century and lacks available therapy. Identification of novel molecular markers for diagnosis and treatment of AD is urgently demanded, and genetic biomarkers show potential prospects.&lt;/p&gt;Method&lt;p&gt;We identify and intersected differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from five microarray datasets to detect consensus DEGs. Based on these DEGs, we conducted Gene Ontology (GO), performed the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis, constructed a protein—protein interaction (PPI) network, and utilized Cytoscape to identify hub genes. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression was applied to identify potential diagnostic biomarkers. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to investigate the biological functions of the key genes.&lt;/p&gt;Result&lt;p&gt;We identified 608 consensus DEGs, several dysregulated pathways, and 18 hub genes. Sixteen hub genes dysregulated as AD progressed. The diagnostic model of 35 genes was constructed, which has a high area under the curve (AUC) value in both the validation dataset and combined dataset (AUC = 0.992 and AUC = 0.985, respectively). The model can also differentiate mild cognitive impairment and AD patients from controls in two blood datasets. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and WW domain-containing transcription regulator protein 1 (WWTR1), which are associated with the Braak stage, Aβ 42 levels, and β-secretase activity, were identified as critical genes of AD.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our study identified 16 hub genes correlated to the neuropathological stage and 35 potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of AD. WWTR1 were identified as candidate genes for future studies. This study deepens our understanding of the transcriptomic and functional features and provides new potential diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
