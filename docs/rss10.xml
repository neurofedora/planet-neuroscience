Birdsong is a complex vocal communication signal, and like humans, birds need to discriminate between similar sequences of sound with different meanings. The caudal mesopallium (CM) is a cortical-level auditory area implicated in song discrimination. CM neurons respond sparsely to conspecific song and are tolerant of production variability. Intracellular recordings in CM have identified a diversity of intrinsic membrane dynamics, which could contribute to the emergence of these higher-order functional properties. We investigated this hypothesis using a novel linear-dynamical cascade model that incorporated detailed biophysical dynamics to simulate auditory responses to birdsong. Neuron models that included a low-threshold potassium current present in a subset of CM neurons showed increased selectivity and coding efficiency relative to models without this current. These results demonstrate the impact of intrinsic dynamics on sensory coding and the importance of including the biophysical characteristics of neural populations in simulation studies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JCcLbdK_z5k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Genome data, with underlying new knowledge, are accumulating at exponential rate thanks to ever-improving sequencing technologies and the parallel development of dedicated efficient Bioinformatics methods and tools. Advanced Education in Bioinformatics and Genome Analyses is to a large extent not accessible to students in developing countries where endeavors to set up Bioinformatics courses concern most often only basic levels. Here, we report a pioneering pilot experience concerning the design and implementation, from scratch, of a three-months advanced and extensive course in Bioinformatics and Genome Analyses in the Institut Pasteur de Tunis. Most significantly the outcome of the course was upgrading the participants’ skills in Bioinformatics and Genome Analyses to recognized international standards. Here we detail the different steps involved in the implementation of this course as well as the topics covered in the program. The description of this pilot experience might be helpful for the implementation of other similar educational projects, notably in developing countries, aiming to go beyond basics and providing young researchers with high-level skills.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jk3OXkDl4KM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Learning the sequence of influenza A genome assembly during viral replication using point process models and fluorescence in situ hybridization</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/99ZwYvNlJkU/article</link>

Within influenza virus infected cells, viral genomic RNA are selectively packed into progeny virions, which predominantly contain a single copy of 8 viral RNA segments. Intersegmental RNA-RNA interactions are thought to mediate selective packaging of each viral ribonucleoprotein complex (vRNP). Clear evidence of a specific interaction network culminating in the full genomic set has yet to be identified. Using multi-color fluorescence &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization to visualize four vRNP segments within a single cell, we developed image-based models of vRNP-vRNP spatial dependence. These models were used to construct likely sequences of vRNP associations resulting in the full genomic set. Our results support the notion that selective packaging occurs during cytoplasmic transport and identifies the formation of multiple distinct vRNP sub-complexes that likely form as intermediate steps toward full genomic inclusion into a progeny virion. The methods employed demonstrate a statistically driven, model based approach applicable to other interaction and assembly problems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/99ZwYvNlJkU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Neuron-Specific Gene 2 (NSG2) Encodes an AMPA Receptor Interacting Protein That Modulates Excitatory Neurotransmission</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/1/ENEURO.0292-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Neurons have evolved a number of unique protein-coding genes that regulate trafficking of protein complexes within small organelles throughout dendrites and axons. Neuron-specific gene 2 (NSG2) encodes for one of the most abundant proteins in the nervous system during perinatal development. NSG2 belongs to a family of small neuronal endosomal proteins but its function has remained uncharacterized to date. Here, we show that NSG2 is found in discrete punctae restricted to the somatodendritic arbors of developing mouse and human neurons, and a significant proportion of NSG2 punctae colocalize with postsynaptic HOMER1 and surface-expressed AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) at excitatory synapses. Immunoprecipitation revealed that NSG2 physically interacts with both the GluA1 and GluA2 AMPAR subunits in mouse brain. Knock-out of NSG2 in mouse hippocampal neurons selectively impaired the frequency of miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) and caused alterations in PSD95 expression at postsynaptic densities (PSDs). In contrast, NSG2 overexpression caused a significant increase in the amplitude of mEPSCs as well as GluA2 surface expression. Thus, NSG2 functions as an AMPAR-binding protein that is required for normal synapse formation and/or maintenance, and has unique functions compared with other NSG family members.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Isoflurane Inhibits Dopaminergic Synaptic Vesicle Exocytosis Coupled to CaV2.1 and CaV2.2 in Rat Midbrain Neurons</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/1/ENEURO.0278-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Volatile anesthetics affect neuronal signaling by poorly understood mechanisms. Activation of central dopaminergic pathways has been implicated in emergence from general anesthesia. The volatile anesthetic isoflurane differentially inhibits glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic vesicle (SV) exocytosis by reducing presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx without affecting the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-exocytosis relationship, but its effects on dopaminergic exocytosis are unclear. We tested the hypothesis that isoflurane inhibits exocytosis in dopaminergic neurons. We used electrical stimulation or depolarization by elevated extracellular KCl to evoke exocytosis measured by quantitative live-cell fluorescence imaging in cultured rat ventral tegmental area neurons. Using trains of electrically evoked action potentials (APs), isoflurane inhibited exocytosis in dopaminergic neurons to a greater extent (30 ± 4% inhibition; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) than in non-dopaminergic neurons (15 ± 5% inhibition; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.014). Isoflurane also inhibited exocytosis evoked by elevated KCl in dopaminergic neurons (35 ± 6% inhibition; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0007), but not in non-dopaminergic neurons (2 ± 4% inhibition). Pharmacological isolation of presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel subtypes showed that isoflurane inhibited KCl-evoked exocytosis mediated exclusively by either Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 (P/Q-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels; 30 ± 5% inhibition; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0002) or by Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.2 (N-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels; 35 ± 11% inhibition; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.015). Additionally, isoflurane inhibited single AP-evoked Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx by 41 ± 3% and single AP-evoked exocytosis by 34 ± 6%. Comparable reductions in exocytosis and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx were produced by lowering extracellular [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]. Thus, isoflurane inhibits exocytosis from dopaminergic neurons by a mechanism distinct from that in non-dopaminergic neurons involving reduced Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry through Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 and/or Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.2.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: NMNAT Proteins that Limit Wallerian Degeneration Also Regulate Critical Period Plasticity in the Visual Cortex</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/1/ENEURO.0277-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Many brain regions go through critical periods of development during which plasticity is enhanced. These critical periods are associated with extensive growth and retraction of thalamocortical and intracortical axons. Here, we investigated whether a signaling pathway that is central in Wallerian axon degeneration also regulates critical period plasticity in the primary visual cortex (V1). Wallerian degeneration is characterized by rapid disintegration of axons once they are separated from the cell body. This degenerative process is initiated by reduced presence of cytoplasmic nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferases (NMNATs) and is strongly delayed in mice overexpressing cytoplasmic NMNAT proteins, such as Wld&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt; mutant mice producing a UBE4b-NMNAT1 fusion protein or NMNAT3 transgenic mice. Here, we provide evidence that in Wld&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt; mice and NMNAT3 transgenic mice, ocular dominance (OD) plasticity in the developing visual cortex is reduced. This deficit is only observed during the second half of the critical period. Additionally, we detect an early increase of visual acuity in the V1 of Wld&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt; mice. We do not find evidence for Wallerian degeneration occurring during OD plasticity. Our findings suggest that NMNATs do not only regulate Wallerian degeneration during pathological conditions but also control cellular events that mediate critical period plasticity during the physiological development of the cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25411?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To validate imaging features able to discriminate neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders from multiple sclerosis with conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this cross‐sectional study, brain and spinal cord scans were evaluated from 116 neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder patients (98 seropositive and 18 seronegative) in chronic disease phase and 65 age‐, sex‐, and disease duration–matched multiple sclerosis patients. To identify independent predictors of neuromyelitis optica diagnosis, after assessing the prevalence of typical/atypical findings, the original cohort was 2:1 randomized in a training sample (where a multivariate logistic regression analysis was run) and a validation sample (where the performance of the selected variables was tested and validated).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typical brain lesions occurred in 50.9% of neuromyelitis optica patients (18.1% brainstem periventricular/periaqueductal, 32.7% periependymal along lateral ventricles, 3.4% large hemispheric, 6.0% diencephalic, 4.3% corticospinal tract), 72.2% had spinal cord lesions (46.3% long transverse myelitis, 36.1% short transverse myelitis), 37.1% satisfied 2010 McDonald criteria, and none had cortical lesions. Fulfillment of at least 2 of 5 of absence of juxtacortical/cortical lesions, absence of periventricular lesions, absence of Dawson fingers, presence of long transverse myelitis, and presence of periependymal lesions along lateral ventricles discriminated neuromyelitis optica patients in both training (sensitivity = 0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.84–0.97; specificity = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.78–0.97) and validation samples (sensitivity = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.66–0.92; specificity = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.71–0.99). MRI findings and criteria performance were similar irrespective of serostatus.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although up to 50% of neuromyelitis optica patients have no typical lesions and a relatively high percentage of them satisfy multiple sclerosis criteria, several easily applicable imaging features can help to distinguish neuromyelitis optica from multiple sclerosis.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;High levels of antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) are observed in patients with different neurological disorders, but cells producing these autoantibodies are largely unexplored. We detect circulating GAD‐reactive B cells in peripheral blood that readily differentiate into antibody‐producing cells. These cells are highly elevated in most patients with GAD‐antibody–associated disorders (n = 15) compared to controls (n = 19). They mainly produce GAD65 antibodies of the IgG1 and IgG4 subclasses and are as abundant as B cells reactive for common recall antigens. Bone marrow cells represent an additional source of GAD antibodies. The identification of GAD‐antibody–producing cells has implications for the selection of cell‐specific biologics.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Diamond nano-pillar arrays for quantum microscopy of neuronal signals. (arXiv:1901.08743v1 [quant-ph])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08743</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Modern neuroscience is currently limited in its capacity to perform long
term, wide-field measurements of neuron electromagnetics with nanoscale
resolution. Quantum microscopy using the nitrogen vacancy centre (NV) can
provide a potential solution to this problem with electric and magnetic field
sensing at nano-scale resolution and good biocompatibility. However, the
performance of existing NV sensing technology does not allow for studies of
small mammalian neurons yet. In this paper, we propose a solution to this
problem by engineering NV quantum sensors in diamond nanopillar arrays. The
pillars improve light collection efficiency by guiding excitation/emission
light, which improves sensitivity. More importantly, they also improve the size
of the signal at the NV by removing screening charges as well as coordinating
the neuron growth to the tips of the pillars where the NV is located. Here, we
provide a growth study to demonstrate coordinated neuron growth as well as the
first simulation of nano-scopic neuron electric and magnetic fields to assess
the enhancement provided by the nanopillar geometry.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Ablation Studies in Artificial Neural Networks. (arXiv:1901.08644v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08644</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ablation studies have been widely used in the field of neuroscience to tackle
complex biological systems such as the extensively studied Drosophila central
nervous system, the vertebrate brain and more interestingly and most
delicately, the human brain. In the past, these kinds of studies were utilized
to uncover structure and organization in the brain, i.e. a mapping of features
inherent to external stimuli onto different areas of the neocortex. considering
the growth in size and complexity of state-of-the-art artificial neural
networks (ANNs) and the corresponding growth in complexity of the tasks that
are tackled by these networks, the question arises whether ablation studies may
be used to investigate these networks for a similar organization of their inner
representations. In this paper, we address this question and performed two
ablation studies in two fundamentally different ANNs to investigate their inner
representations of two well-known benchmark datasets from the computer vision
domain. We found that features distinct to the local and global structure of
the data are selectively represented in specific parts of the network.
Furthermore, some of these representations are redundant, awarding the network
a certain robustness to structural damages. We further determined the
importance of specific parts of the network for the classification task solely
based on the weight structure of single units. Finally, we examined the ability
of damaged networks to recover from the consequences of ablations by means of
recovery training. We argue that ablations studies are a feasible method to
investigate knowledge representations in ANNs and are especially helpful to
examine a networks robustness to structural damages, a feature of ANNs that
will become increasingly important for future safety-critical applications.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02910</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Extended Kalman filter (EKF) does not guarantee consistent mean and
covariance under linearization, even though it is the main framework for
robotic localization. While Lie group improves the modeling of the state space
in localization, the EKF on Lie group still relies on the arbitrary Gaussian
assumption in face of nonlinear models. We instead use von Mises filter for
orientation estimation together with the conventional Kalman filter for
position estimation, and thus we are able to characterize the first two moments
of the state estimates. Since the proposed algorithm holds a solid
probabilistic basis, it is fundamentally relieved from the inconsistency
problem. Furthermore, we extend the localization algorithm to fully circular
representation even for position, which is similar to grid patterns found in
mammalian brains and in recurrent neural networks. The applicability of the
proposed algorithms is substantiated not only by strong mathematical foundation
but also by the comparison against other common localization methods.

	<content:encoded>Case fatality rates in severe falciparum malaria depend on the pattern and degree of vital organ dysfunction. Recent large-scale case-control analyses of pooled severe malaria data reported that glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PDd) was protective against cerebral malaria but increased the risk of severe malarial anaemia. A novel formulation of the balancing selection hypothesis was proposed as an explanation for these findings, whereby the selective advantage is driven by the competing risks of death from cerebral malaria and death from severe malarial anaemia. We re-analysed these claims using causal diagrams and showed that they are subject to collider bias. A simulation based sensitivity analysis, varying the strength of the known effect of G6PDd on anaemia, showed that this bias is sufficient to explain all of the observed association. Future genetic epidemiology studies in severe malaria would benefit from the use of causal reasoning.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Neurons recorded in behaving animals often do not discernibly respond to sensory input and are not overtly task-modulated. These non-classically responsive neurons are difficult to interpret and are typically neglected from analysis, confounding attempts to connect neural activity to perception and behavior. Here we describe a trial-by-trial, spike-timing-based algorithm to reveal the coding capacities of these neurons in auditory and frontal cortex of behaving rats. Classically responsive and non-classically responsive cells contained significant information about sensory stimuli and behavioral decisions. Stimulus category was more accurately represented in frontal cortex than auditory cortex, via ensembles of non-classically responsive cells coordinating the behavioral meaning of spike timings on correct but not error trials. This unbiased approach allows the contribution of all recorded neurons – particularly those without obvious task-related, trial-averaged firing rate modulation – to be assessed for behavioral relevance on single trials.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/42001</link>
	<content:encoded>Most replicative helicases are hexameric, ring-shaped motor proteins that translocate on and unwind DNA. Despite extensive biochemical and structural investigations, how their translocation activity is utilized chemo-mechanically in DNA unwinding is poorly understood. We examined DNA unwinding by G40P, a DnaB-family helicase, using a single-molecule fluorescence assay with a single base pair resolution. The high-resolution assay revealed that G40P by itself is a very weak helicase that stalls at barriers as small as a single GC base pair and unwinds DNA with the step size of a single base pair. Binding of a single ATPgS could stall unwinding, demonstrating highly coordinated ATP hydrolysis between six identical subunits. We observed frequent slippage of the helicase, which is fully suppressed by the primase DnaG. We anticipate that these findings allow a better understanding on the fine balance of thermal fluctuation activation and energy derived from hydrolysis.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/41623</link>
	<content:encoded>Midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons migrate to form the laterally-located substantia nigra pars compacta (SN) and medially-located ventral tegmental area (VTA), but little is known about the underlying cellular and molecular processes. Here we visualize the dynamic cell morphologies of tangentially migrating SN-mDA neurons in 3D and identify two distinct migration modes. Slow migration is the default mode in SN-mDA neurons, while fast, laterally-directed migration occurs infrequently and is strongly associated with bipolar cell morphology. Tangential migration of SN-mDA neurons is altered in absence of Reelin signaling, but it is unclear whether Reelin acts directly on migrating SN-mDA neurons and how it affects their cell morphology and migratory behavior. By specifically inactivating Reelin signaling in mDA neurons we demonstrate its direct role in SN-mDA tangential migration. Reelin promotes laterally-biased movements in mDA neurons during their slow migration mode, stabilizes leading process morphology and increases the probability of fast, laterally-directed migration.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>In stereotyped neuronal networks, synaptic connectivity is dictated by cell surface proteins, which assign unique identities to neurons, and physically mediate axon guidance and synapse targeting. We recently identified two groups of immunoglobulin superfamily proteins in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, Dprs and DIPs, as strong candidates for synapse targeting functions. Here, we uncover the molecular basis of specificity in Dpr–DIP mediated cellular adhesions and neuronal connectivity. First, we present five crystal structures of Dpr–DIP and DIP–DIP complexes, highlighting the evolutionary and structural origins of diversification in Dpr and DIP proteins and their interactions. We further show that structures can be used to rationally engineer receptors with novel specificities or modified affinities, which can be used to study specific circuits that require Dpr–DIP interactions to help establish connectivity. We investigate one pair, engineered Dpr10 and DIP-α, for function in the neuromuscular circuit in flies, and reveal roles for homophilic and heterophilic binding in wiring.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/40292</link>
	<content:encoded>Cell lineages provide the framework for understanding how cell fates are decided during development. Describing cell lineages in most organisms is challenging; even a fruit fly larva has ~50,000 cells and a small mammal has &amp;gt;1 billion cells. Recently, the idea of applying CRISPR to induce mutations during development, to be used as heritable markers for lineage reconstruction, has been proposed by several groups. While an attractive idea, its practical value depends on the accuracy of the cell lineages that can be generated. Here, we use computer simulations to estimate the performance of these approaches under different conditions. We incorporate empirical data on CRISPR-induced mutation frequencies in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. We show significant impacts from multiple biological and technical parameters - variable cell division rates, skewed mutational outcomes, target dropouts and different sequencing strategies. Our approach reveals the limitations of published CRISPR recorders, and indicates how future implementations can be optimised.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The accuracy of electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) is challenged by overlapping sources from within the brain. This lack of accuracy is a severe limitation to the possibilities and reliability of modern stimulation protocols in basic research and clinical diagnostics. As a solution, we here introduce a theory of stochastic neuronal spike timing probability densities for describing the large-scale spiking activity in neural networks, and a novel spike density component analysis (SCA) method for isolating specific neural sources. Three studies are conducted based on 564 cases of evoked responses to auditory stimuli from 94 human subjects each measured with 60 EEG electrodes and 306 MEG sensors. In the first study we show that the large-scale spike timing (but not non-encephalographic artifacts) in MEG/EEG waveforms can be modeled with Gaussian probability density functions with high accuracy (median 99.7%-99.9% variance explained), while gamma and sine functions fail describing the MEG and EEG waveforms. In the second study we confirm that SCA can isolate a specific evoked response of interest. Our findings indicate that the mismatch negativity (MMN) response is accurately isolated with SCA, while principal component analysis (PCA) fails supressing interference from overlapping brain activity, e.g. from P3a and alpha waves, and independent component analysis (ICA) distorts the evoked response. Finally, we confirm that SCA accurately reveals inter-individual variation in evoked brain responses, by replicating findings relating individual traits with MMN variations. The findings of this paper suggest that the commonly overlapping neural sources in single-subject or patient data can be more accurately separated by applying the introduced theory of large-scale spike timing and method of SCA, when compared to PCA and ICA.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/532374v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Scaffold proteins are responsible for structural organisation within cells; they form complexes with other proteins to facilitate signalling pathways and catalytic reactions. The scaffold protein connector enhancer of kinase suppressor of Ras 2 (CNK2) is predominantly expressed in neural tissues and was recently implicated in X-linked intellectual disability (ID). We have investigated the role of CNK2 in neurons in order to contribute to our understanding of how CNK2 alterations might cause developmental defects, and we have elucidated a functional role for CNK2 in the molecular processes that govern morphology of the postsynaptic density (PSD). We have also identified novel CNK2 interaction partners and explored their functional interdependency with CNK2. We focussed on the novel interaction partner TRAF2- and NCK-interacting kinase TNIK, which is also associated with ID. Both CNK2 and TNIK are expressed in neuronal dendrites and concentrated in dendritic spines, and staining with synaptic markers indicates a clear postsynaptic localisation. Importantly, our data highlight that CNK2 plays a role in directing TNIK subcellular localisation, and in neurons, CNK2 participates in ensuring that this multifunctional kinase is present at desirable levels at synaptic sites. In summary, our data indicate that CNK2 expression is critical for modulating PSD morphology; moreover, our study highlights a role for CNK2 in directing the localisation of regulatory proteins within the cell. Importantly, we describe a novel link between CNK2 and the regulatory kinase TNIK, and provide evidence supporting the idea that these proteins play complementary roles in the regulation of dendritic spine growth and maintenance.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/532291v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Neuroinflammation is a key part of the etio-pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. We test the relationship between neuroinflammation and the disruption of functional connectivity in large-scale networks, and their joint influence on cognitive impairment. We combined [11C]PK11195 positron emission tomography (PET) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) in 28 humans (13 females/15 males) with clinical diagnosis of probable Alzheimer[prime]s disease or mild cognitive impairment with positive PET biomarker for amyloid, and 14 age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy humans (8 females/6 males). Source-based 'inflammetry' was used to extract principal components of [11C]PK11195 PET signal variance across all participants. rs-fMRI data were pre-processed via independent component analyses to classify neuronal and non-neuronal signals. Multiple linear regression models identified sources of signal co-variance between neuroinflammation and brain connectivity profiles, in relation to group and cognitive status. Patients showed significantly higher [11C]PK11195 binding relative to controls, in a distributed spatial pattern including the hippocampus, medial, and inferior temporal cortex. Patients with enhanced loading on this [11C]PK11195 binding distribution displayed diffuse abnormal functional connectivity. The expression of a stronger association between such abnormal connectivity and higher levels of neuroinflammation correlated with worse cognitive deficits. Our study suggests that neuroinflammation relates to the pathophysiological changes in network function that underlie cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease. Neuroinflammation, and its association with functionally-relevant reorganisation of brain networks, is proposed as a target for emerging immuno-therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing or slowing the emergence of dementia.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/532127v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective: To investigate whether or not functional connectivity (FC) could be used as a potential biomarker for classification of primary insomnia (PI) at the individual level by using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA). Methods: Thirty-eight drug-naive patients with PI and 44 healthy controls (HC) underwent resting-state functional MR imaging. Three commonly used FC metrics were calculated for each participant. We used the MVPA framework using linear support vector machine (SVM) with the three types of metrics as features separately. Subsequently, an unbiased N-fold cross-validation strategy was used to generate a classification system and was then used to evaluate its classification performances. Finally, FC metrics with significant high classification performance were compared between the two groups and were correlated with clinical characteristics, i.e., Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS). Results: The best classifier could reach up to an accuracy of 81.5%, with sensitivity of 84.9%, specificity of 79.1% and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 83.0% (all P &amp;lt; 0.001). Right fronto-insular cortex, left precuneus and left middle frontal gyrus showed high classification weights. In addition, right fronto-insular cortex and left middle frontal gyrus were the overlapping regions between MVPA and group comparison. Correlation analysis showed that functional connectivity strength (FCS) in left middle frontal gyrus and head of right caudate nucleus were correlated with PSQI and SDS respectively. Conclusion: The current study suggests abnormal FCS might serve as a potential neuromarkers for PI.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The perception of the noisy visual world around us naturally combines geometry and probability with psychophysics. So how do we perceive geometric objects from a probabilistic perspective, i.e. infer randomness in a spatial setting? To test this psychophysically, we use a set of simple experiments to distinguish between probability distributions of planar line images connected with Buffon's needle and Bertrand's paradox, two classic exemplars of geometric probability. We find that participants associate greater randomness with images that are invariant under the sub-groups of translation, rotation, and scale. An information theoretic framework centered around the Radon (Hough) transform captures the observed behavioral results, and suggests that symmetry and chance are embedded in human visual perception.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Resting-state fMRI Signals of Intelligent People Wander in a Larger Space</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/529362v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Natural intelligence is one of the vastly explored research areas in cognitive science. Its evolution and manifestation through behavioral patterns in animal kingdom have been extensively investigated. Since early days of cognitive sciences, there have been considerable efforts to simulate intelligent behaviors through high-level cognitive models. In the framework of the computational theory of mind, production systems are top-down models which simulate intelligent behaviors by invoking their behavioral manifestations. These models describe an intelligent behavior as structured mental programming which decomposes a complex task into simpler independent parts, each one represented by a cognitive enclosure where attention is sequentially devoted, and finally the information obtained from all cognitive enclosures is integrated to accomplish the task. In this article, we investigate the relations between these models of intelligence and resting-state fMRI signals. Based on these models, we hypothesize that the capacity of distinct mental representations is the core feature of intelligent behaviors. Therefore, we reason that resting-state fMRI signals of intelligent individuals wander in a larger space and can be divided to more well-separated independent components. This may be interpreted as the functional equivalence of one of the most celebrated structural correlates of intelligence, its positive association with the total brain volume. In the general framework of topological data analysis, using a well-established non-linear dimensionality reduction method, we show that indeed resting-state fMRI signals of intelligent individuals occupy a larger space and can be divided to more well-separated components with less connections in the reduced two-dimensional space. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to relate the functional space of resting-state fMRI signals with the behavioral signatures of the human intelligence.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Cognitive faculties such as imagination, planning, and decision-making require the ability to represent alternative scenarios. In animals, split-second decision-making implies that the brain can represent alternatives at a commensurate speed. Yet despite this insight, it has remained unknown whether there exists neural activity that can consistently represent alternatives in &amp;lt;1 s. Here we report that neural activity in the hippocampus, a brain structure vital to cognition, can regularly cycle between representations of alternative locations (bifurcating paths in a maze) at 8 Hz. This cycling dynamic was paced by the internally generated 8 Hz theta rhythm, often occurred in the absence of overt deliberative behavior, and unexpectedly also governed an additional hippocampal representation defined by alternatives (heading direction). These findings implicate a fast, regular, and generalized neural mechanism underlying the representation of competing possibilities.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Developmental Changes in Movement Related Brain Activity in Early Childhood</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/531905v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In a previous MEG study of movement-related brain activity in preschool age children, we reported that pre-movement fields and sensorimotor cortex oscillations differed from those typically observed in adults, suggesting that maturation of cortical motor networks is still incomplete by late preschool age (Cheyne et al., 2014). Here we describe the same measurements in an older group of school-aged children (6 to 8 years old) and an adult control group, in addition to repeated recordings in seven children from the original study approximately two years later. Differences were observed both longitudinally within children and between age groups. Pre-movement (readiness) fields were still not present in the oldest children, however both frequency and magnitude of movement-related mu (8-12Hz) and beta (15-30Hz) oscillations demonstrated linear increases with age. In contrast, movement-evoked gamma synchronization demonstrated a step-like transition from low (30-50 Hz) to high (70-90 Hz) narrow-band oscillations, and this occurred at different ages in different children. These data provide novel evidence of linear and non-linear changes in motor cortex oscillations and delayed development of the readiness field throughout early childhood. Individual children showed large differences in maturation of movement-related brain activity, possibly reflecting differing rates of motor development.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/531871v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Suicide and major depression (MDD) are more prevalent in individuals reporting early life adversity (ELA). Prefrontal cortex volume is reduced by stress acutely and progressively in vivo, and changes in neuron and glia density are reported in depressed suicide decedents. We previously found reduced levels of the neurotrophic factor BDNF in suicide decedents and with ELA, and in the present study we sought to determine whether cortex thickness, neuron density or glia density in the dorsolateral prefrontal (BA9) and anterior cingulate (BA24) cortex are associated with ELA or suicide. Methods: A total of 52 brains, constituting 13 quadruplets of nonpsychiatric nonsuicide controls and MDD suicide decedents with and without ELA (n=13/group), all with psychological autopsy, were matched for age, sex and postmortem interval. Brains were collected at autopsy and frozen and blocks containing BA9 and BA24 were later dissected, post-fixed and sectioned. Sections were immunostained for NeuN to label neurons and counterstained with thionin to stain glial cell nuclei. Cortex thickness, neuron and glial density and neuron volume were measured by stereology. Results: Cortical thickness was 6% less with an ELA history in BA9 and 12% less in BA24 (p&amp;lt;0.05), but not in depressed suicide decedents in either BA9 or BA24. Neuron density was not different in ELA or in suicide decedents, but glial density was 17% greater with ELA history in BA9 and 15% greater in BA24, but not in suicides. Neuron volume was not different with ELA or suicide. Discussion: Reported ELA, but not the stress associated with suicide, is associated with thinner prefrontal cortex and greater glia density in adulthood. ELA may alter normal neurodevelopment and contribute to suicide risk.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/531830v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Neuroimaging techniques are increasingly used to study brain cognition in humans. Beyond their individual activation, the functional associations between brain areas have become a standard proxy to describe how information is distributed across the brain network. Among the many analysis tools available, dynamic models of brain activity have been developed to overcome the limitations of original connectivity measures such as functional connectivity. In particular, much effort has been devoted to the assessment of directional interactions between brain areas from their observed activity. This paper summarizes our recent approach to analyze fMRI data based on our whole-brain effective connectivity referred to as MOU-EC, while discussing the pros and cons of its underlying assumptions with respect to other established approaches. Once tuned, the model provides a connectivity measure that reflects the dynamical state of BOLD activity obtained using fMRI, which can be used to explore the brain cognition. We focus on two important applications. First, as a connectivity measure, MOU-EC can be used to extract biomarkers for task-specific brain coordination, understood as the patterns of areas exchanging information. The multivariate nature of connectivity measures raises several challenges for whole-brain analysis, for which machine-learning tools presents some advantages over statistical testing. Second, we show how to interpret changes in MOU-EC connections in a collective and model-based manner, bridging with network analysis. To illustrate our framework, we use a dataset where subjects were recorded in two conditions, watching a movie and a black screen (referred to as rest). Our framework provides a comprehensive set of tools that open exciting perspectives for the study of distributed cognition, as well as neuropathologies.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Long-term synaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurogliaform interneurons</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/531822v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Hippocampal interneurons located within stratum lacunosum-moleculare (SLM), which include neurogliaform (NGF) cells, mediate powerful feed-forward inhibition that can modulate spiking and plasticity in CA1 pyramidal cells. Despite evidence of long-term plasticity at excitatory inputs onto almost all other hippocampal interneuron subtypes, including stratum radiatum feed-forward interneurons, it is not known whether long-term potentiation (LTP) occurs in CA1 SLM interneurons. Here, we show that these interneurons exhibit Hebbian NMDA receptor-dependent LTP, and that Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels can also be sufficient for induction of plasticity. Furthermore, using an optogenetic dissection strategy, we find that selective stimulation of excitatory fibers from entorhinal cortex can induce LTP in SLM interneurons, whilst stimulation of thalamic afferents from the nucleus reuniens, also known to project to SLM, does not. Finally, we show that a mouse line selective for cortical NGF cells, where Cre recombinase is under the control of the neuron-derived neurotrophic factor (NDNF) promoter, can also be used to target these interneurons within the hippocampus, and that hippocampal NGF cells exhibit LTP. Recruitment of NGF cells can thus be persistently enhanced in an activity-dependent manner, implying that their role in gating dendritic signaling in pyramidal neurons is modifiable.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/531699v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective: Cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation (ctDCS) is challenging due to the complexity of the cerebellar structure. Therefore, our objective is to develop a freely available computational pipeline to perform cerebellar atlas-based electric field analysis using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided subject-specific head modeling. Methods: We present a freely available computational pipeline to determine subject-specific lobular electric field distribution during ctDCS. The computational pipeline can isolate subject-specific cerebellar lobules based on a spatially unbiased atlas (SUIT) for the cerebellum, and then calculates the lobular electric field distribution during ctDCS. The computational pipeline was tested in a case study using a subject-specific head model as well as using a Colin 27 Average Brain. The 5cmx5cm anode was placed 3 cm lateral to inion, and the same sized cathode was placed on the contralateral supra-orbital area (called Manto montage) and buccinators muscle (called Celnik montage). A 4x1 HD-ctDCS electrode montage was also implemented for a comparison using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: Eta-squared effect size after three-way ANOVA for electric field strength was 0.05 for lobule, 0.00 for montage, 0.04 for head model, 0.01 for lobule*montage interaction, 0.01 for lobule* head model interaction, and 0.00 for montage*head model interaction in case of Enorm. Here, the electric field strength of both the Celnik and the Manto montages affected the lobules Crus II, VIIb, VIII, IX of the targeted cerebellar hemispheres while Manto montage had more bilateral effect. The HD-ctDCS montage primarily affected the lobules Crus I, Crus II, VIIb of the targeted cerebellar hemisphere. Our freely available computational modeling approach to analyze subject-specific lobular electric field distribution during ctDCS provided an insight into healthy human anodal ctDCS results.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Prefrontal oscillations modulate the propagation of neuronal activity required for working memory</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/531574v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Cognition involves using attended information (e.g., stimuli, rules, responses), maintained in working memory (WM), to guide action. During a cognitive task, a correct response requires flexible, selective gating so that only the appropriate information flows at the proper time from WM to downstream effectors that carry out the response. Much evidence suggests that WM information is encoded in the firing rates of populations of neurons in prefrontal cortex (PFC). At the same time, many experiments have demonstrated separate, task-related modulation of oscillatory dynamics in PFC networks. In this work, we used biophysically-detailed modeling to explore the hypothesis that network oscillations, leveraging lateral inhibition, can independently gate responses to rate-coded items in working memory. Consistent with recent data, we modeled the superficial layers of PFC as a WM buffer that stores task-relevant information and the deep layers of PFC as an output gate that flexibly governs which information in the WM buffer is propagated downstream to guide action. Items in WM were stored in populations of neurons that had either asynchronous spiking or correlated spiking that was modulated at fast beta/gamma oscillation frequencies. We found that whichever WM item induced a response in the output gate with the shortest period between spike volleys would be most reliably propagated through the output gate. Furthermore, the output gate exhibited network resonance capable of selectively propagating items with resonant oscillatory modulation. We found that network resonance of the deep layer gate can be flexibly tuned by varying the excitability of deep layer principal cells. Our results demonstrate that the propagation of WM-associated neuronal activity can be modulated by tuning either the oscillatory properties of populations encoding WM items, themselves, or the resonant properties of the output gate through which item-encoding activity must propagate to reach downstream effectors. In our PFC model, these dynamics reveal how population rate-coded items embedded in superficial beta and gamma oscillations can be alternately selected by tuning network resonance in the deep layers of PFC depending on task demands. Thus, our model predicts that the experimentally-observed modulation of PFC beta and gamma oscillations could leverage network resonance and lateral inhibition to govern the flexible routing of signals in service of cognitive processes like gating outputs from working memory and the selection of rule-based actions.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/531392v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>A fundamental challenge for behavioral neuroscientists is to represent inherent variability among animals accurately without compromising the ability to quantify differences between conditions. We developed two new methods that apply curve and shape alignment techniques to address this issue. As a proof-of-concept we applied these methods to compare normal or alarmed behavior in pairs of medaka (Oryzias latipes). The curve alignment method we call Behavioral Distortion Distance (BDD) revealed that alarmed fish display less predictable swimming over time, even if individuals incorporate the same action patterns like immobility, sudden changes in swimming trajectory, or changing their position in the water column. The Conformal Spatiotemporal Distance (CSD) technique on the other hand revealed that, in spite of the unpredictability, alarmed individuals share an overall swim pattern, possibly accounting for the widely held notion of 'stereotypy' in alarm responses. More generally, we propose that these new applications of known computational geometric techniques are useful in combination to represent, compare, and quantify complex behaviors consisting of common action patterns that differ in duration, sequence, or frequency</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Is removal of weak connections necessary for graph-theoretical analysis of dense weighted structural connectomes?</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/531350v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Recent advances in diffusion MRI tractography permit the generation of dense weighted structural connectomes that offer greater insight into brain organization. However, these efforts are hampered by the lack of consensus on how to extract topological measures from the resulting graphs. Here we evaluate the common practice of removing the graphs' weak connections, which is primarily intended to eliminate spurious connections and emphasize strong connections. Because this processing step requires arbitrary or heuristic-based choices (e.g., setting a threshold level below which connections are removed), and such choices might complicate statistical analysis and inter-study comparisons, in this work we test whether removing weak connections is indeed necessary. To this end, we systematically evaluated the effect of removing weak connections on a range of popular graph-theoretical metrics. Specifically, we investigated if (and at what extent) removal of weak connections introduces a statistically significant difference between two otherwise equal groups of healthy subjects when only applied to one of the groups. Using data from the Human Connectome Project, we found that removal of weak connections had no statistical effect even when removing the weakest ~70-90% connections. Removing yet a larger extent of weak connections, thus reducing connectivity density even further, did produce a predictably significant effect. However, metric values became sensitive to the exact connectivity density, which has ramifications regarding the stability of the statistical analysis. This pattern persisted whether connections were removed by connection strength threshold or connectivity density, and for connectomes generated using parcellations at different resolutions. Finally, we showed that the same pattern also applies for data from a clinical-grade MRI scanner. In conclusion, our analysis revealed that removing weak connections is not necessary for graph-theoretical analysis of dense weighted connectomes. Because removal of weak connections provides no practical utility to offset the undesirable requirement for arbitrary or heuristic-based choices, we recommend that this step is avoided in future studies.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/531293v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Nonhuman primate models (NHP) are commonly used to advance our understanding of brain function and organization. However, to date, they have offered few insights into individual differences among NHPs. In large part, this is due to the logistical challenges of NHP research, which limit most studies to five subjects or fewer. Methods: We leveraged the availability of a large-scale open NHP imaging resource to provide an initial examination of individual differences in the functional organization of the nonhuman primate brain. Specifically, we selected one awake fMRI dataset (Newcastle: n = 10) and two anesthetized fMRI data sets (Oxford: n = 19; UC-Davis: n = 19) to examine individual differences in functional connectivity characteristics across the cortex, as well as potential state dependencies. Results: We noted significant individual variations of functional connectivity across the macaque cortex. Similar to the findings in human, during the awake state, the primary sensory and motor cortices showed lower variability than the high-order association regions. This variability pattern was significantly correlated with T1w/T2w map, the degree of long-distance connectivity, but not short-distance connectivity. However, the inter-individual variability under anesthesia exhibited a very distinct pattern, with lower variability in medial frontal cortex, precuneus and somatomotor regions and higher variability in the lateral ventral frontal and insular cortices. Conclusions: This work has implications for our understanding of the evolutionary origins of individual variation in the human brain, as well as methodological implications that must be considered in any pursuit to study individual variation in NHP models.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Multimodal sensory integration facilitates the generation of a unified and coherent perception of the environment. It is now well established that unimodal sensory perceptions, such as vision, are improved in multisensory contexts. While multimodal integration is primarily performed by dedicated multisensory brain regions such as the association cortices or the superior colliculus, recent studies have shown that multisensory interactions also occur in primary sensory cortices. In particular, sounds were shown to modulate the responses of neurons located in layers 2/3 (L2/3) of the mouse primary visual cortex (V1). Yet, the net effect of sound modulation at the V1 population level remained unclear. Here, we performed two-photon calcium imaging in awake mice to compare the representation of the orientation and the direction of drifting gratings by V1 L2/3 neurons in unimodal (visual only) or multi-modal (audiovisual) conditions. We found that sound modulation depended on the tuning properties (orientation and direction selectivity) and response amplitudes of V1 L2/3 neurons. Sounds potentiated the responses of neurons that were highly tuned to the cue orientation and direction but weakly active in the unimodal context, following the principle of inverse effectiveness of multimodal integration. Moreover, sound suppressed the responses of neurons untuned for the orientation and/or the direction of the visual cue. Altogether, sound modulation improved the representation of the orientation and direction of the visual stimulus in V1 L2/3. Namely, visual stimuli presented with auditory stimuli recruited a neuronal population better tuned to the visual stimulus orientation and direction than when presented alone.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/531186v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Sleep can be distinguished from wake by changes in brain electrical activity, typically assessed using electroencephalography (EEG). The hallmark of non-rapid-eye-movement sleep are two major EEG events: slow waves and spindles. Here we sought to identify possible signatures of sleep in brain hemodynamic activity, using simultaneous fMRI-EEG. We found that, during the transition from wake to sleep, blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) activity evolved from a mixed-frequency pattern to one dominated by two distinct oscillations: a low-frequency (~0.05Hz) oscillation prominent in light sleep and a high-frequency (~0.17Hz) oscillation in deep sleep. The two BOLD oscillations correlated with the occurrences of spindles and slow waves, respectively. They were detectable across the whole brain, cortically and subcortically, but had different regional distributions and opposite onset patterns. These spontaneous BOLD oscillations provide fMRI signatures of basic sleep processes, which may be employed to study human sleep at spatial resolution and brain coverage not achievable using EEG.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Loss of one Engrailed1 allele enhances induced α-synucleinopathy</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/530915v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Parkinsons disease (PD) is a synucleinopathy that has multiple neuropathological characteristics, with nigrostriatal dopamine system degeneration being a core feature. Current models of PD pathology typically fail to recapitulate several attributes of the pathogenic process and neuropathology. We aimed to define the effects of combining a mouse model exhibiting multiple PD-like changes with intrastriatal injections of -synuclein (-syn) pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) aggregates. We employed the heterozygous Engrailed 1 (En1+/-) mouse that features several pathophysiological hallmarks of clinical PD. Objective: To test the hypothesis that the neuropathological changes in the En1+/- mice will promote formation of -syn aggregates following intrastriatal injections of pathogenic human -syn PFFs. Methods: We unilaterally injected PFFs into the striata of 1 month-old En1+/- and control wild-type mice and euthanized animals at 3 months for post-mortem analysis. Results: Using immunohistochemistry and unbiased stereology, we established that PFF-injected En1+/- mice exhibited a near-threefold increase in pS129--syn-positive neurons in the substantia nigra compared to PFF-injected wild-type mice. The PFF-injected En1+/- mice also displayed significant increases in pS129--syn-positive neurons in the amygdala and ventral tegmental area; regions of known PD pathology with projections to the striatum. Additionally, we observed amplified pS129--syn-positive aggregation in En1+/- mice in multiple cortical regions. Conclusions: Following intrastriatal injection of PFFs, absence of an En1 allele leads to additional aggregation of pathological -syn, potentially due to En1-loss mediated nigrostriatal impairment. We propose that further development of this double-hit model could be predictive of pre-clinical therapeutic potential and success for PD than existing mouse models.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/530808v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Visuo-vestibular integration is crucial for locomotion, yet cortical mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. We combined binaural monopolar galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to characterize the cortical networks activated during antero-posterior and lateral stimulations in humans. We focused on functional areas that selectively respond to egomotion-consistent optic flow patterns: the human middle temporal complex (hMT+), V6, the ventral intraparietal (VIP) area, the cingulate sulcus visual (CSv) area and the posterior insular cortex (PIC). Areas hMT+, CSv, and PIC were equivalently responsive during lateral and antero-posterior GVS while areas VIP and V6 were highly activated during antero-posterior GVS but remained silent during lateral GVS. Using psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses, we confirmed that a cortical network including areas V6 and VIP is engaged during antero-posterior GVS. Our results suggest that V6 and VIP play a specific role in processing multisensory signals specific to locomotion during navigation.</content:encoded>

During spatial navigation, the frequency and timing of spikes from spatial neurons including place cells in hippocampus and grid cells in medial entorhinal cortex are temporally organized by continuous theta oscillations (6–11 Hz). The theta rhythm is regulated by subcortical structures including the medial septum, but it is unclear how spatial information from place cells may reciprocally organize subcortical theta-rhythmic activity. Here we recorded single-unit spiking from a constellation of subcortical and hippocampal sites to study spatial modulation of rhythmic spike timing in rats freely exploring an open environment. Our analysis revealed a novel class of neurons that we termed ‘phaser cells,’ characterized by a symmetric coupling between firing rate and spike theta-phase. Phaser cells encoded space by assigning distinct phases to allocentric isocontour levels of each cell’s spatial firing pattern. In our dataset, phaser cells were predominantly located in the lateral septum, but also the hippocampus, anteroventral thalamus, lateral hypothalamus, and nucleus accumbens. Unlike the unidirectional late-to-early phase precession of place cells, bidirectional phase modulation acted to return phaser cells to the same theta-phase along a given spatial isocontour, including cells that characteristically shifted to later phases at higher firing rates. Our dynamical models of intrinsic theta-bursting neurons demonstrated that experience-independent temporal coding mechanisms can qualitatively explain (1) the spatial rate-phase relationships of phaser cells and (2) the observed temporal segregation of phaser cells according to phase-shift direction. In open-field phaser cell simulations, competitive learning embedded phase-code entrainment maps into the weights of downstream targets, including path integration networks. Bayesian phase decoding revealed error correction capable of resetting path integration at subsecond timescales. Our findings suggest that phaser cells may instantiate a subcortical theta-rhythmic loop of spatial feedback. We outline a framework in which location-dependent synchrony reconciles internal idiothetic processes with the allothetic reference points of sensory experience.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zGh30KsIyYw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08521</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Using a novel network analysis of spontaneous low-frequency functional MRI
data recorded at rest, we study the functional network that describes the
extent of synchronization among different areas of the brain. Comparing
forty-four medicated patients and forty healthy subjects, we detected
significant differences in the robustness of these functional networks. Such
differences resulted in a larger resistance to edge removal (disconnection) in
the graph of schizophrenic patients as compared to healthy controls. This paper
shows that the distribution of connectivity strength among brain regions is
spatially more homogeneous in schizophrenic patients with respect to healthy
ones. As a consequence, the precise hierarchical modularity of healthy brains
is crumbled in schizophrenic ones, making possible a peculiar arrangement of
region-to-region interaction that, in turns, produces several topologically
equivalent backbones of the whole functional brain network. We hypothesize that
the manifold nature of the basal scheme of functional organization within the
brain, together with its altered hierarchical modularity, contributes to
positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Our work also fits the disconnection
hypothesis that describes schizophrenia as a brain disorder, characterized by
abnormal functional integration among brain regions.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The cortex exhibits self-sustained highly-irregular activity even under
resting conditions, whose origin and function need to be fully understood. It
is believed that this can be described as an &quot;asynchronous state&quot; stemming from
the balance between excitation and inhibition, with important consequences for
information-processing, though a competing hypothesis claims it stems from
critical dynamics. By analyzing a parsimonious neural-network model with
excitatory and inhibitory interactions, we elucidate a noise-induced mechanism
called &quot;Jensen's force&quot; responsible for the emergence of a novel phase of
arbitrarily-low but self-sustained activity, which reproduces all the
experimental features of asynchronous states. The simplicity of our framework
allows for a deep understanding of asynchronous states from a broad
statistical-mechanics perspective and of the phase transitions to other
standard phases it exhibits, opening the door to reconcile, asynchronous-state
and critical-state hypotheses. We argue that Jensen's forces are measurable
experimentally and might be relevant in contexts beyond neuroscience.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Most of mathematic forgetting curve models fit well with the forgetting data
under the learning condition of one time rather than repeated. In the paper, a
convolution model of forgetting curve is proposed to simulate the memory
process during learning. In this model, the memory ability (i.e. the central
procedure in the working memory model) and learning material (i.e. the input in
the working memory model) is regarded as the system function and the input
function, respectively. The status of forgetting (i.e. the output in the
working memory model) is regarded as output function or the convolution result
of the memory ability and learning material. The model is applied to simulate
the forgetting curves in different situations. The results show that the model
is able to simulate the forgetting curves not only in one time learning
condition but also in multi-times condition. The model is further verified in
the experiments of Mandarin tone learning for Japanese learners. And the
predicted curve fits well on the test points.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08093</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Multimodal behavior involves multiple processing stations distributed across
distant brain regions, but our understanding of how such distributed processing
is coordinated in the brain is limited. Here we take a decoding approach to
this problem, aiming to quantify how temporal aspects of brain-wide neural
activity may be used to infer specific multimodal behaviors. Using high
temporal resolution measurements by MEG, we detect bursts of activity from
hundreds of locations across the surface of the brain at millisecond
resolution. We then compare decoding using three characteristics of neural
activity bursts, decoding with event counts, with latencies and with time
differences between pairs of events. Training decoders in this regime is
particularly challenging because the number of samples is smaller by orders of
magnitude than the input dimensionality. We develop a new decoding approach for
this regime that combines non-parametric modelling with aggressive feature
selection. Surprisingly, we find that decoding using time-differences, based on
thousands of region pairs, is significantly more accurate than using other
activity characteristics, reaching 90% accuracy consistently across subjects.
These results suggest that relevant information about multimodal brain function
is provided by subtle time differences across remote brain areas.

	<title>eLife: latest articles: scRNA-Seq reveals distinct stem cell populations that drive hair cell regeneration after loss of Fgf and Notch signaling</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/44431</link>
	<content:encoded>Loss of sensory hair cells leads to deafness and balance deficiencies. In contrast to mammalian hair cells, zebrafish ear and lateral line hair cells regenerate from poorly characterized support cells. Equally ill-defined is the gene regulatory network underlying the progression of support cells to differentiated hair cells. scRNA-Seq of lateral line organs uncovered five different support cell types, including quiescent and activated stem cells. Ordering of support cells along a developmental trajectory identified self-renewing cells and genes required for hair cell differentiation. scRNA-Seq analyses of &lt;i&gt;fgf3&lt;/i&gt; mutants, in which hair cell regeneration is increased, demonstrates that Fgf and Notch signaling inhibit proliferation of support cells in parallel by inhibiting Wnt signaling. Our scRNA-Seq analyses set the foundation for mechanistic studies of sensory organ regeneration and is crucial for identifying factors to trigger hair cell production in mammals. The data is searchable and publicly accessible via a web-based interface.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Requirements for RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex formation in vivo</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/43654</link>
	<content:encoded>Transcription by RNA polymerase II requires assembly of a preinitiation complex (PIC) composed of general transcription factors (GTFs) bound at the promoter. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt;, some GTFs are essential for transcription, whereas others are not required under certain conditions. PICs are stable in the absence of nucleotide triphosphates, and subsets of GTFs can form partial PICs. By depleting individual GTFs in yeast cells, we show that all GTFs are essential for TBP binding and transcription, suggesting that partial PICs do not exist at appreciable levels &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Depletion of FACT, a histone chaperone that travels with elongating Pol II, strongly reduces PIC formation and transcription. In contrast, TBP-associated factors (TAFs) contribute to transcription of most genes, but TAF-independent transcription occurs at substantial levels, preferentially at promoters containing TATA elements. PICs are absent in cells deprived of uracil, and presumably UTP, suggesting that transcriptionally inactive PICs are removed from promoters &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/42424</link>
	<content:encoded>Genetic variation conferring resistance and susceptibility to carcinogen-induced tumorigenesis is frequently studied in mice. We have now turned this to melanoma using the collaborative cross (CC), a resource of mouse strains designed to discover genes for complex diseases. We studied melanoma-prone transgenic progeny across seventy CC genetic backgrounds. We mapped a strong quantitative trait locus for rapid onset spontaneous melanoma onset to &lt;i&gt;Prkdc&lt;/i&gt;, a gene involved in detection and repair of DNA damage. In contrast, rapid onset UVR-induced melanoma was linked to the ribosomal subunit gene &lt;i&gt;Rrp15&lt;/i&gt;. Ribosome biogenesis was upregulated in skin shortly after UVR exposure. Mechanistically, variation in the 'usual suspects' by which UVR may exacerbate melanoma, defective DNA repair, melanocyte proliferation, or inflammatory cell infiltration, did not explain melanoma susceptibility or resistance across the CC. Instead, events occurring soon after exposure, such as dysregulation of ribosome function, which alters many aspects of cellular metabolism, may be important.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/42138</link>
	<content:encoded>The cerebellum integrates sensory stimuli and motor actions to enable smooth coordination and motor learning. Here we harness the innate behavioral repertoire of the larval zebrafish to characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of feature coding across the entire Purkinje cell population during visual stimuli and the reflexive behaviors that they elicit. Population imaging reveals three spatially-clustered regions of Purkinje cell activity along the rostrocaudal axis. Complementary single-cell electrophysiological recordings assign these Purkinje cells to one of three functional phenotypes that encode a specific visual, and not motor, signal via complex spikes. In contrast, simple spike output of most Purkinje cells is strongly driven by motor-related tail and eye signals. Interactions between complex and simple spikes show heterogeneous modulation patterns across different Purkinje cells, which become temporally restricted during swimming episodes. Our findings reveal how sensorimotor information is encoded by individual Purkinje cells and organized into behavioral modules across the entire cerebellum.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: FACT and Ubp10 collaborate to modulate H2B deubiquitination and nucleosome dynamics</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/40988</link>
	<content:encoded>Monoubiquitination of histone H2B (H2B-Ub) plays a role in transcription and DNA replication, and is required for normal localization of the histone chaperone, FACT. In yeast, H2B-Ub is deubiquitinated by Ubp8, a subunit of SAGA, and Ubp10. Although they target the same substrate, loss of Ubp8 and Ubp10 cause different phenotypes and alter the transcription of different genes. We show that Ubp10 has poor activity on yeast nucleosomes, but that the addition of FACT stimulates Ubp10 activity on nucleosomes and not on other substrates. Consistent with a role for FACT in deubiquitinating H2B &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, a FACT mutant strain shows elevated levels of H2B-Ub. Combination of FACT mutants with deletion of Ubp10, but not Ubp8, confers increased sensitivity to hydroxyurea and activates a cryptic transcription reporter, suggesting that FACT and Ubp10 may coordinate nucleosome assembly during DNA replication and transcription. Our findings reveal unexpected interplay between H2B deubiquitination and nucleosome dynamics.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Oxytocin promotes coordinated out-group attack during intergroup conflict in humans</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/40698</link>
	<content:encoded>Intergroup conflict contributes to human discrimination and violence, but persists because individuals make costly contributions to their group’s fighting capacity. Yet, how group members effectively coordinate their contributions during intergroup conflict remains poorly understood. Here, we examine the role of oxytocin for (the coordination of) contributions to group attack or defense in multi-round, real-time feedback intergroup contests. In a double-blind placebo-controlled study with &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 480 males in Intergroup Attacker-Defender Contests, we found that oxytocin reduced contributions to attack and over time increased attacker’s within-group coordination of contributions. However, rather than becoming peaceful, attackers given oxytocin better tracked their rival’s historical defense and coordinated their contributions into well-timed and hence more profitable attacks. Our results reveal coordination of contributions as a critical component of successful attacks and subscribe to the possibility that oxytocin enables individuals to contribute to in-group efficiency and prosperity even when doing so implies outsiders are excluded or harmed.</content:encoded>

Phototrophic organisms such as cyanobacteria utilize the sun’s energy to convert atmospheric carbon dioxide into organic carbon, resulting in diurnal variations in the cell’s metabolism. Flux balance analysis is a widely accepted constraint-based optimization tool for analyzing growth and metabolism, but it is generally used in a time-invariant manner with no provisions for sequestering different biomass components at different time periods. Here we present CycleSyn, a periodic model of &lt;i&gt;Synechocystis&lt;/i&gt; sp. PCC 6803 metabolism that spans a 12-hr light/12-hr dark cycle by segmenting it into 12 Time Point Models (TPMs) with a uniform duration of two hours. The developed framework allows for the flow of metabolites across TPMs while inventorying metabolite levels and only allowing for the utilization of currently or previously produced compounds. The 12 TPMs allow for the incorporation of time-dependent constraints that capture the cyclic nature of cellular processes. Imposing bounds on reactions informed by temporally-segmented transcriptomic data enables simulation of phototrophic growth as a single linear programming (LP) problem. The solution provides the time varying reaction fluxes over a 24-hour cycle and the accumulation/consumption of metabolites. The diurnal rhythm of metabolic gene expression driven by the circadian clock and its metabolic consequences is explored. Predicted flux and metabolite pools are in line with published studies regarding the temporal organization of phototrophic growth in &lt;i&gt;Synechocystis&lt;/i&gt; PCC 6803 paving the way for constructing time-resolved genome-scale models (GSMs) for organisms with a circadian clock. In addition, the metabolic reorganization that would be required to enable &lt;i&gt;Synechocystis&lt;/i&gt; PCC 6803 to temporally separate photosynthesis from oxygen-sensitive nitrogen fixation is also explored using the developed model formalism.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TnrMxUFOeR0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The differential modulation of agonist and antagonist binding to opioid receptors (ORs) by sodium (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) has been known for decades. To shed light on the molecular determinants, thermodynamics, and kinetics of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; translocation through the μ-OR (MOR), we used a multi-ensemble Markov model framework combining equilibrium and non-equilibrium atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; binding to MOR active or inactive crystal structures embedded in an explicit lipid bilayer. We identify an energetically favorable, continuous ion pathway through the MOR active conformation only, and provide, for the first time: i) estimates of the energy differences and required timescales of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; translocation in inactive and active MORs, ii) estimates of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced changes to agonist binding validated by radioligand measurements, and iii) testable hypotheses of molecular determinants and correlated motions involved in this translocation, which are likely to play a key role in MOR signaling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vAvW0Pod-dQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Cellular functions are shaped by reaction networks whose dynamics are determined by the concentrations of underlying components. However, cellular mechanisms ensuring that a component’s concentration resides in a given range remain elusive. We present network properties which suffice to identify components whose concentration ranges can be efficiently computed in mass-action metabolic networks. We show that the derived ranges are in excellent agreement with simulations from a detailed kinetic metabolic model of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;. We demonstrate that the approach can be used with genome-scale metabolic models to arrive at predictions concordant with measurements from &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; under different growth scenarios. By application to 14 genome-scale metabolic models from diverse species, our approach specifies the cellular determinants of concentration ranges that can be effectively employed to make predictions for a variety of biotechnological and medical applications.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kQAXSW7n2UI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Systems biology reveals how altered TGFβ signalling with age reduces protection against pro-inflammatory stimuli</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/djeTM0j7Dos/article</link>

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative condition caused by dysregulation of multiple molecular signalling pathways. Such dysregulation results in damage to cartilage, a smooth and protective tissue that enables low friction articulation of synovial joints. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), especially MMP-13, are key enzymes in the cleavage of type II collagen which is a vital component for cartilage integrity. Transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) can protect against pro-inflammatory cytokine-mediated MMP expression. With age there is a change in the ratio of two TGFβ type I receptors (Alk1/Alk5), a shift that results in TGFβ losing its protective role in cartilage homeostasis. Instead, TGFβ promotes cartilage degradation which correlates with the spontaneous development of OA in murine models. However, the mechanism by which TGFβ protects against pro-inflammatory responses and how this changes with age has not been extensively studied. As TGFβ signalling is complex, we used systems biology to combine experimental and computational outputs to examine how the system changes with age. Experiments showed that the repressive effect of TGFβ on chondrocytes treated with a pro-inflammatory stimulus required Alk5. Computational modelling revealed two independent mechanisms were needed to explain the crosstalk between TGFβ and pro-inflammatory signalling pathways. A novel meta-analysis of microarray data from OA patient tissue was used to create a Cytoscape network representative of human OA and revealed the importance of inflammation. Combining the modelled genes with the microarray network provided a global overview into the crosstalk between the different signalling pathways involved in OA development.
Our results provide further insights into the mechanisms that cause TGFβ signalling to change from a protective to a detrimental pathway in cartilage with ageing. Moreover, such a systems biology approach may enable restoration of the protective role of TGFβ as a potential therapy to prevent age-related loss of cartilage and the development of OA.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/djeTM0j7Dos&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Gene regulatory networks are composed of sub-networks that are often shared across biological processes, cell-types, and organisms. Leveraging multiple sources of information, such as publicly available gene expression datasets, could therefore be helpful when learning a network of interest. Integrating data across different studies, however, raises numerous technical concerns. Hence, a common approach in network inference, and broadly in genomics research, is to separately learn models from each dataset and combine the results. Individual models, however, often suffer from under-sampling, poor generalization and limited network recovery. In this study, we explore previous integration strategies, such as batch-correction and model ensembles, and introduce a new multitask learning approach for joint network inference across several datasets. Our method initially estimates the activities of transcription factors, and subsequently, infers the relevant network topology. As regulatory interactions are context-dependent, we estimate model coefficients as a combination of both dataset-specific and conserved components. In addition, adaptive penalties may be used to favor models that include interactions derived from multiple sources of prior knowledge including orthogonal genomics experiments. We evaluate generalization and network recovery using examples from &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, and show that sharing information across models improves network reconstruction. Finally, we demonstrate robustness to both false positives in the prior information and heterogeneity among datasets.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Sm0qtCLgIJQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Statistical books can provide deep insights into statistics and software. There are, however, many resources available to the practitioner. Book reviews have the capacity to function as a critical mechanism for the learner to assess the merits of engaging in part, in full, or at all with a book. The “ten simple rules” format, pioneered in computational biology, was applied here to writing effective book reviews for statistics because of the wide breadth of offerings in this domain, including topical introductions, computational solutions, and theory. Learning by doing is a popular paradigm in statistics and computation, but there is still a niche for books in the pedagogy of self-taught and instruction-based learning. Primarily, these rules ensure that book reviews function as a form of short syntheses to inform and guide readers in deciding to use a specific book relative to other options for resolving statistical challenges.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/u6I3i7zGdDw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: An Efficient Population Density Method for Modeling Neural Networks with Synaptic Dynamics Manifesting Finite Relaxation Time and Short-Term Plasticity</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/6/ENEURO.0002-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;When incorporating more realistic synaptic dynamics, the computational efficiency of population density methods (PDMs) declines sharply due to the increase in the dimension of master equations. To avoid such a decline, we develop an efficient PDM, termed colored-synapse PDM (csPDM), in which the dimension of the master equations does not depend on the number of synapse-associated state variables in the underlying network model. Our goal is to allow the PDM to incorporate realistic synaptic dynamics that possesses not only finite relaxation time but also short-term plasticity (STP). The model equations of csPDM are derived based on the diffusion approximation on synaptic dynamics and probability density function methods for Langevin equations with colored noise. Numerical examples, given by simulations of the population dynamics of uncoupled exponential integrate-and-fire (EIF) neurons, show good agreement between the results of csPDM and Monte Carlo simulations (MCSs). Compared to the original full-dimensional PDM (fdPDM), the csPDM reveals more excellent computational efficiency because of the lower dimension of the master equations. In addition, it permits network dynamics to possess the short-term plastic characteristics inherited from plastic synapses. The novel csPDM has potential applicability to any spiking neuron models because of no assumptions on neuronal dynamics, and, more importantly, this is the first report of PDM to successfully encompass short-term facilitation/depression properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no scale for rating the severity of autoimmune encephalitis (AE). In this study, we aimed to develop a novel scale for rating severity in patients with diverse AE syndromes and to verify the reliability and validity of the developed scale.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key items were generated by a panel of experts and selected according to content validity ratios. The developed scale was initially applied to 50 patients with AE (development cohort) to evaluate its acceptability, reproducibility, internal consistency, and construct validity. Then, the scale was applied to another independent cohort (validation cohort, n=38).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new scale consisting of 9 items (seizure, memory dysfunction, psychiatric symptoms, consciousness, language problems, dyskinesia/dystonia, gait instability and ataxia, brainstem dysfunction, and weakness) was developed. Each item was assigned a value of up to 3 points. The total score could therefore range from 0 to 27. We named the scale the Clinical Assessment Scale in Autoimmune Encephalitis (CASE). The new scale showed excellent interobserver (ICC = 0.97) and intraobserver (ICC = 0.96) reliability for total scores, was highly correlated with mRS (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.86, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001), and had acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.88). Additionally, in the validation cohort, the scale showed high interobserver reliability (ICC = 0.99) and internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.92).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CASE is a novel clinical scale for AE with a high level of clinimetric properties. It would be suitable for application in clinical practice and might help overcome the limitations of current outcome scales for AE.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07589</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Finding the causes to observed effects and establishing causal relationships
between events is (and has been) an essential element of science and
philosophy. Automated methods that can detect causal relationships would be
very welcome, but practical methods that can infer causality are difficult to
find, and the subject of ongoing research. While Shannon information only
detects correlation, there are several information-theoretic notions of
&quot;directed information&quot; that have successfully detected causality in some
systems, in particular in the neuroscience community. However, recent work has
shown that some directed information measures can sometimes inadequately
estimate the extent of causal relations, or even fail to identify existing
cause-effect relations between components of systems, especially if neurons
contribute in a cryptographic manner to influence the effector neuron. Here, we
test how often cryptographic logic emerges in an evolutionary process that
generates artificial neural circuits for two fundamental cognitive tasks:
motion detection and sound localization. Our results suggest that whether or
not transfer entropy measures of causality are misleading depends strongly on
the cognitive task considered. These results emphasize the importance of
understanding the fundamental logic processes that contribute to cognitive
processing, and quantifying their relevance in any given nervous system.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The control of brain network dynamics across diverse scales of space and time. (arXiv:1901.07536v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07536</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The human brain is composed of distinct regions that are each associated with
particular functions and distinct propensities for the control of neural
dynamics. However, the relation between these functions and control profiles is
poorly understood, as is the variation in this relation across diverse scales
of space and time. Here we probe the relation between control and dynamics in
brain networks constructed from diffusion tensor imaging data in a large
community based sample of young adults. Specifically, we probe the control
properties of each brain region and investigate their relationship with
dynamics across various spatial scales using the Laplacian eigenspectrum. In
addition, through analysis of regional modal controllability and partitioning
of modes, we determine whether the associated dynamics are fast or slow, as
well as whether they are alternating or monotone. We find that brain regions
that facilitate the control of energetically easy transitions are associated
with activity on short length scales and fast time scales. Conversely, brain
regions that facilitate control of difficult transitions are associated with
activity on long length scales and slow time scales. Built on linear dynamical
models, our results offer parsimonious explanations for the activity
propagation and network control profiles supported by regions of differing
neuroanatomical structure.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/42341</link>
	<content:encoded>The zinc finger CCCTC-binding protein (CTCF) carries out many functions in the cell. Although previous studies sought to explain CTCF multivalency based on sequence composition of binding sites, few examined how CTCF post-translational modification (PTM) could contribute to function. Here, we performed CTCF mass spectrometry, identified a novel phosphorylation site at Serine 224 (Ser&lt;sup&gt;224&lt;/sup&gt;-P), and demonstrate that phosphorylation is carried out by Polo kinase 1 (PLK1). CTCF Ser&lt;sup&gt;224&lt;/sup&gt;-P is chromatin-associated, mapping to at least a subset of known CTCF sites. CTCF Ser&lt;sup&gt;224&lt;/sup&gt;-P accumulates during the G2/M transition of the cell cycle and is enriched at pericentric regions. The phospho-obviation mutant, S224A, appeared normal. However, the phospho-mimic mutant, S224E, is detrimental to mouse embryonic stem cell colonies. While ploidy and chromatin architecture appear unaffected, S224E mutants differentially express of hundreds of genes, including p53 and p21. We have thus identified a new CTCF PTM and provided evidence of biological function.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Progenitor self-renewal and differentiation is often regulated by spatially restricted cues within a tissue microenvironment. Here we examine how progenitor cell migration impacts regionally induced commitment within the nephrogenic niche in mice. We identify a subset of cells that express &lt;i&gt;Wnt4&lt;/i&gt;, an early marker of nephron commitment, but migrate back into the progenitor population where they accumulate over time. Single cell RNA-seq and computational modelling of returning cells reveals that nephron progenitors can traverse the transcriptional hierarchy between self-renewal and commitment in either direction. This plasticity may enable robust regulation of nephrogenesis as niches remodel and grow during organogenesis.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/39304</link>
	<content:encoded>Male germ cells of all placental mammals express an ancient nuclear RNA binding protein of unknown function called RBMXL2. Here we find that deletion of the retrogene encoding RBMXL2 blocks spermatogenesis. Transcriptome analyses of age-matched deletion mice show that RBMXL2 controls splicing patterns during meiosis. In particular, RBMXL2 represses the selection of aberrant splice sites and the insertion of cryptic and premature terminal exons. Our data suggest a &lt;i&gt;Rbmxl2&lt;/i&gt; retrogene has been conserved across mammals as part of a splicing control mechanism that is fundamentally important to germ cell biology. We propose that this mechanism is essential to meiosis because it buffers the high ambient concentrations of splicing activators, thereby preventing poisoning of key transcripts and disruption to gene expression by aberrant splice site selection.</content:encoded>

Infections of stratified epithelia contribute to a large group of common diseases, such as dermatological conditions and sexually transmitted diseases. To investigate how epithelial structure affects infection dynamics, we develop a general ecology-inspired model for stratified epithelia. Our model allows us to simulate infections, explore new hypotheses and estimate parameters that are difficult to measure with tissue cell cultures. We focus on two contrasting pathogens: &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia trachomatis&lt;/i&gt; and Human papillomaviruses. Using cervicovaginal parameter estimates, we find that key infection symptoms can be explained by differential interactions with the layers, while clearance and pathogen burden appear to be bottom-up processes. Cell protective responses to infections (e.g. mucus trapping) generally lowered pathogen load but there were specific effects based on infection strategies. Our modeling approach opens new perspectives for 3D tissue culture experimental systems of infections and, more generally, for developing and testing hypotheses related to infections of stratified epithelia.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ztnxRVtKRWQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Although the basic cellular organization of the cortex is conserved across mammals, cells have diversified during evolution. An increasingly integrated taxonomy of cell types, especially with the advent of single-cell transcriptomic data, has revealed an unprecedented variety of human cortical cell subtypes. Here, we broadly review the cellular composition and diversity of the mammalian brain, and how progenitor pools generate cell subtypes during development. We then discuss human cortical cells that are distinct from rodent cells, as well as the challenges and advantages of using model systems to study human cell types in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

Quantitative information on protein lifetimes can provide clues as to how these challenges are met. Advances in proteomics and mass spectrometry, which now enable comprehensive lifetime estimations for thousands of proteins, suggest that neuronal and synaptic protein lifetimes are unusually long, with half-lives typically ranging from days to weeks, even months and beyond for certain protein families. Half-lives &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; are several-fold longer than those in cell culture, tend to cluster for proteins belonging to multimolecular complexes, are affected by developmental stage, and possibly by environmental conditions and activity levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/758?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dozens of genes have been implicated in late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, but none has a defined mechanism of action in neurons. Here, we show that the risk factor Pyk2 (PTK2B) localizes specifically to neurons in adult brain. Absence of Pyk2 has no major effect on synapse formation or the basal parameters of synaptic transmission in the hippocampal Schaffer collateral pathway. However, the induction of synaptic LTD is suppressed in Pyk2-null slices. In contrast, deletion of Pyk2 expression does not alter LTP under control conditions. Of relevance for AD pathophysiology, Pyk2&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; slices are protected from amyloid-β-oligomer (Aβo)-induced suppression of LTP in hippocampal slices. Acutely, a Pyk2 kinase inhibitor also prevents Aβo-induced suppression of LTP in WT slices. Female and male transgenic AD model mice expressing APPswe/PSEN1E9 require Pyk2 for age-dependent loss of synaptic markers and for impairment of learning and memory. However, absence of Pyk2 does not alter Aβ accumulation or gliosis. Therefore, the Pyk2 risk gene is directly implicated in a neuronal Aβo signaling pathway impairing synaptic anatomy and function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Genetic variation at the Pyk2 (PTK2B) locus is a risk for late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the pathophysiological role of Pyk2 is not clear. Here, we studied Pyk2 neuronal function in mice lacking expression with and without transgenes generating amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque pathology. Pyk2 is not required for basal synaptic transmission or LTP, but participates in LTD. Hippocampal slices lacking Pyk2 are protected from AD-related Aβ oligomer suppression of synaptic plasticity. In transgenic AD model mice, deletion of Pyk2 rescues synaptic loss and learning/memory deficits. Therefore, Pyk2 plays a central role in AD-related synaptic dysfunction mediating Aβ-triggered dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Claudin-1-Dependent Destabilization of the Blood-Brain Barrier in Chronic Stroke</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/743?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent evidence suggests that blood–brain barrier (BBB) recovery and reestablishment of BBB impermeability after stroke is incomplete. This could influence stroke recovery, increase the risk of repeat stroke, and be a solid substrate for developing vascular dementia. Although accumulating evidence has defined morphological alterations and underlying mechanisms of tight junction (TJ) changes during BBB breakdown in acute stroke, very little is known about the type of alterations and mechanisms in BBB &quot;leakage&quot; found subacutely or chronically. The current study examined BBB structural alterations during the &quot;BBB leakage&quot; associated with the chronic phase of stroke in male mice and both genders of humans. We found significant upregulation of claudin-1 mRNA and protein, a nonspecific claudin for blood vessels, and downregulation in claudin-5 expression. Morphological and biochemical as well as fluorescence resonance energy transfer and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis of postischemic brain endothelial cells and cells overexpressing claudin-1 indicated that newly synthesized claudin-1 was present on the cell membrane (~45%), was incorporated into the TJ complex with established interaction with zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), and was building homophilic &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-interactions. The appearance of claudin-1 in the TJ complex reduced claudin-5 strands (homophilic claudin-5 &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-interactions) and claudin-5/ZO-1 interaction affecting claudin-5 incorporation into the TJ complex. Moreover, claudin-1 induction was associated with an endothelial proinflammatory phenotype. Targeting claudin-1 with a specific C1C2 peptide improved brain endothelial barrier permeability and functional recovery in chronic stroke condition. This study highlights a potential &quot;defect&quot; in postischemic barrier formation that may underlie prolonged vessel leakiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Although rarely expressed at the normal blood–brain barrier (BBB), claudin-1 is expressed in pathological conditions. Analyzing poststroke human and mouse blood microvessels we have identified that claudin-1 is highly expressed in leaky brain microvessels. Our results reveal that claudin-1 is incorporated in BBB tight junction complex, impeding BBB recovery and causing BBB leakiness during poststroke recovery. Targeting claudin-1 with a claudin-1 peptide improves brain endothelial barrier permeability and consequently functional neurological recovery after stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Conditional Knock-out of mGluR5 from Astrocytes during Epilepsy Development Impairs High-Frequency Glutamate Uptake</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/727?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Astrocyte expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) is consistently observed in resected tissue from patients with epilepsy and is equally prevalent in animal models of epilepsy. However, little is known about the functional signaling properties or downstream consequences of astrocyte mGluR5 activation during epilepsy development. In the rodent brain, astrocyte mGluR5 expression is developmentally regulated and confined in expression/function to the first weeks of life, with similar observations made in human control tissue. Herein, we demonstrate that mGluR5 expression and function dramatically increase in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Interestingly, in both male and female mice, mGluR5 function persists in the astrocyte throughout the process of epileptogenesis following status epilepticus. However, mGluR5 expression and function are transient in animals that do not develop epilepsy over an equivalent time period, suggesting that patterns of mGluR5 expression may signify continuing epilepsy development or its resolution. We demonstrate that, during epileptogenesis, astrocytes reacquire mGluR5-dependent calcium transients following agonist application or synaptic glutamate release, a feature of astrocyte-neuron communication absent since early development. Finally, we find that the selective and conditional knock-out of mGluR5 signaling from astrocytes during epilepsy development slows the rate of glutamate clearance through astrocyte glutamate transporters under high-frequency stimulation conditions, a feature that suggests astrocyte mGluR5 expression during epileptogenesis may recapitulate earlier developmental roles in regulating glutamate transporter function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In development, astrocyte mGluR5 signaling plays a critical role in regulating structural and functional interactions between astrocytes and neurons at the tripartite synapse. Notably, mGluR5 signaling is a positive regulator of astrocyte glutamate transporter expression and function, an essential component of excitatory signaling regulation in hippocampus. After early development, astrocyte mGluR5 expression is downregulated, but reemerges in animal models of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) development and patient epilepsy samples. We explored the hypothesis that astrocyte mGluR5 reemergence recapitulates earlier developmental roles during TLE acquisition. Our work demonstrates that astrocytes with mGluR5 signaling during TLE development perform faster glutamate uptake in hippocampus, revealing a previously unexplored role for astrocyte mGluR5 signaling in hypersynchronous pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Hard Decisions Shape the Neural Coding of Preferences</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/718?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hard decisions between equally valued alternatives can result in preference changes, meaning that subsequent valuations for chosen items increase and decrease for rejected items. Previous research suggests that this phenomenon is a consequence of cognitive dissonance reduction after the decision, induced by the mismatch between initial preferences and decision outcomes. In contrast, this functional magnetic resonance imaging and eye-tracking study with male and female human participants found that preferences are already updated online during the process of decision-making. Preference changes were predicted from activity in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and precuneus while making hard decisions. Fixation durations during this phase predicted both choice outcomes and subsequent preference changes. These preference adjustments became behaviorally relevant only for choices that were remembered and were in turn associated with hippocampus activity. Our results suggest that preferences evolve dynamically as decisions arise, potentially as a mechanism to prevent stalemate situations in underdetermined decision scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Most theories of decision-making assume that we always choose the best option available, based on a set of stable preferences. However, what happens for hard decisions when the available options are preferred equally? We show that in such stalemate situations, decision-makers adjust their preferences dynamically during the process of decision-making, and these preference adjustments are predicted by a left prefrontal-parietal network. We also show that eye movements during decision-making are predictive of the magnitude of the upcoming value change. Our results suggest that preferences are dynamic, adjusted every time a hard decision is made, prompting a re-evaluation of existing frameworks of decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Posterior-Anterior Distinction between Scene Perception and Scene Construction in Human Medial Parietal Cortex</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/705?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human retrosplenial complex (RSC), located in medial parietal cortex, has been implicated in numerous cognitive functions, including scene perception, spatial navigation, and autobiographical memory retrieval. Recently, a posterior–anterior distinction within RSC was proposed, such that posterior aspects process scene-related visual information (constituting a medial place area [MPA]), whereas anterior aspects process information that is vividly retrieved from memory, thereby supporting remembering and potentially navigation. Here, we tested this proposed distinction in a single group of participants (both male and female) using fMRI with both perceptual and mnemonic tasks. After completing a resting-state scan, participants performed a task that required constructing scenes from memory and completed a scene selectivity localizer task. We tested directly perceptual and mnemonic responses in MPA and an anterior, connectivity-defined region (CON), which showed strong functional connectivity with anterior parahippocampal place area. A double dissociation was observed, such that CON was more strongly activated during scene construction than was MPA, whereas MPA was more perceptually responsive than CON. Further, peak responses from the scene construction task were anterior to perceptual peaks in all but 1 participant and hemisphere. Finally, through analyses of the posterior–anterior response profiles, we identify the fundus of the parieto-occipital sulcus as a potential location for the crossover from perceptual to mnemonic representations and highlight a potential left-hemisphere advantage for mnemonic representations. Collectively, our results support a distinction between posterior and anterior aspects of the RSC, suggesting that more specific functional-anatomic terms should be used in its place in future work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The retrosplenial complex (RSC) has been implicated in vision, spatial cognition, and memory. We previously speculated on a potential posterior–anterior distinction within RSC for scene perception and memory-based scene construction/navigation. Here, we tested this distinction through a combination of resting-state, perceptual, and mnemonic task data. Consistent with our predictions, we demonstrate that perceptual responses peak consistently posterior of those elicited by memory-based scene construction within the broader RSC. Further, we highlight (1) the fundus of the parieto-occipital sulcus as a landmark for the transition between these representations, (2) the anterior bank of parieto-occipital sulcus as the point of maximal separation between these representations, and (3) identify a potential hemispheric asymmetry in mnemonic representations. These data support functional dissociations within RSC.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Sensorimotor Pathway via Higher-Order Thalamus</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/692?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We now know that sensory processing in cortex occurs not only via direct communication between primary to secondary areas, but also via their parallel cortico-thalamo-cortical (i.e., &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-thalamic) pathways. Both corticocortical and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-thalamic pathways mainly signal through glutamatergic class 1 (driver) synapses, which have robust and efficient synaptic dynamics suited for the transfer of information such as receptive field properties, suggesting the importance of class 1 synapses in feedforward, hierarchical processing. However, such a parallel arrangement has only been identified in sensory cortical areas: visual, somatosensory, and auditory. To test the generality of &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-thalamic pathways, we sought to establish its presence beyond purely sensory cortices to determine whether there is a &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-thalamic pathway parallel to the established primary somatosensory (S1) to primary motor (M1) pathway. We used &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-synaptic viral tracing, optogenetics in slice preparations, and bouton size analysis in the mouse (both sexes) to document that a circuit exists from layer 5 of S1 through the posterior medial nucleus of the thalamus to M1 with glutamatergic class 1 properties. This represents a hitherto unknown, robust sensorimotor linkage and suggests that the arrangement of parallel direct and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-thalamic corticocortical circuits may be present as a general feature of cortical functioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; During sensory processing, feedforward pathways carry information such as receptive field properties via glutamatergic class 1 synapses, which have robust and efficient synaptic dynamics. As expected, class 1 synapses subserve the feedforward projection from primary to secondary sensory cortex, but also a route through specific higher-order thalamic nuclei, creating a parallel feedforward &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-thalamic pathway. We now extend the concept of cortical areas being connected via parallel, direct, and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-thalamic circuits from purely sensory cortices to a sensorimotor cortical circuit (i.e., primary sensory cortex to primary motor cortex). This suggests a generalized arrangement for corticocortical communication.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Drebrin-like (Dbnl) Controls Neuronal Migration via Regulating N-Cadherin Expression in the Developing Cerebral Cortex</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/678?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The actin cytoskeleton is crucial for neuronal migration in the mammalian developing cerebral cortex. The adaptor protein Drebrin-like (Dbnl) plays important roles in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, dendrite formation, and endocytosis by interacting with F-actin, cobl, and dynamin. Although Dbnl is known to be expressed in the brain, the functions of this molecule during brain development are largely unknown. In this study, to examine the roles of Dbnl in the developing cerebral cortex, we conducted experiments using mice of both sexes with knockdown of Dbnl, effected by &lt;i&gt;in utero&lt;/i&gt; electroporation, in the migrating neurons of the embryonic cortex. Time-lapse imaging of the Dbnl-knockdown neurons revealed that the presence of Dbnl is a prerequisite for appropriate formation of processes in the multipolar neurons in the multipolar cell accumulation zone or the deep part of the subventricular zone, and for neuronal polarization and entry into the cortical plate. We found that Dbnl knockdown decreased the amount of N-cadherin protein expressed on the plasma membrane of the cortical neurons. The defect in neuronal migration caused by Dbnl knockdown was rescued by moderate overexpression of N-cadherin and αN-catenin or by transfection of the phospho-mimic form (Y337E, Y347E), but not the phospho-resistant form (Y337F, Y347F), of Dbnl. These results suggest that Dbnl controls neuronal migration, neuronal multipolar morphology, and cell polarity in the developing cerebral cortex via regulating N-cadherin expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Disruption of neuronal migration can cause neuronal disorders, such as lissencephaly and subcortical band heterotopia. During cerebral cortical development, the actin cytoskeleton plays a key role in neuronal migration; however, the mechanisms of regulation of neuronal migration by the actin cytoskeleton still remain unclear. Herein, we report that the novel protein Dbnl, an actin-binding protein, controls multiple events during neuronal migration in the developing mouse cerebral cortex. We also showed that this regulation is mediated by phosphorylation of Dbnl at tyrosine residues 337 and 347 and αN-catenin/N-cadherin, suggesting that the Dbnl-αN-catenin/N-cadherin pathway is important for neuronal migration in the developing cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Local Acceleration of Neurofilament Transport at Nodes of Ranvier</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/663?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Myelinated axons are constricted at nodes of Ranvier. These constrictions are important physiologically because they increase the speed of saltatory nerve conduction, but they also represent potential bottlenecks for the movement of axonally transported cargoes. One type of cargo are neurofilaments, which are abundant space-filling cytoskeletal polymers that function to increase axon caliber. Neurofilaments move bidirectionally along axons, alternating between rapid movements and prolonged pauses. Strikingly, axon constriction at nodes is accompanied by a reduction in neurofilament number that can be as much as 10-fold in the largest axons. To investigate how neurofilaments navigate these constrictions, we developed a transgenic mouse strain that expresses a photoactivatable fluorescent neurofilament protein in neurons. We used the pulse-escape fluorescence photoactivation technique to analyze neurofilament transport in mature myelinated axons of tibial nerves from male and female mice of this strain &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Fluorescent neurofilaments departed the activated region more rapidly in nodes than in flanking internodes, indicating that neurofilament transport is faster in nodes. By computational modeling, we showed that this nodal acceleration can be explained largely by a local increase in the duty cycle of neurofilament transport (i.e., the proportion of the time that the neurofilaments spend moving). We propose that this transient acceleration functions to maintain a constant neurofilament flux across nodal constrictions, much as the current increases where a river narrows its banks. In this way, neurofilaments are prevented from piling up in the flanking internodes, ensuring a stable neurofilament distribution and uniform axonal morphology across these physiologically important axonal domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Myelinated axons are constricted at nodes of Ranvier, resulting in a marked local decrease in neurofilament number. These constrictions are important physiologically because they increase the efficiency of saltatory nerve conduction, but they also represent potential bottlenecks for the axonal transport of neurofilaments, which move along axons in a rapid intermittent manner. Imaging of neurofilament transport in mature myelinated axons &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; reveals that neurofilament polymers navigate these nodal axonal constrictions by accelerating transiently, much as the current increases where a river narrows its banks. This local acceleration is necessary to ensure a stable axonal morphology across nodal constrictions, which may explain the vulnerability of nodes of Ranvier to neurofilament accumulations in animal models of neurotoxic neuropathies and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Localizing Proton-Mediated Inhibitory Feedback at the Retinal Horizontal Cell-Cone Synapse with Genetically-Encoded pH Probes</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/651?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Lateral inhibition in the vertebrate retina depends on a negative feedback synapse between horizontal cells (HCs) and rod and cone photoreceptors. A change in pH is thought to be the signal for negative feedback, but its spatial profile in the synaptic cleft is unknown. Here we use three different membrane proteins, each fused to the same genetically-encoded pH-sensitive Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) (pHluorin), to probe synaptic pH in retina from transgenic zebrafish (&lt;i&gt;Danio rerio&lt;/i&gt;) of either sex. We used the cone transducin promoter to express SynaptopHluorin (pHluorin on vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP2)) or CalipHluorin (pHluorin on an L-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel) and the HC-specific connexin-55.5 promoter to express AMPApHluorin (pHluorin on an AMPA receptor). Stimulus light led to increased fluorescence of all three probes, consistent with alkalinization of the synaptic cleft. The receptive field size, sensitivity to surround illumination, and response to activation of an alien receptor expressed exclusively in HCs, are consistent with lateral inhibition as the trigger for alkalinization. However, SynaptopHluorin and AMPApHluorin, which are displaced farther from cone synaptic ribbons than CalipHluorin, reported a smaller pH change. Hence, unlike feedforward glutamatergic transmission, which spills over to allow cross talk between terminals in the cone network, the pH change underlying HC feedback is compartmentalized to individual synaptic invaginations within a cone terminal, consistent with private line communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Lateral inhibition (LI) is a fundamental feature of information processing in sensory systems, enhancing contrast sensitivity and enabling edge discrimination. Horizontal cells (HCs) are the first cellular substrate of LI in the vertebrate retina, but the synaptic mechanisms underlying LI are not completely understood, despite decades of study. This paper makes a significant contribution to our understanding of LI, by showing that each HC–cone synapse is a &quot;private-line&quot; that operates independently from other HC–cone connections. Using transgenic zebrafish expressing pHluorin, a pH-sensitive GFP variant spliced onto three different protein platforms expressed either in cones or HCs we show that the feedback pH signal is constrained to individual cone terminals, and more stringently, to individual synaptic contact sites within each terminal.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Extrasynaptic NMDA Receptors on Rod Pathway Amacrine Cells: Molecular Composition, Activation, and Signaling</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/627?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the rod pathway of the mammalian retina, axon terminals of glutamatergic rod bipolar cells are presynaptic to AII and A17 amacrine cells in the inner plexiform layer. Recent evidence suggests that both amacrines express NMDA receptors, raising questions concerning molecular composition, localization, activation, and function of these receptors. Using dual patch-clamp recording from synaptically connected rod bipolar and AII or A17 amacrine cells in retinal slices from female rats, we found no evidence that NMDA receptors contribute to postsynaptic currents evoked in either amacrine. Instead, NMDA receptors on both amacrine cells were activated by ambient glutamate, and blocking glutamate uptake increased their level of activation. NMDA receptor activation also increased the frequency of GABAergic postsynaptic currents in rod bipolar cells, suggesting that NMDA receptors can drive release of GABA from A17 amacrines. A striking dichotomy was revealed by pharmacological and immunolabeling experiments, which found GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors on AII amacrines and GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors on A17 amacrines. Immunolabeling also revealed a clustered organization of NMDA receptors on both amacrines and a close spatial association between GluN2B subunits and connexin 36 on AII amacrines, suggesting that NMDA receptor modulation of gap junction coupling between these cells involves the GluN2B subunit. Using multiphoton Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging, we verified that activation of NMDA receptors evoked an increase of intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in dendrites of both amacrines. Our results suggest that AII and A17 amacrines express clustered, extrasynaptic NMDA receptors, with different and complementary subunits that are likely to contribute differentially to signal processing and plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Glutamate is the most important excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS, but not all glutamate receptors transmit fast excitatory signals at synapses. NMDA-type glutamate receptors act as voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels, with functional properties determined by their specific subunit composition. These receptors can be found at both synaptic and extrasynaptic sites on neurons, but the role of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that retinal AII and A17 amacrine cells, postsynaptic partners at rod bipolar dyad synapses, express extrasynaptic (but not synaptic) NMDA receptors, with different and complementary GluN2 subunits. The localization of GluN2A-containing receptors to A17s and GluN2B-containing receptors to AIIs suggests a mechanism for differential modulation of excitability and signaling in this retinal microcircuit.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Enhancement of BDNF Expression and Memory by HDAC Inhibition Requires BET Bromodomain Reader Proteins</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/612?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors may have therapeutic utility in multiple neurological and psychiatric disorders, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we identify BRD4, a BET bromodomain reader of acetyl-lysine histones, as an essential component involved in potentiated expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and memory following HDAC inhibition. In &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies, we reveal that pharmacological inhibition of BRD4 reversed the increase in &lt;i&gt;BDNF&lt;/i&gt; mRNA induced by the class I/IIb HDAC inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA). Knock-down of HDAC2 and HDAC3, but not other HDACs, increased &lt;i&gt;BDNF&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression, whereas knock-down of BRD4 blocked these effects. Using dCas9-BRD4, locus-specific targeting of BRD4 to the &lt;i&gt;BDNF&lt;/i&gt; promoter increased &lt;i&gt;BDNF&lt;/i&gt; mRNA. In additional studies, RGFP966, a pharmacological inhibitor of HDAC3, elevated &lt;i&gt;BDNF&lt;/i&gt; expression and BRD4 binding to the BDNF promoter, effects that were abrogated by JQ1 (an inhibitor of BRD4). Examining known epigenetic targets of BRD4 and HDAC3, we show that H4K5ac and H4K8ac modifications and H4K5ac enrichment at the &lt;i&gt;BDNF&lt;/i&gt; promoter were elevated following RGFP966 treatment. In electrophysiological studies, JQ1 reversed RGFP966-induced enhancement of LTP in hippocampal slice preparations. Last, in behavioral studies, RGFP966 increased subthreshold novel object recognition memory and cocaine place preference in male C57BL/6 mice, effects that were reversed by cotreatment with JQ1. Together, these data reveal that BRD4 plays a key role in HDAC3 inhibitor-induced potentiation of &lt;i&gt;BDNF&lt;/i&gt; expression, neuroplasticity, and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Some histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are known to have neuroprotective and cognition-enhancing properties, but the underlying mechanisms have yet to be fully elucidated. In the current study, we reveal that BRD4, an epigenetic reader of histone acetylation marks, is necessary for enhancing brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression and improved memory following HDAC inhibition. Therefore, by identifying novel epigenetic regulators of BDNF expression, these data may lead to new therapeutic targets for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Modulator-Gated, SUMOylation-Mediated, Activity-Dependent Regulation of Ionic Current Densities Contributes to Short-Term Activity Homeostasis</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/596?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurons operate within defined activity limits, and feedback control mechanisms dynamically tune ionic currents to maintain this optimal range. This study describes a novel, rapid feedback mechanism that uses SUMOylation to continuously adjust ionic current densities according to changes in activity. Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) is a peptide that can be post-translationally conjugated to ion channels to influence their surface expression and biophysical properties. Neuronal activity can regulate the extent of protein SUMOylation. This study on the single, unambiguously identifiable lateral pyloric neuron (LP), a component of the pyloric network in the stomatogastric nervous system of male and female spiny lobsters (&lt;i&gt;Panulirus interruptus&lt;/i&gt;), focused on dynamic SUMOylation in the context of activity homeostasis. There were four major findings: First, neuronal activity adjusted the balance between SUMO conjugation and deconjugation to continuously and bidirectionally fine-tune the densities of two opposing conductances: the hyperpolarization activated current (I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;) and the transient potassium current (I&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;). Second, tonic 5 nm dopamine (DA) gated activity-dependent SUMOylation to permit and prevent activity-dependent regulation of I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. Third, DA-gated, activity-dependent SUMOylation contributed to a feedback mechanism that restored the timing and duration of LP activity during prolonged modulation by 5 μm DA, which initially altered these and other activity features. Fourth, DA modulatory and metamoduatory (gating) effects were tailored to simultaneously alter and stabilize neuronal output. Our findings suggest that modulatory tone may select a subset of rapid activity-dependent mechanisms from a larger menu to achieve homeostasis under varying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Post-translational SUMOylation of ion channel subunits controls their interactions. When subunit SUMOylation is dysregulated, conductance densities mediated by the channels are distorted, leading to nervous system disorders, such as seizures and chronic pain. Regulation of ion channel SUMOylation is poorly understood. This study demonstrated that neuronal activity can regulate SUMOylation to reconfigure ionic current densities over minutes, and this regulation was gated by tonic nanomolar dopamine. Dynamic SUMOylation was necessary to maintain specific aspects of neuronal output while the neuron was being modulated by high (5 μm) concentrations of dopamine, suggesting that the gating function may ensure neuronal homeostasis during extrinsic modulation of a circuit.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Coincidence Detection within the Excitable Rat Olfactory Bulb Granule Cell Spines</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/584?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the mammalian olfactory bulb, the inhibitory axonless granule cells (GCs) feature reciprocal synapses that interconnect them with the principal neurons of the bulb, mitral, and tufted cells. These synapses are located within large excitable spines that can generate local action potentials (APs) upon synaptic input (&quot;spine spike&quot;). Moreover, GCs can fire global APs that propagate throughout the dendrite. Strikingly, local postsynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry summates mostly linearly with Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry due to coincident global APs generated by glomerular stimulation, although some underlying conductances should be inactivated. We investigated this phenomenon by constructing a compartmental GC model to simulate the pairing of local and global signals as a function of their temporal separation t. These simulations yield strongly sublinear summation of spine Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry for the case of perfect coincidence t = 0 ms. Summation efficiency (SE) sharply rises for both positive and negative t. The SE reduction for coincident signals depends on the presence of voltage-gated Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels in the spine head, while NMDARs are not essential. We experimentally validated the simulated SE in slices of juvenile rat brain (both sexes) by pairing two-photon uncaging of glutamate at spines and APs evoked by somatic current injection at various intervals t while imaging spine Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals. Finally, the latencies of synaptically evoked global APs and EPSPs were found to correspond to t  10 ms, explaining the observed approximately linear summation of synaptic local and global signals. Our results provide additional evidence for the existence of the GC spine spike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Here we investigate the interaction of local synaptic inputs and global activation of a neuron by a backpropagating action potential within a dendritic spine with respect to local Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling. Our system of interest, the reciprocal spine of the olfactory bulb granule cell, is known to feature a special processing mode, namely, a synaptically triggered action potential that is restricted to the spine head. Therefore, coincidence detection of local and global signals follows different rules than in more conventional synapses. We unravel these rules using both simulations and experiments and find that signals coincident within ±7 ms around 0 ms result in sublinear summation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry because of synaptic activation of voltage-gated Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels within the spine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We introduce Arbor, a performance portable library for simulation of large
networks of multi-compartment neurons on HPC systems. Arbor is open source
software, developed under the auspices of the HBP. The performance portability
is by virtue of back-end specific optimizations for x86 multicore, Intel KNL,
and NVIDIA GPUs. When coupled with low memory overheads, these optimizations
make Arbor an order of magnitude faster than the most widely-used comparable
simulation software. The single-node performance can be scaled out to run very
large models at extreme scale with efficient weak scaling.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07298</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many time-series data including text, movies, and biological signals can be
represented as sequences of correlated binary patterns. These patterns may be
described by weighted combinations of a few dominant structures that underpin
specific interactions among the binary elements. To extract the dominant
correlation structures and their contributions to generating data in a
time-dependent manner, we model the dynamics of binary patterns using the
state-space model of an Ising-type network that is composed of multiple
undirected graphs. We provide a sequential Bayes algorithm to estimate the
dynamics of weights on the graphs while gaining the graph structures online.
This model can uncover overlapping graphs underlying the data better than a
traditional orthogonal decomposition method, and outperforms an original
time-dependent full Ising model. We assess the performance of the method by
simulated data, and demonstrate that spontaneous activity of cultured
hippocampal neurons is represented by dynamics of multiple graphs.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Children with congenital heart disease (CHD) remain at risk for
neurodevelopmental impairment despite improved peri- and intraoperative care.
Our prospective cohort study aimed to determine the relationship between
perioperative brain volumes and neurodevelopmental outcome in neonates with
severe CHD. Pre- and postoperative cerebral MRI was acquired in term born
neonates with CHD undergoing neonatal cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Brain
volumes were measured using an atlas prior based automated method. One-year
outcome was assessed with the Bayley-III. CHD infants (n=77) had lower pre- and
postoper-ative total and regional brain volumes compared to controls (n=44, all
p&amp;lt;0.01). CHD infants had poorer cognitive and motor outcome (p&amp;lt;=0.0001) and a
trend towards lower language composite score compared to controls (p=0.06). The
total and selected regional postoperative brain volumes predicted cognitive and
language outcome (all p&amp;lt;0.04). This association was independent of length of
intensive care unit stay for total, cortical, temporal, frontal and cerebellar
volumes. In CHD neonates undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery, pre- and
postoperative brain volumes are reduced, and postoperative brain volumes
predict cognitive and language outcome at one year. Reduced cerebral volumes in
CHD patients could serve as a biomarker for im-paired outcome.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.06552</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Working memory (WM) allows information to be stored and manipulated over
short time scales. Performance on WM tasks is thought to be supported by the
frontoparietal system (FPS), the default mode system (DMS), and interactions
between them. Yet little is known about how these systems and their
interactions relate to individual differences in WM performance. We address
this gap in knowledge using functional MRI data acquired during the performance
of a 2-back WM task, as well as diffusion tensor imaging data collected in the
same individuals. We show that the strength of functional interactions between
the FPS and DMS during task engagement is inversely correlated with WM
performance, and that this strength is modulated by the activation of FPS
regions but not DMS regions. Next, we use a clustering algorithm to identify
two distinct subnetworks of the FPS, and find that these subnetworks display
distinguishable patterns of gene expression. Activity in one subnetwork is
positively associated with the strength of FPS-DMS functional interactions,
while activity in the second subnetwork is negatively associated. Further, the
pattern of structural linkages of these subnetworks explains their differential
capacity to influence the strength of FPS-DMS functional interactions. To
determine whether these observations could provide a mechanistic account of
large-scale neural underpinnings of WM, we build a computational model of the
system composed of coupled oscillators. Modulating the amplitude of the
subnetworks in the model causes the expected change in the strength of FPS-DMS
functional interactions, thereby offering support for a mechanism in which
subnetwork activity tunes functional interactions. Broadly, our study presents
a holistic account of how regional activity, functional interactions, and
structural linkages together support individual differences in WM in humans.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/43888</link>
	<content:encoded>Myelin serves as an axonal insulator that facilitates rapid nerve conduction along axons. By transmission electron microscopy, a healthy myelin sheath comprises compacted membrane layers spiraling around the cross-sectioned axon. Previously we identified the assembly of septin filaments in the innermost non-compacted myelin layer as one of the latest steps of myelin maturation in the central nervous system (CNS) (Patzig et al., 2016). Here we show that loss of the cytoskeletal adaptor protein anillin (ANLN) from oligodendrocytes disrupts myelin septin assembly, thereby causing the emergence of pathological myelin outfoldings. Since myelin outfoldings are a poorly understood hallmark of myelin disease and brain aging we assessed axon/myelin-units in &lt;i&gt;Anln&lt;/i&gt;-mutant mice by focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM); myelin outfoldings were three-dimensionally reconstructed as large sheets of multiple compact membrane layers. We suggest that anillin-dependent assembly of septin filaments scaffolds mature myelin sheaths, facilitating rapid nerve conduction in the healthy CNS.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/41800</link>
	<content:encoded>Nuclear entry of HIV-1 replication complexes through intact nuclear pore complexes is critical for successful infection. The host protein cleavage-and-polyadenylation-specificity-factor-6 (CPSF6) has been implicated in different stages of early HIV-1 replication. Applying quantitative microscopy of HIV-1 reverse-transcription and pre-integration-complexes (RTC/PIC), we show that CPSF6 is strongly recruited to nuclear replication complexes but absent from cytoplasmic RTC/PIC in primary human macrophages. Depletion of CPSF6 or lack of CPSF6 binding led to accumulation of HIV-1 subviral complexes at the nuclear envelope of macrophages and reduced infectivity.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A Gestalt inference model for auditory scene segregation</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/vyBkEuhJkjY/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Debmalya Chakrabarty, Mounya Elhilali&lt;/p&gt;

Our current understanding of how the brain segregates auditory scenes into meaningful objects is in line with a Gestaltism framework. These Gestalt principles suggest a theory of how different attributes of the soundscape are extracted then bound together into separate groups that reflect different objects or streams present in the scene. These cues are thought to reflect the underlying statistical structure of natural sounds in a similar way that statistics of natural images are closely linked to the principles that guide figure-ground segregation and object segmentation in vision. In the present study, we leverage inference in stochastic neural networks to learn emergent grouping cues directly from natural soundscapes including speech, music and sounds in nature. The model learns a hierarchy of local and global spectro-temporal attributes reminiscent of simultaneous and sequential Gestalt cues that underlie the organization of auditory scenes. These mappings operate at multiple time scales to analyze an incoming complex scene and are then fused using a Hebbian network that binds together coherent features into perceptually-segregated auditory objects. The proposed architecture successfully emulates a wide range of well established auditory scene segregation phenomena and quantifies the complimentary role of segregation and binding cues in driving auditory scene segregation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vyBkEuhJkjY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Generalizing clusters of similar species as a signature of coexistence under competition</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/IY4Xes5-Z1I/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Rafael D’Andrea, Maria Riolo, Annette M. Ostling&lt;/p&gt;

Patterns of trait distribution among competing species can potentially reveal the processes that allow them to coexist. It has been recently proposed that competition may drive the spontaneous emergence of niches comprising clusters of similar species, in contrast with the dominant paradigm of greater-than-chance species differences. However, current clustering theory relies largely on heuristic rather than mechanistic models. Furthermore, studies of models incorporating demographic stochasticity and immigration, two key players in community assembly, did not observe clusters. Here we demonstrate clustering under partitioning of resources, partitioning of environmental gradients, and a competition-colonization tradeoff. We show that clusters are robust to demographic stochasticity, and can persist under immigration. While immigration may sustain clusters that are otherwise transient, too much dilutes the pattern. In order to detect and quantify clusters in nature, we introduce and validate metrics which have no free parameters nor require arbitrary trait binning, and weigh species by their abundances rather than relying on a presence-absence count. By generalizing beyond the circumstances where clusters have been observed, our study contributes to establishing them as an update to classical trait patterning theory.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IY4Xes5-Z1I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Top-down inputs drive neuronal network rewiring and context-enhanced sensory processing in olfaction</title>

Much of the computational power of the mammalian brain arises from its extensive top-down projections. To enable neuron-specific information processing these projections have to be precisely targeted. How such a specific connectivity emerges and what functions it supports is still poorly understood. We addressed these questions in silico in the context of the profound structural plasticity of the olfactory system. At the core of this plasticity are the granule cells of the olfactory bulb, which integrate bottom-up sensory inputs and top-down inputs delivered by vast top-down projections from cortical and other brain areas. We developed a biophysically supported computational model for the rewiring of the top-down projections and the intra-bulbar network via adult neurogenesis. The model captures various previous physiological and behavioral observations and makes specific predictions for the cortico-bulbar network connectivity that is learned by odor exposure and environmental contexts. Specifically, it predicts that—after learning—the granule-cell receptive fields with respect to sensory and with respect to cortical inputs are highly correlated. This enables cortical cells that respond to a learned odor to enact disynaptic inhibitory control specifically of bulbar principal cells that respond to that odor. For this the reciprocal nature of the granule cell synapses with the principal cells is essential. Functionally, the model predicts context-enhanced stimulus discrimination in cluttered environments (‘olfactory cocktail parties’) and the ability of the system to adapt to its tasks by rapidly switching between different odor-processing modes. These predictions are experimentally testable. At the same time they provide guidance for future experiments aimed at unraveling the cortico-bulbar connectivity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Zr8mG2szw1g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Differential mobility and local variation in infection attack rate</title>

Infectious disease transmission in animals is an inherently spatial process in which a host’s home location and their social mixing patterns are important, with the mixing of infectious individuals often different to that of susceptible individuals. Although incidence data for humans have traditionally been aggregated into low-resolution data sets, modern representative surveillance systems such as electronic hospital records generate high volume case data with precise home locations. Here, we use a gridded spatial transmission model of arbitrary resolution to investigate the theoretical relationship between population density, differential population movement and local variability in incidence. We show analytically that a uniform local attack rate is only possible for individual pixels in the grid if susceptible and infectious individuals move in the same way. Using a population in Guangdong, China, for which a robust quantitative description of movement is available (a movement kernel), and a natural history consistent with pandemic influenza; we show that local cumulative incidence is positively correlated with population density when susceptible individuals are more connected in space than infectious individuals. Conversely, under the less intuitively likely scenario, when infectious individuals are more connected, local cumulative incidence is negatively correlated with population density. The strength and direction of correlation changes sign for other kernel parameter values. We show that simulation models in which it is assumed implicitly that only infectious individuals move are assuming a slightly unusual specific correlation between population density and attack rate. However, we also show that this potential structural bias can be corrected by using the appropriate non-isotropic kernel that maps infectious-only code onto the isotropic dual-mobility kernel. These results describe a precise relationship between the spatio-social mixing of infectious and susceptible individuals and local variability in attack rates. More generally, these results suggest a genuine risk that mechanistic models of high-resolution attack rate data may reach spurious conclusions if the precise implications of spatial force-of-infection assumptions are not first fully characterized, prior to models being fit to data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bSUhdjfqBC8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Human verbal memory encoding is hierarchically distributed in a continuous processing stream: Human processing stream for verbal memory encoding</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0214-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Processing of memory is supported by coordinated activity in a network of sensory, association, and motor brain regions. It remains a major challenge to determine where memory is encoded for later retrieval. Here we used direct intracranial brain recordings from epilepsy patients performing free recall tasks to determine the temporal pattern and anatomical distribution of verbal memory encoding across the entire human cortex. High gamma frequency activity (65-115 Hz) showed consistent power responses during encoding of subsequently recalled and forgotten words on a subset of electrodes localized in 16 distinct cortical areas activated in the tasks. More of the high gamma power during word encoding, and less power before and after the word presentation, was characteristic of successful recall and observed across multiple brain regions. Latencies of the induced power changes and this subsequent memory effect between the recalled and forgotten words followed an anatomical sequence from visual to prefrontal cortical areas. Finally, the magnitude of the memory effect was unexpectedly found to be the largest in selected brain regions both at the top and at the bottom of the processing stream. These included the language processing areas of the prefrontal cortex and the downstream visual areas at the junction of the occipital and temporal lobes. Our results provide evidence for distributed encoding of verbal memory organized along a hierarchical posterior-to-anterior processing stream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Verbal memory is a complex function supported by a network of brain regions specialized for perception, decision-making, and execution of action. Our results shed light on the temporal and anatomical organization of this network during encoding of memories for subsequent recall. By finding consistent differences in fast gamma activity recorded directly from the human brain during presentation of words that were later recalled or forgotten, we identified specific regions with the greatest memory effect. This subsequent memory effect was present across a feed-forward processing stream, providing evidence for hierarchical and distributed organization of verbal memory. The identified brain regions in the processing stream present new targets for brain modulation technologies to treat verbal and cognitive deficits in brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

In this review, we revisit the fundamental manifestations of neuroborreliosis (meningitis, cranial neuritis, and radiculoneuritis), as these have withstood the test of time. We also discuss other manifestations that are less frequent. Stroke, as a manifestation of Lyme neuroborreliosis, is considered in the context of other infections. The summary of the literature regarding clinical outcomes of neuroborreliosis leads to its controversies. We also include new information on pathogenesis and on the polymicrobial nature of tick‐borne diseases.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Stroke Recovery in Rats after 24‐Hour–Delayed Intramuscular Neurotrophin‐3 Infusion</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25386?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurotrophin‐3 (NT3) plays a key role in the development and function of locomotor circuits including descending serotonergic and corticospinal tract axons and afferents from muscle and skin. We have previously shown that gene therapy delivery of human NT3 into affected forelimb muscles improves sensorimotor recovery after stroke in adult and elderly rats. Here, to move toward the clinic, we tested the hypothesis that intramuscular infusion of NT3 protein could improve sensorimotor recovery after stroke.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rats received unilateral ischemic stroke in sensorimotor cortex. To simulate a clinically feasible time to treatment, 24 hours later rats were randomized to receive NT3 or vehicle by infusion into affected triceps brachii for 4 weeks using implanted catheters and minipumps.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radiolabeled NT3 crossed from the bloodstream into the brain and spinal cord in rodents with or without strokes. NT3 increased the accuracy of forelimb placement during walking on a horizontal ladder and increased use of the affected arm for lateral support during rearing. NT3 also reversed sensory impairment of the affected wrist. Functional magnetic resonance imaging during stimulation of the affected wrist showed spontaneous recovery of peri‐infarct blood oxygenation level–dependent signal that NT3 did not further enhance. Rather, NT3 induced neuroplasticity of the spared corticospinal and serotonergic pathways.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results show that delayed, peripheral infusion of NT3 can improve sensorimotor function after ischemic stroke. Phase I and II clinical trials of NT3 (for constipation and neuropathy) have shown that peripheral high doses are safe and well tolerated, which paves the way for NT3 as a therapy for stroke. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2019;85:32–46.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25385?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate the association between serum soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2), a soluble type of an innate immune receptor expressed on the microglia, and the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 1,349 Japanese community residents aged 60 and older without dementia were followed prospectively for 10 years (2002–2012). Serum sTREM2 levels were quantified by using an enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay and divided into quartiles. Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) of serum sTREM2 levels on the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the follow‐up, 300 subjects developed all‐cause dementia; 193 had Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 85 had vascular dementia (VaD). The age‐ and sex‐adjusted incidences of all‐cause dementia, AD, and VaD elevated significantly with higher serum sTREM2 levels (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; for trend &amp;lt; 0.012). These associations were not altered after adjustment for confounding factors, including high‐sensitive C‐reactive protein. Subjects with the highest quartile of serum sTREM2 levels had significantly higher multivariable‐adjusted risks of developing all‐cause dementia, AD, and VaD than those with the lowest quartile (HR = 2.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.39–2.97, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001 for all‐cause dementia; HR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.02–2.55, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04 for AD; HR = 2.85, 95% CI = 1.35–6.02, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.006 for VaD). No significant heterogeneity in the association of serum sTREM2 levels with the development of dementia was observed among the other risk factor subgroups (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; for heterogeneity &amp;gt; 0.11).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present findings suggest a significant association between increased serum sTREM2 levels and the risk of developing all‐cause dementia, AD, and VaD in the general elderly Japanese population. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2019;85:47–58.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hand amputation is a highly disabling event, which significantly affects quality of life. An effective hand replacement can be achieved if the user, in addition to motor functions, is provided with the sensations that are naturally perceived while grasping and moving. Intraneural peripheral electrodes have shown promising results toward the restoration of the sense of touch. However, the long‐term usability and clinical relevance of intraneural sensory feedback have not yet been clearly demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this aim, we performed a 6‐month clinical study with 3 transradial amputees who received implants of transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrodes (TIMEs) in their median and ulnar nerves. After calibration, electrical stimulation was delivered through the TIMEs connected to artificial sensors in the digits of a prosthesis to generate sensory feedback, which was then used by the subjects while performing different grasping tasks.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All subjects, notwithstanding their important clinical differences, reported stimulation‐induced sensations from the phantom hand for the whole duration of the trial. They also successfully integrated the sensory feedback into their motor control strategies while performing experimental tests simulating tasks of real life (with and without the support of vision). Finally, they reported a decrement of their phantom limb pain and a general improvement in mood state.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The promising results achieved with all subjects show the feasibility of the use of intraneural stimulation in clinical settings. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2019;85:137–154.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agonism of protease‐activated receptor (PAR) 1 by activated protein C (APC) provides neuro‐ and vasculoprotection in experimental neuroinjury models. The pleiotropic PAR1 agonist, 3K3A‐APC, reduces neurological injury and promotes vascular integrity; 3K3A‐APC proved safe in human volunteers. We performed a randomized, controlled, blinded trial to determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of 3K3A‐APC in ischemic stroke patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NeuroNEXT trial, RHAPSODY, used a novel continual reassessment method to determine the MTD using tiers of 120, 240, 360, and 540 μg/kg of 3K3A‐APC. After intravenous tissue plasminogen activator, intra‐arterial mechanical thrombectomy, or both, patients were randomized to 1 of the 4 doses or placebo. Vasculoprotection was assessed as microbleed and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between January 2015 and July 2017, we treated 110 patients. Demographics resembled a typical stroke population. The MTD was the highest‐dose 3K3A‐APC tested, 540 μg/kg, with an estimated toxicity rate of 7%. There was no difference in prespecified ICH rates. In exploratory analyses, 3K3A‐APC reduced ICH rates compared to placebo from 86.5% to 67.4% in the combined treatment arms (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.046) and total hemorrhage volume from an average of 2.1 ± 5.8 ml in placebo to 0.8 ± 2.1 ml in the combined treatment arms (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.066).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RHAPSODY is the first trial of a neuroprotectant for acute ischemic stroke in a trial design allowing thrombectomy, thrombolysis, or both. The MTD was 540 μg/kg for the PAR1 active cytoprotectant, 3K3A‐APC. A trend toward lower hemorrhage rate in an exploratory analysis requires confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Attributable risk of Alzheimer's dementia attributed to age‐related neuropathologies</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25380?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The degree to which Alzheimer's versus other neuropathologies contribute to the risk of Alzheimer's dementia is unknown. We examined the risk of Alzheimer's dementia attributable to pathologic AD and 8 other neuropathologies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants (n = 1,161) came from 2 clinical‐pathological studies of aging. Multivariable logistic regression models examined associations of 8 neuropathological indices with Alzheimer's dementia and quantified the percentage of cases attributable to each. Furthermore, because some dementia cases are not driven by common neuropathologies, we re‐estimated the attributable risks after empirically adjusting for such cases.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of 1,161 persons, 512 (44.1%) had Alzheimer's dementia at time of death. With the exception of microinfarcts, all neuropathological indices were independently associated with greater odds of Alzheimer's dementia. Two hundred ten (41.0%) Alzheimer's dementia cases were attributable to pathological AD. Separately, 8.9% were attributable to macroscopic infarcts, 10.8% to Lewy bodies, 5.2% to hippocampal sclerosis, 11.7% to transactive response DNA‐binding protein 43, 8.1% to cerebral amyloid angiopathy, 6.0% to atherosclerosis, and 5.2% to arteriolosclerosis. A total of 83.3% of cases were attributable to all 8 indices combined. However, after further adjustment for cases driven by other factors, a total of 67.5% of cases were attributable to all 8 neuropathologic indices combined.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pathological AD accounts for a considerable percentage of Alzheimer's dementia cases, but multiple other neuropathologies also contribute. In total, just over two‐thirds of Alzheimer's dementia cases are attributable to common age‐related neuropathologies, suggesting that other disease and resilience factors are important. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2019;85:114–124.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25379?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine the association between clinical outcomes and acute systolic blood pressure (SBP) levels achieved after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eligible patients who were randomized to the ATACH‐2 (Antihypertensive Treatment in Intracerebral Hemorrhage 2) trial (&lt;a href=&quot;http://clinicaltrials.gov&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov&lt;/a&gt;: NCT01176565) were divided into 5 groups by 10‐mmHg strata of average hourly minimum SBP (&amp;lt;120, 120–130, 130–140, 140–150, and ≥ 150 mmHg) during 2 to 24 hours after randomization. Outcomes included: 90‐day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 4 to 6; hematoma expansion, defined as an increase ≥6 ml from baseline to 24‐hour computed tomography; and cardiorenal adverse events within 7 days.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 1,000 subjects in ATACH‐2, 995 with available SBP data were included in the analyses. The proportion of mRS 4 to 6 was 37.5, 36.0, 42.8, 38.6, and 38.0%, respectively. For the “140 to 150” group relative to the “120 to 130,” the odds ratio (OR), adjusting for sex, race, age, onset‐to‐randomization time, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, hematoma volume, and hematoma location, was 1.62 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02–2.58). Hematoma expansion was identified in 16.9, 13.7, 21.4, 18.5, and 26.4%, respectively. The 140 to 150 (OR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.05–3.09) and “≥150” (1.98; 1.12–3.51) showed a higher frequency of expansion than the 120 to 130 group. Cardiorenal events occurred in 13.6, 16.6, 11.5, 8.1, and 8.2%, respectively. The 140 to 150 (0.43; 0.19–0.88) and ≥ 150 (0.44; 0.18–0.96) showed a lower frequency of the events than the 120 to 130.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beneficial effects of lowering and maintaining SBP at 120 to 130 mmHg during the first 24 hours on clinical outcomes by suppressing hematoma expansion was somewhat offset by cardiorenal complications. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2019;85:105–113.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Magnetic resonance T1w/T2w ratio: A parsimonious marker for Parkinson disease</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25376?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newer magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques have shown promise in capturing early Parkinson disease (PD)‐related changes in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), the key pathological loci. Their translational value, however, is hindered by technical complexity and inconsistent results.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel yet simple MRI contrast, the T1w/T2w ratio, was used to study 76 PD patients and 70 controls. The T1w/T2w ratio maps were analyzed using both voxel‐based and region‐of‐interest approaches in normalized space. The sensitivity and specificity of the SNc T1w/T2w ratio in discriminating between PD and controls also were assessed. In addition, its diagnostic performance was tested in a subgroup of PD patients with disease duration ≤2 years (PDE). A second independent cohort of 73 PD patients and 49 controls was used for validation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to controls, PD patients showed a higher T1w/T2w ratio in both the right (cluster size = 164mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) and left (cluster size = 213mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) midbrain that was located ventrolateral to the red nucleus and corresponded to the SNc. The region‐of‐interest approach confirmed the group difference in the SNc T1w/T2w ratio between PD and controls (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). The SNc T1w/T2w ratio had high sensitivity (0.908) and specificity (0.80) to separate PD and controls (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.926), even for PDE patients (AUC = 0.901, sensitivity = 0.857, specificity = 0.857). These results were validated in the second cohort.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The T1w/T2w ratio can detect PD‐related changes in the SNc and may be used as a novel, parsimonious in vivo biomarker for the disease, particularly for early stage patients, with high translational value for clinical practice and research. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2019;85:96–104.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Brain state–dependent stimulation boosts functional recovery following stroke</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25375?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adjuvant protocols devised to enhance motor recovery in subacute stroke patients have failed to show benefits with respect to classic therapeutic interventions. Here, we evaluate the efficacy of a novel brain state–dependent intervention based on known mechanisms of memory and learning that is integrated as part of the weekly rehabilitation program in subacute stroke patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty‐four hospitalized subacute stroke patients were randomly assigned to 2 intervention groups: (1) the associative group received 30 pairings of a peripheral electrical nerve stimulus (ES) such that the generated afferent volley arrived precisely during the most active phase of the motor cortex as patients attempted to perform a movement; and (2) in the control group, the ES intensity was too low to generate a stimulation of the nerve. Functional (including the lower extremity Fugl–Meyer assessment [LE‐FM; primary outcome measure]) and neurophysiological (changes in motor evoked potentials [MEPs]) assessments were performed prior to and following the intervention period.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The associative group significantly improved functional recovery with respect to the control group (median [interquartile range] LE‐FM improvement = 6.5 [3.5–8.25] and 3 [0.75–3], respectively; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.029). Significant increases in MEP amplitude were seen following all sessions in the associative group only (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≤ 0.006).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first evidence of a clinical effect of a neuromodulatory intervention in the subacute phase of stroke. This was evident with relatively few repetitions in comparison to available techniques, making it a clinically viable approach. The results indicate the potential of the proposed neuromodulation system in daily clinical routine for stroke rehabilitation. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2019;85:84–95.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25373?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine whether brain amyloid burden in elderly patients with narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) is lower than in controls, and to assess in patients with NT1 the relationships between amyloid burden, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) markers of Alzheimer disease (AD), CSF orexin‐A, and cognitive profile.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cognitive and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F‐florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) data were compared in patients with NT1 aged ≥ 65 years (n = 23) and in age‐ and sex‐matched controls free of clinical dementia selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; n = 69) and the Multi‐Domain Intervention Alzheimer's Prevention Trial (MAPT‐18F AV45‐PET; n = 23) cohorts. The standardized uptake values (SUVs) of the cortical retention index for 6 regions of interest were computed and averaged to create a mean SUV ratio normalized to 3 subcortical reference regions (cerebellum, pons, and a composite region). A cortical/cerebellum SUV ratio ≥ 1.17 defined positive PET amyloid.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower cortical amyloid burden was observed in the NT1 than in the ADNI and MAPT‐AV45 groups (mean cortical/cerebellum SUV ratios = 0.95 ± 0.15, 1.11 ± 0.18 [&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001], and 1.14 ± 0.17 [&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0005], respectively). Similar results were obtained with all subcortical reference regions and for all cortical regions of interest, except cingulum. Only 1 patient with NT1 (4.4%) had positive PET amyloid compared with 27.5% in the ADNI and 30.4% in the MAPT‐AV45 group. In the NT1 group, cortical or regional amyloid load was not associated with CSF orexin‐A, CSF AD biomarkers, or neuropsychological profile.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower brain amyloid burden, assessed by &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F‐florbetapir PET, in patients with NT1 suggests delayed appearance of amyloid plaques. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2019;85:74–83.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Neural basis of induced phantom limb pain relief</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25371?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phantom limb pain (PLP) is notoriously difficult to treat, partly due to an incomplete understanding of PLP‐related disease mechanisms. Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) is used to modulate plasticity in various neuropathological diseases, including chronic pain. Although NIBS can alleviate neuropathic pain (including PLP), both disease and treatment mechanisms remain tenuous. Insight into the mechanisms underlying both PLP and NIBS‐induced PLP relief is needed for future implementation of such treatment and generalization to related conditions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used a within‐participants, double‐blind, and sham‐controlled design to alleviate PLP via task‐concurrent NIBS over the primary sensorimotor missing hand cortex (S1/M1). To specifically influence missing hand signal processing, amputees performed phantom hand movements during anodal transcranial direct current stimulation. Brain activity was monitored using neuroimaging during and after NIBS. PLP ratings were obtained throughout the week after stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A single session of intervention NIBS significantly relieved PLP, with effects lasting at least 1 week. PLP relief associated with reduced activity in the S1/M1 missing hand cortex after stimulation. Critically, PLP relief and reduced S1/M1 activity correlated with preceding activity changes during stimulation in the mid‐ and posterior insula and secondary somatosensory cortex (S2).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The observed correlation between PLP relief and decreased S1/M1 activity confirms our previous findings linking PLP with increased S1/M1 activity. Our results further highlight the driving role of the mid‐ and posterior insula, as well as S2, in modulating PLP. Lastly, our novel PLP intervention using task‐concurrent NIBS opens new avenues for developing treatment for PLP and related pain conditions. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2019;85:59–73.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(18)30320-5?rss=yes</link>
	<content:encoded>Microglia provide immune surveillance of the CNS. They display diverse behaviors, including nondirectional and directed motility of their processes, phagocytosis of targets such as dying neurons or superfluous synapses, and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cytokines. Many of these functions are mediated by ion channels and cell surface receptors, the expression of which varies with the many morphological and functional states that microglial cells can adopt. Recent progress in understanding microglial function has been facilitated by applying classical cell physiological techniques in situ, such as patch-clamping and live imaging, and cell-specific transcriptomic analyses.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently identified mutations of the axon guidance molecule receptor gene, &lt;i&gt;DCC,&lt;/i&gt; present an opportunity to investigate, in living human brain, mechanisms affecting neural connectivity and the basis of mirror movements, involuntary contralateral responses that mirror voluntary unilateral actions. We hypothesized that haploinsufficient &lt;i&gt;DCC&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+/‐&lt;/sup&gt; mutation carriers with mirror movements would exhibit decreased &lt;i&gt;DCC&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression, a functional ipsilateral corticospinal tract, greater “mirroring” motor representations, and reduced interhemispheric inhibition. &lt;i&gt;DCC&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+/‐&lt;/sup&gt; mutation carriers without mirror movements might exhibit some of these features.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants (n=52) included 13 &lt;i&gt;DCC&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+/‐&lt;/sup&gt; mutation carriers with mirror movements, 7 &lt;i&gt;DCC&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+/‐&lt;/sup&gt; mutation carriers without mirror movements, 13 relatives without the mutation or mirror movements, and 19 unrelated healthy volunteers. The multimodal approach comprised quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) under resting and task conditions, and measures of white matter integrity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mirror movements were associated with reduced &lt;i&gt;DCC&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression, increased ipsilateral TMS‐induced motor evoked potentials, increased fMRI responses in the “mirroring” M1 and cerebellum, and markedly reduced interhemispheric inhibition. The &lt;i&gt;DCC&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+/‐&lt;/sup&gt; mutation, irrespective of mirror movements, was associated with reduced functional connectivity and white matter integrity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diverse connectivity abnormalities were identified in mutation carriers with and without mirror movements, but corticospinal effects and decreased peripheral &lt;i&gt;DCC&lt;/i&gt; mRNA appeared driven by the mirror movement phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>RSS PAP: Transgenerational transmission of enhanced ocular dominance plasticity from enriched mice to their non-enriched offspring</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0252-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;In recent years, evidence has accumulated that non-Mendelian transgenerational inheritance of qualities acquired through experience is possible. In particular, it has been shown that raising rodents in a so-called enriched environment (EE) can not only modify the animals’ behaviour and increase their susceptibility to activity-dependent neuronal network changes, but also influences both behaviour and neuronal plasticity of the non-enriched offspring. Here, we tested whether such a transgenerational transmission can also be observed in the primary visual cortex (V1) using ocular dominance (OD) plasticity after monocular deprivation (MD) as a paradigm. While OD-plasticity after 7 days of MD is absent in standard-cage (SC) raised mice beyond postnatal day (P) 110, it is present lifelong in EE-raised mice. Using intrinsic signal optical imaging to visualize cortical activity, we confirm these previous observations and additionally show that OD-plasticity is not only preserved in adult EE-mice but also in their adult non-enriched offspring: mice born to enriched parents, but raised in SCs at least until P110 displayed similar OD-shifts towards the open eye after 7 days of MD as age-matched EE-raised animals. Furthermore, testing the offspring of EE-female versus EE-males with SC-mating partners revealed that only pups of EE-females, but not of EE-males, preserved OD-plasticity into adulthood, suggesting that the life experiences of the mother have a greater impact on the continued V1-plasticity of the offspring. The OD-plasticity of the non-enriched pups of EE-mothers was, however, mechanistically different from that of non-enriched pups of EE-parents or EE-mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Recently evidence is accumulating that life experiences and thus acquired qualities of parents can be transmitted across generations in a non-Mendelian fashion and have a significant impact on the fitness of offspring. Raising mice in a so-called enriched environment with enhanced opportunities for social interaction, voluntary physical exercise and explorative behaviour has been shown to boost cortical plasticity. Our results now show that the plasticity-promoting effect of enrichment on ocular dominance plasticity, a well-established plasticity paradigm in a primary sensory cortex, can also be transmitted from enriched parents to their non-enriched offspring. Thus cortical plasticity is not only influenced by an animal’s life experiences but can also be modified by the life experiences of its parents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Open Access: Reduced White Matter Fiber Density in Autism Spectrum Disorder</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy348/5298366?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Differences in brain networks and underlying white matter abnormalities have been suggested to underlie symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, robustly characterizing microstructural white matter differences has been challenging. In the present study, we applied an analytic technique that calculates structural metrics specific to differently-oriented fiber bundles within a voxel, termed “fixels”. Fixel-based analyses were used to compare diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data from 25 individuals with ASD (mean age = 16.8 years) and 27 typically developing age-matched controls (mean age = 16.9 years). Group comparisons of fiber density (FD) and bundle morphology were run on a fixel-wise, tract-wise, and global white matter (GWM) basis. We found that individuals with ASD had reduced FD, suggestive of decreased axonal count, in several major white matter tracts, including the corpus callosum (CC), bilateral inferior frontal-occipital fasciculus, right arcuate fasciculus, and right uncinate fasciculus, as well as a GWM reduction. Secondary analyses assessed associations with social impairment in participants with ASD, and showed that lower FD in the splenium of the CC was associated with greater social impairment. Our findings suggest that reduced FD could be the primary microstructural white matter abnormality in ASD.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Open Access: Plasticity in Adult Mouse Visual Cortex Following Optic Nerve Injury</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy347/5298360?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Optic nerve (ON) injury is an established model of axonal injury which results in retrograde degeneration and death of retinal ganglion cells as well anterograde loss of transmission and Wallerian degeneration of the injured axons. While the local impact of ON crush has been extensively documented we know comparatively little about the functional changes that occur in higher visual structures such as primary visual cortex (V1). We explored the extent of adult cortical plasticity using ON crush in aged mice. V1 function of the contralateral hemisphere was assessed longitudinally by intrinsic signal imaging and 2-photon calcium imaging before and after ON crush. Functional imaging demonstrated an immediate shift in V1 ocular dominance towards the ipsilateral, intact eye, due to the expected almost complete loss of responses to contralateral eye stimulation. Surprisingly, within 2 weeks we observed a delayed increase in ipsilateral eye responses. Additionally, spontaneous activity in V1 was reduced, similar to the lesion projection zone after retinal lesions. The observed changes in V1 activity indicate that severe ON injury in adulthood evokes cortical plasticity not only cross-modally but also within the visual cortex; this plasticity may be best compared with that seen after retinal lesions.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Selective Modulation of Early Visual Cortical Activity by Movement Intention</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy345/5298362?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The primate visual system contains myriad feedback projections from higher- to lower-order cortical areas, an architecture that has been implicated in the top-down modulation of early visual areas during working memory and attention. Here we tested the hypothesis that these feedback projections also modulate early visual cortical activity during the planning of visually guided actions. We show, across three separate human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies involving object-directed movements, that information related to the motor effector to be used (i.e., limb, eye) and action goal to be performed (i.e., grasp, reach) can be selectively decoded—prior to movement—from the retinotopic representation of the target object(s) in early visual cortex. We also find that during the planning of sequential actions involving objects in two different spatial locations, that motor-related information can be decoded from both locations in retinotopic cortex. Together, these findings indicate that movement planning selectively modulates early visual cortical activity patterns in an effector-specific, target-centric, and task-dependent manner. These findings offer a neural account of how motor-relevant target features are enhanced during action planning and suggest a possible role for early visual cortex in instituting a sensorimotor estimate of the visual consequences of movement.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Sequence Variation Associated with SLC12A5 Gene Expression Is Linked to Brain Structure and Function in Healthy Adults</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy344/5298361?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;A single-nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter region of the Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;MMP9&lt;/span&gt;) gene, rs3918242, has been shown to affect &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;MMP9&lt;/span&gt; expression in macrophages and was associated with schizophrenia by two independent groups. However, rs3918242's effects on &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;MMP9&lt;/span&gt; expression were not replicable in cell lines or brain tissue. Additionally, publically available data indicate that rs3918242 genotype is related not to &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;MMP9&lt;/span&gt; expression, but rather to expression of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;SLC12A5&lt;/span&gt;, a nearby gene coding for a K+/Cl- cotransporter, whose expression has also been related to schizophrenia. Here, we studied brain structure and function in healthy participants stratified by rs3918242 genotype using structural MRI (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 298), functional MRI during an N-back working memory task (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 554), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) during the same task (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 190). We found rs3918242 was associated with gray matter volume (GMV) in the insula and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex bilaterally, closely replicated in discovery and replication samples; and with inferior parietal lobule (IPL) GMV when the samples were meta-analytically combined. Additionally, using both fMRI and MEG, rs3918242 was associated with right IPL working memory-related activation, replicated in two cohorts and across imaging modalities. These convergent results provide further impetus for examinations of the relationship of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;SLC12A5&lt;/span&gt; with brain structure and function in neuropsychiatric disease.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Biological Characteristics of Connection-Wise Resting-State Functional Connectivity Strength</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy342/5298363?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Functional connectivity is defined as the statistical dependency of neurophysiological activity between 2 separate brain areas. To investigate the biological characteristics of resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC)—and in particular the significance of connection-wise variation in time-series correlations—rsFC was compared with strychnine-based connectivity measured in the macaque. Strychnine neuronography is a historical technique that induces activity in cortical areas through means of local administration of the substance strychnine. Strychnine causes local disinhibition through GABA suppression and leads to subsequent activation of functional pathways. Multiple resting-state fMRI recordings were acquired in 4 macaques (examining in total 299 imaging runs) from which a group-averaged rsFC matrix was constructed. rsFC was observed to be higher (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) between region-pairs with a strychnine-based connection as compared with region-pairs with no strychnine-based connection present. In particular, higher resting-state connectivity was observed in connections that were relatively stronger (weak &amp;lt; moderate &amp;lt; strong; &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) and in connections that were bidirectional (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) instead of unidirectional in strychnine-based connectivity. Our results imply that the level of correlation between brain areas as extracted from resting-state fMRI relates to the strength of underlying interregional functional pathways.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Spontaneous Brain Activity Predicts Task-Evoked Activity During Animate Versus Inanimate Touch</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy340/5298359?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The spontaneous activity of the brain is characterized by an elaborate temporal structure with scale-free properties as indexed by the power law exponent (PLE). We test the hypothesis that spontaneous brain activity modulates task-evoked activity during interactions with animate versus inanimate stimuli. For this purpose, we developed a paradigm requiring participants to actively touch either animate (real hand) or inanimate (mannequin hand) stimuli. Behaviorally, participants perceived the animate target as closer in space, temporally more synchronous with their own self, and more personally relevant, compared with the inanimate. Neuronally, we observed a modulation of task-evoked activity by animate versus inanimate interactions in posterior insula, in medial prefrontal cortex, comprising anterior cingulate cortex, and in medial superior frontal gyrus. Among these regions, an increased functional connectivity was shown between posterior insula and perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (PACC) during animate compared with inanimate interactions and during resting state. Importantly, PLE during spontaneous brain activity in PACC correlated positively with PACC task-evoked activity during animate versus inanimate stimuli. In conclusion, we demonstrate that brain spontaneous activity in PACC can be related to the distinction between animate and inanimate stimuli and thus might be specifically tuned to align our brain with its animate environment.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Neural Coding of Contact Events in Somatosensory Cortex</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy337/5298364?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Manual interactions with objects require precise and rapid feedback about contact events. These tactile signals are integrated with motor plans throughout the neuraxis to achieve dexterous object manipulation. To better understand the role of somatosensory cortex in interactions with objects, we measured, using chronically implanted arrays of electrodes, the responses of populations of somatosensory neurons to skin indentations designed to simulate the initiation, maintenance, and termination of contact with an object. First, we find that the responses of somatosensory neurons to contact onset and offset dwarf their responses to maintenance of contact. Second, we show that these responses rapidly and reliably encode features of the simulated contact events—their timing, location, and strength—and can account for the animals’ performance in an amplitude discrimination task. Third, we demonstrate that the spatiotemporal dynamics of the population response in cortex mirror those of the population response in the nerves. We conclude that the responses of populations of somatosensory neurons are well suited to encode contact transients and are consistent with a role of somatosensory cortex in signaling transitions between task subgoals.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Open Access: Thalamocortical Afferents Innervate the Cortical Subplate much Earlier in Development in Primate than in Rodent</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy327/5298367?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The current model, based on rodent data, proposes that thalamocortical afferents (TCA) innervate the subplate towards the end of cortical neurogenesis. This implies that the laminar identity of cortical neurons is specified by intrinsic instructions rather than information of thalamic origin. In order to determine whether this mechanism is conserved in the primates, we examined the growth of thalamocortical (TCA) and corticofugal afferents in early human and monkey fetal development. In the human, TCA, identified by secretagogin, calbindin, and ROBO1 immunoreactivity, were observed in the internal capsule of the ventral telencephalon as early as 7–7.5 PCW, crossing the pallial/subpallial boundary (PSB) by 8 PCW before the calretinin immunoreactive corticofugal fibers do. Furthermore, TCA were observed to be passing through the intermediate zone and innervating the presubplate of the dorsolateral cortex, and already by 10–12 PCW TCAs were occupying much of the cortex. Observations at equivalent stages in the marmoset confirmed that this pattern is conserved across primates. Therefore, our results demonstrate that in primates, TCAs innervate the cortical presubplate at earlier stages than previously demonstrated by acetylcholinesterase histochemistry, suggesting that pioneer thalamic afferents may contribute to early cortical circuitry that can participate in defining cortical neuron phenotypes.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Genetic mutant analysis in the nematode &lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/em&gt; has revealed common molecular programs that control neuronal identity. Neuron type-specific combinations of transcription factors, called terminal selectors, act as master regulatory factors to initiate and maintain terminal identity programs through direct regulation of neuron type-specific effector genes. We will provide here an update on recent studies that solidify the terminal selector concept in worms, flies and chordates.

	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/26i5OktndI4/article</link>

In the field of assisted reproductive techniques (ART), computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) systems have proved their utility and potential for assessing sperm quality, improving the prediction of the fertility potential of a seminal dose. Although most laboratories and scientific centers use commercial systems, in the recent years certain free and open-source alternatives have emerged that can reduce the costs that research groups have to face. However, these open-source alternatives cannot analyze sperm kinetic responses to different stimuli, such as chemotaxis, thermotaxis or rheotaxis. In addition, the programs released to date have not usually been designed to encourage the scalability and the continuity of software development. We have developed an open-source CASA software, called OpenCASA, which allows users to study three classical sperm quality parameters: motility, morphodmetry and membrane integrity (viability) and offers the possibility of analyzing the guided movement response of spermatozoa to different stimuli (useful for chemotaxis, thermotaxis or rheotaxis studies) or different motile cells such as bacteria, using a single software. This software has been released in a Version Control System at Github. This platform will allow researchers not only to download the software but also to be involved in and contribute to further developments. Additionally, a Google group has been created to allow the research community to interact and discuss OpenCASA. For validation of the OpenCASA software, we analysed different simulated sperm populations (for chemotaxis module) and evaluated 36 ejaculates obtained from 12 fertile rams using other sperm analysis systems (for motility, membrane integrity and morphology modules). The results were compared with those obtained by Open-CASA using the Pearson’s correlation and Bland-Altman tests, obtaining a high level of correlation in all parameters and a good agreement between the different used methods and the OpenCASA. With this work, we propose an open-source project oriented to the development of a new software application for sperm quality analysis. This proposed software will use a minimally centralized infrastructure to allow the continued development of its modules by the research community.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/26i5OktndI4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A Manifold Regularized Multi-Task Learning Model for IQ Prediction from Multiple fMRI Paradigms. (arXiv:1901.05913v1 [q-bio.QM])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05913</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Multi-modal brain functional connectivity (FC) data have shown great
potential for providing insights into individual variations in behavioral and
cognitive traits. The joint learning of multi-modal imaging data can utilize
the intrinsic association, and thus can boost the learning performance.
Although several multi-task based learning models have already been proposed by
viewing the feature learning on each modality as one task, most of them ignore
the geometric structure information inherent in the modalities, which may play
an important role in extracting discriminative features. In this paper, we
propose a new manifold regularized multi-task learning model by simultaneously
considering between-subject and between-modality relationships. Besides
employing a group-sparsity regularizer to jointly select a few common features
across multiple tasks (modalities), we design a novel manifold regularizer to
preserve the structure information both within and between modalities in our
model. This will make our model more adaptive for realistic data analysis. Our
model is then validated on the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort dataset,
where we regard our modalities as functional MRI (fMRI) data collected under
two paradigms. Specifically, we conduct experimental studies on fMRI based FC
network data in two task conditions for intelligence quotient (IQ) prediction.
The results demonstrate that our proposed model can not only achieve improved
prediction performance, but also yield a set of IQ-relevant biomarkers.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.04908</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The current dominant visual processing paradigm in both human and machine
research is the feedforward, layered hierarchy of neural-like processing
elements. Within this paradigm, visual saliency is seen by many to have a
specific role, namely that of early selection. Early selection is thought to
enable very fast visual performance by limiting processing to only the most
relevant candidate portions of an image. Though this strategy has indeed led to
improved processing time efficiency in machine algorithms, at least one set of
critical tests of this idea has never been performed with respect to the role
of early selection in human vision. How would the best of the current saliency
models perform on the stimuli used by experimentalists who first provided
evidence for this visual processing paradigm? Would the algorithms really
provide correct candidate sub-images to enable fast categorization on those
same images? Here, we report on a new series of tests of these questions whose
results suggest that it is quite unlikely that such an early selection process
has any role in human rapid visual categorization.

Complex eukaryotic promoters normally contain multiple cis-regulatory sequences for different transcription factors (TFs). The binding patterns of the TFs to these sites, as well as the way the TFs interact with each other and with the RNA polymerase (RNAp), lead to combinatorial problems rarely understood in detail, especially under varying epigenetic conditions. The aim of this paper is to build a model describing how the main regulatory cluster of the olfactory receptor Or59b drives transcription of this gene in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. The cluster-driven expression of this gene is represented as the equilibrium probability of RNAp being bound to the promoter region, using a statistical thermodynamic approach. The RNAp equilibrium probability is computed in terms of the occupancy probabilities of the single TFs of the cluster to the corresponding binding sites, and of the interaction rules among TFs and RNAp, using experimental data of Or59b expression to tune the model parameters. The model reproduces correctly the changes in RNAp binding probability induced by various mutation of specific sites and epigenetic modifications. Some of its predictions have also been validated in novel experiments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OzMB2Hh3nOo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Modeling cell line-specific recruitment of signaling proteins to the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/FF8MbA9TfH8/article</link>

Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) typically contain multiple autophosphorylation sites in their cytoplasmic domains. Once activated, these autophosphorylation sites can recruit downstream signaling proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) and phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains, which recognize phosphotyrosine-containing short linear motifs (SLiMs). These domains and SLiMs have polyspecific or promiscuous binding activities. Thus, multiple signaling proteins may compete for binding to a common SLiM and vice versa. To investigate the effects of competition on RTK signaling, we used a rule-based modeling approach to develop and analyze models for ligand-induced recruitment of SH2/PTB domain-containing proteins to autophosphorylation sites in the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) receptor (IGF1R). Models were parameterized using published datasets reporting protein copy numbers and site-specific binding affinities. Simulations were facilitated by a novel application of model restructuration, to reduce redundancy in rule-derived equations. We compare predictions obtained via numerical simulation of the model to those obtained through simple prediction methods, such as through an analytical approximation, or ranking by copy number and/or K&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; value, and find that the simple methods are unable to recapitulate the predictions of numerical simulations. We created 45 cell line-specific models that demonstrate how early events in IGF1R signaling depend on the protein abundance profile of a cell. Simulations, facilitated by model restructuration, identified pairs of IGF1R binding partners that are recruited in anti-correlated and correlated fashions, despite no inclusion of cooperativity in our models. This work shows that the outcome of competition depends on the physicochemical parameters that characterize pairwise interactions, as well as network properties, including network connectivity and the relative abundances of competitors.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FF8MbA9TfH8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Some mammalian lineages, such as primates, exhibit exceptionally large cortices relative to the amount of sensory inputs from the dorsal thalamus, and this expansion is associated with a larger number of distinct cortical areas, composing a larger proportion of the cortical sheet. We propose a link between the organization of the neocortex and its expansion relative to the size of the dorsal thalamus, based on a combination of work in comparative neuroanatomy and experimental research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;{\it Ellsberg thought experiments} and empirical confirmation of Ellsberg
preferences pose serious challenges to {\it subjective expected utility theory}
(SEUT). We have recently elaborated a quantum-theoretic framework for human
decisions under uncertainty which satisfactorily copes with the Ellsberg
paradox and other puzzles of SEUT. We apply here the quantum-theoretic
framework to the {\it Ellsberg two-urn example}, showing that the paradox can
be explained by assuming a state change of the conceptual entity that is the
object of the decision ({\it decision-making}, or {\it DM}, {\it entity}) and
representing subjective probabilities by quantum probabilities. We also model
the empirical data we collected in a DM test on human participants within the
theoretic framework above. The obtained results are relevant, as they provide a
line to model real life, e.g., financial and medical, decisions that show the
same empirical patterns as the two-urn experiment.

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Proposed Mechanism for Spontaneous Transitions between Interictal and Ictal Activity</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/3/557?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Epileptic networks are characterized by two outputs: brief interictal spikes and rarer, more prolonged seizures. Although either output state is readily modeled &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; and induced experimentally, the transition mechanisms are unknown, in part because no models exhibit both output states spontaneously. &lt;i&gt;In silico&lt;/i&gt; small-world neural networks were built using single-compartment neurons whose physiological parameters were derived from dual whole-cell recordings of pyramidal cells in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures that were generating spontaneous seizure-like activity. &lt;i&gt;In silico&lt;/i&gt;, neurons were connected by abundant local synapses and rare long-distance synapses. Activity-dependent synaptic depression and gradual recovery delimited synchronous activity. Full synaptic recovery engendered interictal population spikes that spread via long-distance synapses. When synaptic recovery was incomplete, postsynaptic neurons required coincident activation of multiple presynaptic terminals to reach firing threshold. Only local connections were sufficiently dense to spread activity under these conditions. This coalesced network activity into traveling waves whose velocity varied with synaptic recovery. Seizures were comprised of sustained traveling waves that were similar to those recorded during experimental and human neocortical seizures. Sustained traveling waves occurred only when wave velocity, network dimensions, and the rate of synaptic recovery enabled wave reentry into previously depressed areas at precisely ictogenic levels of synaptic recovery. Wide-field, cellular-resolution GCamP7b calcium imaging demonstrated similar initial patterns of activation in the hippocampus, although the anatomical distribution of traveling waves of synaptic activation was altered by the pattern of synaptic connectivity in the organotypic hippocampal cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; When computerized distributed neural network models are required to generate both features of epileptic networks (i.e., spontaneous interictal population spikes and seizures), the network structure is substantially constrained. These constraints provide important new hypotheses regarding the nature of epileptic networks and mechanisms of seizure onset.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Tau Accumulation in Clinically Normal Older Adults Is Associated with Hippocampal Hyperactivity</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/3/548?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Animal studies demonstrate that hyperactive neurons facilitate early accumulation and spread of tau and amyloid-β proteins in the pathological cascade of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Human neuroimaging studies have linked hippocampal hyperactivity to amyloid-β accumulation, apolipoprotein 4 (APOE4) and clinical progression from prodromal AD to clinical dementia. The relationship between hippocampal hyperactivity and early AD molecular pathology (amyloid-β and tau accumulation) before clinical symptoms remains to be elucidated. Here, we studied 120 clinically normal older humans (80 females/40 males) enrolled in the Harvard Aging Brain Study. We measured functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity during successful memory encoding and amyloid-β accumulation with PiB-positron emission tomography imaging. Additionally, we measured tau accumulation using AV1451 PET imaging in a subset of 87 participants. In this subset, we found that inferior temporal tau accumulation was associated with increased fMRI activity in the hippocampus, but showed no clear association with amyloid. Together, the findings support a hypothetical model of the evolution of preclinical AD that place hippocampal hyperactivity concurrent with spread of tau pathology to neocortical regions before clinical impairment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The circumstances under which the hippocampus becomes hyperactive in preclinical stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have thus far remained elusive. Recent advances in positron emission tomography (PET) tracers now enable &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; characterization of amyloid-β and tau accumulation. Here, we combine amyloid and tau PET with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the association between Alzheimer's disease pathology and memory-related brain activity in clinically normal older adults. We found an association between increased hippocampal activity and tau accumulation in the inferior temporal cortex. These data suggest that the pathogenesis of hippocampal hyperactivity occurs concurrent with the spread of tau pathology from the entorhinal cortex to the neocortex, before the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dopamine D2/3 Binding Potential Modulates Neural Signatures of Working Memory in a Load-Dependent Fashion</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/3/537?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dopamine (DA) modulates corticostriatal connections. Studies in which imaging of the DA system is integrated with functional imaging during cognitive performance have yielded mixed findings. Some work has shown a link between striatal DA (measured by PET) and fMRI activations, whereas others have failed to observe such a relationship. One possible reason for these discrepant findings is differences in task demands, such that a more demanding task with greater prefrontal activations may yield a stronger association with DA. Moreover, a potential DA–BOLD association may be modulated by task performance. We studied 155 (104 normal-performing and 51 low-performing) healthy older adults (43% females) who underwent fMRI scanning while performing a working memory (WM) &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-back task along with DA D&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt; PET assessment using [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]raclopride. Using multivariate partial-least-squares analysis, we observed a significant pattern revealing positive associations of striatal as well as extrastriatal DA D&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt; receptors to BOLD response in the thalamo–striatal–cortical circuit, which supports WM functioning. Critically, the DA–BOLD association in normal-performing, but not low-performing, individuals was expressed in a load-dependent fashion, with stronger associations during 3-back than 1-/2-back conditions. Moreover, normal-performing adults expressing upregulated BOLD in response to increasing task demands showed a stronger DA–BOLD association during 3-back, whereas low-performing individuals expressed a stronger association during 2-back conditions. This pattern suggests a nonlinear DA–BOLD performance association, with the strongest link at the maximum capacity level. Together, our results suggest that DA may have a stronger impact on functional brain responses during more demanding cognitive tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Dopamine (DA) is a major neuromodulator in the CNS and plays a key role in several cognitive processes via modulating the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal. Some studies have shown a link between DA and BOLD, whereas others have failed to observe such a relationship. A possible reason for the discrepancy is differences in task demands, such that a more demanding task with greater prefrontal activations may yield a stronger association with DA. We examined the relationship of DA to BOLD response during working memory under three load conditions and found that the DA–BOLD association is expressed in a load-dependent fashion. These findings may help explain the disproportionate impairment evident in more effortful cognitive tasks in normal aging and in those suffering dopamine-dependent neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Parkinson's disease).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0415-18.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The neuropeptide arginine-vasopressin (AVP) has long been implicated in the regulation of social behavior and communication, but precisely which AVP cell groups are involved is largely unknown. To address if the sexually dimorphic AVP cell group in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is important for social communication, we deleted BNST AVP cells by viral delivery of a Cre-dependent caspase-3 cell-death construct in AVP-iCre positive mice using AVP-iCre negative littermate as controls, and assessed social, sexual, aggressive and anxiety-related behaviors. In males, lesioning BNST AVP cells reduced social investigation of other males and increased urine marking in the presence of a live female, without altering ultrasonic vocalizations, resident-intruder aggression, copulatory behavior, anxiety, or investigation of females or their odor cues. In females, which have significantly fewer AVP cells in the BNST, these injections influenced copulatory behavior but otherwise had minimal effects on social behavior and communication, indicating that these cells contribute to sex differences in social behavioral function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Despite over thirty years of indirect evidence implicating sexually-dimorphic arginine vasopressin (AVP) cells within the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in the control of social and anxiety-related behavior in mammals, the function of these cells has never been directly tested. Here, we show that deletion of these cells in male, but not female, mice reduce investigation of same-sex conspecifics and alter social communication without changing aggressive and anxiety-related behaviors. Although AVP cell deletion in the BNST did not alter male copulatory behavior, it impaired female sexual behavior. These results indicate that sexually-dimorphic AVP cells in the BNST drive specific aspects of sexually-differentiated social investigation, behavior, and communication.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

This sister group relationship gives them an informative phylogenetic position for understanding the fascinating morphological and molecular cell type diversity of bilaterian nervous systems. Moreover, cnidarians display novel features such as endodermal neurogenesis and independently evolved centralizations, which provide a platform for understanding the evolution of nervous system innovations. In recent years, the application of modern genomic tools has significantly advanced our understanding of cnidarian nervous system structure and function. For example, transgenic reporter lines and gene knockdown experiments in several cnidarian species reveal a significant degree of conservation in the neurogenesis gene regulatory program, while single cell RNA sequencing projects are providing a much deeper understanding of cnidarian neural cell type diversity. At the level of neural function, the physiological properties of ion channels have been described and calcium imaging of the nervous system in whole animals has allowed for the identification of neural circuits underlying specific behaviours. Cnidarians have arrived in the modern era of molecular neurobiology and are primed to provide exciting new insights into the early evolution of nervous systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: How to correctly quantify neuronal phase-response curves from noisy recordings. (arXiv:1901.04399v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.04399</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;At the level of individual neurons, various coding properties can be inferred
from the input-output relationship of a cell. For small inputs, this relation
is captured by the phase-response curve (PRC), which measures the effect of a
small perturbation on the timing of the subsequent spike. Experimentally,
however, an accurate experimental estimation of PRCs is challenging. Despite
elaborate measurement efforts, experimental PRC estimates often cannot be
related to those from modeling studies. In particular, experimental PRCs rarely
resemble the generic PRC expected close to spike initiation, which is
indicative of the underlying spike-onset bifurcation. Here, we show for
conductance-based model neurons that the correspondence between theoretical and
measured phase-response curve is lost when the stimuli used for the estimation
are too large. In this case, the derived phase-response curve is distorted
beyond recognition and takes on a generic shape that reflects the measurement
protocol, but not the real neuronal dynamics. We discuss how to identify
appropriate stimulus strengths for perturbation and noise-stimulation methods,
which permit to estimate PRCs that reliably reflect the spike-onset bifurcation
-- a task that is particularly difficult if a lower bound for the stimulus
amplitude is dictated by prominent intrinsic neuronal noise.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.04094</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural decoding may be formulated as dynamic state estimation (filtering)
based on point process observations, a generally intractable problem. Numerical
sampling techniques are often practically useful for the decoding of real
neural data. However, they are less useful as theoretical tools for modeling
and understanding sensory neural systems, since they lead to limited conceptual
insight about optimal encoding and decoding strategies. We consider sensory
neural populations characterized by a distribution over neuron parameters. We
develop an analytically tractable Bayesian approximation to optimal filtering
based on the observation of spiking activity, that greatly facilitates the
analysis of optimal encoding in situations deviating from common assumptions of
uniform coding. Continuous distributions are used to approximate large
populations with few parameters, resulting in a filter whose complexity does
not grow with the population size, and allowing optimization of population
parameters rather than individual tuning functions. Numerical comparison with
particle filtering demonstrates the quality of the approximation. The analytic
framework leads to insights which are difficult to obtain from numerical
algorithms, and is consistent with biological observations about the
distribution of sensory cells' preferred stimuli.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human listeners need to permanently interact with their three-dimensional
(3-D) environment. To this end, they require efficient perceptual mechanisms to
form a sufficiently accurate 3-D auditory space. In this chapter, we discuss
the formation of the 3-D auditory space from various perspectives. The aim is
to show the link between cognition, acoustics, neurophysiology, and
psychophysics, when it comes to spatial hearing. First, we present recent
cognitive concepts for creating internal models of the complex auditory
environment. Second, we describe the acoustic signals available at our ears and
discuss the spatial information they convey. Third, we look into
neurophysiology, seeking for the neural substrates of the 3-D auditory space.
Finally, we elaborate on psychophysical spatial tasks and percepts that are
possible just because of the formation of the auditory space.

	<title>RSS PAP: Postmeal optogenetic inhibition of dorsal or ventral hippocampal pyramidal neurons increases future intake</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0457-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Memory of a recently eaten meal can serve as a powerful mechanism for controlling future eating behavior because it provides a record of intake that likely outlasts most physiological signals generated by the meal. In support, impairing the encoding of a meal in humans increases the amount ingested at the next eating episode. However, the brain regions that mediate the inhibitory effects of memory on future intake are unknown. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that dorsal (dHC) and ventral hippocampal (vHC) glutamatergic pyramidal neurons play a critical role in the inhibition of energy intake during the postprandial period by optogenetically inhibiting these neurons at specific times relative to a meal. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were given viral vectors containing CaMKIIα-eArchT3.0-eYFP or CaMKIIα-GFP and fiber optic probes into dHC of one hemisphere and vHC of the other. Compared to intake on a day in which illumination was not given, inhibition of dHC or vHC glutamatergic neurons after the end of a chow, sucrose, or saccharin meal accelerated the onset of the next meal and increased the amount consumed during that next meal when the neurons were no longer inhibited. Inhibition given during a meal did not affect the amount consumed during that meal or the next one but did hasten meal initiation. These data show that dHC and vHC glutamatergic neuronal activity during the postprandial period is critical for limiting subsequent ingestion and suggest that these neurons inhibit future intake by consolidating the memory of the preceding meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Memory of a recently eaten meal provides a lasting record of recent intake and limits subsequent ingestion; however, the neural mechanisms underlying these mnemonic effects remain unknown. Here, we show that optogenetic inhibition of dorsal or ventral hippocampal pyramidal neurons induced after the end of a sucrose, chow or saccharin meal, when the memory of the meal would be undergoing consolidation, accelerated the initiation of the next meal and, importantly, increased the amount consumed during that next meal when the neurons were no longer inhibited. These findings show that principal hippocampal neurons limit future intake and suggest that they do so by consolidating the memory of the preceding meal.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Cell-Type-Specific Changes in Intrinsic Excitability in the Subiculum following Learning and Exposure to Novel Environmental Contexts</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/6/ENEURO.0484-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The subiculum is the main target of the hippocampal region CA1 and is the principle output region of the hippocampus. The subiculum is critical to learning and memory, although it has been relatively understudied. There are two functional types of principle neurons within the subiculum: regular spiking (RS) and burst spiking (BS) neurons. To determine whether these cell types are differentially modified by learning-related experience, we performed whole-cell patch clamp recordings from male mouse brain slices following contextual fear conditioning (FC) and memory retrieval relative to a number of control behavioral paradigms. RS cells, but not BS cells, displayed a greater degree of experience-related plasticity in intrinsic excitability measures [afterhyperpolarization (AHP), input resistance (R&lt;sub&gt;input&lt;/sub&gt;), current required to elicit a spike], with fear conditioned animals having generally more excitable RS cells compared to naïve controls. Furthermore, we found that the relative proportion of RS to BS neurons is modified by the type of exposure, with the lowest proportion of BS subicular cells occurring in animals that underwent contextual FC followed by a retrieval test. These studies indicate that pyramidal neurons in the subiculum undergo experience- and learning-related plasticity in intrinsic properties in a cell-type-specific manner. As BS and RS cells are thought to convey distinct types of information, this plasticity may be particularly important in encoding, consolidating, and recalling spatial information by modulating information flow from the hippocampus to cortical regions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: PINK1 Interacts with VCP/p97 and Activates PKA to Promote NSFL1C/p47 Phosphorylation and Dendritic Arborization in Neurons</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/6/ENEURO.0466-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;While PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) is well characterized for its role in mitochondrial homeostasis, much less is known concerning its ability to prevent synaptodendritic degeneration. Using unbiased proteomic methods, we identified valosin-containing protein (VCP) as a major PINK1-interacting protein. RNAi studies demonstrate that both VCP and its cofactor NSFL1C/p47 are necessary for the ability of PINK1 to increase dendritic complexity. Moreover, PINK1 regulates phosphorylation of p47, but not the VCP co-factor UFD1. Although neither VCP nor p47 interact directly with PKA, we found that PINK1 binds and phosphorylates the catalytic subunit of PKA at T197 [PKA&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;(pT197)], a site known to activate the PKA holoenzyme. PKA in turn phosphorylates p47 at a novel site (S176) to regulate dendritic complexity. Given that PINK1 physically interacts with both the PKA holoenzyme and the VCP-p47 complex to promote dendritic arborization, we propose that PINK1 scaffolds a novel PINK1-VCP-PKA-p47 signaling pathway to orchestrate dendritogenesis in neurons. These findings highlight an important mechanism by which proteins genetically implicated in Parkinson’s disease (PD; PINK1) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD; VCP) interact to support the health and maintenance of neuronal arbors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;This study examines longitudinal changes in the concreteness of nouns produced by human patients with semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA). Cross-sectional studies show that patients with svPPA demonstrate severe loss of concrete noun knowledge linked to atrophy of the left ventral temporal lobe. It is unknown how disease spread and duration affect the magnitude of the concreteness impairment in svPPA. We evaluate longitudinal spoken production of concrete nouns in svPPA, and relate this to changes in longitudinal MRI measures of gray matter (GM). Noun concreteness in svPPA is compared to that of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) patients, who typically demonstrate highly concrete speech. We elicited naturalistic speech samples at two time points (time 1 and time 2) in patients with svPPA (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 11) and bvFTD (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 15) through descriptions of the Cookie Theft picture and evaluated each spoken noun for concreteness. Compared to bvFTD patients whose noun production remained highly concrete throughout the testing period, mixed-effects models revealed that noun concreteness significantly decreased as disease progressed in svPPA. We also measured longitudinal changes to GM in a subset of svPPA patients (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 7), who showed significant decline in the left and right temporal and frontal regions. Regression analyses revealed that longitudinal GM atrophy in the right fusiform and parahippocampal gyri and the left superior temporal gyrus was related to decreasing noun concreteness. These results suggest that progressive atrophy of the ventral temporal lobe in svPPA contributes to declining concrete noun production over time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Pain-Related Fear--Dissociable Neural Sources of Different Fear Constructs</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/6/ENEURO.0107-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Fear of pain demonstrates significant prognostic value regarding the development of persistent musculoskeletal pain and disability. Its assessment often relies on self-report measures of pain-related fear by a variety of questionnaires. However, based either on &quot;fear of movement/(re)injury/kinesiophobia,&quot; &quot;fear avoidance beliefs,&quot; or &quot;pain anxiety,&quot; pain-related fear constructs plausibly differ while it is unclear how specific the questionnaires are in assessing these different constructs. Furthermore, the relationship of pain-related fear to other anxiety measures such as state or trait anxiety remains ambiguous. Advances in neuroimaging such as machine learning on brain activity patterns recorded by functional magnetic resonance imaging might help to dissect commonalities or differences across pain-related fear constructs. We applied a pattern regression approach in 20 human patients with nonspecific chronic low back pain to reveal predictive relationships between fear-related neural pattern information and different pain-related fear questionnaires. More specifically, the applied multiple kernel learning approach allowed the generation of models to predict the questionnaire scores based on a hierarchical ranking of fear-related neural patterns induced by viewing videos of activities potentially harmful for the back. We sought to find evidence for or against overlapping pain-related fear constructs by comparing the questionnaire prediction models according to their predictive abilities and associated neural contributors. By demonstrating evidence of nonoverlapping neural predictors within fear-processing regions, the results underpin the diversity of pain-related fear constructs. This neuroscientific approach might ultimately help to further understand and dissect psychological pain-related fear constructs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Neuronal Correlations in MT and MST Impair Population Decoding of Opposite Directions of Random Dot Motion</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/6/ENEURO.0336-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The study of neuronal responses to random-dot motion patterns has provided some of the most valuable insights into how the activity of neurons is related to perception. In the opposite directions of motion paradigm, the motion signal strength is decreased by manipulating the coherence of random dot patterns to examine how well the activity of single neurons represents the direction of motion. To extend this paradigm to populations of neurons, studies have used modelling based on data from pairs of neurons, but several important questions require further investigation with larger neuronal datasets. We recorded neuronal populations in the middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST) areas of anaesthetized marmosets with electrode arrays, while varying the coherence of random dot patterns in two opposite directions of motion (left and right). Using the spike rates of simultaneously recorded neurons, we decoded the direction of motion at each level of coherence with linear classifiers. We found that the presence of correlations had a detrimental effect to decoding performance, but that learning the correlation structure produced better decoding performance compared to decoders that ignored the correlation structure. We also found that reducing motion coherence increased neuronal correlations, but decoders did not need to be optimized for each coherence level. Finally, we showed that decoder weights depend of left-right selectivity at 100% coherence, rather than the preferred direction. These results have implications for understanding how the information encoded by populations of neurons is affected by correlations in spiking activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Gamma oscillations in the basolateral amygdala: biophysical mechanisms and computational consequences</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0388-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BL) is thought to support numerous emotional behaviors through specific microcircuits. These are often thought to be comprised of feedforward networks of principal cells and interneurons. Neither well-understood nor often considered are recurrent and feedback connections, which likely engender oscillatory dynamics within BL. Indeed, oscillations in the gamma frequency range (40-100 Hz) are known to occur in the BL, and yet their origin and effect on local circuits remains unknown. To address this, we constructed a biophysically and anatomically detailed model of the rat BL and its local field potential based on the physiological and anatomical literature, along with &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; data we collected on the activities of neurons within the rat BL. Remarkably, the model produced intermittent gamma oscillations (~50-70 Hz) whose properties matched those recorded &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, including their entrainment of spiking. BL gamma-band oscillations were generated by the intrinsic circuitry, depending upon reciprocal interactions between principal cells and fast-spiking interneurons, while connections within these cell types affected the rhythm’s frequency. The model allowed us to conduct experimentally impossible tests to characterize the synaptic and spatial properties of gamma. The entrainment of individual neurons to gamma depended on the number of afferent connections they received, and gamma bursts were spatially restricted in the BL. Importantly, the gamma rhythm synchronized principal cells and mediated competition between ensembles. Together, these results indicate that the recurrent connectivity of BL expands its computational and communication repertoire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significant Statement&lt;/b&gt; Using &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; data we develop the first large-scale biophysically and anatomically realistic model of the basolateral amygdala nucleus (BL), which reproduces the dynamics of the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; local field potential (LFP). Significantly, it predicts that BL intrinsically generates the transient gamma oscillations observed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. The model permitted exploration of the poorly understood synaptic mechanisms underlying gamma genesis in BL, and the model's ability to compute LFPs at arbitrary numbers of recording sites provided insights into the characteristics of the spatial properties of gamma bursts. Furthermore, we show how gamma synchronizes principal cells to overcome their low firing rates while simultaneously promoting competition, potentially impacting their afferent selectivity and efferent drive, and thus emotional behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0462-18.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The primary sensory cortex processes competitive sensory inputs. Ablation of these competitive inputs induces neuroplastic changes in local cortical circuits. However, information concerning cortical plasticity induced by a disturbance of competitive nociceptive inputs is limited. Nociceptive information from the maxillary and mandibular molar pulps converges at the border between the ventral secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) and insular oral region (IOR), therefore S2/IOR is a suitable target for examining the cortical changes induced by a disturbance of noxious inputs, which often causes neuropathic pain and allodynia. We focused on the plastic changes in S2/IOR excitation in a model of rats subjected to inferior alveolar nerve transection (IANX). Our optical imaging using a voltage-sensitive dye revealed that the maxillary molar pulp stimulation-induced excitatory propagation was expanded 1-2 weeks after IANX at the macroscopic level. At the cellular level, based on Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging using two-photon microscopy, the amplitude of the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; responses and the number of responding neurons in S2/IOR increased in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; laser scanning photostimulation revealed that layer II/III pyramidal and GABAergic fast-spiking neurons in S2/IOR received larger excitatory inputs from layer IV in the IANX models, which supports the findings obtained by the macroscopic and microscopic optical imaging. Furthermore, the inhibitory postsynaptic inputs to the pyramidal neurons were decreased in the IANX models, suggesting suppression of inhibitory synaptic transmission onto excitatory neurons. These results suggest that IANX induces plastic changes in S2/IOR by changing the local excitatory and inhibitory circuits. (246/250 words)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; The inferior alveolar nerve (IAN), a mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve, innervates the orofacial region, including the tooth pulps. IAN transection (IANX) induces allodynia in the maxillary nerve-projecting region. This study demonstrates the facilitation of excitatory propagation in the secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) and insular oral region (IOR) following maxillary molar tooth pulp stimulation in IANX rats. Both pyramidal and fast-spiking neurons in layer II/III S2/IOR of IANX rats received larger glutamatergic excitatory inputs from the deeper layers. Reduction of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-mediated IPSCs in pyramidal neurons of IANX rats may contribute to the facilitated excitation in S2/IOR. These findings suggest that GABAergic neurons in S2/IOR could be a therapeutic target for ectopic pain in the orofacial region. (118/120 words)&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Methamphetamine self-administration elicits sex related changes in postsynaptic glutamate transmission in the prefrontal cortex</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0401-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Pre-clinical and clinical research has shown that females are more vulnerable to the rewarding effects of stimulants, and it has been proposed that estrogens may play a role in this enhanced sensitivity; however sex differences in methamphetamine (METH)-induced neuroplasticity have not been explored. To address this gap in knowledge we recorded from the prelimbic area of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of male and females rats following long access METH self-administration (SA) and investigated the resulting long-term synaptic neuroadaptations. Males and females took similar amounts of METH during self-administration; however, female rats exhibit significant synaptic baseline differences when compared to males. Furthermore, females exhibited a significant increase in evoked excitatory currents. This increase in evoked glutamate was correlated with increases in NMDA currents and was not affected by application of a GluN2B selective blocker. We propose that METH SA selectively upregulates GluN2B-lacking NMDAR in the PFC of female rats. Our results may provide a mechanistic explanation for the sex differences reported for METH addiction in females.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The rate of methamphetamine (METH) addiction is second only to heroin, and use trends are on the rise. Like other drugs of abuse, there are known sex differences in METH addiction, however if these differences result from sex differences in pharmacokinetics, neurophysiology, and/or drug-induced neuroplasticity has not been established. Here we assessed METH self-administration induced neuroadaptations in synaptic physiology using electrophysiological measures in prefrontal cortical brain slices of male and female rats. We are the first to report, to our knowledge, that cortical baseline and METH-induced synaptic responses are different between male and female rats. Our results may provide a mechanistic explanation for the sex differences reported for METH addiction in females and highlight the possibility that sex-specific treatment strategies may be required to address METH-induced neuroplasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Isoflurane inhibits dopaminergic synaptic vesicle exocytosis coupled to CaV2.1 and CaV2.2 in rat midbrain neurons</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0278-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Volatile anesthetics affect neuronal signaling by poorly understood mechanisms. Activation of central dopaminergic pathways has been implicated in emergence from general anesthesia. The volatile anesthetic isoflurane differentially inhibits glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic vesicle exocytosis by reducing presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx without affecting the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-exocytosis relationship, but its effects on dopaminergic exocytosis are unclear. We tested the hypothesis that isoflurane inhibits exocytosis in dopaminergic neurons. We used electrical stimulation or depolarization by elevated extracellular KCl to evoke exocytosis measured by quantitative live-cell fluorescence imaging in cultured rat ventral tegmental area neurons. Using trains of electrically evoked action potentials (APs), isoflurane inhibited exocytosis in dopaminergic neurons to a greater extent (30 ± 4% inhibition; p &amp;lt; 0.0001) than in non-dopaminergic neurons (15 ± 5% inhibition; p = 0.014). Isoflurane also inhibited exocytosis evoked by elevated KCl in dopaminergic neurons (35 ± 6% inhibition; p = 0.0007), but not in non-dopaminergic neurons (2 ± 4% inhibition). Pharmacological isolation of presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel subtypes showed that isoflurane inhibited KCl-evoked exocytosis mediated exclusively by either Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 (P/Q-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels) (30 ± 5% inhibition; p = 0.0002) or by Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.2 (N-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels) (35 ± 11% inhibition; p = 0.015). Additionally, isoflurane inhibited single AP-evoked Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx by 41 ± 3% and single AP-evoked exocytosis by 34 ± 6%. Comparable reductions in exocytosis and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx were produced by lowering extracellular [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]. Thus, isoflurane inhibits exocytosis from dopaminergic neurons by a mechanism distinct from that in non-dopaminergic neurons involving reduced Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry through Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 and/or Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Despite their medical importance, the mechanisms of action of general anesthetics have not been fully elucidated. Isoflurane, a widely used volatile anesthetic, inhibits voltage-gated sodium channels and differentially inhibits synaptic vesicle exocytosis depending on neurotransmitter phenotype. Here we show that in dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area isoflurane acts via a sodium channel-independent mechanism to inhibit synaptic vesicle exocytosis in proportion to reduced presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; flux mediated by Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 and/or Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.2, in contrast to its effects in non-dopaminergic neurons. These findings provide a synaptic mechanism for the observed role of reduced dopamine release in anesthetic-induced unconsciousness, and implicate presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels of dopaminergic neurons as important targets of isoflurane.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/6/ENEURO.0187-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transparent and flexible materials are attractive for a wide range of emerging bioelectronic applications. These include neural interfacing devices for both recording and stimulation, where low electrochemical electrode impedance is valuable. Here the conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is used to fabricate electrodes that are small enough to allow unencumbered optical access for imaging a large cell population with two-photon (2P) microscopy, yet provide low impedance for simultaneous high quality recordings of neural activity &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. To demonstrate this, pathophysiological activity was induced in the mouse cortex using 4-aminopyridine (4AP), and the resulting electrical activity was detected with the PEDOT:PSS-based probe while imaging calcium activity directly below the probe area. The induced calcium activity of the neuronal network as measured by the fluorescence change in the cells correlated well with the electrophysiological recordings from the cortical grid of PEDOT:PSS microelectrodes. Our approach provides a valuable vehicle for complementing classical high temporal resolution electrophysiological analysis with optical imaging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Nociceptin/Orphanin-FQ Inhibits Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Neurons via G-Protein-Gated Inwardly Rectifying Potassium Channels</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/6/ENEURO.0161-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The pulsatile release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is a key feature of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis. Kisspeptin neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) trigger GnRH neuronal activity, but how GnRH neurons return to baseline electrical activity is unknown. Nociceptin/orphanin-FQ (OFQ) is an inhibitory neuromodulator. ARC proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons, known to receive inputs from ARC kisspeptin neurons, contact GnRH neurons and coexpress OFQ in the rat. In the present study, the effect of OFQ(1-13) on GnRH neurons was determined in the mouse. We identified transcripts for the OFQ receptor [opioid receptor like 1 (ORL1)] in GnRH neurons, and, using two-model systems (explants and slices), we found that OFQ exerted a potent inhibition on GnRH neurons, with or without excitatory inputs. We confirmed that the inhibition was mediated by ORL1 via G&lt;sub&gt;i/o&lt;/sub&gt;-protein coupling. The inhibition, occurring independently of levels of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate, was sensitive to inwardly rectifying potassium channels. The only specific blocker of G&lt;sub&gt;i/o&lt;/sub&gt;-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels, tertiapin-Q (TPNQ), was ineffective in the inhibition of OFQ. Two GIRK activators, one sharing the binding site of TPNQ and one active only on GIRK1-containing GIRK channels, failed to trigger an inhibition. In contrast, protein kinase C phosphorylation activation, known to inhibit GIRK2-mediated currents, prevented the OFQ inhibition. These results indicate a specific combination of GIRK subunits, GIRK2/3 in GnRH neurons. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt;, double-labeled OFQ/POMC fibers were found in the vicinity of GnRH neurons, and OFQ fibers apposed GnRH neurons. Together, this study brings to light a potent neuromodulator of GnRH neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

There has been considerable effort to use these profiles to understand cell diversity, primarily through unsupervised clustering and differential expression analysis. However, current practices to validate these findings vary. In this review, we describe recent efforts to evaluate clusters from single-cell RNA-sequencing data, and provide a framework for considering current evidence and practices in terms of their capacity to establish principles of cell biology. Single-cell RNA-sequencing has already transformed neuroscience. By facilitating detailed comparative and genetic perturbation analyses, it may provide the tools to uncover fundamental mechanisms of neural diversity throughout the tree of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>
