	<title>Annals of Neurology: A mendelian form of neural tube defect caused by a de novo null variant in SMARCC1 in an identical twin</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25152</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most common birth defects in humans and yet their molecular etiology remains poorly understood. NTDs are believed to result from the complex interaction of environmental factors with a multitude of genetic risk factors in a classical multifactorial disease model. Mendelian forms of NTDs in which single variants are sufficient to cause the disease are extremely rare. We report a monozygotic twin with severe NTDs (occipital encephalocele and myelomeningocele) and a shared de novo, likely truncating, variant in &lt;em&gt;SMARCC1&lt;/em&gt;. RTPCR analysis suggests the potential null nature of the variant attributed to nonsense-mediated decay. &lt;em&gt;SMARCC1&lt;/em&gt; is extremely constrained in humans and encodes a highly conserved core chromatin remodeler, BAF155. Mice that are heterozygous for a null allele or homozygous for a hypomorphic allele develop severe NTDs in the form of exencephaly. This is the first report of &lt;em&gt;SMARCC1&lt;/em&gt; mutation in humans, and it shows a critical and conserved requirement for intact BAF chromatin remodeling complex in neurulation.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Alternative diagnostic criteria for idiopathic hypersomnia: A 32-hour protocol</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25141</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25141-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess the diagnostic value of extended sleep duration on a controlled 32-hour bed rest protocol in idiopathic hypersomnia (IH).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25141-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;One hundred sixteen patients with high suspicion of IH (37 clear-cut IH according to multiple sleep latency test criteria and 79 probable IH), 32 with hypersomnolence associated with a comorbid disorder (non-IH), and 21 controls underwent polysomnography, modified sleep latency tests, and a 32-hour bed rest protocol. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to find optimal total sleep time (TST) cutoff values on various periods that discriminate patients from controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25141-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;TST was longer in patients with clear-cut IH than other groups (probable IH, non-IH, and controls) and in patients with probable IH than non-IH and controls. The TST cutoff best discriminating clear-cut IH and controls was 19 hours for the 32-hour recording (sensitivity = 91.9%, specificity = 85.7%) and 12 hours (100%, 85.7%) for the first 24 hours. The 19-hour cutoff displayed a specificity and sensitivity of 91.9% and 81.2% between IH and non-IH patients. Patients with IH above the 19-hour cutoff were overweight, had more sleep inertia, and had higher TST on all periods compared to patients below 19 hours, whereas no differences were found for the 12-hour cutoff. An inverse correlation was found between the mean sleep latency and TST during 32-hour recording in IH patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25141-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In standardized and controlled stringent conditions, the optimal cutoff best discriminating patients from controls was 19 hours over 32 hours, allowing a clear-cut phenotypical characterization of major interest for research purposes. Sleepier patients on the multiple sleep latency test were also the more severe in terms of extended sleep. Ann Neurol 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25143-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The neurodegenerative disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome involving multiple molecular pathways. The development of biomarkers for use in therapeutic trials is a priority. We sought to use a high-throughput proteomic method to identify novel biomarkers in individual cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25143-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry with label-free quantification was used to identify CSF proteins using samples from a well-characterized longitudinal cohort comprising patients with ALS (n = 43), the upper motor neuron variant, primary lateral sclerosis (PLS; n = 6), and cross-sectional healthy (n = 20) and disease controls (Parkinsons' disease, n = 20; ALS mimic disorders, n = 12).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25143-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three macrophage-derived chitinases showed increased abundance in ALS: chitotriosidase (CHIT1), chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1), and chitinase-3-like protein 2 (CHI3L2). Elevated CHI3L1 was common to ALS and PLS, whereas CHIT1 and CHI3L2 levels differed. Chitinase levels correlated with disease progression rate (CHIT1, &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.56, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001; CHI3L1, &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.31; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.028; CHI3L2, &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.29, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.044). CHIT1, CHI3L1, and CHI3L2 levels correlated with phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain (pNFH; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.62, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.49, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.41, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). CHI3L1 levels, but not CHIT1 or CHI3L2, increased over time in those with low initial levels (gradient = 0.005 log abundance units/month, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001). High CHIT1 was associated with shortened survival (hazard ratio [HR] 2.84; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.009). Inclusion of pNFH in survival models left only an association of pNFH and survival (HR 1.26; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.019).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Our objective is to describe the longitudinal evolution of thalamic atrophy in MS and normal aging, and to estimate sample sizes for study design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25150-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six hundred one subjects (2,632 MRI scans) were analyzed. Five hundred twenty subjects with relapse-onset MS (clinically isolated syndrome, n = 90; relapsing–remitting MS, n = 392; secondary progressive MS, n = 38) underwent annual standardized 3T MRI scans for an average of 4.1 years, including a 1mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; 3-dimensional T1-weighted sequence (3DT1; 2,485 MRI scans). Eighty-one healthy controls (HC) were scanned longitudinally on the same scanner using the same protocol (147 MRI scans). 3DT1s were processed using FreeSurfer's longitudinal pipeline after lesion inpainting. Rates of normalized thalamic volume loss in MS and HC were compared in linear mixed effects models. Simulation-based sample size calculations were performed incorporating the rate of atrophy in HC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The rate of decline was consistent throughout the MS disease duration and across MS clinical subtypes. Eighty or 100 subjects per arm (α = 0.1 or 0.05, respectively) would be needed to detect the maximal effect size with 80% power in a 24-month study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Effects of high vs moderate-intensity training on neuroplasticity and functional recovery after focal ischemia. (arXiv:1802.02937v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02937</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background and Purpose: This study was designed to compare the effects of
high-intensity interval training (HIT) and moderate-intensity continuous
training (MOD) on functional recovery and cerebral plasticity during the first
2 weeks following cerebral ischemia. Methods: Rats were randomized as follows:
Control (n=15), SHAM (n=9), MCAO (n=13), MCAO-D1 (n=7), MOD (n=13) and HIT
(n=13). Incremental tests were performed at day 1 (D1) and 14 (D14) to identify
the running speed associated with the lactate threshold (SLT) and the maximal
speed (Smax). Functional tests were performed at D1, D7 and D14. Microglia
form, cytokines, p75NTR, KCC2 and NKCC1 expression were made at D15.
Results-HIT was more effective to improve the endurance performance than MOD
and induced a fast recovery of the impaired forelimb grip force. The Iba-1
positive cells with amoeboid form and the pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine
expression were lower in HIT group, mainly in the ipsilesional hemisphere. A
p75NTR overexpression is observed on the ipsilesional side together with a
restored NKCC1/KCC2 ratio on the contralesional side. Conclusions-Low-volume
HIT based on lactate threshold appears to be more effective after cerebral
ischemia than work-matched MOD to improve aerobic fitness, grip strength and
might promote cerebral plasticity.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02930</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Drawing upon a body of research on the evolution of creativity, this paper
proposes a theory of how, when, and why the forward-thinking story-telling
abilities of humans evolved, culminating in the visionary abilities of science
fiction writers. The ability to recursively chain thoughts together evolved
approximately two million years ago. Language abilities, and the ability to
shift between different modes of thought, evolved approximately 100,000 years
ago. Science fiction dates to at least the second Century AD. It is suggested
that well before this time, but after 100,000 years ago, and concurrent with
the evolution of a division of labour between creators and imitators there
arose a division of labour between past, present, and future thinkers.
Agent-based model research suggests there are social benefits to the evolution
of individual differences in creativity such that there is a balance between
novelty-generating creators and continuity-perpetuating imitators. A balance
between individuals focused on the past, present, and future would be expected
to yield similar adaptive benefits.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Restate the reference for EEG microstate analysis. (arXiv:1802.02701v1 [q-bio.QM])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02701</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Despite the decades of efforts, the choice of EEG reference is still a
debated fundamental issue. Non-neutral reference can inevitably inject the
uncontrolled temporal biases into all EEG recordings, which may influence the
spatiotemporal analysis of brain activity. A method, termed microstates,
identifying spatiotemporal EEG features as the quasi-stable topography states
in milliseconds, suggests its potential as biomarkers of neurophysiological
disease. As reference electrode standardization technique (REST) could
reconstruct an infinity reference approximately, it is a question whether REST
or the other references will be more reliable than average reference (AR) for
the microstates analysis. In this study, we design the microstate-based EEG
forward model, and apply different references for microstates analysis. The
spatial similarity between the generated and assumed cluster maps is mainly
investigated. Furthermore, the real EEG data by the parametric bootstrap method
is used to validate the performance of the references. Finally, we find that
REST is robust to recover more similar cluster maps to the assumption than AR
in the simulation, and the cluster maps between REST and AR on the real EEG
data are quite different. This study may indicate that REST contributes to
identifying more objective microstates features than AR.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Biological Mechanisms for Learning: A Computational Model of Olfactory Learning in the Manduca sexta Moth, with Applications to Neural Nets. (arXiv:1802.02678v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02678</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The insect olfactory system, which includes the antennal lobe (AL), mushroom
body (MB), and ancillary structures, is a relatively simple neural system
capable of learning. Its structural features, which are widespread in
biological neural systems, process olfactory stimuli through a cascade of
networks where large dimension shifts occur from stage to stage and where
sparsity and randomness play a critical role in coding. Learning is partly
enabled by a neuromodulatory reward mechanism of octopamine stimulation of the
AL, whose increased activity induces rewiring of the MB through Hebbian
plasticity. Enforced sparsity in the MB focuses Hebbian growth on neurons that
are the most important for the representation of the learned odor. Based upon
current biophysical knowledge, we have constructed an end-to-end computational
model of the Manduca sexta moth olfactory system which includes the interaction
of the AL and MB under octopamine stimulation. Our model is able to robustly
learn new odors, and our simulations of integrate-and-fire neurons match the
statistical features of in-vivo firing rate data. From a biological
perspective, the model provides a valuable tool for examining the role of
neuromodulators, like octopamine, in learning, and gives insight into critical
interactions between sparsity, Hebbian growth, and stimulation during learning.
Our simulations also inform predictions about structural details of the
olfactory system that are not currently well-characterized. From a machine
learning perspective, the model yields bio-inspired mechanisms that are
potentially useful in constructing neural nets for rapid learning from very few
samples. These mechanisms include high-noise layers, sparse layers as noise
filters, and a biologically-plausible optimization method to train the network
based on octopamine stimulation, sparse layers, and Hebbian growth.

The consensus that complexity begets stability in ecosystems was challenged in the seventies, a result recently extended to ecologically-inspired networks. The approaches assume the existence of a feasible equilibrium, i.e. with positive abundances. However, this key assumption has not been tested. We provide analytical results complemented by simulations which show that equilibrium feasibility vanishes in species rich systems. This result leaves us in the uncomfortable situation in which the existence of a feasible equilibrium assumed in local stability criteria is far from granted. We extend our analyses by changing interaction structure and intensity, and find that feasibility and stability is warranted irrespective of species richness with weak interactions. Interestingly, we find that the dynamical behaviour of ecologically inspired architectures is very different and richer than that of unstructured systems. Our results suggest that a general understanding of ecosystem dynamics requires focusing on the interplay between interaction strength and network architecture.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3gE01kroZuI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Amygdala stimulation-induced apnea is attention and nasal-breathing dependent</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25178</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests disordered breathing is critically involved in Sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP). To that end, evaluating structures that are activated by seizures and can activate brain regions that produce cardiorespiratory changes can further our understanding of the pathophysiology of SUDEP. Prior preclinical studies have shown that electrical stimulation of the human amygdala induces apnea, suggesting a role for the amygdala in controlling respiration. In this study, we aimed to both confirm these findings in a larger group of patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and also further explore the anatomical and cognitive properties of this effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven surgical TLE patients had depth electrodes implanted in the amygdala that were used to deliver electrical stimulation during functional mapping prior to resection. Real-time respiratory monitoring was performed in each patient to confirm apnea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our data confirm that amygdala stimulation reliably induces apnea (occurring in all seven patients) and further suggest that apnea can be overcome by instructing the patient to inhale, and can be prevented entirely by breathing through the mouth prior to electrical stimulation. Finally, stimulation induced apnea occurred only when stimulating the medial most amygdalar contacts located in the central nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings confirm a functional connection between the amygdala and respiratory control in humans. Moreover, they suggest specific amygdalar nuclei may be critical in mediating this effect and that attentional state is critical to apnea mediated by amygdala activation - perhaps alluding to future development of strategies for the prevention of SUDEP.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Do subjects with minimal motor features have prodromal PD?</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25179</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Background&lt;/b&gt;: Understanding the pathological changes underlying mild motor features of the eldery and defining a patient population with prodromal Parkinson's disease (PD) are of great clinical importance. It remains unclear, however, how to accurately and specifically diagnose prodromal PD. We examined whether older adults with minimal parkinsonian motor features have nigrostriatal degeneration and α-synuclein pathology consistent with prodromal PD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Brain sections were obtained from older adults with a clinical diagnosis of PD (N=21) and without a clinical diagnosis of PD (N=27) who underwent motor examination proximate to death. Cases without PD were further dichotomized into no motor deficit (n=9) or minimal motor features (n-18) groups using a modified Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. We performed quantitative unbiased stereological analyses of dopaminergic neurons/terminals and α-synuclein accumulation in the nigrostriatal system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: In all subjects with minimal motor features, there were significant reductions in dopaminergic neurons and terminals in the substantia nigra and putamen that was intermediate between subjects with no motor deficit and PD. Phosphorylated α-synuclein inclusions were observed in the substantia nigra that were of similar density to what was seen in PD. Furthermore, there was greater Lewy neuritic pathology in the putamen relative to PD patients. Lastly, neurons with α-synuclein inclusions displayed reductions in tyrosine hydroxylase expression that was comparable in subjects with both minimal motor features and PD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Minimal motor features in older adults may represent prodromal PD and identify at risk individuals for testing putative neuroprotective interventions that could slow or prevent PD progression.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Stereotactic Laser Amygdalohippocampotomy for Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25180</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective&lt;/em&gt;: To evaluate the outcomes one-year and longer following stereotactic laser amygdalohippocampotomy for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy in a large series of patients treated over a five-year period since introduction of this novel technique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods&lt;/em&gt;: Surgical outcomes of a consecutive series of fifty-eight patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy who underwent the surgery at our institution with at least 12-months follow-up were retrospectively evaluated. A subgroup analysis was performed comparing patients with and without mesial temporal sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results&lt;/em&gt;: One-year following stereotactic laser amygdalohippocampotomy 53.4% (95% confidence interval: 40.8%-65.7%) of all patients were free of disabling seizures (Engel 1). Three of nine patients became seizure free following repeat ablation. Subgroup analysis showed that 60.5% (95% confidence interval: 45.6%-73.7%) of patients with mesial temporal sclerosis were free of disabling seizures as compared to 33.3% (95% confidence interval: 15.0%-58.5%) of patients without mesial temporal sclerosis. Quality of Life in Epilepsy-31 scores significantly improved at the group level, few procedure-related complications were observed, and verbal memory outcome was better than historical open resection data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interpretation&lt;/em&gt;: In an unselected consecutive series of patients, stereotactic laser amygdalohippocampotomy yielded seizure-free rates for patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy lower than, but comparable to, the outcomes typically associated with open temporal lobe surgery. Analogous to results from open surgery, patients without mesial temporal sclerosis fared less well. This novel procedure is an effective minimally invasive alternative to resective surgery. In the minority of patients not free of disabling seizures, laser ablation presents no barrier to additional open surgery. This article is protected by copyright.

Extensive works during the past decade yield ample insights into the molecular and cellular functions of MeCP2 in neural development. Furthermore, genetic manipulations in Mecp2 mouse models strongly suggested that deficiency in synaptic plasticity and various behaviors of Mecp2 null or transgenic mice could be rescued in adulthood. Further studies elucidating neural circuits responsible for symptoms in MECP2-associated disorders in rodent and non-human primate models will shed light on the development of potential therapeutic interventions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Clinical and animal model studies have shown that changes in PFC excitation and inhibition are important for cognitive functions as well as related disorders. Here, we discuss recent findings revealing the roles of the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic proteins neuroligin 1 (NLGN1) and NLGN2 in the PFC in memory formation and modulation of memory strength. We propose that shifts in NLGN1 and NLGN2 expression in specific excitatory and inhibitory neuronal subpopulations in response to experience regulate the dynamic processes of memory consolidation and strengthening. Because excitatory/inhibitory imbalances accompany neuropsychiatric disorders in which strength and flexibility of representations play important roles, understanding these mechanisms may suggest novel therapies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

These limitations reflect what has been dichotomy between the structure and mechanical properties of living brain tissue and non-living neural probes. To bridge the gap between neural and electronic networks, we have introduced the new concept of mesh electronics probes designed with structural and mechanical properties such that the implant begins to ‘look and behave’ like neural tissue. Syringe-implanted mesh electronics have led to the realization of probes that are neuro-attractive and free of the chronic immune response, as well as capable of stable long-term mapping and modulation of brain activity at the single-neuron level. This review provides a historical overview of a 10-year development of mesh electronics by highlighting the tissue-like design, syringe-assisted delivery, seamless neural tissue integration, and single-neuron level chronic recording stability of mesh electronics. We also offer insights on unique near-term opportunities and future directions for neuroscience and neurology that now are available or expected for mesh electronics neurotechnologies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

These experiments begin to provide a mechanistic understanding of motivation-specific neural processing of need-relevant cues in healthy humans and in disease states such as obesity and other eating disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

A recent explosion of technical advances in genome-editing and single-cell sequencing has enabled lineage analysis in an unprecedented scale, speed, and depth across different species.

During development, individual gene activity can dynamically engage different signaling networks; thus genetic mutations can lead to different functional changes at different times. Interpretation of phenotypes can be further complicated if initial functional changes trigger compensatory mechanisms. Examining genetic mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders reveals cellular phenotypes that change over the course of development and exist long before behavioral deficits are assessed. Correspondingly, earlier genetic interventions in these disorder models have often been more effective at improving behavioral deficits than late interventions. The restricted period of effective intervention demonstrates that identifying a target window is an essential component of treatment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Emerging evidence indicates that REST is a master transcriptional regulator of neuron-specific genes not only in neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation, but also in differentiated neurons during the critical period in postnatal brain development, where it plays a role in fine-tuning of genes involved in synaptic plasticity, and in normal aging, where it promotes neuroprotection by repressing genes involved in oxidative stress and β-amyloid toxicity. This review focuses on recent findings that dysregulation of REST and REST-dependent epigenetic remodeling provide a central mechanism critical to the progressive neurodegeneration associated with neurologic disorders and diseases including global ischemia, stroke, epilepsy, Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

This neural activity reflects internal processes by which the brain plans and executes volitional movements. The study of motor planning offers an opportunity to understand how the structure and dynamics of neural circuits support persistent internal states and how these states influence behavior. Recent advances in large-scale neural recordings are beginning to decipher the relationship of the dynamics of populations of neurons during motor planning and movements. New behavioral tasks in rodents, together with quantified perturbations, link dynamics in specific nodes of neural circuits to behavior. These studies reveal a neural network distributed across multiple brain regions that collectively supports motor planning. We review recent advances and highlight areas where further work is needed to achieve a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying motor planning and related cognitive processes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

These functions rely on the computation of the local cerebellar microcircuits and long-range connectivity that relays cerebellar output to various brain areas. In this review, we discuss recent work on two of the circuit elements, which are thought to be fundamental for a wide range of non-sensorimotor behaviors: The role for cerebellar granule cells in multimodal integration in the cerebellar cortex and the long-range connectivity between the deep cerebellar nuclei and the basal ganglia. Lastly, we discuss how studies on synapses and circuits of the cerebellum in rodent models of autism-spectrum disorders might contribute to our understanding of the pathophysiology of this class of neurodevelopmental disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Studies have found that sensory, prefrontal, hippocampal, cerebellar, and striatal regions, as well as the circuits that connect them, are perturbed in mouse models of ASD and ID. Dissecting the disruptions in morphology and activity in these neural circuits might help us to understand the shared risk between the two disorders as well as their clinical heterogeneity. Treatments that target the balance between excitation and inhibition in these regions are able to reverse pathological phenotypes, elucidating this deficit as a commonality across models and opening new avenues for intervention. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Understanding the mechanisms underlying neuronal structural changes is central to our knowledge of how the nervous system is shaped for complex behaviors and how it further adapts to developmental and environmental demands. Caenorhabditis elegans provides a powerful model for examining developmental processes and for discovering mechanisms controlling neural plasticity. Recent findings have identified conserved themes underlying neural plasticity in development and under environmental stress. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Designing behavioral paradigms that provide a solid foundation to ask questions about decision-making computations and mechanisms is a difficult and often underestimated challenge. Here, we propose three dimensions on which we can consider rodent decision-making tasks: ethological validity, task complexity, and stimulus-response compatibility. We review recent research through this lens, and provide practical guidance for researchers in the decision-making field. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

These platforms leverage basic advances in biocompatible materials, semiconductor device designs and systems engineering concepts to afford modes of operation that are qualitatively distinct from those of conventional approaches that tether animals to external hardware by means of optical fibers, electrical cables and/or fluidic tubing. Neuroscience studies that exploit the unique features of these technologies enable insights into neural function through targeted stimulation, inhibition and recording, with spatially and genetically precise manipulation of neural circuit activity. Experimental possibilities include studies in naturalistic, three dimensional environments, investigations of pair-wise or group related social interactions and many other scenarios of interest that cannot be addressed using traditional hardware. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Individual network components in the mushroom bodies of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster represent cues, learning signals and behavioral outcomes of learned experience. Recent findings have highlighted the importance of dopamine-driven plasticity and activity in feedback and feedforward connections, between various elements of the mushroom body neural network. These computational motifs have been shown to be crucial for long term olfactory memory consolidation, integration of internal states, re-evaluation and updating of learned information. The often recurrent circuit anatomy and a prolonged requirement for activity in parts of these underlying networks, suggest that self-sustained and precisely timed activity is a fundamental feature of network computations in the insect brain. Together these processes allow flies to continuously adjust the content of their learned knowledge and direct their behavior in a way that best represents learned expectations and serves their most pressing current needs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Numerous genes in the endo-lysosomal pathways have been found to associate with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mutations of these genes lead to dysfunction in multiple steps of the endo-lysosomal network: autophagy, endocytic trafficking and lysosomal degradation, resulting in accumulation of pathogenic proteins. Although the exact pathogenic mechanism varies for different disease-associated genes, dysfunction of the endo-lysosomal pathways represents a converging mechanism shared by these diseases. Therefore, strategies that correct or compensate for endo-lysosomal dysfunction may be promising therapeutic approaches to treat neurodegenerative diseases. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

These devices, usually sensing cell activity via microelectrodes, should be characterized by safe working conditions in the biological milieu together with a well-controlled operation-life. The stable device/neuronal electrical coupling at the interface requires tight interactions between the electrode surface and the cell membrane. This neuro-electrode hybrid represents the hyphen between the soft nature of neural tissue, generating electrical signals via ion motions, and the rigid realm of microelectronics and medical devices, dealing with electrons in motion. Efficient integration of these entities is essential for monitoring, analyzing and controlling neuronal signaling but poses significant technological challenges. Improving the cell/electrode interaction and thus the interface performance requires novel engineering of (nano)materials: tuning at the nanoscale electrode's properties may lead to engineer interfacing probes that better camouflaged with their biological target. In this brief review, we highlight the most recent concepts in nanotechnologies and nanomaterials that might help reducing the mismatch between tissue and electrode, focusing on the device's mechanical properties and its biological integration with the tissue. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Activation of excitatory glutamatergic synapses leads to their shuttling from the synapse to the nucleus, mostly importin-mediated, and subsequent regulation of gene transcription needed for long lasting modifications of synaptic function. Accordingly, increasing evidences show that alterations of the activity of synaptonuclear messengers are correlated to synaptic failure as observed in different synaptopathies. Specifically, recent studies demonstrate that the modulation of the activity of synaptonuclear messengers could represent a novel molecular target in the pathogenesis of both neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

of consciousness. They are classified into two groups: Group-1 consists of
complex storm-like waves (a, b, and g); Group-2 is composed of simple
quasilinear waves (q and d). In order to elucidate the mechanism of EEG wave
formation and propagation, this paper extends the Vlasov-Maxwell equations of
Plasma Brain Dynamics (PBD) to a set of two-fluid, self-similar, nonlinear
solitary wave equations. Numerical simulations are performed for different EEG
signals. Main results include: (1) The excitation and propagation of the EEG
wave packets are dependent of electric and magnetic fields, brain aqua-ions,
electron and ion temperatures, masses, and their initial fluid speeds; (2)
Group-1 complex waves contain three ingredients: the high-frequency
ion-acoustic (IA) mode, the intermediate-frequency lower-hybrid (LH) mode, and
the low-frequency ion-cyclotron (IC) mode; (3) Group-2 simple waves fall within
the IA band, featured by one or a combination of the three envelopes:
sinusoidal, sawtooth, and spiky/bipolar. The study proposes an alternative
model to Quantum Brain Dynamics (QBD) by suggesting that the formation and
propagation of the nonlinear solitary EEG waves in the brain have the same
mechanism as that of the waves in space plasmas

	<content:encoded>We revisit recent evidence showing that nasal respiration entrains oscillations at the same frequency as breathing in several regions of the rodent brain. Moreover, respiration modulates the amplitude of a specific gamma sub-band (70–120Hz), most prominently in frontal regions.

	<content:encoded>There is current controversy regarding the role of prefrontal versus posterior cortices in consciousness. Clinical and correlative data have been used both to support and refute a causal role for prefrontal cortex in the level of consciousness, but a definitive relationship has not been demonstrated. We used anesthetic-induced unconsciousness as a model system to study the effect of cholinergic and noradrenergic stimulation of rat prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices on the level of consciousness. We demonstrate that cholinergic stimulation of prefrontal cortex, but not parietal cortical areas, restored wakefulness in rats despite continuous exposure to sevoflurane anesthesia. Noradrenergic stimulation of the prefrontal or parietal areas did not reverse the anesthetized state. We conclude that cholinergic mechanisms in prefrontal cortex can control the level of consciousness.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/262261v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective: This study aimed to characterise effects of coil orientation on the size of Motor Evoked Potentials (MEPs) from both sides of Orbicularis Oris (OO) and compare these effects with those reported for First Dorsal Interosseus (FDI), following stimulation to left lip and left hand Primary Motor Cortex. Methods: Using a 70mm figure-of-eight coil, we collected MEPs from eight different orientations while recording from contralateral and ipsilateral OO and FDI using a monophasic pulse. Results: MEPs from OO were evoked consistently for six out of eight orientations for contralateral and ipsilateral sites. When latency and silent periods were taken into account, contralateral orientations 0, 45, 90, and 315 degrees were found to best elicit OO MEPs with a likely cortical origin. As expected, the largest FDI MEPs were recorded with an orientation of 45 degrees, invoking a posterior-anterior (PA) current flow, from the contralateral location. Conclusion: Orientations traditionally used for FDI were also found suitable for eliciting OO MEPs. Individuals vary more in their optimal coil orientation for eliciting MEPs from OO than for FDI. It is recommended that researchers iteratively probe several orientations when eliciting MEPs from OO. Care must be taken however because several orientations likely induced direct activation of facial muscles.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/262246v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Maturation is a process that allows synapses to acquire full functionality; failures in synaptic maturation may contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders. Neuroligins are postsynaptic cell-adhesion molecules essential for synapse maturation, but the underlying pathways are incompletely understood. Here, we show that maturational increases in active zone stability and synaptic vesicle recycling rely on the joint action of Neuroligins and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Applying BDNF to neuronal cultures mimicked the maturation-promoting effects of overexpressing the Neuroligin isoforms NL1 or NL2. Inhibiting BDNF signaling reduced the effects of NL1 and NL2 on presynaptic maturation and of NL2 on synapse formation. Applying BDNF to NL1-knockout mouse cultures rescued defective presynaptic maturation, indicating that BDNF acts downstream of NL1 and can restore presynaptic maturation at late stages of network development. Our data introduce BDNF as a novel and essential component in a transsynaptic pathway linking Neuroligin-mediated cell adhesion, neurotrophin action and presynaptic maturation.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/262022v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective: Endodontic diagnosis collectively relies on interpretation of chair-side clinical testing and pain history to assess the presence of inflammation in the pulp and periapical tissues. Whether clinical findings relate to a patient subjective pain description is largely unknown. We tested for an association between mechanical and thermal sensory responses of affected teeth, with pain quality descriptors and pain intensity at rest and in function. Identification of such associations will clarify whether pain descriptors are useful in discriminating the underlying biological processes contributing to dental pain. Methods: Participants (n= 228) were recruited from among those presenting with toothache at a dental emergency clinic. Clinical testing (cold, EPT, percussion, palpation, and bite) was completed by calibrated examiners and participants verbally rated their pain intensity with reference to 22 pain qualities (0-10 VAS). Two-way ANOVA determined the relationship between groups defined by pulp vitality and percussion sensitivity and the intensity rating of each pain descriptor. Results: Patients with percussion hypersensitivity reported significantly higher levels of current pain, worst pain, pain at rest and pain in function. Patients with positive cold detection reported higher levels of pain at rest. There was a significant interaction between the cold responsiveness and percussion hypersensitivity on the intensity of pain evoked by cold. Patients with a positive cold detection and percussion hypersensitivity experienced more intense evoked pain with eating or drinking cold things. Patients with positive cold detection reported higher intensity shooting pain. Finally, patients with percussion hypersensitivity reported higher levels of radiating, throbbing pain and pain evoked by chewing/biting (all p&amp;lt;0.05). Conclusion: Shooting pain is more salient in odontalgia patients with a vital pulp diagnosis with positive cold detection results, and may be a unique feature of pulp mediated pain. Radiating, throbbing, and evoked pain are associated with percussion sensitivity and could reflect central sensitization or more advanced inflammatory processes. As pain is an individual and multidimensional experience, a detailed pain history including pain descriptors may help improve endodontic diagnosis and distinguish the underlying biological mechanisms in different stages of the disease.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/261255v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Learning and memory are known to be supported by a network involving the medial temporal lobe and linked neocortical regions. Emerging evidence indicates that primary sensory regions (i.e., V1) may be also contribute to recognition memory processes, but this has been only tested with a single visuospatial sequence as the target memorandum. The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to test the capacity of human V1 to support the learning of multiple, concurrent and complex visual sequences involving discontinous (second-order) associations. Two peripheral, task-irrelevant but structured sequences of orientated gratings appeared simultaneously in right and left visual fields alongside a central, task-relevant sequence that was in the focus of spatial attention. Pseudorandom sequences were interspersed amongst the three complex structured sequences with different asynchronies. We found that a network involving the precuneus and V1 was involved in learning the structured sequence presented at central fixation, whereas right V1 was modulated by repeated exposure to a concurrent structured sequence presented in the left visual field. The same result was not found in left V1. These results indicate that human V1 can support the learning of multiple concurrent sequences involving complex discontinuous inter-item associations, even those that are goal-irrelevant.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/259812v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Cyclic-AMP response element binding protein (CREB)-mediated gene expression is critical for the processing of visceral information, including learning about visceral stimuli (e.g. conditioned taste aversion). However, CREB requires additional co-factors to induce gene expression, including transducer of regulated CREB-activity (TORC). The nuclear localization of TORC1 has not been examined previously in the visceral neuraxis. c-Fos, a widely-used marker of activity, is induced by visceral stimulation. If CREB-mediated gene transcription is necessary for c-Fos induction in the visceral neuraxis after systemic LiCl injection, then TORC should be active following stimulation, and co-localized with c-Fos in activated neurons. We examined nuclear (activated) TORC1 in the visceral neuraxis at 30, 60, and 180 minutes after LiCl, as compared to c-Fos induction. Consistent with previous studies we found increases in c-Fos 60 min after LiCl in all regions. Nuclear TORC1 was also increased in the area postrema, NTS, and paraventricular nucleus after LiCl. Surprisingly, in the central amygdala, TORC1 was deactivated after LiCl, such that almost all TORC1 was cytoplasmic, whereas control rats had almost all nuclear TORC1. Fluorescent double-labeling of TORC1 and c-Fos after LiCl found that cellular co-localization of c-Fos and TORC1 was very low across the visceral neuraxis. Nuclear TORC1 expression reveals a population of cells in the visceral neuraxis, independent of c-Fos-positive cells, that are regulated by LiCl. TORC1, and in turn CREB-mediated gene transcription, may not be necessary for c-Fos induction in the visceral neuraxis after LiCl.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/234666v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Transcranial focused ultrasound is a form of non-invasive neuromodulation that uses acoustic energy to affect neuronal excitability. The effect of ultrasound on human motor cortical excitability is currently unknown. We apply ultrasound to the primary motor cortex in humans using a novel transcranial ultrasound and magnetic stimulation (TUMS) paradigm that allows for concurrent and concentric ultrasound stimulation with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). This allows for non-invasive inspection of the effect of ultrasound on motor neuronal excitability using the motor evoked potential (MEP) generated by TMS. We test the effect of ultrasound on single pulse MEP recruitment curves and paired pulse protocols including short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF). We also test the longevity of the effect and the effect of ultrasound on the cortical silent period in a small sub-sample of participants. In addition, we test the effect of ultrasound to motor cortex on a stimulus response reaction time task. Results show ultrasound inhibits the amplitude of single-pulse MEPs and attenuates intracortical facilitation but does not affect intracortical inhibition. Early evidence suggests that ultrasound does not affect cortical silent period duration and that the duration of inhibition may be related to the duration of stimulation. Finally, ultrasound reduces reaction time on a simple stimulus response task. This is the first report of the effect of ultrasound on human motor cortical excitability and motor behavior and confirms previous results in the somatosensory cortex that ultrasound results in effective neuronal inhibition that confers a performance advantage.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A computational approach to distinguish somatic vs. germline origin of genomic alterations from deep sequencing of cancer specimens without a matched normal</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/134RQp414fk/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by James X. Sun, Yuting He, Eric Sanford, Meagan Montesion, Garrett M. Frampton, Stéphane Vignot, Jean-Charles Soria, Jeffrey S. Ross, Vincent A. Miller, Phil J. Stephens, Doron Lipson, Roman Yelensky&lt;/p&gt;

A key constraint in genomic testing in oncology is that matched normal specimens are not commonly obtained in clinical practice. Thus, while well-characterized genomic alterations do not require normal tissue for interpretation, a significant number of alterations will be unknown in whether they are germline or somatic, in the absence of a matched normal control. We introduce SGZ (somatic-germline-zygosity), a computational method for predicting somatic vs. germline origin and homozygous vs. heterozygous or sub-clonal state of variants identified from deep massively parallel sequencing (MPS) of cancer specimens. The method does not require a patient matched normal control, enabling broad application in clinical research. SGZ predicts the somatic vs. germline status of each alteration identified by modeling the alteration’s allele frequency (AF), taking into account the tumor content, tumor ploidy, and the local copy number. Accuracy of the prediction depends on the depth of sequencing and copy number model fit, which are achieved in our clinical assay by sequencing to high depth (&amp;gt;500x) using MPS, covering 394 cancer-related genes and over 3,500 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Calls are made using a statistic based on read depth and local variability of SNP AF. To validate the method, we first evaluated performance on samples from 30 lung and colon cancer patients, where we sequenced tumors and matched normal tissue. We examined predictions for 17 somatic hotspot mutations and 20 common germline SNPs in 20,182 clinical cancer specimens. To assess the impact of stromal admixture, we examined three cell lines, which were titrated with their matched normal to six levels (10–75%). Overall, predictions were made in 85% of cases, with 95–99% of variants predicted correctly, a significantly superior performance compared to a basic approach based on AF alone. We then applied the SGZ method to the COSMIC database of known somatic variants in cancer and found &amp;gt;50 that are in fact more likely to be germline.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/134RQp414fk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01830</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The pervasive use of distributional semantic models or word embeddings in a
variety of research fields is due to their remarkable ability to represent the
meanings of words for both practical application and cognitive modeling.
However, little has been known about what kind of information is encoded in
text-based word vectors. This lack of understanding is particularly problematic
when word vectors are regarded as a model of semantic representation for
abstract concepts. This paper attempts to reveal the internal information of
distributional word vectors by the analysis using Binder et al.'s (2016)
brain-based vectors, explicitly structured conceptual representations based on
neurobiologically motivated attributes. In the analysis, the mapping from
text-based vectors to brain-based vectors is trained and prediction performance
is evaluated by comparing the estimated and original brain-based vectors. The
analysis demonstrates that social and cognitive information is better encoded
in text-based word vectors, but emotional information is not. This result is
discussed in terms of embodied theories for abstract concepts.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Alleviating catastrophic forgetting using context-dependent gating and synaptic stabilization. (arXiv:1802.01569v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01569</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Humans and most animals can learn new tasks without forgetting old ones.
However, training artificial neural networks (ANNs) on new tasks typically
cause it to forget previously learned tasks. This phenomenon is the result of
&quot;catastrophic forgetting&quot;, in which training an ANN disrupts connection weights
that were important for solving previous tasks, degrading task performance.
Several recent studies have proposed methods to stabilize connection weights of
ANNs that are deemed most important for solving a task, which helps alleviate
catastrophic forgetting. Here, drawing inspiration from algorithms that are
believed to be implemented in vivo, we propose a complementary method: adding a
context-dependent gating signal, such that only sparse, mostly non-overlapping
patterns of units are active for any one task. This method is easy to
implement, requires little computational overhead, and allows ANNs to maintain
high performance across large numbers of sequentially presented tasks when
combined with weight stabilization. This work provides another example of how
neuroscience-inspired algorithms can benefit ANN design and capability.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Global White Matter Diffusion Characteristics Predict Longitudinal Cognitive Change Independently of Amyloid Status in Clinically Normal Older Adults</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy031/4841692?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;White matter degradation has been proposed as one possible explanation for age-related cognitive decline. In the present study, we examined 2 main questions: 1) Do diffusion characteristics predict longitudinal change in cognition independently or synergistically with amyloid status? 2) Are the effects of diffusion characteristics on longitudinal cognitive change tract-specific or global in nature? Cognitive domains of executive function, episodic memory, and processing speed were measured annually (mean follow-up = 3.93 ± 1.25 years). Diffusion tensor imaging and Pittsburgh Compound-B positron emission tomography were performed at baseline in 265 clinically normal older adults (aged 63–90). Tract-specific diffusion was measured as the mean fractional anisotropy (FA) for 9 major white matter tracts. Global diffusion was measured as the mean FA across the 9 white matter tracts. Linear mixed models demonstrated independent, rather than synergistic, effects of global FA and amyloid status on cognitive decline. After controlling for amyloid status, lower global FA was associated with worse longitudinal performance in episodic memory and processing speed, but not executive function. After accounting for global FA, none of the individual tracts predicted a significant change in cognitive performance. These findings suggest that global, rather than tract-specific, diffusion characteristics predict longitudinal cognitive decline independently of amyloid status.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;This study aimed to determine whether prenatal stress, measured by the number of stressful life events during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, might relate to mood dysregulation and altered brain structure in young adulthood. Participants included 93 young adults from a community-based birth cohort from the Czech Republic. Information on prenatal stress exposure was collected from their mothers in 1990−1992. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and mood-related data were collected from the young adults in 2015. MRI analyses focused on overall gray matter (GM) volume and GM volume of cortical regions previously associated with major depression. Higher prenatal stress predicted more mood dysregulation, lower overall GM volume, and lower GM volume in mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and precuneus in young adulthood. We observed no prenatal stress by sex interactions for any of the relations. We conclude that prenatal stress is an important risk factor that relates to worse mood states and altered brain structure in young adulthood irrespective of sex. Our results point to the importance and long-lasting effects of prenatal programming and suggest that offspring of mothers who went through substantial stress during pregnancy might benefit from early intervention that would reduce the odds of mental illness in later life.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy029/4841690?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;In the mammalian cortex, GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons represent 2 major neuronal classes, which establish inhibitory and excitatory synapses, respectively. Despite differences in their anatomy, physiology and developmental origin, both cell types require support from glial cells, particularly astrocytes, for their growth and survival. Recent experiments indicate that glutamatergic neurons also depend on astrocytes for synapse formation. However, it is not clear if the same holds true for GABAergic neurons. By studying highly pure GABAergic cell cultures, established through fluorescent activated cell sorting, we find that purified GABAergic neurons are smaller and have reduced survival, nevertheless they establish robust synaptic transmission in the absence of glia. Support from glial cells reverses morphological and survival deficits, but does little to alter synaptic transmission. In contrast, in cultures of purified glutamatergic neurons, morphological development, survival and synaptic transmission are collectively dependent on glial support. Thus, our results demonstrate a fundamental difference in the way GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons depend on glia for the establishment of synaptic transmission, a finding that has important implications for our understanding of how neuronal networks develop.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy028/4841689?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The normal development of thalamocortical connections plays a critical role in shaping brain connectivity in the prenatal and postnatal periods. Recent studies using advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques in neonates and infants have shown that abnormal thalamocortical connectivity is associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, all these studies have focused on a single neuroimaging modality, overlooking the dynamic relationship between structure and function at this early stage. Here, we study the relationship between structural and functional thalamocortical connectivity patterns derived from healthy full-term infants scanned with diffusion-weighted MRI and resting-state functional MRI within the first weeks of life (mean gestational age = 39.3 ± 1.2 weeks; age at scan = 24.2 ± 7.9 days). Our results show that while there is, in general, good spatial agreement between both MRI modalities, there are regional variations that are system-specific: regions involving primary-sensory cortices exhibit greater structural/functional overlap, whereas higher-order association areas such as temporal and posterior parietal cortices show divergence in spatial patterns of each modality. This variability illustrates the complementarity of both modalities and highlights the importance of multimodal approaches.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Cortical spreading depolarization (SD) is the electrophysiological event underlying migraine aura, and a critical contributor to secondary damage after brain injury. Experimental models of SD have been used for decades in migraine and brain injury research; however, they are highly invasive and often cause primary tissue injury, diminishing their translational value. Here we present a non-invasive method to trigger SDs using light-induced depolarization in transgenic mice expressing channelrhodopsin-2 in neurons (Thy1-ChR2-YFP). Focal illumination (470 nm, 1–10 mW) through intact skull using an optical fiber evokes power-dependent steady extracellular potential shifts and local elevations of extracellular [K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] that culminate in an SD when power exceeds a threshold. Using the model, we show that homozygous mice are significantly more susceptible to SD (i.e., lower light thresholds) than heterozygous ChR2 mice. Moreover, we show SD susceptibility differs significantly among cortical divisions (motor, whisker barrel, sensory, visual, in decreasing order of susceptibility), which correlates with relative channelrhodopsin-2 expression. Furthermore, the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 blocks the transition to SD without diminishing extracellular potential shifts. Altogether, our data show that the optogenetic SD model is highly suitable for examining physiological or pharmacological modulation of SD in acute and longitudinal studies.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Dual signaling of Wamide myoinhibitory peptides through a peptide-gated channel and a GPCR in Platynereis</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/261990v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Neuropeptides commonly signal by metabotropic G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). In some mollusks and cnidarians, RFamide neuropeptides mediate fast ionotropic signaling by peptide-gated ion channels that belong to the DEG/ENaC family. Here we describe a neuropeptide system with a dual mode of signaling by both a peptide-gated channel and a GPCR. We identified and characterised a peptide-gated channel in the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii that is specifically activated by Wamide myoinhibitory peptides derived from the same proneuropeptide. The myoinhibitory peptide-gated ion channel (MGIC) belongs to the DEG/ENaC family and is paralogous to RFamide-gated channels. Platynereis myoinhibitory peptides also activate a previously described GPCR, MAG. We measured the potency of all Wamides on both MGIC and MAG and identified peptides that preferentially activate one or the other receptor. Analysis of a single-cell transcriptome resource indicates that MGIC and MAG signal to distinct target neurons. The identification of a Wamide-gated channel suggests that peptide-gated channels are more diverse and widespread in animals than previously appreciated. The possibility of neuropeptide signaling by both ionotropic and metabotropic receptors to different target cells in the same organism highlights an additional level of complexity in peptidergic signaling networks.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Ribbon synapses of hair cells transmit mechanical information but the transfer characteristics relating deflection of the hair bundle to glutamate release have not been assessed directly. Here we have imaged glutamate to investigate how hair cells encode information in the lateral line of zebrafish. Half the hair cells signalled cupula motion in either direction from rest, achieving maximum sensitivity for deflections of ~40 nm in the preferred direction. The remainder rectified completely and were less sensitive, extending the operating range of the neuromast beyond 1 m. Adaptation was also heterogeneous, with some hair cells generating sustained synaptic outputs and others transient. A unique signal encoded a return to rest: a transient burst from hair cells unresponsive to the initial stimulus. A mixed population of hair cells with these various transfer characteristics will allow a neuromast to encode weak stimuli as well as the amplitude and duration of stronger deflections.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Extinction recall of fear memories formed before stress is not affected despite amygdalar hyperactivity</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/261578v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Stress is known to exert its detrimental effects not only by enhancing fear, but also by impairing its extinction. However, in earlier studies stress exposure invariably preceded both processes. Thus, compared to unstressed animals, stressed animals had to extinguish fear memories from higher levels of freezing caused by prior exposure to stress. Here we decouple the two processes to examine if stress specifically impairs fear extinction. Strikingly, when fear memories were formed before stress exposure, thereby allowing animals to initiate extinction from comparable levels of fear, recall of fear extinction was unaffected. Despite this we observed a persistent increase in theta activity in the BLA. Theta activity in the mPFC, by contrast, was normal. Stress also disrupted mPFC-BLA theta-frequency synchrony and directional coupling. Thus, in the absence of the fear-enhancing effects of stress, the expression of fear reflects normal regulation of mPFC activity, not stress-induced hyperactivity in the amygdala.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Single-trial Phase Entrainment of Theta Oscillations in Sensory Regions Predicts Human Associative Memory Performance</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/261487v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Episodic memories are rich in sensory information and often contain integrated information from different sensory modalities. For instance, we can store memories of a recent concert with visual and auditory impressions being integrated in one episode. Theta oscillations have recently been implicated in playing a causal role synchronizing and effectively binding the different modalities together in memory. However, an open question is whether momentary fluctuations in theta synchronization predict the likelihood of associative memory formation for multisensory events. To address this question we presented movies and sounds with their luminance and volume modulated at theta (4 Hz), with a phase offset at 0{degrees} or 180{degrees} with respect to each other. This allowed us to entrain the visual and auditory cortex in a synchronous (0{degrees}) or asynchronous manner (180{degrees}). Participants were asked to remember the association between a movie and a sound while having their EEG activity recorded. Associative memory performance was significantly enhanced in the synchronous (0{degrees}) compared to the asynchronous (180{degrees}) condition. Source-level analysis demonstrated that the physical stimuli effectively entrained their respective cortical areas with a corresponding phase offset. Importantly, the strength of entrainment during encoding correlated with the efficacy of associative memory such that small phase differences between visual and auditory cortex predicted a high likelihood of correct retrieval in a later recall test. These findings suggest that theta oscillations serve a specific function in the episodic memory system: Binding the contents of different modalities into coherent memory episodes.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/261446v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The striatum shows general topographic organization and regional differences in behavioral functions. How corticostriatal topography differs across cortical areas and cell types to support these distinct functions is unclear. This study contrasted corticostriatal projections from two layer 5 cell types, intratelencephalic (IT-type) and pyramidal tract (PT-type) neurons, using viral vectors expressing fluorescent reporters in Cre-driver mice. Long-range corticostriatal projections from sensory and motor cortex are somatotopic, with a decreasing somatotopic specificity as injections move from sensory to motor and frontal areas. Somatotopic organization differs between IT-type and PT-type neurons, including injections in the same site, with IT-type neurons having higher somatotopic stereotypy than PT-type neurons. Furthermore, IT-type projections from interconnected cortical areas have stronger correlations in corticostriatal targeting than PT-type projections do. Thus, as predicted by a long-standing basal ganglia model, corticostriatal projections of interconnected cortical areas form parallel circuits in basal ganglia-thalamus-cortex loops.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/261438v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Nerve injury often causes neuronal loss and glial proliferation, disrupting the delicate balance between neurons and glial cells in the brain. Recently, we have developed an innovative technology to convert internal reactive glial cells into functional neurons inside the mouse brain. Here, we further demonstrate that such glia-to-neuron conversion can rebalance neuron-glia ratio and reverse glial scar back to neural tissue. Specifically, using a severe stab injury model in the mouse cortex, we demonstrated that ectopic expression of NeuroD1 in reactive astrocytes significantly reduced glial reactivity and transformed toxic A1 astrocytes into less harmful astrocytes before neuronal conversion. Importantly, astrocytes were not depleted after neuronal conversion but rather repopulated due to its intrinsic proliferation capability. Remarkably, converting reactive astrocytes into neurons also significantly reduced microglia-mediated neuroinflammation. Moreover, accompanying regeneration of new neurons together with repopulation of new astrocytes, blood-brain-barrier was restored and synaptic density was rescued in the injury sites. Together, these results demonstrate that glial scar can be reversed back to neural tissue through rebalancing neuron:glia ratio after glia-to-neuron conversion.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Non-Canonical Activation of CREB Mediates Neuroprotection in a C. elegans Model of Excitotoxic Necrosis</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/261420v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Excitotoxicity, caused by exaggerated neuronal stimulation by Glutamate (Glu), is a major cause of neurodegeneration in brain ischemia. While we know that neurodegeneration is triggered by overstimulation of Glu-Receptors (GluRs), the subsequent mechanisms that lead to cellular demise remain controversial. Surprisingly, signaling downstream of GluRs can also activate neuroprotective pathways. The strongest evidence involves activation of the transcription factor cAMP Response Element Binding-protein (CREB), widely recognized for its importance in synaptic plasticity. Canonical views describe CREB as a phosphorylation-triggered transcription factor, where transcriptional activation involves CREB phosphorylation and association with CREB Binding Protein (CBP). However, given CREBs ubiquitous cross-tissue expression, the multitude of cascades leading to CREB phosphorylation, and its ability to regulate thousands of genes, it remains unclear how CREB exerts closely-tailored, differential neuroprotective responses in excitotoxicity. A non-canonical, alternative cascade for activation of CREB-mediated transcription involves the CREB co-factor cAMP-regulated transcriptional co-activator (CRTC), and may be independent of CREB phosphorylation. To identify cascades that activate CREB in excitotoxicity we use a C. elegans model of neurodegeneration by excitotoxic necrosis. We demonstrate that CREBs neuroprotective effect is conserved, and seems most effective in neurons with moderate Glu exposure. We find that factors mediating canonical CREB activation are not involved. Instead, phosphorylation-independent CREB activation in nematode excitotoxic necrosis hinges on CRTC. CREB-mediated transcription that depends on CRTC, but not on CREB phosphorylation, might lead to expression of a specific subset of neuroprotective genes. Elucidating conserved mechanisms of excitotoxicity-specific CREB activation can help us focus on core neuroprotective programs in excitotoxicity.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/261370v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>When the visual system analyses distributed patterns of sensory inputs, what features of those distributions does it use? It has been previously demonstrated that higher-order statistical moments of luminance distributions influence perception of static surfaces and textures. Here, we tested whether the brain also represents higher-order moments of dynamic stimuli. We constructed random dot kinematograms where dots moved according to probability distributions that selectively differed in terms of their mean, variance, skewness, or kurtosis. When viewing these stimuli, human observers were sensitive to the mean direction of coherent motion and to the variance of the individual dot displacement angles, but they were insensitive to skewness and kurtosis. Observer behavior accorded with a model of directional motion energy, suggesting that information about higher-order moments is discarded early in the visual processing hierarchy. These results demonstrate that use of higher-order moments is not a general property of visual perception.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/261347v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Although the amygdala's role in shaping social behavior is especially important during early post-natal development, very little is known of human amygdala functional development before childhood. To address this important gap, this study used resting-state fMRI to examine early functional network development of the amygdala and its subregions in 80 participants from 3-months to 5-years of age. Whole brain functional connectivity with the whole amygdala and its laterobasal and superficial nuclear groups were largely similar to those seen in older children and adults, and functional distinctions between subregion networks exist already. These patterns suggest many amygdala functional circuits are intact from infancy, especially those that are part of larger motor, visual, auditory and subcortical (basal ganglia especially) networks. Notably, these observed robust amygdala functional networks in infancy precede reports to date of elicited amygdala reactivity in development. Developmental changes in connectivity were observed between the laterobasal nucleus and bilateral ventral temporal and motor cortex as well as between the superficial nuclei and medial thalamus, occipital cortex and a different region of motor cortex. These results show amygdala-subcortical and sensory-cortex connectivity begins refinement prior to childhood, though connectivity changes with associative and frontal cortical areas, seen after early childhood, were not evident in this age range. These findings represent early steps in understanding amygdala network dynamics across infancy through early childhood, an important period of emotional and cognitive development.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/261271v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The ability to detect regularities in sound (i.e., recurring structure) is critical for effective perception, enabling, for example, change detection and prediction. Two seemingly unconnected lines of research concern the neural operations involved in processing regularities: one investigates how neural activity synchronizes with temporal regularities (e.g., frequency modulation; FM) in sounds, whereas the other focuses on increases in sustained activity during stimulation with repeating tone-frequency patterns. In three electroencephalography studies with male and female human participants, we investigated whether neural synchronization and sustained neural activity are dissociable, or whether they are functionally interdependent. Experiment I demonstrated that neural activity synchronizes with temporal regularity (FM) in sounds, and that sustained activity increases concomitantly. In Experiment II, phase coherence of FM in sounds was parametrically varied. Although neural synchronization was more sensitive to changes in FM coherence, such changes led to a systematic modulation of both neural synchronization and sustained activity, with magnitude increasing as coherence increased. In Experiment III, participants either performed a duration categorization task on the sounds, or a visual object tracking task to distract attention. Neural synchronization was observed irrespective of task, whereas the sustained response was observed only when attention was on the auditory task, not under (visual) distraction. The results show that neural synchronization and sustained activity levels are functionally linked: both are sensitive to regularities in sounds. However, neural synchronization might reflect a more sensory-driven response to regularity, compared with sustained activity which may be influenced by attentional, contextual, or other experiential factors.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/261214v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Sensorimotor computations can be flexibly adjusted according to internal states and contextual inputs. The mechanisms supporting this flexibility are not understood. Here, we tested the utility of a dynamical system perspective to approach this problem. In a dynamical system whose state is determined by interactions among neurons, computations can be rapidly and flexibly reconfigured by controlling the system's inputs and initial conditions. To investigate whether the brain employs such control strategies, we recorded from the dorsomedial frontal cortex (DMFC) of monkeys trained to measure time intervals and subsequently produce timed motor responses according to multiple context-specific stimulus-response rules. Analysis of the geometry of neural states revealed a control mechanism that relied on the system's inputs and initial conditions. A tonic input specified by the behavioral context adjusted firing rates throughout each trial, while the dynamics in the measurement epoch allowed the system to establish initial conditions for the ensuing production epoch. This initial condition in turn set the speed of neural dynamics in the production epoch allowing the animal to aim for the target interval. These results provide evidence that the language of dynamical systems can be used to parsimoniously link brain activity to sensorimotor computations.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/261164v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The neural control of insect locomotion is distributed among various body segments. Local pattern-generating circuits at the thoracic ganglia interact with incoming sensory signals and central descending commands from the head ganglia. The evidence from different insect preparations suggests that the subesophageal ganglion (SEG) may play an important role in locomotion-related tasks. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the locust SEG modulates the coupling pattern between segmental leg CPGs in the absence of sensory feedback. Here, we investigated its role in processing and transmitting sensory information to the leg motor centers, and mapped the major related neural pathways. Specifically, the intra- and inter-segmental transfer of leg-feedback were studied by simultaneously monitoring motor responses and descending signals from the SEG. Our findings reveal a crucial role of the SEG in the transfer of intersegmental, but not intrasegmental, signals. Additional lesion experiments, in which the intersegmental connectives were cut at different locations, together with double nerve staining, indicated that sensory signals are mainly transferred to the SEG via the connective contralateral to the stimulated leg. We therefore suggest that, similar to data reported for vertebrates, insect leg sensory-motor loops comprise contralateral ascending pathways to the head and ipsilateral descending ones.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/261107v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Many pathological conditions, such as seizures, stroke, and spreading depression, are associated with substantial changes in ion concentrations in the extracellular space (ECS) of the brain. An understanding of the mechanisms that govern ECS concentration dynamics may be a prerequisite for understanding such pathologies. To estimate the transport of ions due to electrodiffusive effects, one must keep track of both the ion concentrations and the electric potential simultaneously in the relevant regions of the brain. Although this is currently unfeasible experimentally, it is in principle achievable with computational models based on biophysical principles and constraints. Previous computational models of extracellular ion-concentration dynamics have required extensive computing power, and therefore have been limited to either phenomena on very small spatiotemporal scales (micrometers and milliseconds), or simplified and idealized 1-dimensional (1-D) transport processes on a larger scale. Here, we present the 3-D Kirchhoff-Nernst-Planck (KNP) framework, tailored to explore electrodiffusive effects on large spatiotemporal scales. By assuming electroneutrality, the KNP-framework circumvents charge-relaxation processes on the spatiotemporal scales of nanometers and nanoseconds, and makes it feasible to run simulations on the spatiotemporal scales of millimeters and seconds on a standard desktop computer. In the present work, we use the 3-D KNP framework to simulate the dynamics of ion concentrations and the electrical potential surrounding a morphologically detailed pyramidal cell. In addition to elucidating the single neuron contribution to electrodiffusive effects in the ECS, the simulation demonstrates the efficiency of the 3-D KNP framework. We envision that future applications of the framework to more complex and biologically realistic systems will be useful in exploring pathological conditions associated with large concentration variations in the ECS.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Peter W. Donhauser, Esther Florin, Sylvain Baillet&lt;/p&gt;

Magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography (MEG, EEG) are essential techniques for studying distributed signal dynamics in the human brain. In particular, the functional role of neural oscillations remains to be clarified. For that reason, imaging methods need to identify distinct brain regions that concurrently generate oscillatory activity, with adequate separation in space and time. Yet, spatial smearing and inhomogeneous signal-to-noise are challenging factors to source reconstruction from external sensor data. The detection of weak sources in the presence of stronger regional activity nearby is a typical complication of MEG/EEG source imaging. We propose a novel, hypothesis-driven source reconstruction approach to address these methodological challenges. The imaging with embedded statistics (iES) method is a subspace scanning technique that constrains the mapping problem to the actual experimental design. A major benefit is that, regardless of signal strength, the contributions from all oscillatory sources, which activity is consistent with the tested hypothesis, are equalized in the statistical maps produced. We present extensive evaluations of iES on group MEG data, for mapping 1) induced oscillations using experimental contrasts, 2) ongoing narrow-band oscillations in the resting-state, 3) co-modulation of brain-wide oscillatory power with a seed region, and 4) co-modulation of oscillatory power with peripheral signals (pupil dilation). Along the way, we demonstrate several advantages of iES over standard source imaging approaches. These include the detection of oscillatory coupling without rejection of zero-phase coupling, and detection of ongoing oscillations in deeper brain regions, where signal-to-noise conditions are unfavorable. We also show that iES provides a separate evaluation of oscillatory synchronization and desynchronization in experimental contrasts, which has important statistical advantages. The flexibility of iES allows it to be adjusted to many experimental questions in systems neuroscience.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TNJ39uqAYcw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Interpretation of correlated neural variability from models of feed-forward and recurrent circuits</title>

Neural populations respond to the repeated presentations of a sensory stimulus with correlated variability. These correlations have been studied in detail, with respect to their mechanistic origin, as well as their influence on stimulus discrimination and on the performance of population codes. A number of theoretical studies have endeavored to link network architecture to the nature of the correlations in neural activity. Here, we contribute to this effort: in models of circuits of stochastic neurons, we elucidate the implications of various network architectures—recurrent connections, shared feed-forward projections, and shared gain fluctuations—on the stimulus dependence in correlations. Specifically, we derive mathematical relations that specify the dependence of population-averaged covariances on firing rates, for different network architectures. In turn, these relations can be used to analyze data on population activity. We examine recordings from neural populations in mouse auditory cortex. We find that a recurrent network model with random effective connections captures the observed statistics. Furthermore, using our circuit model, we investigate the relation between network parameters, correlations, and how well different stimuli can be discriminated from one another based on the population activity. As such, our approach allows us to relate properties of the neural circuit to information processing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ANUis3AuuHE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: High complement levels in astrocyte-derived exosomes of Alzheimer's disease</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25172</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Astrocytes fulfill neuronal trophic roles normally, but are transformed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) into A1-type reactive astrocytes that may destroy neurons through unknown mechanisms. &lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: To investigate astrocyte inflammatory mechanisms, astrocyte-derived exosomes (ADEs) were isolated immunochemically from plasmas of AD patients and matched controls for ELISA quantification of complement proteins. &lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: ADE levels of C1q, C4b, C3d, factor B, factor D, Bb, C3b and C5b-C9 terminal complement complex (TCC), but not mannose-binding lectin (MBL), normalized by the CD81 exosome marker were significantly higher for AD patients (n=28) than age- and gender-matched controls (all p&amp;lt;0.0001). ADE normalized levels of IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β were significantly higher for AD patients than controls, but there was greater overlap between the two groups than for complement proteins. Mean ADE levels of complement proteins for AD patients in a longitudinal study were significantly higher (n=16, p&amp;lt;0.0001) at the AD2 stage of moderate dementia than at the AD1 preclinical stage five to 12 years earlier, which were the same as for controls. ADE levels of complement regulatory proteins CD59, CD46, decay-accelerating factor (DAF) and complement receptor type 1 (CR1), but not factor I, were significantly lower for AD patients than controls (p&amp;lt;0.0001 for CD59 and DAF), were diminished by the AD1 stage and were further decreased at the AD2 stage. &lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: ADE complement effector proteins in AD are produced by dysregulated systems, attain higher levels than in controls, and may potentially damage neurons in the late inflammatory phase of AD.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antibody production from germinal center reactions: therapeutic implications</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25173</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-antibody encephalitis is mediated by IgG-autoantibodies directed against the NR1-subunit of the NMDAR. Around 20% of patients have an underlying ovarian teratoma, and the condition responds to early immunotherapies and ovarian teratoma removal. However, despite clear therapeutic relevance, mechanisms of NR1-IgG production and the contribution of germinal center B cells to NR1-IgG levels are unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical data and longitudinal paired serum NR1-reactive IgM and IgG levels from ten patients with NMDAR-antibody encephalitis were determined. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from these ten patients, and two available ovarian teratomas, were stimulated with combinations of immune factors, and tested for secretion of total IgG and NR1-antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to disease-defining NR1-IgG, serum NR1-IgM were found in 6/10 patients. NR1-IgM levels were typically highest around disease onset, and detected for several months into the disease course. Moreover, circulating patient B cells were differentiated into CD19&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD27&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt;CD38&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; antibody-secreting cells &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and, in 90% of patients, secreted NR1-IgM and NR1-IgG. Secreted levels of NR1-IgG correlated with serum NR1-IgG (p&amp;lt;0.0001) and this was observed across the varying disease durations, suggestive of an ongoing process. Furthermore, ovarian teratoma tissue contained infiltrating lymphocytes which produced NR1-IgG in culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Persistent serum NR1-IgM and NR1-IgG, alongside the consistent production of NR1-IgG from circulating B cells and from ovarian teratomas suggest ongoing germinal center-reactions may account for the peripheral cell populations which secrete NR1-IgG. Cells participating in germinal center reactions might be a therapeutic target for the treatment of NMDAR-antibody encephalitis. This article is protected by copyright.

We investigated whether there is a spatiotemporal pattern of GM atrophy that is associated with faster disability accumulation in MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25145-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We analyzed 3,604 brain high-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans from 1,417 participants: 1,214 MS patients (253 clinically isolated syndrome [CIS], 708 relapsing-remitting [RRMS], 128 secondary-progressive [SPMS], and 125 primary-progressive [PPMS]), over an average follow-up of 2.41 years (standard deviation [SD] = 1.97), and 203 healthy controls (HCs; average follow-up = 1.83 year; SD = 1.77), attending seven European centers. Disability was assessed with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). We obtained volumes of the deep GM (DGM), temporal, frontal, parietal, occipital and cerebellar GM, brainstem, and cerebral white matter. Hierarchical mixed models assessed annual percentage rate of regional tissue loss and identified regional volumes associated with time-to-EDSS progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25145-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;SPMS showed the lowest baseline volumes of cortical GM and DGM. Of all baseline regional volumes, only that of the DGM predicted time-to-EDSS progression (hazard ratio = 0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.65, 0.82; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001): for every standard deviation decrease in baseline DGM volume, the risk of presenting a shorter time to EDSS worsening during follow-up increased by 27%. Of all longitudinal measures, DGM showed the fastest annual rate of atrophy, which was faster in SPMS (–1.45%), PPMS (–1.66%), and RRMS (–1.34%) than CIS (–0.88%) and HCs (–0.94%; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). The rate of temporal GM atrophy in SPMS (–1.21%) was significantly faster than RRMS (–0.76%), CIS (–0.75%), and HCs (–0.51%). Similarly, the rate of parietal GM atrophy in SPMS (–1.24-%) was faster than CIS (–0.63%) and HCs (–0.23%; all &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; values &amp;lt;0.05). Only the atrophy rate in DGM in patients was significantly associated with disability accumulation (beta = 0.04; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The difference in regional GM atrophy development between phenotypes needs to be taken into account when evaluating treatment effect of therapeutic interventions.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Dysfunctional sarcomere contractility contributes to muscle weakness in ACTA1-related nemaline myopathy (NEM3)</title>

Mutations in &lt;em&gt;ACTA1&lt;/em&gt; are a frequent cause of NM (ie, NEM3). &lt;em&gt;ACTA1&lt;/em&gt; encodes alpha-actin 1, the main constituent of the sarcomeric thin filament. The mechanisms by which mutations in &lt;em&gt;ACTA1&lt;/em&gt; contribute to muscle weakness in NEM3 are incompletely understood. We hypothesized that sarcomeric dysfunction contributes to muscle weakness in NEM3 patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25144-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this hypothesis, we performed contractility measurements in individual muscle fibers and myofibrils obtained from muscle biopsies of 14 NEM3 patients with different &lt;em&gt;ACTA1&lt;/em&gt; mutations. To identify the structural basis for impaired contractility, low angle X-ray diffraction and stimulated emission-depletion microscopy were applied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25144-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings reveal that muscle fibers of NEM3 patients display a reduced maximal force-generating capacity, which is caused by dysfunctional sarcomere contractility in the majority of patients, as revealed by contractility measurements in myofibrils. Low angle X-ray diffraction and stimulated emission-depletion microscopy indicate that dysfunctional sarcomere contractility in NEM3 patients involves a lower number of myosin heads binding to actin during muscle activation. This lower number is not the result of reduced thin filament length. Interestingly, the calcium sensitivity of force is unaffected in some patients, but decreased in others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Besides relating clinical effects with neuroplastic changes in cortical swallowing processing, we aimed to identify factors influencing treatment success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25151-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this double-blind, randomized study, 60 acute dysphagic stroke patients received contralesional anodal (1mA, 20 minutes) or sham tDCS on 4 consecutive days. Swallowing function was thoroughly assessed before and after the intervention using the validated Fiberoptic Endoscopic Dysphagia Severity Scale (FEDSS) and clinical assessment. In 10 patients, swallowing-related brain activation was recorded applying magnetoencephalography before and after the intervention. Voxel-based statistical lesion pattern analysis was also performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Patients treated with tDCS showed greater improvement in FEDSS than the sham group (1.3 vs 0.4 points, mean difference = 0.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.4–1.4, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0005). Functional recovery was accompanied by a significant increase of activation (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) in the contralesional swallowing network after real but not sham tDCS. Regarding predictors of treatment success, for every hour earlier that treatment was initiated, there was greater improvement on the FEDSS (adjusted odds ratio = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.98–1.00, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) in multivariate analysis. Stroke location in the right insula and operculum was indicative of worse response to tDCS (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01496</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in human
beings, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The current
standard of care includes interventional catheter ablation in selected
patients, but the success rate is limited. The major limitation of the current
approach to AF is the lack of fundamental understanding of its underlying
mechanism. Specifically, it remains unclear whether human AF dynamics are a
deterministic or a stochastic process. Here we assess for determinism in human
AF by evaluating the properties of the symbolic representation of intracardiac
electrical recordings obtained from patients. Specifically, we evaluate (a) the
number of the missing ordinal patterns, (b) the rate of missing ordinal pattern
decay for increased length of the time series, and (c) the causal-entropy
complexity plane of the Bandt-Pompe symbolic representation. When used
together, these are powerful tools to detect determinism, even in the presence
of experimental noise and brief time series.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;`Bursting', defined as periods of high frequency firing of a neuron separated
by periods of quiescence, has been observed in various neuronal systems, both
\textit{in vitro} and \textit{in vivo}. It has been associated with a range of
neuronal processes, including efficient information transfer and the formation
of functional networks during development, and has been shown to be sensitive
to genetic and pharmacological manipulations. Accurate detection of periods of
bursting activity is thus an important aspect of characterising both
spontaneous and evoked neuronal network activity. A wide variety of
computational methods have been developed to detect periods of bursting in
spike trains recorded from neuronal networks. In this chapter, we review
several of the most popular and successful of these methods.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Harnessing functional segregation across brain rhythms as a means to detect EEG oscillatory multiplexing during music listening. (arXiv:1802.01008v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01008</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Music, being a multifaceted stimulus evolving at multiple timescales,
modulates brain function in a manifold way that encompasses not only the
distinct stages of auditory perception but also higher cognitive processes like
memory and appraisal. Network theory is apparently a promising approach to
describe the functional reorganization of brain oscillatory dynamics during
music listening. However, the music induced changes have so far been examined
within the functional boundaries of isolated brain rhythms. Using naturalistic
music, we detected the functional segregation patterns associated with
different cortical rhythms, as these were reflected in the surface EEG
measurements. The emerged structure was compared across frequency bands to
quantify the interplay among rhythms. It was also contrasted against the
structure from the rest and noise listening conditions to reveal the specific
components stemming from music listening. Our methodology includes an efficient
graph-partitioning algorithm, which is further utilized for mining prototypical
modular patterns, and a novel algorithmic procedure for identifying switching
nodes that consistently change module during music listening. Our results
suggest the multiplex character of the music-induced functional reorganization
and particularly indicate the dependence between the networks reconstructed
from the {\delta} and {\beta}H rhythms. This dependence is further justified
within the framework of nested neural oscillations and fits perfectly within
the context of recently introduced cortical entrainment to music. Considering
its computational efficiency, and in conjunction with the flexibility of in
situ electroencephalography, it may lead to novel assistive tools for real-life
applications.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00840</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Certain concepts, words, and images are intuitively more similar than others
(dog vs. cat, dog vs. spoon), though quantifying such similarity is notoriously
difficult. Indeed, this kind of computation is likely a critical part of
learning the category boundaries for words within a given language. Here, we
use a set of 27 items (e.g. 'dog') that are highly common in infants' input,
and use both image- and word-based algorithms to independently compute
similarity among them. We find three key results. First, the pairwise item
similarities derived within image-space and word-space are correlated,
suggesting preserved structure among these extremely different representational
formats. Second, the closest 'neighbors' for each item, within each space,
showed significant overlap (e.g. both found 'egg' as a neighbor of 'apple').
Third, items with the most overlapping neighbors are later-learned by infants
and toddlers. We conclude that this approach, which does not rely on human
ratings of similarity, may nevertheless reflect stable within-class structure
across these two spaces. We speculate that such invariance might aid lexical
acquisition, by serving as an informative marker of category boundaries.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Self-Face Recognition Begins to Share Active Region in Right Inferior Parietal Lobule with Proprioceptive Illusion During Adolescence</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy027/4840635?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;We recently reported that right-side dominance of the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) in self-body recognition (proprioceptive illusion) task emerges during adolescence in typical human development. Here, we extend this finding by demonstrating that functional lateralization to the right IPL also develops during adolescence in another self-body (specifically a self-face) recognition task. We collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 60 right-handed healthy children (8–11 years), adolescents (12–15 years), and adults (18–23 years; 20 per group) while they judged whether a presented face was their own (Self) or that of somebody else (Other). We also analyzed fMRI data collected while they performed proprioceptive illusion task. All participants performed self-face recognition with high accuracy. Among brain regions where self-face-related activity (Self vs. Other) developed, only right IPL activity developed predominantly for self-face processing, with no substantial involvement in other-face processing. Adult-like right-dominant use of IPL emerged during adolescence, but was not yet present in childhood. Adult-like common activation between the tasks also emerged during adolescence. Adolescents showing stronger right-lateralized IPL activity during illusion also showed this during self-face recognition. Our results suggest the importance of the right IPL in neuronal processing of information associated with one’s own body in typically developing humans.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Neural Representations of the Full Spatial Field in Auditory Cortex of Awake Marmoset (Callithrix jacchus)</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Unlike visual signals, sound can reach the ears from any direction, and the ability to localize sounds from all directions is essential for survival in a natural environment. Previous studies have largely focused on the space in front of a subject that is also covered by vision and were often limited to measuring spatial tuning along the horizontal (azimuth) plane. As a result, we know relatively little about how the auditory cortex responds to sounds coming from spatial locations outside the frontal space where visual information is unavailable. By mapping single-neuron responses to the full spatial field in awake marmoset (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Callithrix jacchus&lt;/span&gt;), an arboreal animal for which spatial processing is vital in its natural habitat, we show that spatial receptive fields in several auditory areas cover all spatial locations. Several complementary measures of spatial tuning showed that neurons were tuned to both frontal space and rear space (outside the coverage of vision), as well as the space above and below the horizontal plane. Together, these findings provide valuable new insights into the representation of all spatial locations by primate auditory cortex.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: PDK1 Deficit Impairs the Development of the Dentate Gyrus in Mice</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy024/4840633?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;3-Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) is crucial for the development of the dentate gyrus (DG), the first gateway receiving afferent inputs from the entorhinal cortex. However, the role of PDK1 in DG development is unclear. In the present study, by crossing &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Pdk1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;fl/fl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; mice with the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Emx1-cre&lt;/span&gt; line, we identified that the ablation of PDK1 disrupted the development of DG via decreasing the proliferation, and increasing the differentiation of dentate neural progenitor cells, downregulating AKT activity and upregulating GSK3β signaling. Moreover, PDK1 deletion disrupted the distribution of Reelin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells and decreased the level of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Reelin&lt;/span&gt; mRNA which may contribute to the defective migration of progenitor cells and the disrupted radial glial scaffolds. Furthermore, the inhibition of GSK3β activity partially restored the decreased proliferation of primary neural stem cells in vitro. Taken together, our data indicated that the ablation of PDK1 affected the proliferation and differentiation of dentate neural progenitor cells in mice.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Cerebellar Functional Connectivity in Term- and Very Preterm-Born Infants</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy023/4840632?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Cortical resting state networks have been consistently identified in infants using resting state-functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Comparable studies in adults have demonstrated cerebellar components of well-established cerebral networks. However, there has been limited investigation of early cerebellar functional connectivity. We acquired non-sedated rs-fMRI data in the first week of life in 57 healthy, term-born infants and at term-equivalent postmenstrual age in 20 very preterm infants (mean birth gestational age 27 ± 2 weeks) without significant cerebral or cerebellar injury. Seed correlation analyses were performed using regions of interests spanning the cortical and subcortical gray matter and cerebellum. Parallel analyses were performed using rs-fMRI data acquired in 100 healthy adults. Our results demonstrate that cortico-cerebellar functional connectivity is well-established by term. Intra- and cortico-cerebellar functional connectivity were largely similar in infants and adults. However, infants showed more functional connectivity structure within the cerebellum, including stronger homotopic correlations and more robust anterior–posterior anticorrelations. Prematurity was associated with reduced correlation magnitudes, but no alterations in intra- and cortico-cerebellar functional connectivity topography. These results add to the growing evidence that the cerebellum plays an important role in shaping early brain development during infancy.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Environmental Influences on Infant Cortical Thickness and Surface Area</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy020/4840631?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Cortical thickness (CT) and surface area (SA) vary widely between individuals and are associated with intellectual ability and risk for various psychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions. Factors influencing this variability remain poorly understood, but the radial unit hypothesis, as well as the more recent supragranular cortex expansion hypothesis, suggests that prenatal and perinatal influences may be particularly important. In this report, we examine the impact of 17 major demographic and obstetric history variables on interindividual variation in CT and SA in a unique sample of 805 neonates who received MRI scans of the brain around 2 weeks of age. Birth weight, postnatal age at MRI, gestational age at birth, and sex emerged as important predictors of SA. Postnatal age at MRI, paternal education, and maternal ethnicity emerged as important predictors of CT. These findings suggest that individual variation in infant CT and SA is explained by different sets of environmental factors with neonatal SA more strongly influenced by sex and obstetric history and CT more strongly influenced by socioeconomic and ethnic disparities. Findings raise the possibility that interventions aimed at reducing disparities and improving obstetric outcomes may alter prenatal/perinatal cortical development.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Rab23 Regulates Radial Migration of Projection Neurons via N-cadherin</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy018/4840630?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Radial migration of cortical projection neurons is a prerequisite for shaping a distinct multilayered cerebral cortex during mammalian corticogenesis. Members of Rab GTPases family were reported to regulate radial migration. Here, in vivo conditional knockout or in utero knockdown (KD) of Rab23 in mice neocortex causes aberrant polarity and halted migration of cortical projection neurons. Further investigation of the underlying mechanism reveals down-regulation of N-cadherin in the Rab23-deficient neurons, which is a cell adhesion protein previously known to modulate radial migration. (Shikanai M, Nakajima K, Kawauchi T. 2011. N-cadherin regulates radial glial fiber-dependent migration of cortical locomoting neurons. Commun Integr Biol. 4:326–330.) Interestingly, pharmacological inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) also decreases the expression of N-cadherin, implicating an upstream effect of ERK1/2 on N-cadherin and also suggesting a link between Rab23 and ERK1/2. Further biochemical studies show that silencing of Rab23 impedes activation of ERK1/2 via perturbed platelet-derived growth factor-alpha (PDGFRα) signaling. Restoration of the expression of Rab23 or N-cadherin in Rab23-KD neurons could reverse neuron migration defects, indicating that Rab23 modulates migration through N-cadherin. These studies suggest that cortical neuron migration is mediated by a molecular hierarchy downstream of Rab23 via N-cadherin.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Membrane perturbing properties of toxin mycolactone from &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium ulcerans&lt;/i&gt;</title>

Mycolactone is the exotoxin produced by &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium ulcerans&lt;/i&gt; and is the virulence factor behind the neglected tropical disease Buruli ulcer. The toxin has a broad spectrum of biological effects within the host organism, stemming from its interaction with at least two molecular targets and the inhibition of protein uptake into the endoplasmic reticulum. Although it has been shown that the toxin can passively permeate into host cells, it is clearly lipophilic. Association with lipid carriers would have substantial implications for the toxin’s distribution within a host organism, delivery to cellular targets, diagnostic susceptibility, and mechanisms of pathogenicity. Yet the toxin’s interactions with, and distribution in, lipids are unknown. Herein we have used coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, guided by all-atom simulations, to study the interaction of mycolactone with pure and mixed lipid membranes. Using established techniques, we calculated the toxin’s preferential localization, membrane translocation, and impact on membrane physical and dynamical properties. The computed water-octanol partition coefficient indicates that mycolactone prefers to be in an organic phase rather than in an aqueous environment. Our results show that in a solvated membrane environment the exotoxin mainly localizes in the water-membrane interface, with a preference for the glycerol moiety of lipids, consistent with the reported studies that found it in lipid extracts of the cell. The calculated association constant to the model membrane is similar to the reported association constant for Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein. Mycolactone is shown to modify the physical properties of membranes, lowering the transition temperature, compressibility modulus, and critical line tension at which pores can be stabilized. It also shows a tendency to behave as a linactant, a molecule that localizes at the boundary between different fluid lipid domains in membranes and promotes inter-mixing of domains. This property has implications for the toxin’s cellular access, T-cell immunosuppression, and therapeutic potential.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LYJj4QzsN_A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) in microbial organisms have the potential to vastly improve the way we understand, manage, and treat infectious diseases. Yet, microbial GWAS methods established thus far remain insufficiently able to capitalise on the growing wealth of bacterial and viral genetic sequence data. Facing clonal population structure and homologous recombination, existing GWAS methods struggle to achieve both the precision necessary to reject spurious findings and the power required to detect associations in microbes. In this paper, we introduce a novel phylogenetic approach that has been tailor-made for microbial GWAS, which is applicable to organisms ranging from purely clonal to frequently recombining, and to both binary and continuous phenotypes. Our approach is robust to the confounding effects of both population structure and recombination, while maintaining high statistical power to detect associations. Thorough testing via application to simulated data provides strong support for the power and specificity of our approach and demonstrates the advantages offered over alternative cluster-based and dimension-reduction methods. Two applications to &lt;i&gt;Neisseria meningitidis&lt;/i&gt; illustrate the versatility and potential of our method, confirming previously-identified penicillin resistance loci and resulting in the identification of both well-characterised and novel drivers of invasive disease. Our method is implemented as an open-source R package called treeWAS which is freely available at https://github.com/caitiecollins/treeWAS.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OLN5pMOESlw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The packaging of DNA inside a nucleus shows complex structure stabilized by a host of DNA-bound factors. Both the distribution of these factors and the contacts between different genomic locations of the DNA can now be measured on a genome-wide scale. This has advanced the development of models aimed at predicting the conformation of DNA given only the locations of bound factors—the chromatin folding problem. Here we present a maximum-entropy model that is able to predict a contact map representation of structure given a sequence of bound factors. Non-local effects due to the sequence neighborhood around contacting sites are found to be important for making accurate predictions. Lastly, we show that the model can be used to infer a sequence of bound factors given only a measurement of structure. This opens up the possibility for efficiently predicting sequence regions that may play a role in generating cell-type specific structural differences.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/O5rA1JNPMq0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Biophysical attributes that affect CaMKII activation deduced with a novel spatial stochastic simulation approach</title>

Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) holoenzymes play a critical role in decoding Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals in neurons. Understanding how this occurs has been the focus of numerous studies including many that use models. However, CaMKII is notoriously difficult to simulate in detail because of its multi-subunit nature, which causes a combinatorial explosion in the number of species that must be modeled. To study the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-calmodulin-CaMKII reaction network with detailed kinetics while including the effect of diffusion, we have customized an existing stochastic particle-based simulator, Smoldyn, to manage the problem of combinatorial explosion. With this new method, spatial and temporal aspects of the signaling network can be studied without compromising biochemical details. We used this new method to examine how calmodulin molecules, both partially loaded and fully loaded with Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, choose pathways to interact with and activate CaMKII under various Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; input conditions. We found that the dependence of CaMKII phosphorylation on Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signal frequency is intrinsic to the network kinetics and the activation pattern can be modulated by the relative amount of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to calmodulin and by the rate of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion. Depending on whether Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx is saturating or not, calmodulin molecules could choose different routes within the network to activate CaMKII subunits, resulting in different frequency dependence patterns. In addition, the size of the holoenzyme produces a subtle effect on CaMKII activation. The more extended the subunits are organized, the easier for calmodulin molecules to access and activate the subunits. The findings suggest that particular intracellular environmental factors such as crowding and calmodulin availability can play an important role in decoding Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals and can give rise to distinct CaMKII activation patterns in dendritic spines, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel nanodomains and cytoplasm.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yb7HPOwKnGo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Predicting clinical diagnosis in Huntington's disease: An imaging polymarker</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25171</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Huntington's disease (HD) gene-carriers can be identified prior to clinical diagnosis; however, statistical models for predicting when overt motor symptoms will manifest are too imprecise to be useful at the level of the individual. Perfecting this prediction is integral to the search for disease modifying therapies. This study aimed to identify an imaging marker capable of reliably predicting real-life clinical diagnosis in HD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Method&lt;/b&gt;: A multivariate machine learning approach was applied to resting-state and structural MRI scans from 19 pre-manifest HD gene carriers (preHD, 8 of whom developed clinical disease in the 5 years post-scanning) and 21 healthy controls. A classification model was developed using cross-group comparisons between preHD and controls, and within the preHD group in relation to “estimated” and “actual” proximity to disease onset. Imaging measures were modelled individually, and combined, and permutation modelling robustly tested classification accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Classification performance for preHDs vs. controls was greatest when all measures were combined. The resulting polymarker predicted converters with high accuracy including those who were not expected to manifest in that timescale based on the currently adopted statistical models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: We propose that a holistic multivariate machine learning treatment of brain abnormalities in the premanifest phase can be used to accurately identify those patients within 5 years of developing motor features of Huntington's disease, with implications for prognostication and preclinical trials.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Orthostatic Heart Rate Changes in Patients with Autonomic Failure caused by Neurodegenerative Synucleinopathies</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25170</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Blunted tachycardia during hypotension is a characteristic feature of patients with autonomic failure, but the range has not been defined. This study reports the range of orthostatic heart rate (HR) changes in patients with autonomic failure caused by neurodegenerative synucleinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Patients evaluated at sites of the U.S. Autonomic Consortium (NCT01799915) underwent standardized autonomic function tests and full neurological evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: We identified 402 patients with orthostatic hypotension (OH) who had normal sinus rhythm. Of these, 378 had impaired sympathetic activation, i.e., neurogenic OH, and based on their neurological examination were diagnosed with Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, pure autonomic failure or multiple system atrophy. The remaining 24 patients had preserved sympathetic activation and their OH was classified as non-neurogenic, due to volume depletion, anemia or polypharmacy. Patients with neurogenic OH had twice the fall in systolic blood pressure (SBP) [-44±25 vs. -21±14 mmHg (mean±SD), p&amp;lt;0.0001] but only one third of the increase in HR than those with non-neurogenic OH (8±8 vs. 25±11 bpm, p&amp;lt;0.0001). A ΔHR/ΔSBP ratio of 0.492 bpm/mmHg had excellent sensitivity (91.3%) and specificity (88.4%) to distinguish between patients with neurogenic vs. non-neurogenic OH (AUC=0.96, p&amp;lt;0.0001). Within patients with neurogenic OH, HR increased more in those with multiple system atrophy (p=0.0003), but there was considerable overlap with patients with Lewy body disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: A blunted HR increase during hypotension suggests a neurogenic cause. A ΔHR/ΔSBP ratio lower than 0.5 bpm/mmHg is diagnostic of neurogenic OH. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00753</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Byrne and colleagues present a paper on a timely topic with potentially
important results. However, we think that issues in the design and analysis
complicate the interpretation and limit the generalizability of the findings.
Specifically, the details of the small volume correction used in the primary
analysis are not adequately described and, moreover, the results do not appear
to be corroborated by the whole-brain analysis. In addition, the follow-up
multilevel modeling, which is fundamental to the conclusions of the paper, is
inherently circular thereby guaranteeing discovery of the reported effect.
Finally, the study does not control for other factors that vary over the course
of the day and are known to impact MRI measurements, and fails to link the
neural results directly to any relevant behavior.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus and the striatum support episodic and procedural memory,
respectively, and &quot;place&quot; and &quot;response&quot; learning within spatial navigation.
Recently this dichotomy has been linked to &quot;model-based&quot; and &quot;model-free&quot;
reinforcement learning. Here we present a well-constrained neural model of how
both systems support spatial navigation, and apply the same model to more
abstract problems such as sequential decision making. In particular, we show
that if a task can be transformed into a Markov Decision Process, the machinery
provided by the hippocampus and striatum can be utilized to solve it. These
results show how the hippocampal complex can represent non-spatial problems,
including context, probabilities and action-dependent information, in support
of &quot;model-based&quot; reinforcement learning to complement learning within the
striatum.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Neurofeedback Tunes Scale-Free Dynamics in Spontaneous Brain Activity. (arXiv:1512.09133v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.09133</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain oscillations exhibit long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs), which
reflect the regularity of their fluctuations: low values representing more
random (decorrelated) while high values more persistent (correlated) dynamics.
LRTCs constitute supporting evidence that the brain operates near criticality,
a state where neuronal activities are balanced between order and randomness.
Here, healthy adults used closed-loop brain training (neurofeedback, NFB) to
reduce the amplitude of alpha oscillations, producing a significant increase in
spontaneous LRTCs post-training. This effect was reproduced in patients with
post-traumatic stress disorder, where abnormally random dynamics were reversed
by NFB, correlating with significant improvements in hyperarousal. Notably,
regions manifesting abnormally low LRTCs (i.e., excessive randomness)
normalized toward healthy population levels, consistent with theoretical
predictions about self-organized criticality. Hence, when exposed to
appropriate training, spontaneous cortical activity reveals a residual capacity
for &quot;self-tuning&quot; its own temporal complexity, despite manifesting the abnormal
dynamics seen in individuals with psychiatric disorder. Lastly, we observed an
inverse-U relationship between strength of LRTC and oscillation amplitude,
suggesting a breakdown of long-range dependence at high/low synchronization
extremes, in line with recent computational models. Together, our findings
offer a broader mechanistic framework for motivating research and clinical
applications of NFB, encompassing disorders with perturbed LRTCs.

	<content:encoded>The biological basis of consciousness is one of the most challenging and fundamental questions in 21st century science. A related pursuit aims to identify the neural correlates and causes of unconsciousness. We review current trends in the investigation of physiological, pharmacological, and pathological states of unconsciousness at the level of large-scale functional brain networks. We focus on the roles of brain connectivity, repertoire, graph-theoretical techniques, and neural dynamics in understanding the functional brain disconnections and reduced complexity that appear to characterize these states.</content:encoded>

Genetic networks from post-mortem human brain revealed 84 partner genes co-expressed with &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;DRD2&lt;/span&gt;. Moreover, eight functional single nucleotide polymorphisms combined into a polygenic co-expression index (PCI) predicted co-expression of this &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;DRD2&lt;/span&gt; network and were associated with prefrontal function in humans. Here, we investigated the non-linear association of the PCI with behavioral and Working Memory (WM) related brain response to pharmacological D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Rs stimulation. Fifty healthy volunteers took part in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, functional MRI (fMRI) study with bromocriptine and performed the N-Back task. The PCI by drug interaction was significant on both WM behavioral scores (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; = 0.046) and related prefrontal activity (all corrected &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) using a polynomial PCI model. Non-linear responses under placebo were reversed by bromocriptine administration. fMRI results on placebo were replicated in an independent sample of 50 participants who did not receive drug administration (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; = 0.034). These results match earlier evidence in non-human primates and confirm the physiological relevance of this &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;DRD2&lt;/span&gt; co-expression network. Results show that in healthy subjects, different alleles evaluated as an ensemble are associated with non-linear prefrontal responses. Therefore, brain response to a dopaminergic drug may depend on a complex system of allelic patterns associated with &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;DRD2&lt;/span&gt; co-expression.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;How the variety of neurons that organize into neocortical layers and functional areas arises is a central question in the study of cortical development. While both intrinsic and extrinsic cues are known to influence this process, whether distinct neuronal progenitor groups contribute to neuron diversity and allocation is poorly understood. Using in vivo genetic fate-mapping combined with whole-cell patch clamp recording, we show that the firing pattern and apical dendritic morphology of excitatory neurons in layer 4 of the barrel cortex are specified in part by their neural precursor lineage. Further, we show that separate precursors contribute to unique features of barrel cortex topography including the intralaminar position and thalamic innervation of the neurons they generate. Importantly, many of these lineage-specified characteristics are different from those previously measured for pyramidal neurons in layers 2–3 of the frontal cortex. Collectively, our data elucidate a dynamic temporal program in neuronal precursors that fine-tunes the properties of their progeny according to the lamina of destination.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Distinct Beta-band Oscillatory Circuits Underlie Corticospinal Gain Modulation</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Rhythmic synchronization of neurons is known to affect neuronal interactions. In the motor system, oscillatory power fluctuations modulate corticospinal excitability. However, previous research addressing phase-specific gain modulation in the motor system has resulted in contradictory findings. It remains unclear how many time windows of increased responsiveness each oscillatory cycle provides. Moreover, we still lack conclusive evidence as to whether the motor cortex entails an intrinsic response modulation along the rhythm cycle, as shown for spinal neurons. We investigated this question with single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation over the primary motor cortex at rest. Application of near-motor threshold stimuli revealed a frequency- and phase-specific gain modulation at both cortical and spinal level, independent of the spontaneous oscillatory power fluctuations at each level. We detected bilateral sensorimotor circuits in the lower beta-band (14–17 Hz) and unilateral corticospinal circuits in the upper beta-band (20–24 Hz). These findings provide novel evidence that intrinsic activity in the human motor cortex modulates input gain along the beta oscillatory cycle within distinct circuits. In accordance with periodic alternations of synchronous hyper- and depolarization, increased neuronal responsiveness occurred once per oscillatory beta cycle. This information may lead to new brain state-dependent and circuit-specific interventions for targeted neuromodulation.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Eye Movement Reinstatement and Neural Reactivation During Mental Imagery</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Half a century ago, Donald Hebb posited that mental imagery is a constructive process that emulates perception. Specifically, Hebb claimed that visual imagery results from the reactivation of neural activity associated with viewing images. He also argued that neural reactivation and imagery benefit from the re-enactment of eye movement patterns that first occurred at viewing (fixation reinstatement). To investigate these claims, we applied multivariate pattern analyses to functional MRI (fMRI) and eye tracking data collected while healthy human participants repeatedly viewed and visualized complex images. We observed that the specificity of neural reactivation correlated positively with vivid imagery and with memory for stimulus image details. Moreover, neural reactivation correlated positively with fixation reinstatement, meaning that image-specific eye movements accompanied image-specific patterns of brain activity during visualization. These findings support the conception of mental imagery as a simulation of perception, and provide evidence consistent with the supportive role of eye movement in neural reactivation.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Flexible interactions between brain regions enable neural systems to adaptively transfer and process information. However, the neural substrates that regulate adaptive communications between brain regions are understudied. In this human fMRI study, we investigated this issue by tracking time-varying, task-evoked changes in functional connectivity between localized occipitotemporal regions while participants performed different tasks on the same visually presented stimuli. We found that functional connectivity between ventral temporal and the primary visual regions selectively increased during the processing of task-relevant information. Further, additional task demands selectively strengthen these targeted connectivity patterns. To identify candidate regions that contribute to this increase in inter-regional coupling, we regressed the task-specific time-varying connectivity strength between primary visual and occipitotemporal regions against voxel-wise activity patterns elsewhere in the brain. This allowed us to identify a set of frontal and parietal regions whose activity increased as a function of task-evoked functional connectivity. These results suggest that frontoparietal regions may provide top-down biasing signals to influence task-specific interactions between brain regions.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Verbal Creativity Correlates with the Temporal Variability of Brain Networks During the Resting State</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy010/4836784?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Creativity is the ability to see the world in new ways. Creative individuals exhibit the ability to switch between different modes of thinking and shift their mental focus. This suggests a connection between creativity and dynamic interactions of brain networks. We report here the first investigation into the relationship between the reconfiguration of dynamic brain networks during the resting state and verbal creativity using two fMRI datasets involving 574 subjects. We find that verbal creativity correlates with temporal variability of the functional-connectivity (FC) patterns of the lateral prefrontal cortex, the precuneus, and the parahippocampal gyrus. High variability of these regions indicates flexible connectivity patterns which may facilitate executive functions. Furthermore, verbal creativity correlates with the temporal variability of FC patterns within the default mode network (DMN), between the DMN and attention/sensorimotor network, and between control and sensory networks. High variability of FCs between the DMN and attention networks characterizes frequent adjustments of attention. Finally, dynamic interaction between the cerebellum and task control network also contributes to verbal creativity, suggesting a relationship between the cerebellum and creativity. This study reveals a close relationship between verbal creativity and high variability of cortical networks involved in spontaneous thought, attention and cognitive control.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Single Neurons in Anterior Cingulate Cortex Signal the Need to Change Action During Performance of a Stop-change Task that Induces Response Competition</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy008/4836782?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Several human imaging studies have suggested that anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is highly active when participants receive competing inputs, and that these signals may be important for influencing the downstream planning of actions. Despite increasing evidence from several neuroimaging studies, no study has examined ACC activity at the level of the single neuron in rodents performing similar tasks. To fill this gap, we recorded from single neurons in ACC while rats performed a stop-change task. We found higher firing on trials with competing inputs (STOP trials), and that firing rates were positively correlated with accuracy and movement speed, suggesting that when ACC was engaged, rats tended to slow down and perform better. Finally, firing was the strongest when STOP trials were preceded by GO trials and was reduced when rats adapted their behavior on trials subsequent to a STOP trial. These data provide the first evidence that activity of single neurons in ACC is elevated when 2 responses are in competition with each other when there is a need to change the course of action to obtain reward.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Neuron-glial related cell adhesion molecule NrCAM is a newly identified negative regulator of spine density that genetically interacts with Semaphorin3F (Sema3F), and is implicated in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). To investigate a role for NrCAM in spine pruning during the critical adolescent period when networks are established, we generated novel conditional, inducible NrCAM mutant mice (Nex1Cre-ERT2: NrCAMflox/flox). We demonstrate that NrCAM functions cell autonomously during adolescence in pyramidal neurons to restrict spine density in the visual (V1) and medial frontal cortex (MFC). Guided by molecular modeling, we found that NrCAM promoted clustering of the Sema3F holoreceptor complex by interfacing with Neuropilin-2 (Npn2) and PDZ scaffold protein SAP102. NrCAM-induced receptor clustering stimulated the Rap-GAP activity of PlexinA3 (PlexA3) within the holoreceptor complex, which in turn, inhibited Rap1-GTPase and inactivated adhesive β1 integrins, essential for Sema3F-induced spine pruning. These results define a developmental function for NrCAM in Sema3F receptor signaling that limits dendritic spine density on cortical pyramidal neurons during adolescence.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The synaptic connectivity of cortex is plastic, with experience shaping the ongoing interactions between neurons. Theoretical studies of spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) have focused on either just pairs of neurons or large-scale simulations. A simple analytic account for how fast spike time correlations affect both microscopic and macroscopic network structure is lacking. We develop a low-dimensional mean field theory for STDP in recurrent networks and show the emergence of assemblies of strongly coupled neurons with shared stimulus preferences. After training, this connectivity is actively reinforced by spike train correlations during the spontaneous dynamics. Furthermore, the stimulus coding by cell assemblies is actively maintained by these internally generated spiking correlations, suggesting a new role for noise correlations in neural coding. Assembly formation has often been associated with firing rate-based plasticity schemes; our theory provides an alternative and complementary framework, where fine temporal correlations and STDP form and actively maintain learned structure in cortical networks.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Activation of pial and dural macrophages and dendritic cells by CSD (67 chrs)</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25169</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cortical spreading depression (CSD) has long been implicated in migraine attacks with aura. The process by which CSD, a cortical event that occurs within the blood brain barrier (BBB), results in nociceptor activation outside the BBB is likely mediated by multiple molecules and cells. The objective of this study was to determine whether CSD activates immune cells inside the BBB (pia), outside the BBB (dura), or in both, and if so, when.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigating cellular events in the meninges shortly after CSD, we used &lt;em&gt;in-vivo&lt;/em&gt; 2-photon imaging to identify changes in macrophages and dendritic cells (DC) that reside in the pia, arachnoid, and dura, and their anatomical relationship to TRPV1 axons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that activated meningeal macrophages retract their processes and become circular, and that activated meningeal DC stop migrating. We found that CSD activates pial macrophages instantaneously, pial, subarachnoid and dural DC 6-12 minutes later, and dural macrophages 20 minutes later. Dural macrophages and DC can appear in close proximity to TRPV1-positive axons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that activation of pial macrophages may be more relevant to cases where aura and migraine begin simultaneously, that activation of dural macrophages may be more relevant to cases where headache begins 20-30 minutes after aura, and that activation of dural macrophages may be mediated by activation of migratory DC in the SAS and dura. The anatomical relationship between TRPV1-positive meningeal nociceptors, and dural macrophages and dendritic cells support a role for these immune cells in the modulation of head pain.

A significant portion of bone fractures fail to heal properly, increasing healthcare costs. Advances in fracture management have slowed because translation barriers have limited generation of mechanism-based explanations for the healing process. When uncertainties are numerous, analogical modeling can be an effective strategy for developing plausible explanations of complex phenomena. We demonstrate the feasibility of engineering analogical models in software to facilitate discovery of biomimetic explanations for how fracture healing may progress. Concrete analogical models—Callus Analogs—were created using the MASON simulation toolkit. We designated a Target Region initial state within a characteristic tissue section of mouse tibia fracture at day-7 and posited a corresponding day-10 Target Region final state. The goal was to discover a coarse-grain analog mechanism that would enable the discretized initial state to transform itself into the corresponding Target Region final state, thereby providing an alternative way to study the healing process. One of nine quasi-autonomous Tissue Unit types is assigned to each grid space, which maps to an 80×80 μm region of the tissue section. All Tissue Units have an opportunity each time step to act based on individualized logic, probabilities, and information about adjacent neighbors. Action causes transition from one Tissue Unit type to another, and simulation through several thousand time steps generates a coarse-grain analog—a theory—of the healing process. We prespecified a minimum measure of success: simulated and actual Target Region states achieve ≥ 70% Similarity. We used an iterative refinement protocol to explore many combinations of Tissue Unit logic and action constraints. Workflows progressed through four stages of analog mechanisms. Similarities of 73–90% were achieved for Mechanisms 2–4. The range of Upper-Level similarities increased to 83–94% when we allowed for uncertainty about two Tissue Unit designations. We have demonstrated how Callus Analog experiments provide domain experts with a fresh medium and tools for thinking about and understanding the fracture healing process.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qhxB-qfzMYk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Plant morphogenesis is strongly dependent on the directional growth and the subsequent oriented division of individual cells. It has been shown that the plant cortical microtubule array plays a key role in controlling both these processes. This ordered structure emerges as the collective result of stochastic interactions between large numbers of dynamic microtubules. To elucidate this complex self-organization process a number of analytical and computational approaches to study the dynamics of cortical microtubules have been proposed. To date, however, these models have been restricted to two dimensional planes or geometrically simple surfaces in three dimensions, which strongly limits their applicability as plant cells display a wide variety of shapes. This limitation is even more acute, as both local as well as global geometrical features of cells are expected to influence the overall organization of the array. Here we describe a framework for efficiently simulating microtubule dynamics on triangulated approximations of arbitrary three dimensional surfaces. This allows the study of microtubule array organization on realistic cell surfaces obtained by segmentation of microscopic images. We validate the framework against expected or known results for the spherical and cubical geometry. We then use it to systematically study the individual contributions of global geometry, cell-edge induced catastrophes and cell-face induced stability to array organization in a cuboidal geometry. Finally, we apply our framework to analyze the highly non-trivial geometry of leaf pavement cells of &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Nicotiana benthamiana&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Hedera helix&lt;/i&gt;. We show that our simulations can predict multiple features of the microtubule array structure in these cells, revealing, among others, strong constraints on the orientation of division planes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-ogXqfE-FHg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Centralized and distributed cognitive task processing in the human connectome. (arXiv:1802.00334v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00334</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A key question in modern neuroscience is how cognitive changes in a human
brain can be quantified and captured by functional connectomes (FC) . A
systematic approach to measure pairwise functional distance at different brain
states is lacking. This would provide a straight-forward way to quantify
differences in cognitive processing across tasks; also, it would help in
relating these differences in task-based FCs to the underlying structural
network. Here we propose a framework, based on Jensen-Shannon divergence,to map
the task-rest connectivity divergence between tasks and resting-state FC. We
show how this information theoretical measure allows for quantifying
connectivity changes in distributed and centralized processing in functional
networks. We study resting-state and seven tasks from the Human Connectome
Project dataset to obtain the most divergent links across tasks. We investigate
how these changes are associated to different functional brain networks, and
use the proposed measure to infer changes in the information processing
regimes. Furthermore, we show how the FC divergence with respect to resting
state is shaped by structural connectivity, and to what extent this
relationship depends on the task. This framework provides a well grounded
mathematical quantification of connectivity changes associated to cognitive
processing in large-scale brain networks.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00297</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The dynamics of networks of neuronal cultures has been recently shown to be
strongly dependent on the network geometry and in particular on their
dimensionality. However, this phenomenon has been so far mostly unexplored from
the theoretical point of view. Here we reveal the rich interplay between
network geometry and synchronization of coupled oscillators in the context of a
simplicial complex model of manifolds called Complex Network Manifold. The
networks generated by this model combine small world properties (infinite
Hausdorff dimension) and a high modular structure with finite and tunable
spectral dimension. We show that the networks display frustrated
synchronization for a wide range of the coupling strength of the oscillators,
and that the synchronization properties are directly affected by the spectral
dimension of the network.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: AMPA, NMDA and GABAA receptor mediated network burst dynamics in cortical cultures in vitro. (arXiv:1802.00217v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00217</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this work we study the excitatory AMPA, and NMDA, and inhibitory GABAA
receptor mediated dynamical changes in neuronal networks of neonatal rat cortex
in vitro. Extracellular network-wide activity was recorded with 59 planar
electrodes simultaneously under different pharmacological conditions. We
analyzed the changes of overall network activity and network-wide burst
frequency between baseline and AMPA receptor (AMPA-R) or NMDA receptor (NMDA-R)
driven activity, as well as between the latter states and disinhibited
activity. Additionally, spatiotemporal structures of pharmacologically modified
bursts and recruitment of electrodes during the network bursts were studied.
Our results show that AMPA-R and NMDA-R receptors have clearly distinct roles
in network dynamics. AMPA-Rs are in greater charge to initiate network wide
bursts. Therefore NMDA-Rs maintain the already initiated activity. GABAA
receptors (GABAA-Rs) inhibit AMPA-R driven network activity more strongly than
NMDA-R driven activity during the bursts.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Evolutionary analysis of polyproline motifs in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; reveals their regulatory role in translation</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/tDkLZ5Cs-1M/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Fei Qi, Magdalena Motz, Kirsten Jung, Jürgen Lassak, Dmitrij Frishman&lt;/p&gt;

Translation of consecutive prolines causes ribosome stalling, which is alleviated but cannot be fully compensated by the elongation factor P. However, the presence of polyproline motifs in about one third of the &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; proteins underlines their potential functional importance, which remains largely unexplored. We conducted an evolutionary analysis of polyproline motifs in the proteomes of 43 &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; strains and found evidence of evolutionary selection against translational stalling, which is especially pronounced in proteins with high translational efficiency. Against the overall trend of polyproline motif loss in evolution, we observed their enrichment in the vicinity of translational start sites, in the inter-domain regions of multi-domain proteins, and downstream of transmembrane helices. Our analysis demonstrates that the time gain caused by ribosome pausing at polyproline motifs might be advantageous in protein regions bracketing domains and transmembrane helices. Polyproline motifs might therefore be crucial for co-translational folding and membrane insertion.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tDkLZ5Cs-1M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Bioinformatics is recognized as part of the essential knowledge base of numerous career paths in biomedical research and healthcare. However, there is little agreement in the field over what that knowledge entails or how best to provide it. These disagreements are compounded by the wide range of populations in need of bioinformatics training, with divergent prior backgrounds and intended application areas. The Curriculum Task Force of the International Society of Computational Biology (ISCB) Education Committee has sought to provide a framework for training needs and curricula in terms of a set of bioinformatics core competencies that cut across many user personas and training programs. The initial competencies developed based on surveys of employers and training programs have since been refined through a multiyear process of community engagement. This report describes the current status of the competencies and presents a series of use cases illustrating how they are being applied in diverse training contexts. These use cases are intended to demonstrate how others can make use of the competencies and engage in the process of their continuing refinement and application. The report concludes with a consideration of remaining challenges and future plans.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/H-O9q3LkWbg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Two recent papers have tackled the fundamental questions of how place fields are formed in a new environment and what plasticity mechanisms contribute to this process. Bittner et al., in their recent publication, discovered a novel plasticity rule that, in contrast to previous rules, spans the behavioral, seconds-long, timescale. Sheffield et al. have monitored, for the first time, dendritic activity during place field formation, and show the emergence of spatially tuned local NMDA spikes in basal dendrites of CA1 neurons.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Modern neuroscientific techniques that specifically manipulate and measure neuronal activity in behaving animals now allow bridging of the gap from the cellular to the behavioral level. However, in doing so, they also pose new challenges. Research using incompletely defined manipulations in a high-dimensional space without clear hypotheses is likely to suffer from multiple well-known conceptual and statistical problems. In this context it is essential to develop hypotheses with testable implications across levels.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The hippocampus is one of the brain’s great mysteries. Historically, theories of its function included emotion, response inhibition, general memory and spatial perception/learning, with memory versus space emerging as a particular focus of more recent debates. A 1978 paper by Olton and colleagues captured this dichotomy by exploiting their newly developed radial maze task to reveal a profound deficit in the ability of hippocampally lesioned rats to execute a spatial memory task. This finding supported the emerging spatial map theory of hippocampal function, and helped pave the way for the subsequent uncovering of an entire brain system linking space and memory.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>2018 marks the 40th anniversary of Trends in Neurosciences (TINS), which I had the honor of joining last summer as its editor. As part of the anniversary, we will be issuing a series of 40 short Science and Society articles, each highlighting a past paper (or two) published during one of the years 1978–2017. At its core, the series aims to showcase the breadth of neuroscientific research, and give a glimpse of the remarkable progress during the last few decades. The February issue of TINS launches the series, with four articles discussing papers from 1978, 1988, 1998, and 2008.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: GSimp: A Gibbs sampler based left-censored missing value imputation approach for metabolomics studies</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/TpqgoEqOUBM/article</link>

Left-censored missing values commonly exist in targeted metabolomics datasets and can be considered as missing not at random (MNAR). Improper data processing procedures for missing values will cause adverse impacts on subsequent statistical analyses. However, few imputation methods have been developed and applied to the situation of MNAR in the field of metabolomics. Thus, a practical left-censored missing value imputation method is urgently needed. We developed an iterative Gibbs sampler based left-censored missing value imputation approach (GSimp). We compared GSimp with other three imputation methods on two real-world targeted metabolomics datasets and one simulation dataset using our imputation evaluation pipeline. The results show that GSimp outperforms other imputation methods in terms of imputation accuracy, observation distribution, univariate and multivariate analyses, and statistical sensitivity. Additionally, a parallel version of GSimp was developed for dealing with large scale metabolomics datasets. The R code for GSimp, evaluation pipeline, tutorial, real-world and simulated targeted metabolomics datasets are available at: https://github.com/WandeRum/GSimp.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TpqgoEqOUBM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The Binary State Speciation and Extinction (BiSSE) model is a branching process based model that allows the diversification rates to be controlled by a binary trait. We develop a general approach, based on the BiSSE model, for predicting pathogenicity in bacterial populations from microsatellites profiling data. A comprehensive approach for predicting pathogenicity in &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; populations is proposed using the state-dependent branching process model combined with microsatellites TRS-PCR profiling. Additionally, we have evaluated the possibility of using the BiSSE model for estimating parameters from genetic data. We analyzed a real dataset (from 251 &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; strains) and confirmed previous biological observations demonstrating a prevalence of some virulence traits in specific bacterial sub-groups. The method may be used to predict pathogenicity of other bacterial taxa.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Uz6bdMXl0nc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Prefrontal Corticostriatal Disconnection Blocks the Acquisition of Goal-Directed Action</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1311?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The acquisition of goal-directed action requires encoding of the association between an action and its specific consequences or outcome. At a neural level, this encoding has been hypothesized to involve a prefrontal corticostriatal circuit involving the projection from the prelimbic cortex (PL) to the posterior dorsomedial striatum (pDMS); however, no direct evidence for this claim has been reported. In a series of experiments, we performed functional disconnection of this pathway using targeted lesions of the anterior corpus callosum to disrupt contralateral corticostriatal projections with asymmetrical lesions of the PL and/or pDMS to block plasticity in this circuit in rats. We first demonstrated that unilaterally blocking the PL input to the pDMS prevented the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-related kinase/mitogen activated protein kinase (pERK/pMAPK) induced by instrumental training. Next, we used a full bilateral disconnection of the PL from the pDMS and assessed goal-directed action using an outcome-devaluation test. Importantly, we found evidence that rats maintaining an ipsilateral and/or contralateral connection between the PL and the pDMS were able to acquire goal-directed actions. In contrast, bilateral PL–pDMS disconnection abolished the acquisition of goal-directed actions. Finally, we used a temporary pharmacological disconnection to disrupt PL inputs to the pDMS by infusing the NMDA antagonist dl-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid into the pDMS during instrumental training and found that this manipulation also disrupted goal-directed learning. These results establish that, in rats, the acquisition of new goal-directed actions depends on a prefrontal–corticostriatal circuit involving a connection between the PL and the pDMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; It has been hypothesized that the prelimbic cortex (PL) and posterior dorsomedial striatum (pDMS) in rodents interact in a corticostriatal circuit to mediate goal-directed learning. However, no direct evidence supporting this claim has been reported. Using targeted lesions, we performed functional disconnection of the PL–pDMS pathway to assess its role in goal-directed learning. In the first experiment, we demonstrated that PL input to the pDMS is necessary for instrumental training-induced neuronal activity. Next, we disrupted ipsilateral, contralateral, or bilateral PL–pDMS connections and found that only bilateral PL–pDMS disconnection disrupted the acquisition of goal-directed actions, a finding we replicated in our final study using a pharmacological disconnection procedure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Visually-Driven Maps in Area 3b</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1295?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sensory perception relies on the precise neuronal encoding of modality-specific environmental features in primary sensory cortices. Some studies have reported the penetration of signals from other modalities even into early sensory areas. So far, no comprehensive account of maps induced by &quot;foreign sources&quot; exists. We addressed this question using surface-based topographic mapping techniques applied to ultra-high resolution fMRI neuroimaging data, measured in female participants. We show that fine-grained finger maps in human primary somatosensory cortex, area 3b, are somatotopically activated not only during tactile mechanical stimulation, but also when viewing the same fingers being touched. Visually-induced maps were weak in amplitude, but overlapped with the stronger tactile maps tangential to the cortical sheet when finger touches were observed in both first- and third-person perspectives. However, visually-induced maps did not overlap tactile maps when the observed fingers were only approached by an object but not actually touched. Our data provide evidence that &quot;foreign source maps&quot; in early sensory cortices are present in the healthy human brain, that their arrangement is precise, and that their induction is feature-selective. The computations required to generate such specific responses suggest that counterflow (feedback) processing may be much more spatially specific than has been often assumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Using ultra-high field fMRI, we provide empirical evidence that viewing touches activates topographically aligned single finger maps in human primary somatosensory cortical area 3b. This shows that &quot;foreign source maps&quot; in early sensory cortices are topographic, precise, and feature-selective in healthy human participants with intact sensory pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Meis1 Coordinates Cerebellar Granule Cell Development by Regulating Pax6 Transcription, BMP Signaling and Atoh1 Degradation</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1277?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cerebellar granule cell precursors (GCPs) and granule cells (GCs) represent good models to study neuronal development. Here, we report that the transcription factor myeloid ectopic viral integration site 1 homolog (Meis1) plays pivotal roles in the regulation of mouse GC development. We found that Meis1 is expressed in GC lineage cells and astrocytes in the cerebellum during development. Targeted disruption of the Meis1 gene specifically in the GC lineage resulted in smaller cerebella with disorganized lobules. Knock-down/knock-out (KO) experiments for Meis1 and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; assays showed that Meis1 binds to an upstream sequence of Pax6 to enhance its transcription in GCPs/GCs and also suggested that the Meis1–Pax6 cascade regulates morphology of GCPs/GCs during development. In the conditional KO (cKO) cerebella, many Atoh1-positive GCPs were observed ectopically in the inner external granule layer (EGL) and a similar phenomenon was observed in cultured cerebellar slices treated with a bone morphogenic protein (BMP) inhibitor. Furthermore, expression of Smad proteins and Smad phosphorylation were severely reduced in the cKO cerebella and Meis1-knock-down GCPs cerebella. Reduction of phosphorylated Smad was also observed in cerebellar slices electroporated with a Pax6 knock-down vector. Because it is known that BMP signaling induces Atoh1 degradation in GCPs, these findings suggest that the Meis1–Pax6 pathway increases the expression of Smad proteins to upregulate BMP signaling, leading to degradation of Atoh1 in the inner EGL, which contributes to differentiation from GCPs to GCs. Therefore, this work reveals crucial functions of Meis1 in GC development and gives insights into the general understanding of the molecular machinery underlying neural differentiation from neural progenitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We report that myeloid ectopic viral integration site 1 homolog (Meis1) plays pivotal roles in the regulation of mouse granule cell (GC) development. Here, we show Meis1 is expressed in GC precursors (GCPs) and GCs during development. Our knock-down and conditional knock-out (cKO) experiments and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; assays revealed that Meis1 is required for proper cerebellar structure formation and for &lt;i&gt;Pax6&lt;/i&gt; transcription in GCPs and GCs. The Meis1–Pax6 cascade regulates the morphology of GCs. In the cKO cerebella, Smad proteins and bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling are severely reduced and Atoh1-expressing GCPs are ectopically detected in the inner external granule layer. These findings suggest that Meis1 regulates degradation of Atoh1 via BMP signaling, contributing to GC differentiation in the inner EGL, and should provide understanding into GC development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Selective Suppression of Local Interneuron Circuits in Human Motor Cortex Contributes to Movement Preparation</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1264?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Changes in neural activity occur in the motor cortex before movement, but the nature and purpose of this preparatory activity is unclear. To investigate this in the human (male and female) brain noninvasively, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to probe the excitability of distinct sets of excitatory inputs to corticospinal neurons during the warning period of various reaction time tasks. Using two separate methods (H-reflex conditioning and directional effects of TMS), we show that a specific set of excitatory inputs to corticospinal neurons are suppressed during motor preparation, while another set of inputs remain unaffected. To probe the behavioral relevance of this suppression, we examined whether the strength of the selective preparatory inhibition in each trial was related to reaction time. Surprisingly, the greater the amount of selective preparatory inhibition, the faster the reaction time was. This suggests that the inhibition of inputs to corticospinal neurons is not involved in preventing the release of movement but may in fact facilitate rapid reactions. Thus, selective suppression of a specific set of motor cortical neurons may be a key aspect of successful movement preparation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Movement preparation evokes substantial activity in the motor cortex despite no apparent movement. One explanation for the lack of movement is that motor cortical output in this period is gated by an inhibitory mechanism. This notion was supported by previous noninvasive TMS studies of human motor cortex indicating a reduction of corticospinal excitability. On the contrary, our data support the idea that there is a coordinated balance of activity upstream of the corticospinal output neurons. This includes a suppression of specific local circuits that supports, rather than inhibits, the rapid generation of prepared movements. Thus, the selective suppression of local circuits appears to be an essential part of successful movement preparation instead of an external control mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) Neuron Excitability Is Regulated by Estradiol Feedback and Kisspeptin</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1249?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons produce the central output controlling fertility and are regulated by steroid feedback. A switch from estradiol negative to positive feedback initiates the GnRH surge, ultimately triggering ovulation. This occurs on a daily basis in ovariectomized, estradiol-treated (OVX+E) mice; GnRH neurons are suppressed in the morning and activated in the afternoon. To test the hypotheses that estradiol and time of day signals alter GnRH neuron responsiveness to stimuli, GFP-identified GnRH neurons in brain slices from OVX+E or OVX female mice were recorded during the morning or afternoon. No differences were observed in baseline membrane potential. Current-clamp revealed GnRH neurons fired more action potentials in response to current injection during positive feedback relative to all other groups, which were not different from each other despite reports of differing ionic conductances. Kisspeptin increased GnRH neuron response in cells from OVX and OVX+E mice in the morning but not afternoon. Paradoxically, excitability in kisspeptin knock-out mice was similar to the maximum observed in control mice but was unchanged by time of day or estradiol. A mathematical model applying a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to estimate probability distributions for estradiol- and time of day–dependent parameters was used to predict intrinsic properties underlying excitability changes. A single identifiable distribution of solutions accounted for similar GnRH neuron excitability in all groups other than positive feedback despite different underlying conductance properties; this was attributable to interdependence of voltage-gated potassium channel properties. In contrast, redundant solutions may explain positive feedback, perhaps indicative of the importance of this state for species survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Infertility affects 15%–20% of couples; failure to ovulate is a common cause. Understanding how the brain controls ovulation is critical for new developments in both infertility treatment and contraception. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons are the final common pathway for central neural control of ovulation. We studied how estradiol feedback regulates GnRH excitability, a key determinant of neural firing rate using laboratory and computational approaches. GnRH excitability is upregulated during positive feedback, perhaps driving increased neural firing rate at this time. Kisspeptin increased GnRH excitability and was essential for estradiol regulation of excitability. Modeling predicts that multiple combinations of changes to GnRH intrinsic conductances can produce the firing response in positive feedback, suggesting the brain has many ways to induce ovulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Tenuous Inhibitory GABAergic Signaling in the Reticular Thalamus</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1232?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Maintenance of a low intracellular Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; concentration ([Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) is critical for enabling inhibitory neuronal responses to GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-mediated signaling. Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; transporters, including KCC2, and extracellular impermeant anions ([A]&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;) of the extracellular matrix are both proposed to be important regulators of [Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;. Neurons of the reticular thalamic (RT) nucleus express reduced levels of KCC2, indicating that GABAergic signaling may produce excitation in RT neurons. However, by performing perforated patch recordings and calcium imaging experiments in rats (male and female), we find that [Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; remains relatively low in RT neurons. Although we identify a small contribution of [A]&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; to a low [Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; in RT neurons, our results also demonstrate that reduced levels of KCC2 remain sufficient to maintain low levels of Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;. Reduced KCC2 levels, however, restrict the capacity of RT neurons to rapidly extrude Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; following periods of elevated GABAergic signaling. In a computational model of a local RT network featuring slow Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; extrusion kinetics, similar to those we found experimentally, model RT neurons are predisposed to an activity-dependent switch from GABA-mediated inhibition to excitation. By decreasing the activity threshold required to produce excitatory GABAergic signaling, weaker stimuli are able to propagate activity within the model RT nucleus. Our results indicate the importance of even diminished levels of KCC2 in maintaining inhibitory signaling within the RT nucleus and suggest how this important activity choke point may be easily overcome in disorders such as epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Precise regulation of intracellular Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; levels ([Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) preserves appropriate, often inhibitory, GABAergic signaling within the brain. However, there is disagreement over the relative contribution of various mechanisms that maintain low [Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;. We found that the Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; transporter KCC2 is an important Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; extruder in the reticular thalamic (RT) nucleus, despite this nucleus having remarkably low KCC2 immunoreactivity relative to other regions of the adult brain. We also identified a smaller contribution of fixed, impermeant anions ([A]&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;) to lowering [Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; in RT neurons. Inhibitory signaling among RT neurons is important for preventing excessive activation of RT neurons, which can be responsible for generating seizures. Our work suggests that KCC2 critically restricts the spread of activity within the RT nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Conditional Deletion of Hippocampal CA2/CA3a Oxytocin Receptors Impairs the Persistence of Long-Term Social Recognition Memory in Mice</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1218?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Oxytocin (OXT) receptors (OXTRs) are prominently expressed in hippocampal CA2 and CA3 pyramidal neurons, but little is known about its physiological function. As the functional necessity of hippocampal CA2 for social memory processing, we tested whether CA2 OXTRs may contribute to long-term social recognition memory (SRM) formation. Here, we found that conditional deletion of &lt;i&gt;Oxtr&lt;/i&gt; from forebrain (&lt;i&gt;Oxtr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;) or CA2/CA3a-restricted excitatory neurons in adult male mice impaired the persistence of long-term SRM but had no effect on sociability and preference for social novelty. Conditional deletion of CA2/CA3a &lt;i&gt;Oxtr&lt;/i&gt; showed no changes in anxiety-like behavior assessed using the open-field, elevated plus maze and novelty-suppressed feeding tests. Application of a highly selective OXTR agonist [Thr&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;,Gly&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;]-OXT to hippocampal slices resulted in an acute and lasting potentiation of excitatory synaptic responses in CA2 pyramidal neurons that relied on &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methyl-d-aspartate receptor activation and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II activity. In addition, &lt;i&gt;Oxtr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice displayed a defect in the induction of long-term potentiation, but not long-term depression, at the synapses between the entorhinal cortex and CA2 pyramidal neurons. Furthermore, &lt;i&gt;Oxtr&lt;/i&gt; deletion led to a reduced complexity of basal dendritic arbors of CA2 pyramidal neurons, but caused no alteration in the density of apical dendritic spines. Considering that the methodologies we have used to delete &lt;i&gt;Oxtr&lt;/i&gt; do not rule out targeting the neighboring CA3a region, these findings suggest that OXTR signaling in the CA2/CA3a is crucial for the persistence of long-term SRM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Oxytocin receptors (OXTRs) are abundantly expressed in hippocampal CA2 and CA3 regions, but there are little known about their physiological function. Taking advantage of the conditional &lt;i&gt;Oxtr&lt;/i&gt; knock-out mice, the present study highlights the importance of OXTR signaling in the induction of long-term potentiation at the synapses between the entorhinal cortex and CA2 pyramidal neurons and the persistence of long-term social recognition memory. Thus, OXTRs in the CA2/CA3a may provide a new target for therapeutic approaches to the treatment of social cognition deficits, which are often observed in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Attention Shifts Recruit the Monkey Default Mode Network</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1202?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A unifying function associated with the default mode network (DMN), which is more active during rest than under active task conditions, has been difficult to define. The DMN is activated during monitoring the external world for unexpected events, as a sentinel, and when humans are engaged in high-level internally focused tasks. The existence of DMN correlates in other species, such as mice, challenge the idea that internally focused, high-level cognitive operations, such as introspection, autobiographical memory retrieval, planning the future, and predicting someone else's thoughts, are evolutionarily preserved defining properties of the DMN. A recent human study demonstrated that demanding cognitive shifts could recruit the DMN, yet it is unknown whether this holds for nonhuman species. Therefore, we tested whether large changes in cognitive context would recruit DMN regions in female and male nonhuman primates. Such changes were measured as displacements of spatial attentional weights based on internal rules of relevance (spatial shifts) compared with maintaining attentional weights at the same location (stay events). Using fMRI in macaques, we detected that a cortical network, activated during shifts, largely overlapped with the DMN. Moreover, fMRI time courses sampled from independently defined DMN foci showed significant shift selectivity during the demanding attention task. Finally, functional clustering based on independent resting state data revealed that DMN and shift regions clustered conjointly, whereas regions activated during the stay events clustered apart. We therefore propose that cognitive shifting in primates generally recruits DMN regions. This might explain a breakdown of the DMN in many neurological diseases characterized by declined cognitive flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Activation of the human default mode network (DMN) can be measured with fMRI when subjects shift thoughts between high-level internally directed cognitive states, when thinking about the self, the perspective of others, when imagining future and past events, and during mind wandering. Furthermore, the DMN is activated as a sentinel, monitoring the environment for unexpected events. Arguably, these cognitive processes have in common fast and substantial changes in cognitive context. As DMN activity has also been reported in nonhuman species, we tested whether shifts in spatial attention activated the monkey DMN. Core monkey DMN and shift-selective regions shared several functional properties, indicating that cognitive shifting, in general, might constitute one of the evolutionarily preserved functions of the DMN.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Prismatic Adaptation Modulates Oscillatory EEG Correlates of Motor Preparation but Not Visual Attention in Healthy Participants</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1189?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Prismatic adaption (PA) has been proposed as a tool to induce neural plasticity and is used to help neglect rehabilitation. It leads to a recalibration of visuomotor coordination during pointing as well as to aftereffects on a number of sensorimotor and attention tasks, but whether these effects originate at a motor or attentional level remains a matter of debate. Our aim was to further characterize PA aftereffects by using an approach that allows distinguishing between effects on attentional and motor processes. We recorded EEG in healthy human participants (9 females and 7 males) while performing a new double step, anticipatory attention/motor preparation paradigm before and after adaptation to rightward-shifting prisms, with neutral lenses as a control. We then examined PA aftereffects through changes in known oscillatory EEG signatures of spatial attention orienting and motor preparation in the alpha and beta frequency bands. Our results were twofold. First, we found PA to rightward-shifting prisms to selectively affect EEG signatures of motor but not attentional processes. More specifically, PA modulated preparatory motor EEG activity over central electrodes in the right hemisphere, contralateral to the PA-induced, compensatory leftward shift in pointing movements. No effects were found on EEG signatures of spatial attention orienting over occipitoparietal sites. Second, we found the PA effect on preparatory motor EEG activity to dominate in the beta frequency band. We conclude that changes to intentional visuomotor, rather than attentional visuospatial, processes underlie the PA aftereffect of rightward-deviating prisms in healthy participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Prismatic adaptation (PA) has been proposed as a tool to induce neural plasticity in both healthy participants and patients, due to its aftereffect impacting on a number of visuospatial and visuomotor functions. However, the neural mechanisms underlying PA aftereffects are poorly understood as only little neuroimaging evidence is available. Here, we examined, for the first time, the origin of PA aftereffects studying oscillatory brain activity. Our results show a selective modulation of preparatory motor activity following PA in healthy participants but no effect on attention-related activity. This provides novel insight into the PA aftereffect in the healthy brain and may help to inform interventions in neglect patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Attention Is Required for Knowledge-Based Sequential Grouping: Insights from the Integration of Syllables into Words</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1178?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;How the brain groups sequential sensory events into chunks is a fundamental question in cognitive neuroscience. This study investigates whether top–down attention or specific tasks are required for the brain to apply lexical knowledge to group syllables into words. Neural responses tracking the syllabic and word rhythms of a rhythmic speech sequence were concurrently monitored using electroencephalography (EEG). The participants performed different tasks, attending to either the rhythmic speech sequence or a distractor, which was another speech stream or a nonlinguistic auditory/visual stimulus. Attention to speech, but not a lexical-meaning-related task, was required for reliable neural tracking of words, even when the distractor was a nonlinguistic stimulus presented cross-modally. Neural tracking of syllables, however, was reliably observed in all tested conditions. These results strongly suggest that neural encoding of individual auditory events (i.e., syllables) is automatic, while knowledge-based construction of temporal chunks (i.e., words) crucially relies on top–down attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Why we cannot understand speech when not paying attention is an old question in psychology and cognitive neuroscience. Speech processing is a complex process that involves multiple stages, e.g., hearing and analyzing the speech sound, recognizing words, and combining words into phrases and sentences. The current study investigates which speech-processing stage is blocked when we do not listen carefully. We show that the brain can reliably encode syllables, basic units of speech sounds, even when we do not pay attention. Nevertheless, when distracted, the brain cannot group syllables into multisyllabic words, which are basic units for speech meaning. Therefore, the process of converting speech sound into meaning crucially relies on attention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Loss of Intercalated Cells (ITCs) in the Mouse Amygdala of Tshz1 Mutants Correlates with Fear, Depression, and Social Interaction Phenotypes</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1160?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The intercalated cells (ITCs) of the amygdala have been shown to be critical regulatory components of amygdalar circuits, which control appropriate fear responses. Despite this, the molecular processes guiding ITC development remain poorly understood. Here we establish the zinc finger transcription factor Tshz1 as a marker of ITCs during their migration from the dorsal lateral ganglionic eminence through maturity. Using germline and conditional knock-out (cKO) mouse models, we show that &lt;i&gt;Tshz1&lt;/i&gt; is required for the proper migration and differentiation of ITCs. In the absence of &lt;i&gt;Tshz1&lt;/i&gt;, migrating ITC precursors fail to settle in their stereotypical locations encapsulating the lateral amygdala and BLA. Furthermore, they display reductions in the ITC marker Foxp2 and ectopic persistence of the dorsal lateral ganglionic eminence marker Sp8. &lt;i&gt;Tshz1&lt;/i&gt; mutant ITCs show increased cell death at postnatal time points, leading to a dramatic reduction by 3 weeks of age. In line with this, &lt;i&gt;Foxp2&lt;/i&gt;-null mutants also show a loss of ITCs at postnatal time points, suggesting that &lt;i&gt;Foxp2&lt;/i&gt; may function downstream of &lt;i&gt;Tshz1&lt;/i&gt; in the maintenance of ITCs. Behavioral analysis of male &lt;i&gt;Tshz1&lt;/i&gt; cKOs revealed defects in fear extinction as well as an increase in floating during the forced swim test, indicative of a depression-like phenotype. Moreover, &lt;i&gt;Tshz1&lt;/i&gt; cKOs display significantly impaired social interaction (i.e., increased passivity) regardless of partner genetics. Together, these results suggest that &lt;i&gt;Tshz1&lt;/i&gt; plays a critical role in the development of ITCs and that fear, depression-like and social behavioral deficits arise in their absence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We show here that the zinc finger transcription factor Tshz1 is expressed during development of the intercalated cells (ITCs) within the mouse amygdala. These neurons have previously been shown to play a crucial role in fear extinction. &lt;i&gt;Tshz1&lt;/i&gt; mouse mutants exhibit severely reduced numbers of ITCs as a result of abnormal migration, differentiation, and survival of these neurons. Furthermore, the loss of ITCs in mouse &lt;i&gt;Tshz1&lt;/i&gt; mutants correlates well with defects in fear extinction as well as the appearance of depression-like and abnormal social interaction behaviors reminiscent of depressive disorders observed in human patients with distal 18q deletions, including the &lt;i&gt;Tshz1&lt;/i&gt; locus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cocaine Selectively Reorganizes Excitatory Inputs to Substantia Nigra Pars Compacta Dopamine Neurons</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1151?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopamine neurons and their targets are involved in addiction and cue-induced relapse. However, afferents onto SNc dopamine neurons themselves appear insensitive to drugs of abuse, such as cocaine, when afferents are collectively stimulated electrically. This contrasts with ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons, whose glutamate afferents react robustly to cocaine. We used an optogenetic strategy to isolate identified SNc inputs and determine whether cocaine sensitivity in the mouse SNc circuit is conferred at the level of three glutamate afferents: dorsal raphé nucleus (DR), pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), and subthalamic nucleus (STN). We found that excitatory afferents to SNc dopamine neurons are sensitive to cocaine in an afferent-specific manner. A single exposure to cocaine &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; led to PPN-innervated synapses reducing the AMPA-to-NMDA receptor-mediated current ratio. In contrast to work in the VTA, this was due to increased NMDA receptor function with no change in AMPA receptor function. STN synapses showed a decrease in calcium-permeable AMPA receptors after cocaine, but no change in the AMPA-to-NMDA ratio. Cocaine also increased the release probability at DR-innervated and STN-innervated synapses, quantified by decreases in paired-pulse ratios. However, release probability at PPN-innervated synapses remained unaffected. By examining identified inputs, our results demonstrate a functional distribution among excitatory SNc afferent nuclei in response to cocaine, and suggest a compelling architecture for differentiation and separate parsing of inputs within the nigrostriatal system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Prior studies have established that substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopamine neurons are a key node in the circuitry that drives addiction and relapse, yet cocaine apparently has no effect on electrically stimulated excitatory inputs. Our study is the first to demonstrate the functional impact of a drug of abuse on synaptic mechanisms of identified afferents to the SNc. Optogenetic dissection of inputs originating from dorsal raphé, pedunculopontine, and subthalamic nuclei were tested for synaptic modifications following &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; cocaine exposure. Our results demonstrate that cocaine differentially induces modifications to SNc synapses depending on input origin. This presents implications for understanding dopamine processing of motivated behavior; most critically, it indicates that dopamine neurons selectively modulate signal reception processed by afferent nuclei.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cholinergic Overstimulation Attenuates Rule Selectivity in Macaque Prefrontal Cortex</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1137?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Acetylcholine is released in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and is a key modulator of cognitive performance in primates. Cholinergic stimulation has been shown to have beneficial effects on performance of cognitive tasks, and cholinergic receptors are being actively explored as promising targets for ameliorating cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease. We hypothesized that cholinergic stimulation of PFC during performance of a cognitive task would augment neuronal activity and neuronal coding of task attributes. We iontophoretically applied the general cholinergic receptor agonist carbachol onto neurons in dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) of male rhesus macaques performing rule-guided prosaccades and antisaccades, a well established oculomotor task for testing cognitive control. Carbachol application had heterogeneous effects on neuronal excitability, with both excitation and suppression observed in significant proportions. Contrary to our prediction, neurons with rule-selective activity exhibited a reduction in selectivity during carbachol application. Cholinergic stimulation disrupted rule selectivity regardless of whether it had suppressive or excitatory effects on these neurons. In addition, cholinergic stimulation excited putative pyramidal neurons, whereas the activity of putative interneurons remained unchanged. Moreover, cholinergic stimulation attenuated saccade direction selectivity in putative pyramidal neurons due to nonspecific increases in activity. Our results suggest excessive cholinergic stimulation has detrimental effects on DLPFC representations of task attributes. These findings delineate the complexity and heterogeneity of neuromodulation of cerebral cortex by cholinergic stimulation, an area of active exploration with respect to the development of cognitive enhancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The neurotransmitter acetylcholine is known to be important for cognitive processes in the prefrontal cortex. Removal of acetylcholine from prefrontal cortex can disrupt short-term memory performance and is reminiscent of Alzheimer's disease, which is characterized by degeneration of acetylcholine-producing neurons. Stimulation of cholinergic receptors is being explored to create cognitive enhancers for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other psychiatric diseases. Here, we stimulated cholinergic receptors in prefrontal cortex and examined its effects on neurons that are engaged in cognitive behavior. Surprisingly, cholinergic stimulation decreased neurons' ability to discriminate between rules. This work suggests that overstimulation of acetylcholine receptors could disrupt neuronal processing during cognition and is relevant to the design of cognitive enhancers based on stimulating the cholinergic system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: DRG Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel 1.7 Is Upregulated in Paclitaxel-Induced Neuropathy in Rats and in Humans with Neuropathic Pain</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1124?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common adverse effect experienced by cancer patients receiving treatment with paclitaxel. The voltage-gated sodium channel 1.7 (Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.7) plays an important role in multiple preclinical models of neuropathic pain and in inherited human pain phenotypes, and its gene expression is increased in dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) of paclitaxel-treated rats. Hence, the potential of change in the expression and function of Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 protein in DRGs from male rats with paclitaxel-related CIPN and from male and female humans with cancer-related neuropathic pain was tested here. Double immunofluorescence in CIPN rats showed that Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 was upregulated in small DRG neuron somata, especially those also expressing calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and in central processes of these cells in the superficial spinal dorsal horn. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in rat DRG neurons revealed that paclitaxel induced an enhancement of ProTx II (a selective Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 channel blocker)-sensitive sodium currents. Bath-applied ProTx II suppressed spontaneous action potentials in DRG neurons occurring in rats with CIPN, while intrathecal injection of ProTx II significantly attenuated behavioral signs of CIPN. Complementarily, DRG neurons isolated from segments where patients had a history of neuropathic pain also showed electrophysiological and immunofluorescence results indicating an increased expression of Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 associated with spontaneous activity. Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 was also colocalized in human cells expressing transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 and CGRP. Furthermore, ProTx II decreased firing frequency in human DRGs with spontaneous action potentials. This study suggests that Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 may provide a potential new target for the treatment of neuropathic pain, including chemotherapy (paclitaxel)-induced neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This work demonstrates that the expression and function of the voltage-gated sodium channel Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 are increased in a preclinical model of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), the most common treatment-limiting side effect of all the most common anticancer therapies. This is key as gain-of-function mutations in human Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 recapitulate both the distribution and pain percept as shown by CIPN patients. This work also shows that Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 is increased in human DRG neurons only in dermatomes where patients are experiencing acquired neuropathic pain symptoms. This work therefore has major translational impact, indicating an important novel therapeutic avenue for neuropathic pain as a class.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Decoding Trans-Saccadic Memory</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1114?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We examine whether peripheral information at a planned saccade target affects immediate postsaccadic processing at the fovea on saccade landing. Current neuroimaging research suggests that presaccadic stimulation has a late effect on postsaccadic processing, in contrast to the early effect seen in behavioral studies. Human participants (both male and female) were instructed to saccade toward a face or a house that, on different trials, remained the same, changed, or disappeared during the saccade. We used a multivariate pattern analysis of electroencephalography data to decode face versus house processing directly after the saccade. The classifier was trained on separate trials without a saccade, where a house or face was presented at the fovea. When the saccade target remained the same across the saccade, we could reliably decode the target 123 ms after saccade offset. In contrast, when the target was changed during the saccade, the new target was decoded at a later time-point, 151 ms after saccade offset. The &quot;same&quot; condition advantage suggests that congruent presaccadic information facilitates processing of the postsaccadic stimulus compared with incongruent information. Finally, the saccade target could be decoded above chance even when it had been removed during the saccade, albeit with a slower time course (162 ms) and poorer signal strength. These findings indicate that information about the (peripheral) presaccadic stimulus is transferred across the saccade so that it becomes quickly available and influences processing at its expected new retinal position (the fovea).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Here we provide neural evidence for early information transfer across saccades. Specifically, we examined the effect of presaccadic sensory information on the initial neuronal processing of a postsaccadic stimuli. Using electroencephalography and multivariate pattern analysis, we found the following: (1) that the identity of the presaccadic stimulus modulated the postsaccadic latency of stimulus relevant information; and (2) that a saccadic neural marker for a saccade target stimulus could be detected even when the stimulus had been removed during saccade. These results demonstrate that information about the peripheral presaccadic stimulus was transferred across the saccade and influenced processing at a new retinal position (the fovea) directly after the saccade landed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Disruption of Interneuron Neurogenesis in Premature Newborns and Reversal with Estrogen Treatment</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1100?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many Preterm-born children suffer from neurobehavioral disorders. Premature birth terminates the hypoxic &lt;i&gt;in utero&lt;/i&gt; environment and supply of maternal hormones. As the production of interneurons continues until the end of pregnancy, we hypothesized that premature birth would disrupt interneuron production and that restoration of the hypoxic milieu or estrogen treatment might reverse interneuron generation. To test these hypotheses, we compared interneuronal progenitors in the medial ganglionic eminences (MGEs), lateral ganglionic eminences (LGEs), and caudal ganglionic eminences (CGEs) between preterm-born [born on embryonic day (E) 29; examined on postnatal day (D) 3 and D7] and term-born (born on E32; examined on D0 and D4) rabbits at equivalent postconceptional ages. We found that both total and cycling Nkx2.1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Dlx2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Sox2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells were more abundant in the MGEs of preterm rabbits at D3 compared with term rabbits at D0, but not in D7 preterm relative to D4 term pups. Total Nkx2.1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; progenitors were also more numerous in the LGEs of preterm pups at D3 compared with term rabbits at D0. Dlx2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells in CGEs were comparable between preterm and term pups. Simulation of hypoxia by dimethyloxalylglycine treatment did not affect the number of interneuronal progenitors. However, estrogen treatment reduced the density of total and proliferating Nkx2.1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Dlx2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells in the MGEs and enhanced Ascl1 transcription factor. Estrogen treatment also reduced Ki67, c-Myc, and phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein, suggesting inhibition of the G1-to-S phase transition. Hence, preterm birth disrupts interneuron neurogenesis in the MGE and estrogen treatment reverses interneuron neurogenesis in preterm newborns by cell-cycle inhibition and elevation of Ascl1. We speculate that estrogen replacement might partially restore neurogenesis in human premature infants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Prematurity results in developmental delays and neurobehavioral disorders, which might be ascribed to disturbances in the development of cortical interneurons. Here, we show that preterm birth disrupts interneuron neurogenesis in the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) and, more importantly, that estrogen treatment reverses this perturbation in the population of interneuron progenitors in the MGE. The estrogen seems to restore neurogenesis by inhibiting the cell cycle and elevating Ascl1 expression. As preterm birth causes plasma estrogen level to drop 100-fold, the estrogen replacement in preterm infants is physiological. We speculate that estrogen replacement might ameliorate disruption in production of interneurons in human premature infants.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A{beta} mediates F-actin disassembly in dendritic spines leading to cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1085?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dendritic spine loss is recognized as an early feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Dendritic spine structure is defined by filamentous actin (F-actin) and we observed depolymerization of synaptosomal F-actin accompanied by increased globular-actin (G-actin) at as early as 1 month of age in a mouse model of AD (APPswe/PS1E9, male mice). This led to recall deficit after contextual fear conditioning (cFC) at 2 months of age in APPswe/PS1E9 male mice, which could be reversed by the actin-polymerizing agent jasplakinolide. Further, the F-actin-depolymerizing agent latrunculin induced recall deficit after cFC in WT mice, indicating the importance of maintaining F-/G-actin equilibrium for optimal behavioral response. Using direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM), we show that F-actin depolymerization in spines leads to a breakdown of the nano-organization of outwardly radiating F-actin rods in cortical neurons from APPswe/PS1E9 mice. Our results demonstrate that synaptic dysfunction seen as F-actin disassembly occurs very early, before onset of pathological hallmarks in AD mice, and contributes to behavioral dysfunction, indicating that depolymerization of F-actin is causal and not consequent to decreased spine density. Further, we observed decreased synaptosomal F-actin levels in postmortem brain from mild cognitive impairment and AD patients compared with subjects with normal cognition. F-actin decrease correlated inversely with increasing AD pathology (Braak score, Aβ load, and tangle density) and directly with performance in episodic and working memory tasks, suggesting its role in human disease pathogenesis and progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Synaptic dysfunction underlies cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The cytoskeletal protein actin plays a critical role in maintaining structure and function of synapses. Using cultured neurons and an AD mouse model, we show for the first time that filamentous actin (F-actin) is lost selectively from synapses early in the disease process, long before the onset of classical AD pathology. We also demonstrate that loss of synaptic F-actin contributes directly to memory deficits. Loss of synaptosomal F-actin in human postmortem tissue correlates directly with decreased performance in memory test and inversely with AD pathology. Our data highlight that synaptic cytoarchitectural changes occur early in AD and they may be targeted for the development of therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: HRPU-2, a Homolog of Mammalian hnRNP U, Regulates Synaptic Transmission by Controlling the Expression of SLO-2 Potassium Channel in Caenorhabditis elegans</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1073?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Slo2 channels are large-conductance potassium channels abundantly expressed in the nervous system. However, it is unclear how their expression level in neurons is regulated. Here we report that HRPU-2, an RNA-binding protein homologous to mammalian heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (hnRNP U), plays an important role in regulating the expression of SLO-2 (a homolog of mammalian Slo2) in &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;. Loss-of-function (&lt;i&gt;lf&lt;/i&gt;) mutants of &lt;i&gt;hrpu-2&lt;/i&gt; were isolated in a genetic screen for suppressors of a sluggish phenotype caused by a hyperactive SLO-2. In &lt;i&gt;hrpu-2(lf)&lt;/i&gt; mutants, SLO-2-mediated delayed outward currents in neurons are greatly decreased, and neuromuscular synaptic transmission is enhanced. These mutant phenotypes can be rescued by expressing wild-type HRPU-2 in neurons. HRPU-2 binds to &lt;i&gt;slo-2&lt;/i&gt; mRNA, and &lt;i&gt;hrpu-2(lf)&lt;/i&gt; mutants show decreased SLO-2 protein expression. In contrast, &lt;i&gt;hrpu-2(lf)&lt;/i&gt; does not alter the expression of either the BK channel SLO-1 or the &lt;i&gt;Shaker&lt;/i&gt; type potassium channel SHK-1. &lt;i&gt;hrpu-2(lf)&lt;/i&gt; mutants are indistinguishable from wild type in gross motor neuron morphology and locomotion behavior. Together, these observations suggest that HRPU-2 plays important roles in SLO-2 function by regulating SLO-2 protein expression, and that SLO-2 is likely among a restricted set of proteins regulated by HRPU-2. Mutations of human Slo2 channel and hnRNP U are strongly linked to epileptic disorders and intellectual disability. The findings of this study suggest a potential link between these two molecules in human patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (hnRNP U) belongs to a family of RNA-binding proteins that play important roles in controlling gene expression. Recent studies have established a strong link between mutations of hnRNP U and human epilepsies and intellectual disability. However, it is unclear how mutations of hnRNP U may cause such disorders. This study shows that mutations of HRPU-2, a worm homolog of mammalian hnRNP U, result in dysfunction of a Slo2 potassium channel, which is critical to neuronal function. Because mutations of Slo2 channels are also strongly associated with epileptic encephalopathies and intellectual disability in humans, the findings of this study point to a potential mechanism underlying neurological disorders caused by hnRNP U mutations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Glutamatergic Transmission to Hypothalamic Kisspeptin Neurons Is Differentially Regulated by Estradiol through Estrogen Receptor {alpha} in Adult Female Mice</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1061?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Estradiol feedback regulates gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons and subsequent luteinizing hormone (LH) release. Estradiol acts via estrogen receptor α (ERα)-expressing afferents of GnRH neurons, including kisspeptin neurons in the anteroventral periventricular (AVPV) and arcuate nuclei, providing homeostatic feedback on episodic GnRH/LH release as well as positive feedback to control ovulation. Ionotropic glutamate receptors are important for estradiol feedback, but it is not known where they fit in the circuitry. Estradiol-negative feedback decreased glutamatergic transmission to AVPV and increased it to arcuate kisspeptin neurons; positive feedback had the opposite effect. Deletion of ERα in kisspeptin cells decreased glutamate transmission to AVPV neurons and markedly increased it to arcuate kisspeptin neurons, which also exhibited increased spontaneous firing rate. KERKO mice had increased LH pulse frequency, indicating loss of negative feedback. These observations indicate that ERα in kisspeptin cells is required for appropriate differential regulation of these neurons and neuroendocrine output by estradiol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The brain regulates fertility through gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons. Ovarian estradiol regulates the pattern of GnRH (negative feedback) and initiates a surge of release that triggers ovulation (positive feedback). GnRH neurons do not express the estrogen receptor needed for feedback (estrogen receptor α [ERα]); kisspeptin neurons in the arcuate and anteroventral periventricular nuclei are postulated to mediate negative and positive feedback, respectively. Here we extend the network through which feedback is mediated by demonstrating that glutamatergic transmission to these kisspeptin populations is differentially regulated during the reproductive cycle and by estradiol. Electrophysiological and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; hormone profile experiments on kisspeptin-specific ERα knock-out mice demonstrate that ERα in kisspeptin cells is required for appropriate differential regulation of these neurons and for neuroendocrine output.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/jWjec7d9uT0/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Yonathan Murin, Jeremy Kim, Josef Parvizi, Andrea Goldsmith&lt;/p&gt;

Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders affecting about 1% of the world population. For patients with focal seizures that cannot be treated with antiepileptic drugs, the common treatment is a surgical procedure for removal of the seizure onset zone (SOZ). In this work we introduce an algorithm for automatic localization of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) in epileptic patients based on electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings. The proposed algorithm builds upon the hypothesis that the abnormal excessive (or synchronous) neuronal activity in the brain leading to seizures &lt;i&gt;starts in the SOZ&lt;/i&gt; and then &lt;i&gt;spreads&lt;/i&gt; to other areas in the brain. Thus, when this abnormal activity starts, signals recorded at electrodes close to the SOZ should have a relatively large &lt;i&gt;causal influence&lt;/i&gt; on the rest of the recorded signals. The SOZ localization is executed in two steps. First, the algorithm represents the set of electrodes using a directed graph in which nodes correspond to recording electrodes and the edges’ weights quantify the &lt;i&gt;pair-wise&lt;/i&gt; causal influence between the recorded signals. Then, the algorithm infers the SOZ from the estimated graph using a variant of the &lt;i&gt;PageRank&lt;/i&gt; algorithm followed by a novel post-processing phase. Inference results for 19 patients show a close match between the SOZ inferred by the proposed approach and the SOZ estimated by expert neurologists (success rate of 17 out of 19).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jWjec7d9uT0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Metabolic plasticity in synthetic lethal mutants: Viability at higher cost</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/RgV2wA7v53Q/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Francesco Alessandro Massucci, Francesc Sagués, M. Ángeles Serrano&lt;/p&gt;

The most frequent form of pairwise synthetic lethality (SL) in metabolic networks is known as plasticity synthetic lethality. It occurs when the simultaneous inhibition of paired functional and silent metabolic reactions or genes is lethal, while the default of the functional partner is backed up by the activation of the silent one. Using computational techniques on bacterial genome-scale metabolic reconstructions, we found that the failure of the functional partner triggers a critical reorganization of fluxes to ensure viability in the mutant which not only affects the SL pair but a significant fraction of other interconnected reactions, forming what we call a SL cluster. Interestingly, SL clusters show a strong entanglement both in terms of reactions and genes. This strong overlap mitigates the acquired vulnerabilities and increased structural and functional costs that pay for the robustness provided by essential plasticity. Finally, the participation of coessential reactions and genes in different SL clusters is very heterogeneous and those at the intersection of many SL clusters could serve as supertargets for more efficient drug action in the treatment of complex diseases and to elucidate improved strategies directed to reduce undesired resistance to chemicals in pathogens.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RgV2wA7v53Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Reactome is a free, open-source, open-data, curated and peer-reviewed knowledgebase of biomolecular pathways. One of its main priorities is to provide easy and efficient access to its high quality curated data. At present, biological pathway databases typically store their contents in relational databases. This limits access efficiency because there are performance issues associated with queries traversing highly interconnected data. The same data in a graph database can be queried more efficiently. Here we present the rationale behind the adoption of a graph database (Neo4j) as well as the new ContentService (REST API) that provides access to these data. The Neo4j graph database and its query language, Cypher, provide efficient access to the complex Reactome data model, facilitating easy traversal and knowledge discovery. The adoption of this technology greatly improved query efficiency, reducing the average query time by 93%. The web service built on top of the graph database provides programmatic access to Reactome data by object oriented queries, but also supports more complex queries that take advantage of the new underlying graph-based data storage. By adopting graph database technology we are providing a high performance pathway data resource to the community. The Reactome graph database use case shows the power of NoSQL database engines for complex biological data types.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7RLEkfWxsdM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The extent of ribosome queuing in budding yeast</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/EGKWmrKeD6Y/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Alon Diament, Anna Feldman, Elisheva Schochet, Martin Kupiec, Yoav Arava, Tamir Tuller&lt;/p&gt;

Ribosome queuing is a fundamental phenomenon suggested to be related to topics such as genome evolution, synthetic biology, gene expression regulation, intracellular biophysics, and more. However, this phenomenon hasn't been quantified yet at a genomic level. Nevertheless, methodologies for studying translation (e.g. ribosome footprints) are usually calibrated to capture only single ribosome protected footprints (mRPFs) and thus limited in their ability to detect ribosome queuing. On the other hand, most of the models in the field assume and analyze a certain level of queuing. Here we present an experimental-computational approach for studying ribosome queuing based on sequencing of RNA footprints extracted from pairs of ribosomes (dRPFs) using a modified ribosome profiling protocol. We combine our approach with traditional ribosome profiling to generate a detailed profile of ribosome traffic. The data are analyzed using computational models of translation dynamics. The approach was implemented on the &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; transcriptome. Our data shows that ribosome queuing is more frequent than previously thought: the measured ratio of ribosomes within dRPFs to mRPFs is 0.2–0.35, suggesting that at least one to five translating ribosomes is in a traffic jam; these queued ribosomes cannot be captured by traditional methods. We found that specific regions are enriched with queued ribosomes, such as the 5’-end of ORFs, and regions upstream to mRPF peaks, among others. While queuing is related to higher density of ribosomes on the transcript (characteristic of highly translated genes), we report cases where traffic jams are relatively more severe in lowly expressed genes and possibly even selected for. In addition, our analysis demonstrates that higher adaptation of the coding region to the intracellular tRNA levels is associated with lower queuing levels. Our analysis also suggests that the &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; transcriptome undergoes selection for eliminating traffic jams. Thus, our proposed approach is an essential tool for high resolution analysis of ribosome traffic during mRNA translation and understanding its evolution.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EGKWmrKeD6Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Identification of allosteric inhibitors of the ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73) targeting the dimer interface</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/MmJFMNHwHpM/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Rahila Rahimova, Simon Fontanel, Corinne Lionne, Lars Peter Jordheim, Suzanne Peyrottes, Laurent Chaloin&lt;/p&gt;

The ecto-5’-nucleotidase CD73 plays an important role in the production of immune-suppressive adenosine in tumor micro-environment, and has become a validated drug target in oncology. Indeed, the anticancer immune response involves extracellular ATP to block cell proliferation through T-cell activation. However, in the tumor micro-environment, two extracellular membrane-bound enzymes (CD39 and CD73) are overexpressed and hydrolyze efficiently ATP into AMP then further into immune-suppressive adenosine. To circumvent the impact of CD73-generated adenosine, we applied an original bioinformatics approach to identify new allosteric inhibitors targeting the dimerization interface of CD73, which should impair the large dynamic motions required for its enzymatic function. Several hit compounds issued from virtual screening campaigns showed a potent inhibition of recombinant CD73 with inhibition constants in the low micromolar range and exhibited a non-competitive inhibition mode. The structure-activity relationships studies indicated that several amino acid residues (D366, H456, K471, Y484 and E543 for polar interactions and G453-454, I455, H456, L475, V542 and G544 for hydrophobic contacts) located at the dimerization interface are involved in the tight binding of hit compounds and likely contributed for their inhibitory activity. Overall, the gathered information will guide the upcoming lead optimization phase that may lead to potent and selective CD73 inhibitors, able to restore the anticancer immune response.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MmJFMNHwHpM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dietary salt promotes neurovascular and cognitive dysfunction through a gut-initiated TH17 response&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietary salt promotes neurovascular and cognitive dysfunction through a gut-initiated TH17 response, Published online: 15 January 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-017-0059-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-017-0059-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A salt-rich diet promotes cerebrovascular diseases and dementia. This study shows that high dietary salt in mice induces a TH17 response in the gut leading to cerebral endothelial dysfunction and cognitive impairment via circulating IL-17.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/FiLW_AskdDE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>
