	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Microglia Under the Spotlight: Activity and Complement-Dependent Engulfment of Synapses</title>
	<link>https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(18)30085-7?rss=yes</link>
	<content:encoded>In 2012, Schaefer et al. revealed that microglia regulate the emergence of functional connectivity by engulfing and selectively eliminating synapses in the retinogeniculate system. This synaptic pruning mechanism, which is activity dependent and relies on the complement cascade, has helped define microglia as a central contributor to normal wiring and to brain disorders.</content:encoded>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Synaptic Capture of Laterally Diffusing AMPA Receptors – An Idea That Stuck</title>
	<link>https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(18)30084-5?rss=yes</link>
	<content:encoded>By the early 2000s there was strong support for the idea that synaptic function and plasticity required AMPA glutamate receptor trafficking through constitutive and regulated internalization and exocytosis. In 2002, Borgdorff and Choquet demonstrated that AMPA receptors could also diffuse laterally in the membrane and become stabilized near synapses. Subsequent studies extended this work, establishing a fundamental role for lateral diffusion in synaptic function and plasticity.</content:encoded>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Peptide-Mediated Neurotransmission Takes Center Stage</title>
	<link>https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(18)30081-X?rss=yes</link>
	<content:encoded>Today, we understand peptide transmitters to be signaling molecules that modulate neural activity. However, in 1982 little was known about neuropeptides and their role in neural communication. The influential 1982 paper by Jan and Jan reported definitive evidence that a presynaptically released neuropeptide evokes postsynaptic responses in an identified cholinergic synapse, thereby fueling a new era in neuroscience.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(18)30080-8?rss=yes</link>
	<content:encoded>In 1992, Brose et al. showed that the synaptic vesicle (SV) protein p65/synaptotagmin (syt) 1 binds – in a mutually dependent manner – Ca2+ and anionic phospholipids, prompting the idea that it functions as a Ca2+ sensor for exocytosis. These findings now define two key aspects of excitation–secretion coupling.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09176</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Scientific studies have shown that non-conscious stimuli and representations
influence information processing during conscious experience. In the light of
such evidence, questions about potential functional links between non-conscious
brain representations and conscious experience arise. This article discusses a
neural coding model capable of explaining how statistical learning mechanisms
in dedicated resonant circuits could generate specific temporal activity traces
of non-conscious representations in the brain. How reentrant signaling,
top-down matching, and statistical coincidence of such activity traces may lead
to the progressive consolidation of temporal patterns that constitute the
neural signatures of conscious experience in networks extending across large
distances beyond functionally specialized brain regions is then explained.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Detection of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation using Attention-based Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks. (arXiv:1805.09133v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09133</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Detection of atrial fibrillation (AF), a type of cardiac arrhythmia, is
difficult since many cases of AF are usually clinically silent and undiagnosed.
In particular paroxysmal AF is a form of AF that occurs occasionally, and has a
higher probability of being undetected. In this work, we present an attention
based deep learning framework for detection of paroxysmal AF episodes from a
sequence of windows. Time-frequency representation of 30 seconds recording
windows, over a 10 minute data segment, are fed sequentially into a deep
convolutional neural network for image-based feature extraction, which are then
presented to a bidirectional recurrent neural network with an attention layer
for AF detection. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework
for transient AF detection, we use a database of 24 hour Holter
Electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings acquired from 2850 patients at the
University of Virginia heart station. The algorithm achieves an AUC of 0.94 on
the testing set, which exceeds the performance of baseline models. We also
demonstrate the cross-domain generalizablity of the approach by adapting the
learned model parameters from one recording modality (ECG) to another
(photoplethysmogram) with improved AF detection performance. The proposed high
accuracy, low false alarm algorithm for detecting paroxysmal AF has potential
applications in long-term monitoring using wearable sensors.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The present work shows that the maximum-entropy method can be applied to a
sample of neuronal recordings along two different routes: (1) apply to the
sample; or (2) apply to a larger, unsampled neuronal population from which the
sample is drawn, and then marginalize to the sample. These two routes give
inequivalent results. The second route can be further generalized to the case
where the size of the larger population is unknown. Which route should be
chosen? Some arguments are presented in favour of the second. This work also
presents and discusses probability formulae that relate states of knowledge
about a population and its samples, and that may be useful for sampling
problems in neuroscience.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09042</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A central problem to understanding intelligence is the concept of
generalisation. This allows previously learnt structure to be exploited to
solve tasks in novel situations differing in their particularities. We take
inspiration from neuroscience, specifically the Hippocampal-Entorhinal system
(containing place and grid cells), known to be important for generalisation. We
propose that to generalise structural knowledge, the representations of the
structure of the world, i.e. how entities in the world relate to each other,
need to be separated from representations of the entities themselves. We show,
under these principles, artificial neural networks embedded with hierarchy and
fast Hebbian memory, can learn the statistics of memories, generalise
structural knowledge, and also exhibit neuronal representations mirroring those
found in the brain. We experimentally support model assumptions, showing a
preserved relationship between grid and place cells across environments.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuromorphic architectures achieve low-power operation by using many simple
spiking neurons in lieu of traditional hardware. Here, we develop methods for
precise linear computations in spiking neural networks and use these methods to
map the evolution of a linear dynamical system (LDS) onto an existing

numerically validate, the discrepancy between the spiking LDS state sequence
and that of its non-spiking counterpart. These analytical results shed light on
the multiway tradeoff between time, space, energy, and accuracy in neuromorphic
computation. To demonstrate the utility of our work, we implemented a
neuromorphic Kalman filter (KF) and used it for offline decoding of human vocal
pitch from neural data. The neuromorphic KF could be used for low-power
filtering in domains beyond neuroscience, such as navigation or robotics.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Logistical constraints lead to an intermediate optimum in outbreak response vaccination</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Yun Tao, Katriona Shea, Matthew Ferrari&lt;/p&gt;

Dynamic models in disease ecology have historically evaluated vaccination strategies under the assumption that they are implemented homogeneously in space and time. However, this approach fails to formally account for operational and logistical constraints inherent in the distribution of vaccination to the population at risk. Thus, feedback between the dynamic processes of vaccine distribution and transmission might be overlooked. Here, we present a spatially explicit, stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Vaccinated model that highlights the density-dependence and spatial constraints of various diffusive strategies of vaccination during an outbreak. The model integrates an agent-based process of disease spread with a partial differential process of vaccination deployment. We characterize the vaccination response in terms of a diffusion rate that describes the distribution of vaccination to the population at risk from a central location. This generates an explicit trade-off between slow diffusion, which concentrates effort near the central location, and fast diffusion, which spreads a fixed vaccination effort thinly over a large area. We use stochastic simulation to identify the optimum vaccination diffusion rate as a function of population density, interaction scale, transmissibility, and vaccine intensity. Our results show that, conditional on a timely response, the optimal strategy for minimizing outbreak size is to distribute vaccination resource at an intermediate rate: fast enough to outpace the epidemic, but slow enough to achieve local herd immunity. If the response is delayed, however, the optimal strategy for minimizing outbreak size changes to a rapidly diffusive distribution of vaccination effort. The latter may also result in significantly larger outbreaks, thus suggesting a benefit of allocating resources to timely outbreak detection and response.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0yJKQdlBIFk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Genome-scale metabolic models have become the tool of choice for the global analysis of microorganism metabolism, and their reconstruction has attained high standards of quality and reliability. Improvements in this area have been accompanied by the development of some major platforms and databases, and an explosion of individual bioinformatics methods. Consequently, many recent models result from “à la carte” pipelines, combining the use of platforms, individual tools and biological expertise to enhance the quality of the reconstruction. Although very useful, introducing heterogeneous tools, that hardly interact with each other, causes loss of traceability and reproducibility in the reconstruction process. This represents a real obstacle, especially when considering less studied species whose metabolic reconstruction can greatly benefit from the comparison to good quality models of related organisms. This work proposes an adaptable workspace, AuReMe, for sustainable reconstructions or improvements of genome-scale metabolic models involving personalized pipelines. At each step, relevant information related to the modifications brought to the model by a method is stored. This ensures that the process is reproducible and documented regardless of the combination of tools used. Additionally, the workspace establishes a way to browse metabolic models and their metadata through the automatic generation of ad-hoc local wikis dedicated to monitoring and facilitating the process of reconstruction. AuReMe supports exploration and semantic query based on RDF databases. We illustrate how this workspace allowed handling, in an integrated way, the metabolic reconstructions of non-model organisms such as an extremophile bacterium or eukaryote algae. Among relevant applications, the latter reconstruction led to putative evolutionary insights of a metabolic pathway.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oV3GF0mvv-g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The entorhinal–hippocampal system is central to such representations, which are severely compromised in some neurological diseases. In spite of much progress, a comprehensive, integrated view of spatial, temporal and other aspects of episodic representation remains elusive. Here, we review recent data on the role of cell-type specific entorhinal inputs which excite deep and superficial CA1 pyramidal cells by direct and indirect pathways. We discuss how an entorhinal dialogue with deep-superficial CA1 cells can multiplex neuronal activity along theta phases and how their reactivation may be segregated during sharp-wave ripples. Thus, deep and superficial CA1 sublayers provide substrate for general hippocampal function. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;h3&quot;&gt;Graphical abstract&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; height=&quot;159&quot; src=&quot;http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438817302994-fx1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;301&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

More recently, the CM pathway was shown to exist in rodents during early development, suggesting that rodents and primates diverged in their reliance on the CM pathway at some point in evolution, thus challenging the traditional view of the sequential development of hand control from rodents to primates. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

How an animal efficiently switches between distinct behaviors is a fundamental question whose inquiry will provide insights into the mechanisms that are necessary for an organism's survival. Previous work aimed at identifying the neural systems responsible for defensive behaviors, such as freezing, has demonstrated critical interactions between the prefrontal cortex and amygdala. Indeed, this foundational research has provided an indispensable anatomical framework that investigators are now using to understand the physiological mechanisms of defined neural circuits within the prefrontal cortex that code for the rapid and flexible expression of defensive behaviors. Here we review recent findings demonstrating temporal and rate coding mechanisms of freezing behavior in the prefrontal cortex. We hypothesize that anatomical features, such as target structure and cortical layer, as well as the nature of the information to be coded, may be critical factors determining the coding scheme. Furthermore, detailed behavioral analyses may reveal subtypes of defensive behaviors that represent the principle factor governing coding selection. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Tau is found in both presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments of neurons in Alzheimer's disease. New research supports that soluble forms of tau trigger pathophysiology in the brain by altering properties of synaptic and neuronal function at the early stages of disease progression, before neurons die. Here we review the current understanding of how tau-mediated synaptic and neuronal dysfunction contributes to cognitive decline. Delineating the mechanisms by which pathogenic tau alters synapses, dendrites and axons will help lay the foundation for new strategies that can restore neuronal function in tauopathy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

These limitations reflect what has been dichotomy between the structure and mechanical properties of living brain tissue and non-living neural probes. To bridge the gap between neural and electronic networks, we have introduced the new concept of mesh electronics probes designed with structural and mechanical properties such that the implant begins to ‘look and behave’ like neural tissue. Syringe-implanted mesh electronics have led to the realization of probes that are neuro-attractive and free of the chronic immune response, as well as capable of stable long-term mapping and modulation of brain activity at the single-neuron level. This review provides a historical overview of a 10-year development of mesh electronics by highlighting the tissue-like design, syringe-assisted delivery, seamless neural tissue integration, and single-neuron level chronic recording stability of mesh electronics. We also offer insights on unique near-term opportunities and future directions for neuroscience and neurology that now are available or expected for mesh electronics neurotechnologies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

This locomotor network generates the rhythmic output, coordinate left/right alternation, and permit communication across segments. Through evolution, more complex movement patterns have emerged, made possible by sub-specialization of neural populations within the spinal cord. Walking tetrapods use a similar basic circuitry, but have added layers of complexity for the coordination of intralimbic flexor and extensor muscles as well as interlimbic coordination between the body halves and fore/hindlimbs. Although the basics of these circuits are known there is a gap in our knowledge regarding how different speeds and gaits are coordinated. Analysing subpopulations among described neuronal populations may bring insight into how changes in locomotor output are orchestrated by a hard-wired network. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Although clinically different, they share similar molecular features: the accumulation of one or two proteins in abnormal conformations inside or outside neurons. Enhancing protein quality control systems could be a useful strategy to neutralize the abnormal proteins causing neurodegenerative diseases. This review emphasizes the subcellular location of protein deposits in neurodegenerative diseases and the need to tailor strategies aimed at boosting protein quality control systems to the affected subcellular compartment. Inhibition of a protein phosphatase terminating the unfolded protein response will be discussed as a strategy to protect from diseases associated with misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Here, we review the recent increase in our understanding of how synapse type-specific molecules differentially regulate the development of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Moreover, several synapse subtype-specific molecules have been shown to control the targeting, formation or maturation of particular subtypes of excitatory synapses. Because inhibitory neurons are extremely diverse, a similar molecular diversity is likely to underlie the development of different inhibitory synapses making it a promising topic for future investigation in the field of the synapse development. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Yet, a full realization of individual cell lineages remains challenging for complex systems. A recent explosion of technical advances in genome-editing and single-cell sequencing has enabled lineage analysis in an unprecedented scale, speed, and depth across different species. In this review, we discuss the application of available as well as future genetic labeling techniques for tracking neural lineages in vivo in the mammalian nervous system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Recent findings from in vivo and in vitro models of motor neuron development have expanded our understanding of how transcription factors govern motor neuron identity and their individual regulatory mechanisms. With the advent of next generation sequencing approaches, researchers now have unprecedented access to the gene regulatory dynamics involved in motor neuron development and are uncovering new connections linking neurodevelopment and neurodegenerative disease. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Safe propagation of action potentials relies on specific ion channel expression at strategic points of the axon such as nodes of Ranvier or axonal branch points. However, while action potentials are generally considered as the quantum of neuronal information, their signaling is not entirely digital. In fact, both their shape and their conduction speed have been shown to be modulated by activity, leading to regulations of synaptic latency and synaptic strength. We report here newly identified mechanisms of (1) safe spike propagation along the axon, (2) compartmentalization of action potential shape in the axon, (3) analog modulation of spike-evoked synaptic transmission and (4) alteration in conduction time after persistent regulation of axon morphology in central neurons. We discuss the contribution of these regulations in information processing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Recent discoveries have revealed surprising and complex roles of the small area CA2 in hippocampal function. Lesion studies have revealed that this region is required for social memory formation. Area CA2 is targeted by extra-hippocampal paraventricular inputs that release vasopressin and can act to enhance social memory performance. In vivo recordings have revealed nonconventional activity by neurons in this region that act to both initiate hippocampal sharp-wave ripple events as well as encode spatial information during immobility. Silencing of CA2 pyramidal neurons has revealed that this area also acts to control hippocampal network excitability during encoding, and this balance of excitation and inhibition is disrupted in disease. This review summarizes recent findings and attempts to integrate these results into pre-existing models. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Autocrine signals have been discovered in many neuronal contexts, providing insights into their regulation and function. The growing realization of the importance of cell-autonomous signaling stems from advances in both conditional genetic approaches and in sophisticated analyses of growth factor dynamics, which combine to enable rigorous in vivo dissection of signaling pathways. Here we review recent studies defining autocrine roles for growth factors such as BDNF, and classical morphogens, including Wnts and BMPs, in regulating neuronal development and plasticity. Collectively, these studies highlight an intimate relationship between activity-dependent autocrine signaling and synaptic plasticity, and further suggest a common principle for coordinating paracrine and autocrine signaling in the nervous system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

These platforms leverage basic advances in biocompatible materials, semiconductor device designs and systems engineering concepts to afford modes of operation that are qualitatively distinct from those of conventional approaches that tether animals to external hardware by means of optical fibers, electrical cables and/or fluidic tubing. Neuroscience studies that exploit the unique features of these technologies enable insights into neural function through targeted stimulation, inhibition and recording, with spatially and genetically precise manipulation of neural circuit activity.

When synaptic vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, these membranes and the attached proteins are endocytosed and either recycled or degraded. This turnover needs to be tightly regulated in a timely and spatially confined manner. Increasing evidence suggests that these mechanisms do not only serve for the removal of defective synaptic vesicles or structural proteins of the active zone but also contribute to pathways regulating synaptic strength. The corresponding presynaptic autophagy system thus appears also important for synaptic maintenance and plasticity. Exciting new studies provide evidence how the autophagy machinery recognizes and degrades synaptic components and lay the ground to understand how autophagy in the presynaptic compartment contributes to modulation and maintenance of synaptic function. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Canonical Notch Signaling Directs the Fate of Differentiating Neurocompetent Progenitors in the Mammalian Olfactory Epithelium</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/21/5022?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The adult olfactory epithelium (OE) has the remarkable capacity to regenerate fully both neurosensory and non-neuronal cell types after severe epithelial injury. Lifelong persistence of two stem cell populations supports OE regeneration when damaged: the horizontal basal cells (HBCs), dormant and held in reserve; and globose basal cells, a heterogeneous population most of which are actively dividing. Both populations regenerate all cell types of the OE after injury, but the mechanisms underlying neuronal versus non-neuronal lineage commitment after recruitment of the stem cell pools remains unknown. We used both retroviral transduction and mouse lines that permit conditional cell-specific genetic manipulation as well as the tracing of progeny to study the role of canonical &lt;i&gt;Notch&lt;/i&gt; signaling in the determination of neuronal versus non-neuronal lineages in the regenerating adult OE. Excision of either &lt;i&gt;Notch1&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Notch2&lt;/i&gt; genes alone in HBCs did not alter progenitor fate during recovery from epithelial injury, whereas conditional knock-out of both &lt;i&gt;Notch1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Notch2&lt;/i&gt; together, retroviral transduction of progenitors with a dominant-negative form of &lt;i&gt;MAML&lt;/i&gt; (mastermind-like), or excision of the downstream cofactor &lt;i&gt;RBPJ&lt;/i&gt; caused progeny to adopt a neuronal fate exclusively. Conversely, we show that overexpressing the Notch1-intracellular domain (N1ICD) either genetically or by transduction blocks neuronal differentiation completely. However, N1ICD overexpression requires both alleles of the canonical cofactor RBPJ to specify downstream lineage. Together, our results suggest that canonical RBPJ-dependent &lt;i&gt;Notch&lt;/i&gt; signaling through redundant Notch1 and Notch2 receptors is both necessary and sufficient for determining neuronal versus non-neuronal differentiation in the regenerating adult OE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Despite the substantial reconstitution of the olfactory epithelium and its population of sensory neurons after injury, disruption and exhaustion of neurogenesis is a consequence of aging and a cause of olfactory dysfunction. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the generation of replacement neurons and non-neuronal cells is critical to any therapeutic strategy aimed at rebuilding a functional neuroepithelium. The results shown here demonstrate that canonical &lt;i&gt;Notch&lt;/i&gt; signaling determines the balance between neurons and non-neuronal cells during restoration of the epithelium after injury. Moreover, the complexities of the multiple Notch pathways impinging on that decision are dissected in detail. Finally, RBPJ, the canonical Notch transcriptional cofactor, exhibits a heretofore unreported haploinsufficiency in setting the balance among the regenerating populations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Neural Correlates of Hierarchical Predictions for Perceptual Decisions</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/21/5008?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sensory information is inherently noisy, sparse, and ambiguous. In contrast, visual experience is usually clear, detailed, and stable. Bayesian theories of perception resolve this discrepancy by assuming that prior knowledge about the causes underlying sensory stimulation actively shapes perceptual decisions. The CNS is believed to entertain a generative model aligned to dynamic changes in the hierarchical states of our volatile sensory environment. Here, we used model-based fMRI to study the neural correlates of the dynamic updating of hierarchically structured predictions in male and female human observers. We devised a crossmodal associative learning task with covertly interspersed ambiguous trials in which participants engaged in hierarchical learning based on changing contingencies between auditory cues and visual targets. By inverting a Bayesian model of perceptual inference, we estimated individual hierarchical predictions, which significantly biased perceptual decisions under ambiguity. Although &quot;high-level&quot; predictions about the cue–target contingency correlated with activity in supramodal regions such as orbitofrontal cortex and hippocampus, dynamic &quot;low-level&quot; predictions about the conditional target probabilities were associated with activity in retinotopic visual cortex. Our results suggest that our CNS updates distinct representations of hierarchical predictions that continuously affect perceptual decisions in a dynamically changing environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Bayesian theories posit that our brain entertains a generative model to provide hierarchical predictions regarding the causes of sensory information. Here, we use behavioral modeling and fMRI to study the neural underpinnings of such hierarchical predictions. We show that &quot;high-level&quot; predictions about the strength of dynamic cue–target contingencies during crossmodal associative learning correlate with activity in orbitofrontal cortex and the hippocampus, whereas &quot;low-level&quot; conditional target probabilities were reflected in retinotopic visual cortex. Our findings empirically corroborate theorizations on the role of hierarchical predictions in visual perception and contribute substantially to a longstanding debate on the link between sensory predictions and orbitofrontal or hippocampal activity. Our work fundamentally advances the mechanistic understanding of perceptual inference in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Behavioral and Neural Representations of Spatial Directions across Words, Schemas, and Images</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/21/4996?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Modern spatial navigation requires fluency with multiple representational formats, including visual scenes, signs, and words. These formats convey different information. Visual scenes are rich and specific but contain extraneous details. Arrows, as an example of signs, are schematic representations in which the extraneous details are eliminated, but analog spatial properties are preserved. Words eliminate all spatial information and convey spatial directions in a purely abstract form. How does the human brain compute spatial directions within and across these formats? To investigate this question, we conducted two experiments on men and women: a behavioral study that was preregistered and a neuroimaging study using multivoxel pattern analysis of fMRI data to uncover similarities and differences among representational formats. Participants in the behavioral study viewed spatial directions presented as images, schemas, or words (e.g., &quot;left&quot;), and responded to each trial, indicating whether the spatial direction was the same or different as the one viewed previously. They responded more quickly to schemas and words than images, despite the visual complexity of stimuli being matched. Participants in the fMRI study performed the same task but responded only to occasional catch trials. Spatial directions in images were decodable in the intraparietal sulcus bilaterally but were not in schemas and words. Spatial directions were also decodable between all three formats. These results suggest that intraparietal sulcus plays a role in calculating spatial directions in visual scenes, but this neural circuitry may be bypassed when the spatial directions are presented as schemas or words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Human navigators encounter spatial directions in various formats: words (&quot;turn left&quot;), schematic signs (an arrow showing a left turn), and visual scenes (a road turning left). The brain must transform these spatial directions into a plan for action. Here, we investigate similarities and differences between neural representations of these formats. We found that bilateral intraparietal sulci represent spatial directions in visual scenes and across the three formats. We also found that participants respond quickest to schemas, then words, then images, suggesting that spatial directions in abstract formats are easier to interpret than concrete formats. These results support a model of spatial direction interpretation in which spatial directions are either computed for real world action or computed for efficient visual comparison.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Palladin Is a Neuron-Specific Translational Target of mTOR Signaling That Regulates Axon Morphogenesis</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/21/4985?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The mTOR signaling pathway regulates protein synthesis and diverse aspects of neuronal morphology that are important for brain development and function. To identify proteins controlled translationally by mTOR signaling, we performed ribosome profiling analyses in mouse cortical neurons and embryonic stem cells upon acute mTOR inhibition. Among proteins whose translation was significantly affected by mTOR inhibition selectively in neurons, we identified the cytoskeletal regulator protein palladin, which is localized within the cell body and axons in hippocampal neurons. Knockdown of palladin eliminated supernumerary axons induced by suppression of the tuberous sclerosis complex protein TSC1 in neurons, demonstrating that palladin regulates neuronal morphogenesis downstream of mTOR signaling. Our findings provide novel insights into an mTOR-dependent mechanism that controls neuronal morphogenesis through translational regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This study reports the discovery of neuron-specific protein translational responses to alterations of mTOR activity. By using ribosome profiling analysis, which can reveal the location and quantity of translating ribosomes on mRNAs, multiple aspects of protein translation were quantitatively analyzed in mouse embryonic stem cells and cortical neurons upon acute mTOR inhibition. Neurons displayed distinct patterns of ribosome occupancy for each codon and ribosome stalling during translation at specific positions of mRNAs. Importantly, the cytoskeletal regulator palladin was identified as a translational target protein of mTOR signaling in neurons. Palladin operates downstream of mTOR to modulate axon morphogenesis. This study identifies a novel mechanism of neuronal morphogenesis regulated by mTOR signaling through control of translation of the key protein palladin.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Activity in Human Auditory Cortex Represents Spatial Separation Between Concurrent Sounds</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/21/4977?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The primary and posterior auditory cortex (AC) are known for their sensitivity to spatial information, but how this information is processed is not yet understood. AC that is sensitive to spatial manipulations is also modulated by the number of auditory streams present in a scene (Smith et al., 2010), suggesting that spatial and nonspatial cues are integrated for stream segregation. We reasoned that, if this is the case, then it is the distance between sounds rather than their absolute positions that is essential. To test this hypothesis, we measured human brain activity in response to spatially separated concurrent sounds with fMRI at 7 tesla in five men and five women. Stimuli were spatialized amplitude-modulated broadband noises recorded for each participant via in-ear microphones before scanning. Using a linear support vector machine classifier, we investigated whether sound location and/or location plus spatial separation between sounds could be decoded from the activity in Heschl's gyrus and the planum temporale. The classifier was successful only when comparing patterns associated with the conditions that had the largest difference in perceptual spatial separation. Our pattern of results suggests that the representation of spatial separation is not merely the combination of single locations, but rather is an independent feature of the auditory scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Often, when we think of auditory spatial information, we think of where sounds are coming from—that is, the process of localization. However, this information can also be used in scene analysis, the process of grouping and segregating features of a soundwave into objects. Essentially, when sounds are further apart, they are more likely to be segregated into separate streams. Here, we provide evidence that activity in the human auditory cortex represents the spatial separation between sounds rather than their absolute locations, indicating that scene analysis and localization processes may be independent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Temporal Response Properties of Accessory Olfactory Bulb Neurons: Limitations and Opportunities for Decoding</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/21/4957?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The vomeronasal system (VNS) is a major vertebrate chemosensory system that functions in parallel to the main olfactory system (MOS). Despite many similarities, the two systems dramatically differ in the temporal domain. While MOS responses are governed by breathing and follow a subsecond temporal scale, VNS responses are uncoupled from breathing and evolve over seconds. This suggests that the contribution of response dynamics to stimulus information will differ between these systems. While temporal dynamics in the MOS are widely investigated, similar analyses in the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) are lacking. Here, we have addressed this issue using controlled stimulus delivery to the vomeronasal organ of male and female mice. We first analyzed the temporal properties of AOB projection neurons and demonstrated that neurons display prolonged, variable, and neuron-specific characteristics. We then analyzed various decoding schemes using AOB population responses. We showed that compared with the simplest scheme (i.e., integration of spike counts over the entire response period), the division of this period into smaller temporal bins actually yields poorer decoding accuracy. However, optimal classification accuracy can be achieved well before the end of the response period by integrating spike counts within temporally defined windows. Since VNS stimulus uptake is variable, we analyzed decoding using limited information about stimulus uptake time, and showed that with enough neurons, such time-invariant decoding is feasible. Finally, we conducted simulations that demonstrated that, unlike the main olfactory bulb, the temporal features of AOB neurons disfavor decoding with high temporal accuracy, and, rather, support decoding without precise knowledge of stimulus uptake time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; A key goal in sensory system research is to identify which metrics of neuronal activity are relevant for decoding stimulus features. Here, we describe the first systematic analysis of temporal coding in the vomeronasal system (VNS), a chemosensory system devoted to socially relevant cues. Compared with the main olfactory system, timescales of VNS function are inherently slower and variable. Using various analyses of real and simulated data, we show that the consideration of response times relative to stimulus uptake can aid the decoding of stimulus information from neuronal activity. However, response properties of accessory olfactory bulb neurons favor decoding schemes that do not rely on the precise timing of stimulus uptake. Such schemes are consistent with the variable nature of VNS stimulus uptake.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/21/4943?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are pentamers built from a variety of subunits. Some are homomeric assemblies of α subunits, others heteromeric assemblies of α and β subunits which can adopt two stoichiometries (2α:3β or 3α:2β). There is evidence for the presence of heteromeric nAChRs with the two stoichiometries in the CNS, but it has not yet been possible to identify them at a given synapse. The 2α:3β receptors are highly sensitive to agonists, whereas the 3α:2β stoichiometric variants, initially described as low sensitivity receptors, are indeed activated by low and high concentrations of ACh. We have taken advantage of the discovery that two compounds (NS9283 and Zn) potentiate selectively the 3α:2β nAChRs to establish (in mice of either sex) the presence of these variants at the motoneuron-Renshaw cell (MN-RC) synapse. NS9283 prolonged the decay of the two-component EPSC mediated by heteromeric nAChRs. NS9283 and Zn also prolonged spontaneous EPSCs involving heteromeric nAChRs, and one could rule out prolongations resulting from AChE inhibition by NS9283. These results establish the presence of 3α:2β nAChRs at the MN-RC synapse. At the functional level, we had previously explained the duality of the EPSC by assuming that high ACh concentrations in the synaptic cleft account for the fast component and that spillover of ACh accounts for the slow component. The dual ACh sensitivity of 3α:2β nAChRs now allows to attribute to these receptors both components of the EPSC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Heteromeric nicotinic receptors assemble α and β subunits in pentameric structures, which can adopt two stoichiometries: 3α:2β or 2α:3β. Both stoichiometric variants are present in the CNS, but they have never been located and characterized functionally at the level of an identified synapse. Our data indicate that 3α:2β receptors are present at the spinal cord synapses between motoneurons and Renshaw cells, where their dual mode of activation (by high concentrations of ACh for synaptic receptors, by low concentrations of ACh for extrasynaptic receptors) likely accounts for the biphasic character of the synaptic current. More generally, 3α:2β nicotinic receptors appear unique by their capacity to operate both in the cleft of classical synapses and at extrasynaptic locations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Mapping Frequency-Specific Tone Predictions in the Human Auditory Cortex at High Spatial Resolution</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/21/4934?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Auditory inputs reaching our ears are often incomplete, but our brains nevertheless transform them into rich and complete perceptual phenomena such as meaningful conversations or pleasurable music. It has been hypothesized that our brains extract regularities in inputs, which enables us to predict the upcoming stimuli, leading to efficient sensory processing. However, it is unclear whether tone predictions are encoded with similar specificity as perceived signals. Here, we used high-field fMRI to investigate whether human auditory regions encode one of the most defining characteristics of auditory perception: the frequency of predicted tones. Two pairs of tone sequences were presented in ascending or descending directions, with the last tone omitted in half of the trials. Every pair of incomplete sequences contained identical sounds, but was associated with different expectations about the last tone (a high- or low-frequency target). This allowed us to disambiguate predictive signaling from sensory-driven processing. We recorded fMRI responses from eight female participants during passive listening to complete and incomplete sequences. Inspection of specificity and spatial patterns of responses revealed that target frequencies were encoded similarly during their presentations, as well as during omissions, suggesting frequency-specific encoding of predicted tones in the auditory cortex (AC). Importantly, frequency specificity of predictive signaling was observed already at the earliest levels of auditory cortical hierarchy: in the primary AC. Our findings provide evidence for content-specific predictive processing starting at the earliest cortical levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Given the abundance of sensory information around us in any given moment, it has been proposed that our brain uses contextual information to prioritize and form predictions about incoming signals. However, there remains a surprising lack of understanding of the specificity and content of such prediction signaling; for example, whether a predicted tone is encoded with similar specificity as a perceived tone. Here, we show that early auditory regions encode the frequency of a tone that is predicted yet omitted. Our findings contribute to the understanding of how expectations shape sound processing in the human auditory cortex and provide further insights into how contextual information influences computations in neuronal circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Encoding of Serial Order in Working Memory: Neuronal Activity in Motor, Premotor, and Prefrontal Cortex during a Memory Scanning Task</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/21/4912?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We have adapted Sternberg's context-recall task to investigate the neural mechanisms of encoding serial order information in working memory, in 2 male rhesus monkeys. We recorded from primary motor, premotor, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex while the monkeys performed the task. In each cortical area, most neurons displayed marked modulation of activity during the list presentation period of the task, whereas the serial order of the stimuli needed to be encoded in working memory. The activity of many neurons changed in a consistent manner over the course of the list presentation period, without regard to the location of the stimuli presented. Remarkably, these neurons encoded serial position information in a relative (rather than absolute) manner across different list lengths. In addition, many neurons showed activity related to both location and serial position, in the form of an interaction effect. Surprisingly, the activity of these neurons was often modulated by the location of stimuli presented before the epoch in which the activity changes occurred. In motor and premotor areas, a large proportion of neurons with list presentation activity also showed direction-related activity during the response phase, whereas in prefrontal cortex most cells showed only list presentation effects. These results show that many neurons had a heterogeneous functionality by representing distinct task variables at different periods of the task. Finally, potential confounds could not account for the effects observed. For these reasons, we conclude that these neurons were indeed participating in sequence encoding in working memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Traditionally, primary motor, premotor, and prefrontal areas have been considered to be mainly engaged in motor output, visuomotor transformation, and higher cognitive functions, respectively. Here we show that neurons in all three cortical regions participate in the encoding of a sequence of spatial stimuli in working memory. Furthermore, a central question in cognitive neuroscience has been the manner in which the position of an item within a sequence is encoded in the brain. Our findings provide direct neurophysiological support for a specific hypothesis from cognitive psychology: that of relative coding of serial order.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/21/4899?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Pain associated with skeletal pathology or disease is a significant clinical problem, but the mechanisms that generate and/or maintain it remain poorly understood. In this study, we explored roles for GDNF, neurturin, and artemin signaling in bone pain using male Sprague Dawley rats. We have shown that inflammatory bone pain involves activation and sensitization of peptidergic, NGF-sensitive neurons via artemin/GDNF family receptor α-3 (GFRα3) signaling pathways, and that sequestering artemin might be useful to prevent inflammatory bone pain derived from activation of NGF-sensitive bone afferent neurons. In addition, we have shown that inflammatory bone pain also involves activation and sensitization of nonpeptidergic neurons via GDNF/GFRα1 and neurturin/GFRα2 signaling pathways, and that sequestration of neurturin, but not GDNF, might be useful to treat inflammatory bone pain derived from activation of nonpeptidergic bone afferent neurons. Our findings suggest that GDNF family ligand signaling pathways are involved in the pathogenesis of bone pain and could be targets for pharmacological manipulations to treat it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Pain associated with skeletal pathology, including bone cancer, bone marrow edema syndromes, osteomyelitis, osteoarthritis, and fractures causes a major burden (both in terms of quality of life and cost) on individuals and health care systems worldwide. We have shown the first evidence of a role for GDNF, neurturin, and artemin in the activation and sensitization of bone afferent neurons, and that sequestering these ligands reduces pain behavior in a model of inflammatory bone pain. Thus, GDNF family ligand signaling pathways are involved in the pathogenesis of bone pain and could be targets for pharmacological manipulations to treat it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Decomposing Gratitude: Representation and Integration of Cognitive Antecedents of Gratitude in the Brain</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/21/4886?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Gratitude is a typical social-moral emotion that plays a crucial role in maintaining human cooperative interpersonal relationship. Although neural correlates of gratitude have been investigated, the neurocognitive processes that lead to gratitude, namely, the representation and integration of its cognitive antecedents, remain largely unknown. Here, we combined fMRI and a human social interactive task to investigate how benefactor's cost and beneficiary's benefit, two critical antecedents of gratitude, are encoded and integrated in beneficiary's brain, and how the neural processing of gratitude is converted to reciprocity. A coplayer decided whether to help a human participant (either male or female) avoid pain at his/her own monetary cost; the participants could transfer monetary points to the benefactor with the knowledge that the benefactor was unaware of this transfer. By independently manipulating monetary cost and the degree of pain reduction, we could identify the neural signatures of benefactor's cost and recipient's benefit and examine how they were integrated. Recipient's self-benefit was encoded in reward-sensitive regions (e.g., ventral striatum), whereas benefactor-cost was encoded in regions associated with mentalizing (e.g., temporoparietal junction). Gratitude was represented in perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC), the strength of which correlated with trait gratitude. Dynamic causal modeling showed that the neural signals representing benefactor-cost and self-benefit passed to pgACC via effective connectivities, suggesting an integrative role of pgACC in generating gratitude. Moreover, gyral ACC plays an intermediary role in converting gratitude representation into reciprocal behaviors. Our findings provide a neural mechanistic account of gratitude and its role in social-moral life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Gratitude plays an integral role in subjective well-being and harmonious interpersonal relationships. However, the neurocognitive processes through which various components and antecedents of gratitude are integrated remain largely unknown. We developed a new interpersonal paradigm to independently and parametrically manipulate two antecedents of gratitude in a helping context, namely, the benefit to beneficiary and the cost to benefactor, to examine their representation and integration in the beneficiary's brain using fMRI. We found the neural encoding of self-benefit and benefactor-cost in reward- and mentalizing-related brain areas, respectively. More importantly, by examining effective connectivity, we showed that these componential signals are passed to perigenual anterior cingulate cortex, which tracks trial-by-trial gratitude levels. Our study thus provides a neural mechanistic account of gratitude.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Primary Tactile Thalamus Spiking Reflects Cognitive Signals</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/21/4870?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Little is known about whether information transfer at primary sensory thalamic nuclei is modified by behavioral context. Here we studied the influence of previous decisions/rewards on current choices and preceding spike responses of ventroposterior medial thalamus (VPm; the primary sensory thalamus in the rat whisker-related tactile system). We trained head-fixed rats to detect a ramp-like deflection of one whisker interspersed within ongoing white noise stimulation. Using generative modeling of behavior, we identify two task-related variables that are predictive of actual decisions. The first reflects task engagement on a local scale (&quot;trial history&quot;: defined as the decisions and outcomes of a small number of past trials), whereas the other captures behavioral dynamics on a global scale (&quot;satiation&quot;: slow dynamics of the response pattern along an entire session). Although satiation brought about a slow drift from Go to NoGo decisions during the session, trial history was related to local (trial-by-trial) patterning of Go and NoGo decisions. A second model that related the same predictors first to VPm spike responses, and from there to decisions, indicated that spiking, in contrast to behavior, is sensitive to trial history but relatively insensitive to satiation. Trial history influences VPm spike rates and regularity such that a history of Go decisions would predict fewer noise-driven spikes (but more regular ones), and more ramp-driven spikes. Neuronal activity in VPm, thus, is sensitive to local behavioral history, and may play an important role in higher-order cognitive signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; It is an important question for perceptual and brain functions to find out whether cognitive signals modulate the sensory signal stream and if so, where in the brain this happens. This study provides evidence that decision and reward history can already be reflected in the ascending sensory pathway, on the level of first-order sensory thalamus. Cognitive signals are relayed very selectively such that only local trial history (spanning a few trials) but not global history (spanning an entire session) are reflected.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Drift in Neural Population Activity Causes Working Memory to Deteriorate Over Time</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/21/4859?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Short-term memories are thought to be maintained in the form of sustained spiking activity in neural populations. Decreases in recall precision observed with increasing number of memorized items can be accounted for by a limit on total spiking activity, resulting in fewer spikes contributing to the representation of each individual item. Longer retention intervals likewise reduce recall precision, but it is unknown what changes in population activity produce this effect. One possibility is that spiking activity becomes attenuated over time, such that the same mechanism accounts for both effects of set size and retention duration. Alternatively, reduced performance may be caused by drift in the encoded value over time, without a decrease in overall spiking activity. Human participants of either sex performed a variable-delay cued recall task with a saccadic response, providing a precise measure of recall latency. Based on a spike integration model of decision making, if the effects of set size and retention duration are both caused by decreased spiking activity, we would predict a fixed relationship between recall precision and response latency across conditions. In contrast, the drift hypothesis predicts no systematic changes in latency with increasing delays. Our results show both an increase in latency with set size, and a decrease in response precision with longer delays within each set size, but no systematic increase in latency for increasing delay durations. These results were quantitatively reproduced by a model based on a limited neural resource in which working memories drift rather than decay with time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Rapid deterioration over seconds is a defining feature of short-term memory, but what mechanism drives this degradation of internal representations? Here, we extend a successful population coding model of working memory by introducing possible mechanisms of delay effects. We show that a decay in neural signal over time predicts that the time required for memory retrieval will increase with delay, whereas a random drift in the stored value predicts no effect of delay on retrieval time. Testing these predictions in a multi-item memory task with an eye movement response, we identified drift as a key mechanism of memory decline. These results provide evidence for a dynamic spiking basis for working memory, in contrast to recent proposals of activity-silent storage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dopamine Triggers CTCF-Dependent Morphological and Genomic Remodeling of Astrocytes</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/21/4846?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dopamine is critical for processing of reward and etiology of drug addiction. Astrocytes throughout the brain express dopamine receptors, but consequences of astrocytic dopamine receptor signaling are not well established. We found that extracellular dopamine triggered rapid concentration-dependent stellation of astrocytic processes that was not a result of dopamine oxidation but instead relied on both cAMP-dependent and cAMP-independent dopamine receptor signaling. This was accompanied by reduced duration and increased frequency of astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients, but little effect on astrocytic voltage-gated potassium channel currents. To isolate possible mechanisms underlying these structural and functional changes, we used whole-genome RNA sequencing and found prominent dopamine-induced enrichment of genes containing the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) motif, suggesting involvement of chromatin restructuring in the nucleus. CTCF binding to promoter sites bidirectionally regulates gene transcription and depends on activation of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1). Accordingly, antagonism of PARP1 occluded dopamine-induced changes, whereas a PARP1 agonist facilitated dopamine-induced changes on its own. These results indicate that astrocyte response to elevated dopamine involves PARP1-mediated CTCF genomic restructuring and concerted expression of gene networks. Our findings propose epigenetic regulation of chromatin landscape as a critical factor in the rapid astrocyte response to dopamine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Although dopamine is widely recognized for its role in modulating neuronal responses both in healthy and disease states, little is known about dopamine effects at non-neuronal cells in the brain. To address this gap, we performed whole-genome sequencing of astrocytes exposed to elevated extracellular dopamine and combined it with evaluation of effects on astrocyte morphology and function. We demonstrate a temporally dynamic pattern of genomic plasticity that triggers pronounced changes in astrocyte morphology and function. We further show that this plasticity depends on activation of genes sensitive to DNA-binding protein CTCF. Our results propose that a broad pattern of astrocyte responses to dopamine specifically relies on CTCF-dependent gene networks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this study, and through an understanding of neuronal system communication,
A light was shed upon a novel model serves as an assistive technology for
locked-in people suffering from Motor neuronal disease. MND patients, who have
an intact minds, are able -till now- to make a mean of on-screen communication.
Work was done upon the potential of brain wave activity patterns to be detected
as electrical signals, classified and translated into commands following BCI
constructing paradigm. However, The interface constructed was for the first
time a device which can reconstruct this command physically. The intervention
is in a software is used to classify imagined right and left limb movement into
binary results, and then make use of the magnetic field produced by the
amplified pulses to reconstruct the activity into ferrofluid droplets movement-
these moved due rotation of a desk according to the data received. Objectives
of the project is to address the challenges of the inaccurate performance and
cost of user-training which are yet the main issues preventing BCI from being
upgraded into more immersive and effective technology. The design requirements
addressed were the communication speed of the droplet movement and the accuracy
of hitting fixed targets . Tests were performed based on software programs
accelerated changing motor imagery movement of left and right limbs. The tests
achieved an average speed of 0.469 cm/s and average accuracy of 81.6% for the
best volume from many were tried. A conclusion to be drawn was that the promise
of this other point of view on BCI systems to be more Brain-Real World Systems.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: CARE-rCortex: a Matlab toolbox for the analysis of CArdio-REspiratory-related activity in the Cortex. (arXiv:1805.08646v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08646</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Although cardio-respiratory (CR) system is generally controlled
by the autonomic nervous system, interactions between the cortex and these
primary functions are receiving an increasing research interest. New method: In
general, the timing of such internally paced events (e.g. heartbeats or
respiratory cycles) may display a large variability. For the analysis of such
CR event-related EEG potentials, a baseline must be correctly associated to
each cycle of detected events. The open-source toolbox CARE-rCortex provides an
easy-to-use interface to detect CR events, define baselines, and analyse in
time-frequency (TF) domain the EEG potentials. Results: CARE-rCortex provides
some practical tools for the detection and the manual validation of CR events.
These events allow to define baselines time-locked to a phase of respiratory or
heart cycles. A statistical test has also been integrated to highlight
significant points of the TF maps with respect to the baseline. We illustrate
the use of the toolbox with the analysis of two real cardio-respiratory
datasets. Comparison with existing methods: Compared to other open-source
toolboxes, CARE-rCortex allows to automatically detect CR events, to define and
check baselines for each detected event. Different baseline normalizations can
be used in the TF analysis of EEG epochs. Conclusions: The analysis of
CR-related EEG activities could provide valuable information about cognitive or
pathological brain states. CARE-rCortex provides an efficient and automatic
detection of CR events for a posterior analysis of event-related EEG
activities. CARE-rCortex runs in Matlab as a plug-in of the EEGLAB software,
and it is publicly available at https://github.com/FannyGrosselin/CARE-rCortex.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08626</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the complexity of biological neural networks like the human
brain is one of the scientific challenges of our century. The organization of
the brain can be described at different levels, ranging from small neural
networks to entire brain regions. Existing methods for the description of
functionally or effective connectivity are based on the analysis of relations
between the activities of different neural units by detecting correlations or
information flow. This is a crucial step in understanding neural disorders like
Alzheimers disease and their causative factors. To evaluate these estimation
methods, it is necessary to refer to a neural network with known connectivity,
which is typically unknown for natural biological neural networks. Therefore,
network simulations, also in silico, are available. In this work, the in silico
simulation of large scale neural networks is established and the influence of
different topologies on the generated patterns of neuronal signals is
investigated. The goal is to develop standard evaluation methods for
neurocomputational algorithms with a realistic large scale model to enable
benchmarking and comparability of different studies.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Optimizing state change detection in functional temporal networks through dynamic community detection. (arXiv:1805.08286v1 [physics.soc-ph])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08286</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dynamic community detection provides a coherent description of network
clusters over time, allowing one to track the growth and death of communities
as the network evolves. However, modularity maximization, a popular method for
performing multilayer community detection, requires the specification of an
appropriate null model as well as resolution and interlayer coupling
parameters. Importantly, the ability of the algorithm to accurately detect
community evolution is dependent on the choice of these parameters. In
functional temporal networks, where evolving communities reflect changing
functional relationships between network nodes, it is especially important that
the detected communities reflect any state changes of the system. Here, we
present analytical work suggesting that a uniform null model provides improved
sensitivity to the detection of small evolving communities in temporal
correlation networks. We then propose a method for increasing the sensitivity
of modularity maximization to state changes in nodal dynamics by modeling
self-identity links between layers based on the self-similarity of the network
nodes between layers. This method is more appropriate for functional temporal
networks from both a modeling and mathematical perspective, as it incorporates
the dynamic nature of network nodes. We motivate our method based on
applications in neuroscience where network nodes represent neurons and
functional edges represent similarity of firing patterns in time. Finally, we
show that in simulated data sets of neuronal spike trains, updating interlayer
links based on the firing properties of the neurons provides superior community
detection of evolving network structure when group of neurons change their
firing properties over time.

benchmarks for simple models of the brain, and 4) serving itself as a model for
the brain. The breadth and ease of its applicability suggests that machine
learning should be in the toolbox of most systems neuroscientists.

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Preterm birth is the greatest risk factor for lifelong neurocognitive deficits, globally. The effect of prematurity on early cortical network function has, however, remained poorly understood. Here, we developed a novel methodology that allows reliable assessment of functional connectivity in neonatal brain activity at millisecond and multisecond scales in terms of cortical phase and amplitude correlations, respectively. We measured scalp electroencephalography at term-equivalent age in infants exposed to very early prematurity as well as in healthy controls. We found that newborn cortical activity organizes into multiplex networks that differ significantly between vigilance states. As compared with healthy control infants, prematurity was found to cause frequency-specific patterns of dysconnectivity in cortical network, changes that were distinct for networks of phase and amplitude correlations. Neuroanatomically, the most prominent markers of prematurity were found in connections involving the frontal regions. Phase synchrony in frontally connected networks was correlated with newborn neurological performance, suggesting the first measure of cortical functional coupling that correlates with neurological performance in human infant.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The present work shows that the maximum-entropy method can be applied to a sample of neuronal recordings along two different routes: (1) apply to the sample; or (2) apply to a larger, unsampled neuronal population from which the sample is drawn, and then marginalize to the sample. These two routes give inequivalent results. The second route can be further generalized to the case where the size of the larger population is unknown. Which route should be chosen? Some arguments are presented in favour of the second. This work also presents and discusses probability formulae that relate states of knowledge about a population and its samples, and that may be useful for sampling problems in neuroscience.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/329185v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The olfactory piriform cortex is thought to participate in olfactory associative memory. Like the hippocampus, which is essential for episodic memory, it belongs to an evolutionally conserved paleocortex and comprises a three-layered cortical structure. During slow-wave sleep, the olfactory piriform cortex becomes less responsive to external odor stimuli and instead displays sharp wave (SPW) activity similar to that observed in the hippocampus. Neural activity patterns during hippocampal SPW have been intensively studied in terms of memory consolidation; however, little is known about the activity patterns of olfactory cortical neurons during olfactory cortex sharp waves (OC-SPWs). In this study, we recorded multi-unit neural activities in the anterior piriform cortex in urethane-anesthetized mice. We found that the activity patterns of olfactory cortical neurons during OC-SPWs were non-randomly organized. Individual olfactory cortical neurons varied in the timings of their peak firing rates during OC-SPW events. Moreover, specific pairs of olfactory cortical neurons were more frequently activated together than expected by chance. On the basis of these observations, we speculate that coordinated activation of specific subsets of olfactory cortical neurons repeats during OC-SPWs, thereby facilitating synaptic plasticity underlying the consolidation of olfactory associative memories.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background: The OPRM1 A118G gene variant (N40D) encoding the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) has been associated with dependence on opiates and other abused drugs but its mechanism is unknown. With opioid abuse-related deaths rising at unprecedented rates, understanding these mechanisms may provide a path to therapy. Methods: Seven human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell lines from homozygous N40D subjects (4 with N40 and 3 with D40 variants) were generated and human induced neuronal cells (iNs) were derived from these iPS cell lines. Morphological, gene expression as well as synaptic physiology analyses were conducted in human iN cells carrying N40D MOR variants; Two pairs of isogenic pluripotent stem cells carrying N40D were generated using CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing and iN cells derived from them were analyzed. Results: Inhibitory human neurons generated from subjects carrying N40D MOR gene variants show mature properties in morphological and functional analyses. Gene expression revealed that they express mature neuronal marker and MORs. Activation of MORs suppressed inhibitory synaptic transmission in human neurons carrying both N40 or D40 MOR variants but D40 show stronger effects. To mitigate the confounding effects of background genetic variation on neuronal function, the regulatory effects of MORs on synaptic transmission were validated in two sets of independently generated isogenic N40D iNs. Conclusions: Activations of N40D MOR variants show different regulatory effects on synaptic transmission in inhibitory human neurons. This study identifies neurophysiological differences between human MOR variants that may predict altered opioid responsivity and/or dependence in this subset of individuals.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Exploratory noise governs both flexibility and spontaneous errors and is regulated by cocaine</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/328872v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In many cognitive processes, lapses (spontaneous errors) are attributed to nuisance processes like sensorimotor noise or disengagement. However, some lapses could also be caused by exploratory noise: behavioral randomness that facilitates learning in changing environments. If so, strategic processes would need only up-regulate (rather than generate) exploration to adapt to a changing environment. This view predicts that lapse rates should be correlated with flexibility because they share a common cause. We report that when macaques performed a set-shifting task, lapse rates were negatively correlated with perseverative error frequency. Furthermore, chronic exposure to cocaine, which impairs cognitive flexibility, increased perseverative errors, but, surprisingly, improved overall performance by reducing lapse rates. We reconcile these results with a model in which cocaine decreased exploration by deepening attractor basins corresponding to rules. These results support the idea that exploratory noise contributes to lapses, meaning that it affects rule-based decision-making even when it has no strategic value.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/328849v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Neuroscience studies of human decision-making abilities commonly involve subjects completing a decision-making task while BOLD signals are recorded using fMRI. Hypotheses are tested about which brain regions mediate the effect of past experience, such as rewards, on future actions. One standard approach to this is model-based fMRI data analysis, in which a model is fitted to the behavioral data, i.e., a subject's choices, and then the neural data are parsed to find brain regions whose BOLD signals are related to the model's internal signals. However, the internal mechanics of such purely behavioral models are not constrained by the neural data, and therefore might miss or mischaracterize aspects of the brain. To address this limitation, we introduce a new method using recurrent neural network models that are flexible enough to be fitted jointly to the behavioral and neural data. We trained a model so that its internal states were suitably related to neural activity during the task, while at the same time its output predicted the next action a subject would execute. We then used the fitted model to create a novel visualization of the relationship between the activity in brain regions at different times following a reward and the choices the subject subsequently made. Finally, we validated our method using a previously published dataset. We showed that the model was able to recover the underlying neural substrates that were discovered by explicit model engineering in the previous work, and also derived new results regarding the temporal pattern of brain activity.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Heterocellular coupling between amacrine cell and ganglion cells</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/328815v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>All superclasses of retinal neurons display some form of electrical coupling including the key neurons of the inner plexiform layer: bipolar cells (BCs), amacrine or axonal cells (ACs) and ganglion cells (GCs). However, coupling varies extensively by class. For example, mammalian rod bipolar cells form no gap junctions at all, while all cone bipolar cells form class-specific coupling arrays, many of them homocellular in-superclass arrays. Ganglion cells are unique in that classes with coupling predominantly form heterocellular cross-class arrays of ganglion cell to amacrine cell (GC::AC) coupling in the mammalian retina. Ganglion cells are the least frequent superclass in the inner plexiform layer and GC::AC gap junctions are sparsely arrayed amidst massive cohorts of AC::AC, bipolar cell BC::BC, and AC::BC gap junctions. Many of these gap junctions and most ganglion cell gap junctions are suboptical, complicating analysis. High resolution 2 nm transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of rabbit retinal connectome RC1 allows quantitative GC::AC coupling maps of identified ganglion cells. Ganglion cell classes apparently avoid direct cross-class homocellular coupling altogether even though they have opportunities via direct membrane touches, while transient OFF alpha ganglion cells and transient ON directionally selective (DS) ganglion cells are strongly coupled to distinct amacrine / axonal cell cohorts. A key feature of ganglion cell coupling is intercellular metabolite flux. Most GC::AC coupling involves GABAergic cells ({gamma}+ amacrine cells), which results in significant GABA flux into ganglion cells. Surveying GABA coupling signatures in the ganglion cell layer across species suggests that the majority of vertebrate retinas engage in GC::YAC coupling. Multi-hop synaptic queries of the entire RC1 connectome clearly profiles the coupled amacrine and axonal cells. Photic drive polarities and source bipolar cell class selectivities are tightly matched across coupled cells. OFF alpha ganglion cells are coupled to OFF {gamma}+ amacrine cells and transient ON DS ganglion cells are coupled to ON {gamma}+ amacrine cells including a large interstitial axonal cell (IAC). Synaptic tabulations show close matches between the classes of bipolar cells sampled by the coupled amacrine and ganglion cells. Further, both ON and OFF coupling ganglion networks show a common theme: synaptic asymmetry whereby the coupled {gamma}+ neurons are also presynaptic to ganglion cell dendrites from different classes of ganglion cells outside the coupled set. In effect, these heterocellular coupling patterns enable an excited ganglion cell to directly inhibit nearby ganglion cells of different classes. Similarly, coupled {gamma}+ amacrine cells engaged in feedback networks can leverage the additional gain of bipolar cell synapses in shaping the signaling of a spectrum of downstream targets based on their own selective coupling with ganglion cells.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/328567v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>One-sided t-tests are widely used in neuroimaging data analysis. While such a test may be applicable when investigating specific regions and prior information about directionality is present, we argue here that it is often mis-applied, with severe consequences for false positive rate (FPR) control. Conceptually, a pair of one-sided t-tests conducted in tandem (e.g., to test separately for both positive and negative effects), effectively amounts to a two-sided t-test. However, replacing the two-sided test with a pair of one-sided tests without multiple comparisons correction essentially doubles the intended FPR of statements made about the same study; that is, the actual family-wise error (FWE) of results at the whole brain level would be 10% instead of the 5% intended by the researcher. Therefore, we strongly recommend that, unless otherwise explicitly justified, two-sided t-tests be applied instead of two simultaneous one-sided t-tests.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The transition from adolescence into adulthood is a period where rapid brain development coincides with a greatly enhanced incidence of psychiatric disorder. The precise developmental brain changes that might account for this emergent psychiatric symptomatology remains obscure. Capitalising on a unique longitudinal dataset, that includes in-vivo myelin-sensitive magnetization transfer (MT) MRI, we show this transition period is characterised by brain-wide growth in MT, within both gray matter and adjacent juxta-cortical white matter. The expression of common developmental psychiatric risk symptomatology in this otherwise healthy population, namely compulsivity and impulsivity, was tied to regionally specific aberrant unfolding of these MT trajectories. This was most marked in superior frontal/cingulate cortex for compulsivity, and in inferior frontal/insular cortex for impulsivity. The findings highlight a brain developmental linkage for emergent psychiatric risk features, evident in regionally specific perturbations in the expansion of MT-related myelination.</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Uncovering Neuronal Networks Defined by Consistent Between-Neuron Spike Timing from Neuronal Spike Recordings</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/3/ENEURO.0379-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;It is widely assumed that distributed neuronal networks are fundamental to the functioning of the brain. Consistent spike timing between neurons is thought to be one of the key principles for the formation of these networks. This can involve synchronous spiking or spiking with time delays, forming spike sequences when the order of spiking is consistent. Finding networks defined by their sequence of time-shifted spikes, denoted here as spike timing networks, is a tremendous challenge. As neurons can participate in multiple spike sequences at multiple between-spike time delays, the possible complexity of networks is prohibitively large. We present a novel approach that is capable of (1) extracting spike timing networks regardless of their sequence complexity, and (2) that describes their spiking sequences with high temporal precision. We achieve this by decomposing frequency-transformed neuronal spiking into separate networks, characterizing each network’s spike sequence by a time delay per neuron, forming a spike sequence timeline. These networks provide a detailed template for an investigation of the experimental relevance of their spike sequences. Using simulated spike timing networks, we show network extraction is robust to spiking noise, spike timing jitter, and partial occurrences of the involved spike sequences. Using rat multineuron recordings, we demonstrate the approach is capable of revealing real spike timing networks with sub-millisecond temporal precision. By uncovering spike timing networks, the prevalence, structure, and function of complex spike sequences can be investigated in greater detail, allowing us to gain a better understanding of their role in neuronal functioning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/3/ENEURO.0038-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The precise nature of the engram, the physical substrate of memory, remains uncertain. Here, it is reported that RNA extracted from the central nervous system of &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt; given long-term sensitization (LTS) training induced sensitization when injected into untrained animals; furthermore, the RNA-induced sensitization, like training-induced sensitization, required DNA methylation. In cellular experiments, treatment with RNA extracted from trained animals was found to increase excitability in sensory neurons, but not in motor neurons, dissociated from naïve animals. Thus, the behavioral, and a subset of the cellular, modifications characteristic of a form of nonassociative long-term memory (LTM) in &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt; can be transferred by RNA. These results indicate that RNA is sufficient to generate an engram for LTS in &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt; and are consistent with the hypothesis that RNA-induced epigenetic changes underlie memory storage in &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: dSTIM and Ral/Exocyst Mediated Synaptic Release from Pupal Dopaminergic Neurons Sustains Drosophila Flight</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0455-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Manifestation of appropriate behaviour in adult animals requires developmental mechanisms that help in the formation of correctly wired neural circuits. Flight circuit development in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; requires Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) through the STIM/Orai pathway. SOCE-associated flight deficits in adult &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; derive extensively from regulation of gene expression in pupal neurons, and one such SOCE-regulated gene encodes the small GTPase &lt;i&gt;Ral&lt;/i&gt;. The cellular mechanism by which Ral helps in maturation of the flight circuit was not understood. Here, we show that knockdown of components of a Ral effector, the exocyst complex, in pupal neurons also leads to reduced flight bout durations, and this phenotype derives primarily from dopaminergic neurons. Importantly, synaptic release from pupal dopaminergic neurons is abrogated upon knockdown of either dSTIM, Ral or exocyst components. &lt;i&gt;Ral&lt;/i&gt; overexpression restores the diminished synaptic release of &lt;i&gt;dStim&lt;/i&gt; knockdown neurons as well as flight deficits associated with &lt;i&gt;dSTIM&lt;/i&gt; knockdown in dopaminergic neurons. These results identify Ral mediated vesicular release as an effector mechanism of neuronal SOCE in pupal dopaminergic neurons with functional consequences on flight behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Appropriate wiring of neuronal circuits during development is essential for adult behavior and cellular mechanisms such as calcium signaling orchestrate the pattern and strength of such neuronal connections to a significant extent. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, flight behavior impacts multiple aspects of life. Calcium, especially through the Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) pathway, regulates gene expression during flight circuit maturation. &lt;i&gt;Ral,&lt;/i&gt; encodes a small GTPase, and is one such SOCE-regulated gene required for &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; flight. In this paper, we show that SOCE-related loss of flight is determined to a significant extent by Ral and the exocyst complex driven synaptic vesicle release in pupal dopaminergic neurons. Thus, SOCE regulated release of dopamine ensures correct wiring of the flight circuit in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Dynamic Interactions between Emotion Perception, Action Perception, and Action Preparation Areas for Reacting to Social Threat: A Combined cTBS-fMRI Study</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0408-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Expressions of emotion are powerful triggers for situation-appropriate responses by the observer. Of particular interest regarding the preparation of such adaptive actions are parietal and premotor cortices, given their connectivity with the amygdala (AMG), known to play a crucial role in processing of affective information and in motor response. We set out to disentangle the respective roles of the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and ventral premotor cortex (PMv) in humans in the processing of emotional body expressions by assessing remote effects of continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) in the action network and in AMG. Participants were presented with blocks of short videos showing either angry or neutral whole body actions. The experiment consisted of three fMRI sessions; two preceded by stimulation of either right IPL or PMv, and a third session assessed baseline activity. Interestingly, whereas at baseline the lAMG did not differentiate between neutral and angry body postures, a significant difference between these conditions emerged after stimulation of either rIPL or rPMv, with much larger responses to angry than neutral stimuli. In addition, effects of cTBS stimulation and emotion were also observed in two other action relevant areas, the supplementary motor area and the superior parietal cortex. Together, these results show how areas involved in action and emotion perception and in action preparation interact dynamically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; When confronted with social threat, the brain must prepare situation-adaptive responses. Previous studies have shown that IPL and PMv are critically involved in social threat perception and that amygdala is triggered by emotional valence of the stimuli. So far, the causal relation between IPL, PMv and amygdala is not clear. By combining cTBS with fMRI, we show that stimulation of IPL and PMv induces significant differences between perception of angry versus neutral bodies in amygdala. Furthermore, stimulation of these areas led to significant interaction effects between the emotion presented and site stimulated in a number of remote parietal and motor areas. Our findings demonstrate involvement of IPL and PMv in emotion body processing, and interaction between these areas and with the amygdala during this process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0175-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Interconnections between the olfactory bulb and the amygdala are a major pathway for triggering strong behavioral responses to a variety of odorants. However, while this broad mapping has been established, the patterns of amygdala feedback connectivity and the influence on olfactory circuitry remain unknown. Here, using a combination of neuronal tracing approaches, we dissect the connectivity of a cortical amygdala (PmCo) feedback circuit innervating the mouse accessory olfactory bulb (AOB). Optogenetic activation of PmCo feedback mainly results in feed-forward mitral cell (MC) inhibition through direct excitation of GABAergic granule cells (GC). In addition, LED-driven activity of corticofugal afferents increases the gain of MC responses to olfactory nerve stimulation. Thus, through corticofugal pathways, the PmCo likely regulates primary olfactory and social odor processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Olfactory inputs are relayed directly through the amygdala to hypothalamic and limbic system nuclei regulating essential responses in the context of social behavior. However, it is not clear whether and how amygdala circuits participate in the earlier steps of olfactory processing at the level of the olfactory bulb. Unraveling the organization of this circuitry is critical to understand the function of amygdala circuits. Combining cre-dependent viral tracing with optogenetic-assisted patch clamp electrophysiology, the present work maps the synaptic connectivity and physiology of a cortical amygdala pathway innervating primary olfactory circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08091</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The segregation of image parts into foreground and background is an important
aspect of the neural computation of 3D scene perception. To achieve such
segregation, the brain needs information about border ownership; that is, the
belongingness of a contour to a specific surface represented in the image. This
article presents psychophysical data derived from 3D percepts of figure and
ground that were generated by presenting 2D images composed of spatially
disjoint shapes that pointed inward or outward relative to the continuous
boundaries that they induced along their collinear edges. The shapes in some
images had the same contrast (black or white) with respect to the background
gray. Other images included opposite contrasts along each induced continuous
boundary. Psychophysical results show that figure vs ground judgment
probabilities in response to these ambiguous displays are determined by the
orientation of contrasts only, not by their relative contrasts, despite the
fact that many border ownership cells in cortical area V2 respond to a
preferred relative contrast. The FACADE and 3D LAMINART models are used to
explain these data.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07661</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Power-law-shaped avalanche-size distributions are widely used to probe for
critical behavior in many different systems, particularly in neural networks.
The definition of avalanche is ambiguous. Usually, theoretical avalanches are
defined as the activity between a stimulus and the relaxation to an inactive
absorbing state. On the other hand, experimental neuronal avalanches are
defined by the activity between consecutive silent states. We claim that the
latter definition may be extended to some theoretical models to characterize
their power-law avalanches and critical behavior. We study a system in which
the separation of driving and relaxation time scales emerges from its
structure. We apply both definitions of avalanche to our model. Both yield
power-law-distributed avalanches that scale with system size in the critical
point as expected. Nevertheless, we find restricted power-law-distributed
avalanches outside of the critical region within the experimental procedure,
which is not expected by the standard theoretical definition. We remark that
these results are dependent on the model details.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07569</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Making an informed, correct and quick decision can be life-saving. It's
crucial for animals during an escape behaviour or for autonomous cars during
driving. The decision can be complex and may involve an assessment of the
amount of threats present and the nature of each threat. Thus, we should expect
early sensory processing to supply classification information fast and
accurately, even before relying the information to higher brain areas or more
complex system components downstream. Today, advanced convolution artificial
neural networks can successfully solve such tasks and are commonly used to
build complex decision making systems. However, in order to achieve excellent
performance on these tasks they require increasingly complex, &quot;very deep&quot; model
structure, which is costly in inference run-time, energy consumption and
training samples, only trainable on cloud-computing clusters. A single spiking
neuron has been shown to be able to solve many of these required tasks for
homogeneous Poisson input statistics, a commonly used model for spiking
activity in the neocortex; when modeled as leaky integrate and fire with
gradient decent learning algorithm it was shown to posses a wide variety of
complex computational capabilities. Here we improve its learning algorithm. We
also account for more natural stimulus generated inputs that deviate from this
homogeneous Poisson spiking. The improved gradient-based local learning rule
allows for significantly better and stable generalization and more efficient
performance. We finally apply our model to a problem of multiple instance
learning with counting where labels are only available for collections of
concepts. In this counting MNIST task the neuron exploits the improved
algorithm and succeeds while out performing the previously introduced single
neuron learning algorithm as well as conventional ConvNet architecture under
similar conditions.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Cellular function given parametric variation: excitability in the Hodgkin-Huxley model. (arXiv:1805.07528v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07528</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;How is reliable physiological function maintained in cells despite
considerable variability in the values of key parameters of multiple
interacting processes that govern that function? Here we use the classic
Hodgkin-Huxley formulation of the squid giant axon action potential to propose
a possible approach to this problem. Although the full Hodgkin-Huxley model is
very sensitive to fluctuations that independently occur in its many parameters,
the outcome is in fact determined by simple combinations of these parameters
along two physiological dimensions: Structural and Kinetic (denoted $S$ and
$K$). Structural parameters describe the properties of the cell, including its
capacitance and the densities of its ion channels. Kinetic parameters are those
that describe the opening and closing of the voltage-dependent conductances.
The impacts of parametric fluctuations on the dynamics of the system, seemingly
complex in the high dimensional representation of the Hodgkin-Huxley model, are
tractable when examined within the $S-K$ plane. We demonstrate that slow
inactivation, a ubiquitous activity-dependent feature of ionic channels, is a
powerful local homeostatic control mechanism that stabilizes excitability amid
changes in structural and kinetic parameters.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Small Animal Multivariate Brain Analysis (SAMBA): A High Throughput Pipeline with a Validation Framework. (arXiv:1709.10483v2 [q-bio.QM] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.10483</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;While many neuroscience questions aim to understand the human brain, much
current knowledge has been gained using animal models, which replicate genetic,
structural, and connectivity aspects of the human brain. While voxel-based
analysis (VBA) of preclinical magnetic resonance images is widely-used, a
thorough examination of the statistical robustness, stability, and error rates
is hindered by high computational demands of processing large arrays, and the
many parameters involved. Thus, workflows are often based on intuition or
experience, while preclinical validation studies remain scarce. To increase
throughput and reproducibility of quantitative small animal brain studies, we
have developed a publicly shared, high throughput VBA pipeline in a
high-performance computing environment, called SAMBA. The increased
computational efficiency allowed large multidimensional arrays to be processed
in 1-3 days, a task that previously took ~1 month. To quantify the variability
and reliability of preclinical VBA in rodent models, we propose a validation
framework consisting of morphological phantoms, and four metrics. This
addresses several sources that impact VBA results, including registration and
template construction strategies. We have used this framework to inform the VBA
workflow parameters in a VBA study for a mouse model of epilepsy. We also
present initial efforts towards standardizing small animal neuroimaging data in
a similar fashion with human neuroimaging. We conclude that verifying the
accuracy of VBA merits attention, and should be the focus of a broader effort
within the community. The proposed framework promotes consistent quality
assurance of VBA in preclinical neuroimaging; facilitating the creation and
communication of robust results.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Patterns and perceptions of cannabis use with physical activity</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/328732v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background and Aims: Past research has shown that cannabis use is common among adults in the U.S. In addition, physical activity (PA), such as exercise, is often a component of many American's daily routines. Anecdotal information suggests that a subset of individuals use cannabis in conjunction with PA, but the evidence base is lacking. The purpose of this study was to assess the frequency, methods of ingestion, strain types, and timing (before, during or after) of cannabis use in combination with PA. We also sought to better understand the types of PA that cannabis is being used with and reasons why individuals may use cannabis with PA. Methods and Results: A brief survey was developed and was administered online to community residents (N = 105) who reported use of cannabis with PA. Analysis of survey responses revealed that participants were using cannabis in combination with a wide range of physical activities. While cannabis use was reported before, during, and after PA, the majority of participants (92%) reported use of cannabis before PA. Most participants (77%) believed that the use of cannabis products with their PA had a positive effect on their performance. The strain of cannabis used with PA was dependent on timing of cannabis use before, during, or after PA. Although participants reported a range of reasons for using cannabis before, during, or after PA, pain management was the only reason reported across all time periods. Conclusions: Findings from this study suggest that there is a sub-community of physically active individuals using cannabis with their PA, many who believe that cannabis use has a positive effect on their performance.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/328682v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Most neurons in the brain transmit information digitally using sequences of spikes that trigger release of synaptic vesicles of fixed size. The first stages of vision and hearing are distinct in operating with analogue signals, but it is unclear how these are recoded for synaptic transmission. By imaging the release of glutamate in live zebrafish, we demonstrate how ribbon synapses of retinal bipolar cells transmit analogue visual signals by changes in both the rate and amplitude of synaptic events. Higher contrasts released glutamate packets composed of more vesicles and coding by amplitude often continued after rate coding had saturated. Glutamate packets equivalent to five vesicles transmitted four times as many bits of information per vesicle compared to independent release events. By discretizing analogue signals into sequences of numbers ranging up to eleven, ribbon synapses increase the dynamic range, temporal precision and efficiency with which visual information is transmitted.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The Roles of Different Spatial Frequency Channels in Real-World Visual Motion Perception</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/328443v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Speed perception is an important task performed by our visual system in various daily life tasks. In various psychophysical tests, relationship between spatial frequency, temporal frequency, and speed has been examined in human subjects. The role of vision impairment in speed perception has also been previously examined. In this work, we examine the inter-relationship between speed, spatial frequency, low vision conditions, and the type of input motion stimuli in motion perception accuracy. For this purpose, we propose a computational model for speed perception and evaluate it in custom generated natural and stochastic sequences by simulating low-vision conditions (low pass filtering at different cutoff frequencies) as well as complementary vision conditions (high pass versions at the same cutoff frequencies). Our results show that low frequency components are critical for accurate speed perception, whereas high frequencies do not play any important role in speed estimation. Since perception of low frequencies may not be impaired in visual acuity loss, speed perception was not found to be impaired in low vision conditions compared to normal vision condition. We also report significant differences between natural and stochastic stimuli, notably an increase in speed estimation error when using stochastic stimuli compared to natural sequences, emphasizing the use of natural stimuli when performing future psychophysical studies for speed perception.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Robust and fast Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampling of diffusion MRI microstructure models</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/328427v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In diffusion MRI analysis, advances in biophysical multi-compartment modeling have gained popularity over the conventional Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), because they possess greater specificity in relating the dMRI signal to underlying cellular microstructure. Biophysical multi-compartment models require parameter estimation, typically performed using either Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) or using Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling. Whereas MLE provides only a point estimate of the fitted model parameters, MCMC recovers the entire posterior distribution of the model parameters given the data, providing additional information such as parameter uncertainty and correlations. MCMC sampling is currently not routinely applied in dMRI microstructure modeling because it requires adjustments and tuning specific to each model, particularly in the choice of proposal distributions, burn-in length, thinning and the number of samples to store. In addition, sampling often takes at least an order of magnitude more time than non-linear optimization. Here we investigate the performance of MCMC algorithm variations over multiple popular diffusion microstructure models to see whether a single well performing variation could be applied efficiently and robustly to many models. Using an efficient GPU-based implementation, we show that run times can be removed as a prohibitive constraint for sampling of diffusion multi-compartment models. Using this implementation, we investigated the effectiveness of different adaptive MCMC algorithms, burn-in, initialization and thinning. Finally we apply the theory of Effective Sample Size to diffusion multi-compartment models as a way of determining a relatively general target for the number of samples needed to characterize parameter distributions for different models and datasets. We conclude that robust and fast sampling is achieved in most diffusion microstructure models with the Adaptive Metropolis-Within-Gibbs (AMWG) algorithm initialized with an MLE point estimate, in which case 100 to 200 samples are sufficient as a burn-in and thinning is mostly unnecessary. As a relatively general target for the number of samples, we recommend a multivariate Effective Sample Size of 2200.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/328419v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The amyloid precursor protein (APP) has been extensively studied because of its relevance to Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, its membrane distribution and neuronal function remain unclear. Here, we generated an APP fusion protein with a pH-sensitive green fluorescent protein at its ectodomain and a pH-insensitive blue fluorescent protein at its cytosolic domain to measure surface and intracellular APP distributions and its cleavage events. This fusion protein, closely resembling endogenous APP, demonstrated a limited correlation between synaptic activities and APP trafficking at synapses and neurites. Inhibition of the three major secretases distinctly affected membrane APP distribution. Intriguingly, the surface APP was inversely correlated to membrane cholesterol, a phenomenon involving APP's cholesterol-binding motif. A point mutation within this motif not only increased surface APP but also caused synaptic swelling when membrane cholesterol was reduced. Our results reveal previously unappreciated relationships between APP trafficking and processing and between membrane APP and cholesterol homeostasis at synapses.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Does subjective sleep quality predict cognitive performance? - Evidence from three empirical studies</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/328369v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The role of sleep in cognitive performance has gained increasing attention in neuroscience and sleep research in the recent decades, however, the relationship between subjective sleep quality and cognitive performance has not yet been comprehensively characterized. In this paper, our aim was to test - across three studies - the relationship between subjective sleep quality and a wide range of cognitive functions in healthy young adults. Sleep quality was assessed by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Athens Insomnia Scale, and a sleep diary to capture general subjective sleep quality, and Groningen Sleep Quality Scale and a questionnaire about the night prior to testing to capture prior night's sleep quality. Within cognitive functions, we tested several sub-processes of procedural learning, short-term memory, working memory and executive functions (assessed by the Alternating Serial Reaction Time, Digit Span, Counting Span tasks, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, respectively). To test the amount of evidence either for associations or no associations between subject sleep quality and cognitive performance, we calculated Bayes Factors along with frequentist analyses. Finally, to further increase the reliability of our conclusions, we also conducted a mini-meta-analysis on the three individual studies included in our paper. Our results, unequivocally across all analyses, show that there is no association between subjective sleep quality and cognitive performance in the domain of procedural learning, short-term/working memory, and executive functions. Our paper can contribute to a deeper understanding of subjective sleep quality and its measures, and we discuss various factors which may affect whether or not associations can be observed between subjective sleep quality and cognitive performance.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/328294v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Excessive consumption of high fat and high sugar (HFHS) diets are known to alter reward processing and aspects of behaviour, and change microbiota profiles. Studies in gnotobiotic mice also provide evidence that gut microorganisms influence social behaviour. To further investigate these interactions, the impact of intermittent access to a HFHS diet on social behaviour, gene expression and microbiota composition was examined. Rats were permitted intermittent daily access (2h / day) to a palatable HFHS diet for 28 days across the adolescent period. Social interaction, social memory and novel object recognition were assessed during this period. Following testing, RT-PCR was conducted on hippocampal and prefrontal cortex (PFC) samples. 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing was used for identification and relative quantification of bacterial taxa. Reduced social interaction behaviours, and impaired social memory and novel object recognition were observed in HFHS diet rats. Reduced levels of monoamine oxidase A (Maoa), catechol-O-methyltransferase (Comt) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) mRNA were observed in the PFC of HFHS diet rats. The relative abundance of a number of specific taxa differed significantly between the two diet groups, in particular, Lachnospiraceae and Ruminoccoceae bacteria, which also predicted social behaviours, novel object recognition performance and Maoa expression. This is the first study to show that limited daily access to HFHS diet alters social behaviour and cognition in rats. Furthermore, behavioural changes are associated with alterations to cortical gene expression of enzymes involved in monoamine synthesis and neuroplasticity, and microbiota profiles predicted diet-induced changes to behaviour and gene expression.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Antimicrobial peptides act as a host defense mechanism and regulate the commensal microbiome. To obtain a comprehensive view of genes contributing to long-term memory we performed mRNA sequencing from single Drosophila heads following behavioral training that produces long-lasting memory. Surprisingly, we find that two immune peptides with antimicrobial activity, Diptericin B and Gram-Negative Bacteria Binding Protein like 3, regulate long-term but not short-term memory or instinctive behavior in Drosophila. The cellular requirement of these two peptides is distinct: head fat body for DptB, and neurons for GNBP-like3. That antimicrobial peptides influence memory provides a novel example of the emerging link between the immune and nervous systems and reveals that some immune peptides may have been repurposed in the nervous system.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/328187v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The neuronal microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) is central to the pathogenesis of many dementias, including Alzheimer's disease. Autosomal dominant mutations in MAPT cause inherited frontotemporal dementia (FTD), but the underlying pathogenic mechanisms are unclear. Using human stem cell models of FTD due to MAPT mutations, we find that tau becomes hyperphosphorylated and mislocalises to neuronal cell bodies and dendrites in cortical neurons, recapitulating a key early event in FTD. Mislocalised tau in the cell body leads to abnormal microtubule dynamics in FTD-MAPT neurons that grossly deform the nuclear membrane, resulting in defective nucleocytoplasmic transport. Neurons in the post-mortem human FTD-MAPT cortex have a high incidence of nuclear deformation, indicating that tau-mediated nuclear membrane dysfunction is an important pathogenic process in FTD. Defects in nucleocytoplasmic transport in FTD point to important commonalities in the pathogenic mechanisms of both tau-mediated dementias and ALS-FTD due to TDP-43 and C9orf72 mutations.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/327692v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Traditionally, attention was thought to be directed by either top-down goals or bottom-up salience. Recent studies have shown that the reward history of a stimulus feature also acts as a powerful attentional cue. This is particularly relevant in schizophrenia, which is characterized by motivational and attentional deficits. Here, we examine the impact of reward on selective attention. Forty-eight people with schizophrenia (PSZ) and 34 non-psychiatric control subject (NCS) discriminated the location of a target dot appearing inside a left circle or right circle. The circles were different colors, one of which was associated with reward via pre-training. In the first 2 blocks, targets were equally likely to appear in the left or right circle. In the last 4 blocks, the target was 75% likely on one side, thus allowing us to separately examine how attention was impacted by reward (color) and probability (location). PSZ had slower overall reaction times (RTs) than NCS. Both groups showed robust effects of spatial probability and reward history, with faster RTs for the rewarded color and for the more probable location. These effects were similar in PSZ and NCS. Negative symptom severity correlated with overall RT slowing, but there were no correlations between symptoms and reward-associated biasing of attention. PSZ demonstrated RT slowing but normal reward history and spatial probability-driven RT facilitation. These results are conceptually similar to prior findings showing intact implicit reward effects on response bias, and suggest that implicit processing of reward and probability is intact in PSZ.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Scale-invariant timing has been observed in a wide range of behavioral experiments. The firing properties of recently described time cells provide a possible neural substrate for scale-invariant behavior. Earlier neural circuit models do not produce scale-invariant neural sequences. In this paper we present a biologically detailed network model based on an earlier mathematical algorithm. The simulations incorporate exponentially decaying persistent firing maintained by the calcium-activated nonspecific (CAN) cationic current and a network structure given by the inverse Laplace transform to generate time cells with scale-invariant firing rates. This model provides the first biologically detailed neural circuit for generating scale-invariant time cells. The circuit that implements the inverse Laplace transform merely consists of off-center/on-surround receptive fields. Critically, rescaling temporal sequences can be accomplished simply via cortical gain control (changing the slope of the f-I curve).</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/327049v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>We examined vibrotactile stimulation as a form of supplemental limb state feedback to enhance on-going control goal-directed movements. Subjects wore a two-dimensional vibrotactile display on their non-dominant arm while performing horizontal planar reaching movements with their dominant arm. The vibrotactile display provided feedback of hand position such that small hand displacements were more easily discriminable using vibrotactile feedback than with intrinsic proprioceptive feedback. When subjects relied solely on proprioceptive feedback to capture visuospatial targets, target capture performance was degraded by proprioceptive drift and an expansion of task space. By contrast, reach accuracy was enhanced immediately when subjects were provided vibrotactile feedback, and further improved over two days of training. Improvements reflected a resolution of proprioceptive drift which occurred only when vibrotactile feedback was active, demonstrating that the benefits of vibrotactile feedback are due in part to its integration into the ongoing control of movement. A partial resolution of task space expansion that persisted even when the vibrotactile feedback was inactive demonstrated that training with vibrotactile feedback also induced changes in movement planning. However, the benefits of vibrotactile feedback come at a cognitive cost. All subjects adopted a stereotyped, movement decomposition strategy wherein they attempted to capture targets by moving first along one axis of the vibrotactile display and then the other. For most subjects, this inefficient movement approach did not resolve over two bouts of training performed on separate days, suggesting that additional training is needed to fully integrate vibrotactile feedback into the planning and online control of goal-directed reaching.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Linda Dib, Nicolas Salamin, David Gfeller&lt;/p&gt;

Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules are critical to adaptive immune defence mechanisms in vertebrate species and are encoded by highly polymorphic genes. Polymorphic sites are located close to the ligand-binding groove and entail MHC-I alleles with distinct binding specificities. Some efforts have been made to investigate the relationship between polymorphism and protein stability. However, less is known about the relationship between polymorphism and MHC-I co-evolutionary constraints. Using Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) we found that co-evolution analysis accurately pinpoints structural contacts, although the protein family is restricted to vertebrates and comprises less than five hundred species, and that the co-evolutionary signal is mainly driven by cross-species changes, and not intra-species polymorphism. Moreover, we show that polymorphic sites in human preferentially avoid co-evolving residues, as well as residues involved in protein stability. These results suggest that sites displaying high polymorphism may also have been selected during vertebrates’ evolution to avoid those under co-evolutionary constraints and thereby maximize their mutability.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5R4fGWtz6gQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Ji Hyun Bak, Seogjoo J. Jang, Changbong Hyeon&lt;/p&gt;

Binding of odorants to olfactory receptors (ORs) elicits downstream chemical and neural signals, which are further processed to odor perception in the brain. Recently, Mainland and colleagues have measured more than 500 pairs of odorant-OR interaction by a high-throughput screening assay method, opening a new avenue to understanding the principles of human odor coding. Here, using a recently developed minimal model for OR activation kinetics, we characterize the statistics of OR activation by odorants in terms of three empirical parameters: the half-maximum effective concentration EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, the efficacy, and the basal activity. While the data size of odorants is still limited, the statistics offer meaningful information on the breadth and optimality of the tuning of human ORs to odorants, and allow us to relate the three parameters with the microscopic rate constants and binding affinities that define the OR activation kinetics. Despite the stochastic nature of the response expected at individual OR-odorant level, we assess that the confluence of signals in a neuron released from the multitude of ORs is effectively free of noise and deterministic with respect to changes in odorant concentration. Thus, setting a threshold to the fraction of activated OR copy number for neural spiking binarizes the electrophysiological signal of olfactory sensory neuron, thereby making an information theoretic approach a viable tool in studying the principles of odor perception.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bABG40KQDFw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

In recent years, two-photon calcium imaging has become a standard tool to probe the function of neural circuits and to study computations in neuronal populations. However, the acquired signal is only an indirect measurement of neural activity due to the comparatively slow dynamics of fluorescent calcium indicators. Different algorithms for estimating spike rates from noisy calcium measurements have been proposed in the past, but it is an open question how far performance can be improved. Here, we report the results of the &lt;i&gt;spikefinder&lt;/i&gt; challenge, launched to catalyze the development of new spike rate inference algorithms through crowd-sourcing. We present ten of the submitted algorithms which show improved performance compared to previously evaluated methods. Interestingly, the top-performing algorithms are based on a wide range of principles from deep neural networks to generative models, yet provide highly correlated estimates of the neural activity. The competition shows that benchmark challenges can drive algorithmic developments in neuroscience.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/a1WS4uygAIc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Target selection is the first and pivotal step in drug discovery. An incorrect choice may not manifest itself for many years after hundreds of millions of research dollars have been spent. We collected a set of 332 targets that succeeded or failed in phase III clinical trials, and explored whether Omic features describing the target genes could predict clinical success. We obtained features from the recently published comprehensive resource: Harmonizome. Nineteen features appeared to be significantly correlated with phase III clinical trial outcomes, but only 4 passed validation schemes that used bootstrapping or modified permutation tests to assess feature robustness and generalizability while accounting for target class selection bias. We also used classifiers to perform multivariate feature selection and found that classifiers with a single feature performed as well in cross-validation as classifiers with more features (AUROC = 0.57 and AUPR = 0.81). The two predominantly selected features were mean mRNA expression across tissues and standard deviation of expression across tissues, where successful targets tended to have lower mean expression and higher expression variance than failed targets. This finding supports the conventional wisdom that it is favorable for a target to be present in the tissue(s) affected by a disease and absent from other tissues. Overall, our results suggest that it is feasible to construct a model integrating interpretable target features to inform target selection. We anticipate deeper insights and better models in the future, as researchers can reuse the data we have provided to improve methods for handling sample biases and learn more informative features.

	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Action and perception are tightly coupled systems requiring coordination and synchronization over time. How the brain achieves synchronization is still a matter of debate, but recent experiments suggest that brain oscillations may play an important role in this process. Brain oscillations have been also proposed to be fundamental in determining time perception. Here, we had subjects perform an audio-visual temporal order judgment task to investigate the fine dynamics of temporal bias and sensitivity before and after the execution of voluntary hand movement (button-press). The reported order of the audio-visual sequence was rhythmically biased as a function of delay from hand action execution. Importantly, we found that it oscillated at a theta range frequency, starting about 500 ms before and persisting about 250 ms after the button-press, with consistent phase-locking across participants. Our results show that the perception of cross-sensory simultaneity oscillates rhythmically in synchrony with the programming phase of a voluntary action, demonstrating a link between action preparation and bias in temporal perceptual judgments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Judgments of the temporal order of a visual and auditory stimulus are not constant over time but fluctuate rhythmically in the theta range (around 7 Hz) in synchrony with the execution of a voluntary movement. Interestingly, these oscillations precede the action execution by about half a second, indicating active synchronization between temporal criterion and the intention to move. Overall, the results point to the presence of a single shared clock for perception and action.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Moment-to-Moment Fluctuations in Neuronal Excitability Bias Subjective Perception Rather than Strategic Decision-Making</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0430-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Perceiving an external stimulus not only depends on the physical features of the stimulus, but also fundamentally on the current state of neuronal excitability, indexed by the power of ongoing alpha-band and beta-band oscillations (8–30 Hz). Recent studies suggest that heightened excitability does not improve perceptual acuity, but biases observers to report the presence of a stimulus regardless of its physical presence. It is unknown whether this bias is due to changes in observers’ subjective perceptual experience (perceptual bias) or their perception-independent decision-making strategy (decision bias). We tested these alternative interpretations in an EEG experiment in which male and female human participants performed two-interval forced choice (2IFC) detection and discrimination. According to signal detection theory, perceptual bias only affects 2IFC detection, but not discrimination, while interval decision bias should be task-independent. We found that correct detection was more likely when excitability before the stimulus-present interval exceeded that before the stimulus-absent interval (i.e. 8–17 Hz power was weaker before the stimulus-present interval), consistent with an effect of excitability on perceptual bias. By contrast, discrimination accuracy was unaffected by excitability fluctuations between intervals, ruling out an effect on interval decision bias. We conclude that the current state of neuronal excitability biases the perceptual experience itself, rather than the decision process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The current state of neuronal excitability, indexed by the power of ongoing low-frequency oscillations (8–30 Hz), has a strong influence on perception. However, the specific mechanism underlying this influence is a continuing subject of debate in neuroscience. Previous research showed that states of heightened excitability make observers report the presence of a sensory stimulus even when none is present. Heightened excitability may therefore indicate a state of strategic decision-making (i.e. observers prefer to report &quot;Yes, I saw the stimulus&quot;) or a state of amplified subjective perception (i.e. observers experience a stimulus even when none is present). Here, we tested these alternative interpretations and found evidence that fluctuations in neuronal excitability bias the perceptual experience itself, rather than the decision strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: RGS14 Restricts Plasticity in Hippocampal CA2 by Limiting Postsynaptic Calcium Signaling</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0353-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Pyramidal neurons in hippocampal area CA2 are distinct from neighboring CA1 in that they resist synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) at CA3 Schaffer Collateral synapses. Regulator of G Protein Signaling 14 (RGS14) is a complex scaffolding protein enriched in CA2 dendritic spines that naturally blocks CA2 synaptic plasticity and hippocampus-dependent learning, but the cellular mechanisms by which RGS14 gates LTP are largely unexplored. A previous study has attributed the lack of plasticity to higher rates of calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) buffering and extrusion in CA2 spines. Additionally, a recent proteomics study revealed that RGS14 interacts with two key Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-activated proteins in CA2 neurons: calcium/calmodulin, and CaMKII. Here, we investigate whether RGS14 regulates Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling in its host CA2 neurons. We find the nascent LTP of CA2 synapses due to genetic knockout (KO) of RGS14 in mice requires Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent postsynaptic signaling through NMDA receptors, CaMK, and PKA, revealing similar mechanisms to those in CA1. We report RGS14 negatively regulates the long-term structural plasticity of dendritic spines of CA2 neurons. We further show that wild-type (WT) CA2 neurons display significantly attenuated spine Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients during structural plasticity induction compared with the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients from CA2 spines of RGS14 KO mice and CA1 controls. Finally, we demonstrate that acute overexpression of RGS14 is sufficient to block spine plasticity, and elevating extracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels restores plasticity to RGS14-expressing neurons. Together, these results demonstrate for the first time that RGS14 regulates plasticity in hippocampal area CA2 by restricting Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; elevations in CA2 spines and downstream signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Recent studies of hippocampal area CA2 have provided strong evidence in support of a clear role for this apparently plasticity-resistant subregion of the hippocampus in social, spatial, and temporal aspects of memory. Regulator of G Protein Signaling 14 (RGS14) is a critical factor that inhibits synaptic plasticity in CA2, but the molecular mechanisms by which RGS14 limits LTP remained unknown. Here we provide new evidence that RGS14 restricts spine calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) in CA2 neurons and that key downstream Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-activated signaling pathways are required for CA2 plasticity in mice lacking RGS14. These results define a previously unrecognized role for RGS14 as a natural inhibitor of postsynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling in hippocampal area CA2.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Differences in Hearing Acuity among &quot;Normal-Hearing&quot; Young Adults Modulate the Neural Basis for Speech Comprehension</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0263-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we investigate how subtle differences in hearing acuity affect the neural systems supporting speech processing in young adults. Auditory sentence comprehension requires perceiving a complex acoustic signal and performing linguistic operations to extract the correct meaning. We used fMRI to monitor human brain activity while adults aged 18–41 listened to spoken sentences. The sentences varied in their level of syntactic processing demands, containing either a subject-relative or object-relative center-embedded clause. All participants self-reported normal hearing, confirmed by audiometric testing, with some variation within a clinically normal range. We found that participants showed activity related to sentence processing in a left-lateralized frontotemporal network. Although accuracy was generally high, participants still made some errors, which were associated with increased activity in bilateral cingulo-opercular and frontoparietal attention networks. A whole-brain regression analysis revealed that activity in a right anterior middle frontal gyrus (aMFG) component of the frontoparietal attention network was related to individual differences in hearing acuity, such that listeners with poorer hearing showed greater recruitment of this region when successfully understanding a sentence. The activity in right aMFG’s for listeners with poor hearing did not differ as a function of sentence type, suggesting a general mechanism that is independent of linguistic processing demands. Our results suggest that even modest variations in hearing ability impact the systems supporting auditory speech comprehension, and that auditory sentence comprehension entails the coordination of a left perisylvian network that is sensitive to linguistic variation with an executive attention network that responds to acoustic challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Hearing loss is associated with increased cognitive demand during speech comprehension. Here we used fMRI to measure brain activity while healthy adults with self-reported normal hearing listened to spoken sentences. We found that regions of right frontal cortex, outside of the traditional perisylvian language network, are more active for listeners with poorer hearing as measured with pure-tone audiometry. These findings suggest executive attention varies with hearing ability, even in the absence of clinical hearing loss, during successful auditory sentence comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Combinatorial Expression of Grp and Neurod6 Defines Dopamine Neuron Populations with Distinct Projection Patterns and Disease Vulnerability</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0152-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Midbrain dopamine neurons project to numerous targets throughout the brain to modulate various behaviors and brain states. Within this small population of neurons exists significant heterogeneity based on physiology, circuitry, and disease susceptibility. Recent studies have shown that dopamine neurons can be subdivided based on gene expression; however, the extent to which genetic markers represent functionally relevant dopaminergic subpopulations has not been fully explored. Here we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing of mouse dopamine neurons and validated studies showing that &lt;i&gt;Neurod6&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Grp&lt;/i&gt; are selective markers for dopaminergic subpopulations. Using a combination of multiplex fluorescent &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization, retrograde labeling, and electrophysiology in mice of both sexes, we defined the anatomy, projection targets, physiological properties, and disease vulnerability of dopamine neurons based on &lt;i&gt;Grp&lt;/i&gt; and/or &lt;i&gt;Neurod6&lt;/i&gt; expression. We find that the combinatorial expression of &lt;i&gt;Grp&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Neurod6&lt;/i&gt; defines dopaminergic subpopulations with unique features. &lt;i&gt;Grp+/Neurod6&lt;/i&gt;+ dopamine neurons reside in the ventromedial VTA, send projections to the medial shell of the nucleus accumbens, and have non-canonical physiological properties. &lt;i&gt;Grp+/Neurod6-&lt;/i&gt; DA neurons are found in the VTA as well as in the ventromedial portion of the SNc where they project selectively to the dorsomedial striatum. &lt;i&gt;Grp-/Neurod6&lt;/i&gt;+ DA neurons represent a smaller VTA subpopulation, which is preferentially spared in a 6-OHDA model of Parkinson’s disease. Together our work provides detailed characterization of &lt;i&gt;Neurod6&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Grp&lt;/i&gt; expression in the midbrain and generates new insights into how these markers define functionally relevant dopaminergic subpopulations with distinct projection patterns, physiology, and disease vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Recent single cell gene profiling studies have uncovered new subpopulations of midbrain dopamine neurons defined by their specific genetic signature. How these genetically-defined cell types map onto known dopaminergic circuits and functionally-defined cell types is unknown. This study elucidates the anatomy, circuitry, physiologic properties, and disease susceptibility of subpopulations of midbrain DA neurons defined by their expression of two genetic markers. This work not only advances our understanding of the dopaminergic system by providing new information about the properties of specific dopamine neuron subpopulations, it also demonstrates that unbiased genetic classification of neurons can reveal functionally relevant cell types.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: TRPV1 Agonist, Capsaicin, Induces Axon Outgrowth after Injury via Ca2+/PKA Signaling</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0095-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Pre-conditioning nerve injuries activate a pro-regenerative program that enhances axon regeneration for most classes of sensory neurons. However, nociceptive sensory neurons and central nervous system neurons regenerate poorly. In hopes of identifying novel mechanisms that promote regeneration, we screened for drugs that mimicked the pre-conditioning response, and identified a nociceptive ligand that activates a pre-conditioning-like response to promote axon outgrowth. We show that activating the ion channel TRPV1 with capsaicin induces axon outgrowth of cultured DRG sensory neurons, and that this effect is blocked in TRPV1 knockout neurons. Regeneration only occurs in NF200-negative nociceptive neurons, consistent with a cell autonomous mechanism. Moreover, we identify a signaling pathway in which TRPV1 activation leads to calcium influx and PKA activation to induce a pre-conditioning-like response. Finally, capsaicin administration to the mouse sciatic nerve activates a similar pre-conditioning-like response and induces enhanced axonal outgrowth, indicating that this pathway can be induced &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. These findings highlight the use of local ligands to induce regeneration, and suggest that it may be possible to target selective neuronal populations for repair, including cell types that often fail to regenerate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; After injury or neurodegenerative disease, axons need to regenerate to restore function. Unfortunately, no current therapies achieve this goal. We performed a drug screen in adult sensory neurons to identify agents that effectively re-program neurons into a pro-growth state. We demonstrate that capsaicin, a TRPV1 agonist, activates a pro-axon growth program. This mechanism requires calcium influx and PKA activity, and leads to the activation of the pro-regenerative transcription factor CREB. Hence, activation of ion channels can promote axon regeneration, an exciting finding since many ion channels are druggable targets. Moreover, these findings suggest an approach for enhancing axon regeneration in selective populations of neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Contribution of the Axon Initial Segment to Action Potentials Recorded Extracellularly</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0068-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Action potentials (APs) are electric phenomena that are recorded both intracellularly and extracellularly. APs are usually initiated in the short segment of the axon called the axon initial segment (AIS). It was recently proposed that at onset of an AP the soma and the AIS form a dipole. We study the extracellular signature (the extracellular action potential, EAP) generated by such a dipole. First, we demonstrate the formation of the dipole and its extracellular signature in detailed morphological models of a reconstructed pyramidal neuron. Then, we study the EAP waveform and its spatial dependence in models with axonal AP initiation and contrast it with the EAP obtained in models with somatic AP initiation. We show that in the models with axonal AP initiation the dipole forms between somatodendritic compartments and the AIS, and not between soma and dendrites as in the classical models. Soma-dendrites dipole is present only in models with somatic AP initiation. Our study has consequences for interpreting extracellular recordings of single-neuron activity and determining electrophysiological neuron types, but also for better understanding the origins of the high-frequency macroscopic extracellular potential recorded in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Signficance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Action potentials in most neurons initiate in the axon initial segment (AIS). However, the AIS is often neglected in computational studies. We studied the consequences of this initiation mechanism on the extracellular signatures of action potentials. We show that at the time of AP initiation AIS forms a dipole with the soma. The peak-to-peak amplitude of the extracellular action potential (EAP) generated by this dipole changes little with changing soma–AIS distance while the width of the EAP increases with the soma–AIS distance. This may help to monitor dynamic changes in the soma–AIS distance in experimental &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; recordings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;According to some researchers, noise is typically conceived as a detrimental
factor in cognitive performance affecting perception, decision making, and
motor function. However, in recent studies it is associated with white noise
with concentration and calm, therefore, this research seeks to establish the
impact of binaural white noise on the performance of short-term visual and
working memory, the alpha - beta brain activity, attention - meditation,
through the use of two auditory stimuli with frequency ranges of (100 to 450hz)
and (100 to 750hz). This study was conducted in the city of Montes Claros, the
Republic of Brazil, where seven participants were evaluated (n = 7) with an
average age of 36.71, and two age groups (GP1) 21 to 30 and (GP2) 41 50, with
university studies. Within the experimental process, the short-term visual
memory tests were performed using the cognitive assessment battery CAB of
CogniFit, and the recording of brain activities through the use of monopolar
electroencephalogram and the eSense algorithms. With the results obtained and
through the use of statistical tests, we can infer that the binaural white
noise with oscillations of 100 to 750 Hz contributed to the performance of
visual work memory in the short term

To obtain the results, we invent an analytic formula approximately implementing

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Atomic resolution mechanism of ligand binding to a solvent inaccessible cavity in T4 lysozyme</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/v22HP1dNVjw/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Jagannath Mondal, Navjeet Ahalawat, Subhendu Pandit, Lewis E. Kay, Pramodh Vallurupalli&lt;/p&gt;

Ligand binding sites in proteins are often localized to deeply buried cavities, inaccessible to bulk solvent. Yet, in many cases binding of cognate ligands occurs rapidly. An intriguing system is presented by the L99A cavity mutant of T4 Lysozyme (T4L L99A) that rapidly binds benzene (~10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; M&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). Although the protein has long served as a model system for protein thermodynamics and crystal structures of both free and benzene-bound T4L L99A are available, the kinetic pathways by which benzene reaches its solvent-inaccessible binding cavity remain elusive. The current work, using extensive molecular dynamics simulation, achieves this by capturing the complete process of spontaneous recognition of benzene by T4L L99A at atomistic resolution. A series of multi-microsecond unbiased molecular dynamics simulation trajectories unequivocally reveal how benzene, starting in bulk solvent, diffuses to the protein and spontaneously reaches the solvent inaccessible cavity of T4L L99A. The simulated and high-resolution X-ray derived bound structures are in excellent agreement. A robust four-state Markov model, developed using cumulative 60 μs trajectories, identifies and quantifies &lt;i&gt;multiple&lt;/i&gt; ligand binding pathways with low activation barriers. Interestingly, none of these identified binding pathways required large conformational changes for ligand access to the buried cavity. Rather, these involve transient but crucial opening of a channel to the cavity via subtle displacements in the positions of key helices (helix4/helix6, helix7/helix9) leading to rapid binding. Free energy simulations further elucidate that these channel-opening events would have been unfavorable in wild type T4L. Taken together and via integrating with results from experiments, these simulations provide unprecedented mechanistic insights into the complete ligand recognition process in a buried cavity. By illustrating the power of subtle helix movements in opening up &lt;i&gt;multiple&lt;/i&gt; pathways for ligand access, this work offers an alternate view of ligand recognition in a solvent-inaccessible cavity, contrary to the common perception of a &lt;i&gt;single&lt;/i&gt; dominant pathway for ligand binding.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v22HP1dNVjw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: On the role of sparseness in the evolution of modularity in gene regulatory networks</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/Eh0FCzbR2R4/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Carlos Espinosa-Soto&lt;/p&gt;

Modularity is a widespread property in biological systems. It implies that interactions occur mainly within groups of system elements. A modular arrangement facilitates adjustment of one module without perturbing the rest of the system. Therefore, modularity of developmental mechanisms is a major factor for evolvability, the potential to produce beneficial variation from random genetic change. Understanding how modularity evolves in gene regulatory networks, that create the distinct gene activity patterns that characterize different parts of an organism, is key to developmental and evolutionary biology. One hypothesis for the evolution of modules suggests that interactions between some sets of genes become maladaptive when selection favours additional gene activity patterns. The removal of such interactions by selection would result in the formation of modules. A second hypothesis suggests that modularity evolves in response to sparseness, the scarcity of interactions within a system. Here I simulate the evolution of gene regulatory networks and analyse diverse experimentally sustained networks to study the relationship between sparseness and modularity. My results suggest that sparseness alone is neither sufficient nor necessary to explain modularity in gene regulatory networks. However, sparseness amplifies the effects of forms of selection that, like selection for additional gene activity patterns, already produce an increase in modularity. That evolution of new gene activity patterns is frequent across evolution also supports that it is a major factor in the evolution of modularity. That sparseness is widespread across gene regulatory networks indicates that it may have facilitated the evolution of modules in a wide variety of cases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Eh0FCzbR2R4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

A biophysical model that captures molecular homeostatic control of ions at the perisynaptic cradle (PsC) is of fundamental importance for understanding the interplay between astroglial and neuronal compartments. In this paper, we develop a multi-compartmental mathematical model which proposes a novel mechanism whereby the flow of cations in thin processes is restricted due to negatively charged membrane lipids which result in the formation of deep potential wells near the dipole heads. These wells restrict the flow of cations to “hopping” between adjacent wells as they transverse the process, and this surface retention of cations will be shown to give rise to the formation of potassium (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and sodium (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) microdomains at the PsC. We further propose that a K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microdomain formed at the PsC, provides the driving force for the return of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to the extracellular space for uptake by the neurone, thereby preventing K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; undershoot. A slow decay of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; was also observed in our simulation after a period of glutamate stimulation which is in strong agreement with experimental observations. The pathological implications of microdomain formation during neuronal excitation are also discussed.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2aFUE1uepp4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Serotonin Selectively Increases Detectability of Motion Stimuli in the Electrosensory System</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0013-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Serotonergic innervation of sensory areas is found ubiquitously across the central nervous system of vertebrates. Here we used a system’s level approach to investigate the role of serotonin on processing motion stimuli in the electrosensory system of the weakly electric fish &lt;i&gt;Apteronotus albifrons&lt;/i&gt;. We found that exogenous serotonin application increased the firing activity of pyramidal neural responses to both looming and receding motion. Separating spikes belonging to bursts from those that were isolated revealed that this effect was primarily due to increased burst firing. Moreover, when investigating whether firing activity during stimulation could be discriminated from baseline (i.e., in the absence of stimulation), we found that serotonin increased stimulus discriminability only for some stimuli. This is because increased burst firing was most prominent for these. Further, the effects of serotonin were highly heterogeneous, with some neurons displaying large while others instead displaying minimal changes in responsiveness following serotonin application. Further analysis revealed that serotonin application had the greatest effect on neurons with low baseline firing rates and little to no effect on neurons with high baseline firing rates. Finally, the effects of serotonin on sensory neuron responses were largely independent of object velocity. Our results therefore reveal a novel function for the serotonergic system in selectively enhancing discriminability for motion stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Previous studies have suggested that the role of serotonin in the electrosensory system was to enhance perception of and neural responses to stimuli associated with same-sex conspecifics. However, these have focused on stationary stimuli. Here we focused on motion stimuli that are typically associated with a different behavioral context (e.g., prey capture). Although exogenous serotonin application increased burst firing to both looming and receding motion. Detectability was significantly enhanced only for receding motion that gave rise to a large excitatory response. We propose that serotonin selectively enhances neural responses to stimuli that elicit electrosensory feedback.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Intrinsic Functional Connectivity Resembles Cortical Architecture at Various Levels of Isoflurane Anesthesia</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy114/4999310?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Cortical single neuron activity and local field potential patterns change at different depths of general anesthesia. Here, we investigate the associated network level changes of functional connectivity. We recorded ongoing electrocorticographic (ECoG) activity from temporo-parieto-occipital cortex of 6 ferrets at various levels of isoflurane/nitrous oxide anesthesia and determined functional connectivity by computing amplitude envelope correlations. Through hierarchical clustering, we derived typical connectivity patterns corresponding to light, intermediate and deep anesthesia. Generally, amplitude correlation strength increased strongly with depth of anesthesia across all cortical areas and frequency bands. This was accompanied, at the deepest level, by the emergence of burst-suppression activity in the ECoG signal and a change of the spectrum of the amplitude envelope. Normalization of functional connectivity to the distribution of correlation coefficients showed that the topographical patterns remained similar across depths of anesthesia, reflecting the functional association of the underlying cortical areas. Thus, while strength and temporal properties of amplitude co-modulation vary depending on the activity of local neural circuits, their network-level interaction pattern is presumably most strongly determined by the underlying structural connectivity.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Laminar positioning of cortical neurons, as determined by termination of neuronal migration, is a key determinant of their ability to assemble into functional circuits. However, the exact contribution of laminar placement to dendrite morphogenesis and synapse formation remains unclear. Here we manipulated the laminar position of cortical neurons by knocking down doublecortin (Dcx), a crucial effector of migration, and show that misplaced neurons fail to properly form dendrites, spines, and functional glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses. We further show that knocking down Dcx in properly positioned neurons induces similar but milder defects, suggesting that the laminar misplacement is the primary cause of altered neuronal development. Thus, the specific laminar environment of their fated layers is crucial for the maturation of cortical neurons, and influences their functional integration into developing cortical circuits.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy052/4999308?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Segregating concurrent sound streams is a computationally challenging task that requires integrating bottom-up acoustic cues (e.g. pitch) and top-down prior knowledge about sound streams. In a multi-talker environment, the brain can segregate different speakers in about 100 ms in auditory cortex. Here, we used magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings to investigate the temporal and spatial signature of how the brain utilizes prior knowledge to segregate 2 speech streams from the same speaker, which can hardly be separated based on bottom-up acoustic cues. In a primed condition, the participants know the target speech stream in advance while in an unprimed condition no such prior knowledge is available. Neural encoding of each speech stream is characterized by the MEG responses tracking the speech envelope. We demonstrate that an effect in bilateral superior temporal gyrus and superior temporal sulcus is much stronger in the primed condition than in the unprimed condition. Priming effects are observed at about 100 ms latency and last more than 600 ms. Interestingly, prior knowledge about the target stream facilitates speech segregation by mainly suppressing the neural tracking of the non-target speech stream. In sum, prior knowledge leads to reliable speech segregation in auditory cortex, even in the absence of reliable bottom-up speech segregation cue.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Firing-rate based network modeling of the dLGN circuit: Effects of cortical feedback on spatiotemporal response properties of relay cells</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/NEnghs1B4I8/article</link>

Visually evoked signals in the retina pass through the dorsal geniculate nucleus (dLGN) on the way to the visual cortex. This is however not a simple feedforward flow of information: there is a significant feedback from cortical cells back to both relay cells and interneurons in the dLGN. Despite four decades of experimental and theoretical studies, the functional role of this feedback is still debated. Here we use a firing-rate model, the extended difference-of-Gaussians (eDOG) model, to explore cortical feedback effects on visual responses of dLGN relay cells. For this model the responses are found by direct evaluation of two- or three-dimensional integrals allowing for fast and comprehensive studies of putative effects of different candidate organizations of the cortical feedback. Our analysis identifies a special mixed configuration of excitatory and inhibitory cortical feedback which seems to best account for available experimental data. This configuration consists of (i) a slow (long-delay) and spatially widespread inhibitory feedback, combined with (ii) a fast (short-delayed) and spatially narrow excitatory feedback, where (iii) the excitatory/inhibitory ON-ON connections are accompanied respectively by inhibitory/excitatory OFF-ON connections, i.e. following a phase-reversed arrangement. The recent development of optogenetic and pharmacogenetic methods has provided new tools for more precise manipulation and investigation of the thalamocortical circuit, in particular for mice. Such data will expectedly allow the eDOG model to be better constrained by data from specific animal model systems than has been possible until now for cat. We have therefore made the Python tool pyLGN which allows for easy adaptation of the eDOG model to new situations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NEnghs1B4I8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Enzyme sequestration by the substrate: An analysis in the deterministic and stochastic domains</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/2a3YD9EnPsk/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Andreas Petrides, Glenn Vinnicombe&lt;/p&gt;

This paper is concerned with the potential multistability of protein concentrations in the cell. That is, situations where one, or a family of, proteins may sit at one of two or more different steady state concentrations in otherwise identical cells, and in spite of them being in the same environment. For models of multisite protein phosphorylation for example, in the presence of excess substrate, it has been shown that the achievable number of stable steady states can increase linearly with the number of phosphosites available. In this paper, we analyse the consequences of adding enzyme docking to these and similar models, with the resultant sequestration of phosphatase and kinase by the fully unphosphorylated and by the fully phosphorylated substrates respectively. In the large molecule numbers limit, where deterministic analysis is applicable, we prove that there are always values for these rates of sequestration which, when exceeded, limit the extent of multistability. For the models considered here, these numbers are much smaller than the affinity of the enzymes to the substrate when it is in a modifiable state. As substrate enzyme-sequestration is increased, we further prove that the number of steady states will inevitably be reduced to one. For smaller molecule numbers a stochastic analysis is more appropriate, where multistability in the large molecule numbers limit can manifest itself as multimodality of the probability distribution; the system spending periods of time in the vicinity of one mode before jumping to another. Here, we find that substrate enzyme sequestration can induce bimodality even in systems where only a single steady state can exist at large numbers. To facilitate this analysis, we develop a weakly chained diagonally dominant M-matrix formulation of the Chemical Master Equation, allowing greater insights in the way particular mechanisms, like enzyme sequestration, can shape probability distributions and therefore exhibit different behaviour across different regimes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2a3YD9EnPsk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Transducin {beta}-Subunit Can Interact with Multiple G Protein {gamma}-Subunits to Enable Light Detection by Rod Photoreceptors</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0144-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The heterotrimeric G protein transducin mediates visual signaling in vertebrate photoreceptor cells. Many aspects of transducin’s function were learned from knockout mice lacking its individual subunits. Of particular interest is the knockout of its rod-specific -subunit (G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). Two studies using independently generated mice documented that this knockout results in a considerable &amp;gt;60-fold reduction in light-sensitivity of affected rods, but provided different interpretations of how the remaining α-subunit (Gα&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;) mediates phototransduction without its cognate Gβ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-subunit partner. One study found that the light-sensitivity reduction matched a corresponding reduction in Gα&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; content in the light-sensing rod outer segments and proposed that Gα&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; activation is supported by remaining Gβ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; associating with other G subunit(s) naturally expressed in photoreceptors. In contrast, the second study reported the same light-sensitivity loss but a much lesser, only ~6-fold reduction of Gα&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; and proposed that light responses of these rods do not require Gβ at all. To resolve this controversy and elucidate the mechanism driving visual signaling in G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; knockout rods, we analyzed both mouse lines side-by-side. We first determined that outer segments of both mice have identical Gα&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; content, which is reduced ~65-fold from the wild type level. We further demonstrated that the remaining Gβ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is present in a complex with endogenous G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and G&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; subunits and that these complexes exist in wild type rods as well. Together, these results argue against the idea that Gα&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; alone supports light responses of G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; knockout rods and suggest that Gβ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is not unique in its ability to mediate vertebrate phototransduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Phototransduction has been a valuable system for understanding the basic principles of G protein signaling. One question that has remained unanswered is whether the G protein α-subunit can support signaling without its cognate β partner complex. Previous studies investigating this question in photoreceptors of G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; knockout mice came to mutually exclusive conclusions. We now resolve this controversy by showing that phototransduction in this knockout is supported by alternative β complexes rather than α-subunit alone. Most importantly, this study highlights functional interchangeability of different -subunits in the context of an intact &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.06336</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This paper considers an electro-chemical based communication model for
intercellular communication in plants. Many plants, such as Mimosa pudica (the
&quot;sensitive plant&quot;), employ electrochemical signals known as action potentials
(APs) for communication purposes. In this paper we present a simple model for
action potential generation. We make use of the concepts from molecular
communication to explain the underlying process of information transfer in a
plant. Using the information-theoretic analysis, we compute the mutual
information between the input and output in this work. The key aim is to study
the variations in the information propagation speed for varying number of plant
cells for one simple case. Furthermore we study the impact of the AP signal on
the mutual information and information propagation speed. We aim to explore
further that how the growth rate in plants can impact the information transfer
rate and vice versa.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Near real-time forecasting for cholera decision making in Haiti after Hurricane Matthew</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/rXysUXWSU_g/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Damiano Pasetto, Flavio Finger, Anton Camacho, Francesco Grandesso, Sandra Cohuet, Joseph C. Lemaitre, Andrew S. Azman, Francisco J. Luquero, Enrico Bertuzzo, Andrea Rinaldo&lt;/p&gt;

Computational models of cholera transmission can provide objective insights into the course of an ongoing epidemic and aid decision making on allocation of health care resources. However, models are typically designed, calibrated and interpreted &lt;i&gt;post-hoc&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we report the efforts of a team from academia, field research and humanitarian organizations to model in near real-time the Haitian cholera outbreak after Hurricane Matthew in October 2016, to assess risk and to quantitatively estimate the efficacy of a then ongoing vaccination campaign. A rainfall-driven, spatially-explicit meta-community model of cholera transmission was coupled to a data assimilation scheme for computing short-term projections of the epidemic in near real-time. The model was used to forecast cholera incidence for the months after the passage of the hurricane (October-December 2016) and to predict the impact of a planned oral cholera vaccination campaign. Our first projection, from October 29 to December 31, predicted the highest incidence in the departments of Grande Anse and Sud, accounting for about 45% of the total cases in Haiti. The projection included a second peak in cholera incidence in early December largely driven by heavy rainfall forecasts, confirming the urgency for rapid intervention. A second projection (from November 12 to December 31) used updated rainfall forecasts to estimate that 835 cases would be averted by vaccinations in Grande Anse (90% Prediction Interval [PI] 476-1284) and 995 in Sud (90% PI 508-2043). The experience gained by this modeling effort shows that state-of-the-art computational modeling and data-assimilation methods can produce informative near real-time projections of cholera incidence. Collaboration among modelers and field epidemiologists is indispensable to gain fast access to field data and to translate model results into operational recommendations for emergency management during an outbreak. Future efforts should thus draw together multi-disciplinary teams to ensure model outputs are appropriately based, interpreted and communicated.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rXysUXWSU_g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Altered Excitability and Local Connectivity of mPFC-PAG Neurons in a Mouse Model of Neuropathic Pain</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/20/4829?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays a major role in both sensory and affective aspects of pain. There is extensive evidence that chronic pain produces functional changes within the mPFC. However, our understanding of local circuit changes to defined subpopulations of mPFC neurons in chronic pain models remains unclear. A major subpopulation of mPFC neurons project to the periaqueductal gray (PAG), which is a key midbrain structure involved in endogenous pain suppression and facilitation. Here, we used laser scanning photostimulation of caged glutamate to map cortical circuits of retrogradely labeled cortico-PAG (CP) neurons in layer 5 (L5) of mPFC in brain slices prepared from male mice having undergone chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve. Whole-cell recordings revealed a significant reduction in excitability for L5 CP neurons contralateral to CCI in the prelimbic (PL), but not infralimbic (IL), region of mPFC. Circuit mapping showed that excitatory inputs to L5 CP neurons in both PL and IL arose primarily from layer 2/3 (L2/3) and were significantly reduced in CCI mice. Glutamate stimulation of L2/3 and L5 elicited inhibitory inputs to CP neurons in both PL and IL, but only L2/3 input was significantly reduced in CP neurons of CCI mice. We also observed significant reduction in excitability and L2/3 inhibitory input to CP neurons ipsilateral to CCI. These results demonstrating region and laminar specific changes to mPFC-PAG neurons suggest that a unilateral CCI bilaterally alters cortical circuits upstream of the endogenous analgesic network, which may contribute to persistence of chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Chronic pain is a significant unresolved medical problem that is refractory to traditional analgesics and can negatively affect emotional health. The role of central circuits in mediating the persistent nature of chronic pain remains unclear. Local circuits within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) process ascending pain inputs and can modulate endogenous analgesia via direct projections to the periaqueductal gray (PAG). However, the mechanisms by which chronic pain alters intracortical circuitry of mPFC-PAG neurons are unknown. Here, we report specific changes to local circuits of mPFC-PAG neurons in mice displaying chronic pain behavior after nerve injury.

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: mTORC1 Is Transiently Reactivated in Injured Nerves to Promote c-Jun Elevation and Schwann Cell Dedifferentiation</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/20/4811?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Schwann cells (SCs) are endowed with a remarkable plasticity. When peripheral nerves are injured, SCs dedifferentiate and acquire new functions to coordinate nerve repair as so-called repair SCs. Subsequently, SCs redifferentiate to remyelinate regenerated axons. Given the similarities between SC dedifferentiation/redifferentiation in injured nerves and in demyelinating neuropathies, elucidating the signals involved in SC plasticity after nerve injury has potentially wider implications. c-Jun has emerged as a key transcription factor regulating SC dedifferentiation and the acquisition of repair SC features. However, the upstream pathways that control c-Jun activity after nerve injury are largely unknown. We report that the mTORC1 pathway is transiently but robustly reactivated in dedifferentiating SCs. By inducible genetic deletion of the functionally crucial mTORC1-subunit Raptor in mouse SCs (including male and female animals), we found that mTORC1 reactivation is necessary for proper myelin clearance, SC dedifferentiation, and consequently remyelination, without major alterations in the inflammatory response. In the absence of mTORC1 signaling, c-Jun failed to be upregulated correctly. Accordingly, a c-Jun binding motif was found to be enriched in promoters of genes with reduced expression in injured mutants. Furthermore, using cultured SCs, we found that mTORC1 is involved in c-Jun regulation by promoting its translation, possibly via the eIF4F-subunit eIF4A. These results provide evidence that proper c-Jun elevation after nerve injury involves also mTORC1-dependent post-transcriptional regulation to ensure timely dedifferentiation of SCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; A crucial evolutionary acquisition of vertebrates is the envelopment of axons in myelin sheaths produced by oligodendrocytes in the CNS and Schwann cells (SCs) in the PNS. When myelin is damaged, conduction of action potentials along axons slows down or is blocked, leading to debilitating diseases. Unlike oligodendrocytes, SCs have a high regenerative potential, granted by their remarkable plasticity. Thus, understanding the mechanisms underlying SC plasticity may uncover new therapeutic targets in nerve regeneration and demyelinating diseases. Our work reveals that reactivation of the mTORC1 pathway in SCs is essential for efficient SC dedifferentiation after nerve injury. Accordingly, modulating this signaling pathway might be of therapeutic relevance in peripheral nerve injury and other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Canonical TGF-{beta} Signaling Negatively Regulates Neuronal Morphogenesis through TGIF/Smad Complex-Mediated CRMP2 Suppression</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/20/4791?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Functional neuronal connectivity requires proper neuronal morphogenesis and its dysregulation causes neurodevelopmental diseases. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family cytokines play pivotal roles in development, but little is known about their contribution to morphological development of neurons. Here we show that the Smad-dependent canonical signaling of TGF-β family cytokines negatively regulates neuronal morphogenesis during brain development. Mechanistically, activated Smads form a complex with transcriptional repressor TG-interacting factor (TGIF), and downregulate the expression of a neuronal polarity regulator, collapsin response mediator protein 2. We also demonstrate that TGF-β family signaling inhibits neurite elongation of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons. Furthermore, the expression of TGF-β receptor 1, Smad4, or TGIF, which have mutations found in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders, disrupted neuronal morphogenesis in both mouse (male and female) and human (female) neurons. Together, these findings suggest that the regulation of neuronal morphogenesis by an evolutionarily conserved function of TGF-β signaling is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Canonical transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling plays a crucial role in multiple organ development, including brain, and mutations in components of the signaling pathway associated with several human developmental disorders. In this study, we found that Smads/TG-interacting factor-dependent canonical TGF-β signaling regulates neuronal morphogenesis through the suppression of collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP2) expression during brain development, and that function of this signaling is evolutionarily conserved in the mammalian brain. Mutations in canonical TGF-β signaling factors identified in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders disrupt the morphological development of neurons. Thus, our results suggest that proper control of TGF-β/Smads/CRMP2 signaling pathways is critical for the precise execution of neuronal morphogenesis, whose impairment eventually results in neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Semaphorin3A Signaling Is Dispensable for Motor Axon Reinnervation of the Adult Neuromuscular Junction</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/3/ENEURO.0155-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a specialized synapse that is formed by motor axon innervation of skeletal muscle fibers. The maintenance of motor-muscle connectivity is critical for the preservation of muscle tone and generation of movement. Injury can induce a robust regenerative response in motor axons, but severe trauma or chronic denervation resulting from neurodegenerative disease typically leads to inefficient repair and poor functional recovery. The axon guidance molecule Semaphorin3A (Sema3A) has been implicated as a negative regulator of motor innervation. Upon binding to a plexinA-neuropilin1 (Npn1) receptor complex, Sema3A initiates a downstream signaling cascade that results in axonal repulsion. Here, we established a reproducible nerve crush model to quantify motor nerve regeneration. We then used that model to investigate the role of Sema3A signaling at the adult NMJ. In contrast to previous findings, we found that &lt;i&gt;Sema3A&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Npn1&lt;/i&gt; mRNA decrease in response to denervation, suggesting that Sema3A-Npn1 signaling may regulate NMJ reinnervation. To directly test that hypothesis, we used inducible knockout models to ubiquitously delete Sema3A or Npn1 from adult mice. Despite demonstrating that we could achieve highly efficient gene deletion, disruption of Sema3A-Npn1 signaling did not affect the normal maintenance of the NMJ or disrupt motor axon reinnervation after a denervating injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Term or Preterm Cesarean Section Delivery Does Not Lead to Long-term Detrimental Consequences in Mice</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy112/4996561?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Epidemiological studies have provided contradictory data on the deleterious sequels of cesarean section (C-section) delivery and their links with developmental brain disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorders. To gain better insight on these issues, we have now compared physiological, morphological, and behavioral parameters in vaginal, term, and preterm C-section delivered mice. We report that C-section delivery does not lead to long-term behavioral alterations though preterm C-section delivery modifies communicative behaviors in pups. Moreover, C-section delivery neither alters the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) developmental excitatory to inhibitory shift nor the frequency or amplitude of glutamatergic and GABAergic postsynaptic currents in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. However, these neurons present an underdeveloped dendritic arbor at birth in pups born by C-section delivery, but this difference disappears 1 day later suggesting an accelerated growth after birth. Therefore, C-section delivery, with prematurity as an aggravating factor, induces transient developmental delays but neither impacts the GABA developmental sequence nor leads to long-term consequences in mice. The deleterious sequels of C-section delivery described in epidemiological studies might be due to a perinatal insult that could be aggravated by C-section delivery.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Local gyrification may reflect the distribution and timing of aberrant cortical expansion in ASDs. We examined MRI data from (Study 1) 64 individuals with ASD and 64 typically developing (TD) controls (7–19 years), and from (Study 2) an independent sample from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 31/group). Local Gyrification Index (lGI), cortical thickness (CT), and surface area (SA) were measured. In Study 1, differences in lGI (ASD &amp;gt; TD) were found in left parietal and temporal and right frontal and temporal regions. lGI decreased bilaterally with age, but more steeply in ASD in left precentral, right lateral occipital, and middle frontal clusters. CT differed between groups in right perisylvian cortex (TD &amp;gt; ASD), but no differences were found for SA. Partial correlations between lGI and CT were generally negative, but associations were weaker in ASD in several clusters. Study 2 results were consistent, though less extensive. Altered gyrification may reflect unique information about the trajectory of cortical development in ASDs. While early overgrowth tends to be undetectable in later childhood in ASDs, findings may indicate that a trace of this developmental abnormality could remain in a disorder-specific pattern of gyrification.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Multiple Regions of a Cortical Network Commonly Encode the Meaning of Words in Multiple Grammatical Positions of Read Sentences</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy110/4996559?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Deciphering how sentence meaning is represented in the brain remains a major challenge to science. Semantically related neural activity has recently been shown to arise concurrently in distributed brain regions as successive words in a sentence are read. However, what semantic content is represented by different regions, what is common across them, and how this relates to words in different grammatical positions of sentences is weakly understood. To address these questions, we apply a semantic model of word meaning to interpret brain activation patterns elicited in sentence reading. The model is based on human ratings of 65 sensory/motor/emotional and cognitive features of experience with words (and their referents). Through a process of mapping functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging activation back into model space we test: which brain regions semantically encode content words in different grammatical positions (e.g., subject/verb/object); and what semantic features are encoded by different regions. In left temporal, inferior parietal, and inferior/superior frontal regions we detect the semantic encoding of words in all grammatical positions tested and reveal multiple common components of semantic representation. This suggests that sentence comprehension involves a common core representation of multiple words’ meaning being encoded in a network of regions distributed across the brain.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Sex differences in the human brain are of interest for many reasons: for example, there are sex differences in the observed prevalence of psychiatric disorders and in some psychological traits that brain differences might help to explain. We report the largest single-sample study of structural and functional sex differences in the human brain (2750 female, 2466 male participants; mean age 61.7 years, range 44–77 years). Males had higher raw volumes, raw surface areas, and white matter fractional anisotropy; females had higher raw cortical thickness and higher white matter tract complexity. There was considerable distributional overlap between the sexes. Subregional differences were not fully attributable to differences in total volume, total surface area, mean cortical thickness, or height. There was generally greater male variance across the raw structural measures. Functional connectome organization showed stronger connectivity for males in unimodal sensorimotor cortices, and stronger connectivity for females in the default mode network. This large-scale study provides a foundation for attempts to understand the causes and consequences of sex differences in adult brain structure and function.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

By analyzing gene expression in primary visual cortex of wild-type and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Otx2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;+/GFP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; mice at plastic and nonplastic ages, we identified several putative genes implicated in Otx2-dependent visual cortex plasticity for ocular dominance. Cortical OTX2 infusion in juvenile mice induced &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Gadd45b/g&lt;/span&gt; expression through direct regulation of transcription. Intriguingly, a reverse effect was found in the adult, where reducing cortical OTX2 resulted in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Gadd45b/g&lt;/span&gt; upregulation. Viral expression of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Gadd45b&lt;/span&gt; in adult visual cortex directly induced ocular dominance plasticity with concomitant changes in MeCP2 foci within parvalbumin interneurons and in methylation states of several plasticity gene promoters, suggesting epigenetic regulation. This interaction provides a molecular mechanism for OTX2 to trigger critical period plasticity yet suppress adult plasticity.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The dentate gyrus (DG) is hypothesized to be a pattern separator crucial for distinguishing similar memories. In this issue of Neuron, a new study by van Dijk and Fenton (2018) revealed that transient changes of firing patterns of DG ensembles, but not the remapping of session-averaged place fields, contributed to a place discrimination task.</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: PICK1-Deficient Mice Exhibit Impaired Response to Cocaine and Dysregulated Dopamine Homeostasis</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0422-17.2018v2?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Protein Interacting with C-Kinase 1 (PICK1) is a widely expressed scaffold protein known to interact via its PDZ domain with several membrane proteins including the dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT), the primary target for cocaine’s reinforcing actions. Here, we establish the importance of PICK1 for behavioral effects observed after both acute and repeated administration of cocaine. In PICK1 knockout (KO) mice, the acute locomotor response to a single injection of cocaine was markedly attenuated. Moreover, in support of a role for PICK1 in neuroadaptive changes induced by cocaine, we observed diminished cocaine intake in a self-administration paradigm. Reduced behavioral effects of cocaine were not associated with decreased striatal DAT distribution and most likely not caused by the ~30% reduction in synaptosomal DA uptake observed in PICK1 KO mice. The PICK1 KO mice demonstrated preserved behavioral responses to DA receptor agonists supporting intact downstream DA receptor signaling. Unexpectedly, we found a prominent increase in striatal DA content and levels of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in PICK1 KO mice. Chronoamperometric recordings showed enhanced DA release in PICK1 KO mice, consistent with increased striatal DA pools. Viral-mediated knockdown of PICK1 in cultured dopaminergic neurons increased TH expression, supporting a direct cellular effect of PICK1. In summary, in addition to demonstrating a key role of PICK1 in mediating behavioral effects of cocaine, our data reveal a so far unappreciated role of PICK1 in DA homeostasis that possibly involves negative regulation of striatal TH levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Cocaine addiction is a major societal problem and better treatments are needed. We demonstrate here the importance of the PDZ-domain scaffold protein PICK1 for both the acute reinforcing effects of cocaine and the long-term behavioral changes seen on repeated cocaine exposure. Interestingly, our data suggest that these alterations are independent of PICK1 binding to the primary target of cocaine, DAT. Moreover, our study reveals a novel role of PICK1 in maintenance of DA homeostasis that involves negative regulation of the levels of striatal TH, the rate-limiting enzyme in DA synthesis. Summarized, these data provide an important framework for further exploring the role of PICK1 in addiction and as putative target for treatment of psychostimulant abuse.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A common goal in data-analysis is to sift through a large data-matrix and detect any significant submatrices (i.e., biclusters) that have a low numerical rank. We present a simple algorithm for tackling this biclustering problem. Our algorithm accumulates information about 2-by-2 submatrices (i.e., ‘loops’) within the data-matrix, and focuses on rows and columns of the data-matrix that participate in an abundance of low-rank loops. We demonstrate, through analysis and numerical-experiments, that this loop-counting method performs well in a variety of scenarios, outperforming simple spectral methods in many situations of interest. Another important feature of our method is that it can easily be modified to account for aspects of experimental design which commonly arise in practice. For example, our algorithm can be modified to correct for controls, categorical- and continuous-covariates, as well as sparsity within the data. We demonstrate these practical features with two examples; the first drawn from gene-expression analysis and the second drawn from a much larger genome-wide-association-study (GWAS).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MbY469xyEU0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: RNA from Trained Aplysia Can Induce an Epigenetic Engram for Long-Term Sensitization in Untrained Aplysia</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0038-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The precise nature of the engram, the physical substrate of memory, remains uncertain. Here, it is reported that RNA extracted from the central nervous system of &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt; given long-term sensitization training induced sensitization when injected into untrained animals; furthermore, the RNA-induced sensitization, like training-induced sensitization, required DNA methylation. In cellular experiments, treatment with RNA extracted from trained animals was found to increase excitability in sensory neurons, but not in motor neurons, dissociated from naïve animals. Thus, the behavioral, and a subset of the cellular, modifications characteristic of a form of nonassociative long-term memory in &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt; can be transferred by RNA. These results indicate that RNA is sufficient to generate an engram for long-term sensitization in &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt; and are consistent with the hypothesis that RNA-induced epigenetic changes underlie memory storage in &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; It is generally accepted that long-term memory (LTM) is encoded as alterations in synaptic strength. An alternative model, however, proposes that LTM is encoded by epigenetic changes. Non-coding RNAs can mediate epigenetic modifications. Therefore, RNA from a trained animal might be capable of producing learning-like behavioral change in an untrained animal. Here, it is demonstrated that the memory for long-term sensitization in the marine mollusk &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt; can be successfully transferred by injecting RNA from sensitized into naïve animals. Moreover, a specific cellular alteration that underlies sensitization in &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt;, sensory neuron hyperexcitability, can be reproduced by exposing sensory neurons &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; to RNA from trained animals. The results provide support for a nonsynaptic, epigenetic model of memory storage in &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: PICK1-Deficient Mice Exhibit Impaired Response to Cocaine and Dysregulated Dopamine Homeostasis</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0422-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Protein Interacting with C-Kinase 1 (PICK1) is a widely expressed scaffold protein known to interact via its PDZ domain with several membrane proteins including the dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT), the primary target for cocaine’s reinforcing actions. Here, we establish the importance of PICK1 for behavioral effects observed after both acute and repeated administration of cocaine. In PICK1 knockout (KO) mice, the acute locomotor response to a single injection of cocaine was markedly attenuated. Moreover, in support of a role for PICK1 in neuroadaptive changes induced by cocaine, we observed diminished cocaine intake in a self-administration paradigm. Reduced behavioral effects of cocaine were not associated with decreased striatal DAT distribution and most likely not caused by the ~30% reduction in synaptosomal DA uptake observed in PICK1 KO mice. The PICK1 KO mice demonstrated preserved behavioral responses to DA receptor agonists supporting intact downstream DA receptor signaling. Unexpectedly, we found a prominent increase in striatal DA content and levels of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in PICK1 KO mice. Chronoamperometric recordings showed enhanced DA release in PICK1 KO mice, consistent with increased striatal DA pools. Viral-mediated knockdown of PICK1 in cultured dopaminergic neurons increased TH expression, supporting a direct cellular effect of PICK1. In summary, in addition to demonstrating a key role of PICK1 in mediating behavioral effects of cocaine, our data reveal a so far unappreciated role of PICK1 in DA homeostasis that possibly involves negative regulation of striatal TH levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Cocaine addiction is a major societal problem and better treatments are needed. We demonstrate here the importance of the PDZ-domain scaffold protein PICK1 for both the acute reinforcing effects of cocaine and the long-term behavioral changes seen on repeated cocaine exposure. Interestingly, our data suggest that these alterations are independent of PICK1 binding to the primary target of cocaine, DAT. Moreover, our study reveals a novel role of PICK1 in maintenance of DA homeostasis that involves negative regulation of the levels of striatal TH, the rate-limiting enzyme in DA synthesis. Summarized, these data provide an important framework for further exploring the role of PICK1 in addiction and as putative target for treatment of psychostimulant abuse.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Dbx1 Pre-Bötzinger Complex Interneurons Comprise the Core Inspiratory Oscillator for Breathing in Unanesthetized Adult Mice</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0130-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The brainstem pre-Bötzinger complex (preBötC) generates inspiratory breathing rhythms, but which neurons comprise its rhythmogenic core? Dbx1-derived neurons may play the preeminent role in rhythm generation, an idea well founded at perinatal stages of development but incompletely evaluated in adulthood. We expressed archaerhodopsin or channelrhodopsin in Dbx1 preBötC neurons in intact adult mice to interrogate their function. Prolonged photoinhibition slowed down or stopped breathing, whereas prolonged photostimulation sped up breathing. Brief inspiratory-phase photoinhibition evoked the next breath earlier than expected, whereas brief expiratory-phase photoinhibition delayed the subsequent breath. Conversely, brief inspiratory-phase photostimulation increased inspiratory duration and delayed the subsequent breath, whereas brief expiratory-phase photostimulation evoked the next breath earlier than expected. Because they govern the frequency and precise timing of breaths in awake adult mice with sensorimotor feedback intact, Dbx1 preBötC neurons constitute an essential core component of the inspiratory oscillator, knowledge directly relevant to human health and physiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Breathing behavior depends on rhythmic movements. The underlying neural rhythm for inspiration may originate due to brainstem interneurons defined genetically by expression of the embryonic transcription factor Dbx1. Dbx1-derived neurons comprise the core oscillator microcircuit in perinatal mice, but they serve other functions too, and their inspiratory rhythmogenic role has not been conclusively tested in adults. Optogenetic photostimulation and photoinhibition of Dbx1-derived brainstem neurons in intact adult mice modulated breathing, either speeding it up, slowing it down to the point of apnea (no breathing), or perturbing its phase, which are functions consistent with the rhythm generator. These results establish the cellular point of origin for breathing rhythm, a key physiologic brain function in humans and all mammals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: How stimulation frequency and intensity impact on the long-lasting effects of coordinated reset stimulation</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/rx9Yjw7JXhk/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Thanos Manos, Magteld Zeitler, Peter A. Tass&lt;/p&gt;

Several brain diseases are characterized by abnormally strong neuronal synchrony. Coordinated Reset (CR) stimulation was computationally designed to specifically counteract abnormal neuronal synchronization processes by desynchronization. In the presence of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) this may lead to a decrease of synaptic excitatory weights and ultimately to an anti-kindling, i.e. unlearning of abnormal synaptic connectivity and abnormal neuronal synchrony. The long-lasting desynchronizing impact of CR stimulation has been verified in pre-clinical and clinical proof of concept studies. However, as yet it is unclear how to optimally choose the CR stimulation frequency, i.e. the repetition rate at which the CR stimuli are delivered. This work presents the first computational study on the dependence of the acute and long-term outcome on the CR stimulation frequency in neuronal networks with STDP. For this purpose, CR stimulation was applied with Rapidly Varying Sequences (RVS) as well as with Slowly Varying Sequences (SVS) in a wide range of stimulation frequencies and intensities. Our findings demonstrate that acute desynchronization, achieved during stimulation, does not necessarily lead to long-term desynchronization after cessation of stimulation. By comparing the long-term effects of the two different CR protocols, the RVS CR stimulation turned out to be more robust against variations of the stimulation frequency. However, SVS CR stimulation can obtain stronger anti-kindling effects. We revealed specific parameter ranges that are favorable for long-term desynchronization. For instance, RVS CR stimulation at weak intensities and with stimulation frequencies in the range of the neuronal firing rates turned out to be effective and robust, in particular, if no closed loop adaptation of stimulation parameters is (technically) available. From a clinical standpoint, this may be relevant in the context of both invasive as well as non-invasive CR stimulation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rx9Yjw7JXhk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Bi-stability in cooperative transport by ants in the presence of obstacles</title>

To cooperatively carry large food items to the nest, individual ants conform their efforts and coordinate their motion. Throughout this expedition, collective motion is driven both by internal interactions between the carrying ants and a response to newly arrived informed ants that orient the cargo towards the nest. During the transport process, the carrying group must overcome obstacles that block their path to the nest. Here, we investigate the dynamics of cooperative transport, when the motion of the ants is frustrated by a linear obstacle that obstructs the motion of the cargo. The obstacle contains a narrow opening that serves as the only available passage to the nest, and through which single ants can pass but not with the cargo. We provide an analytical model for the ant-cargo system in the constrained environment that predicts a bi-stable dynamic behavior between an oscillatory mode of motion along the obstacle and a convergent mode of motion near the opening. Using both experiments and simulations, we show how for small cargo sizes, the system exhibits spontaneous transitions between these two modes of motion due to fluctuations in the applied force on the cargo. The bi-stability provides two possible problem solving strategies for overcoming the obstacle, either by attempting to pass through the opening, or take large excursions to circumvent the obstacle.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jPqnVrYLq7g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Porcupine: A visual pipeline tool for neuroimaging analysis</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/OPful2fUMb8/article</link>

The field of neuroimaging is rapidly adopting a more reproducible approach to data acquisition and analysis. Data structures and formats are being standardised and data analyses are getting more automated. However, as data analysis becomes more complicated, researchers often have to write longer analysis scripts, spanning different tools across multiple programming languages. This makes it more difficult to share or recreate code, reducing the reproducibility of the analysis. We present a tool, Porcupine, that constructs one’s analysis visually and automatically produces analysis code. The graphical representation improves understanding of the performed analysis, while retaining the flexibility of modifying the produced code manually to custom needs. Not only does Porcupine produce the analysis code, it also creates a shareable environment for running the code in the form of a Docker image. Together, this forms a reproducible way of constructing, visualising and sharing one’s analysis. Currently, Porcupine links to Nipype functionalities, which in turn accesses most standard neuroimaging analysis tools. Our goal is to release researchers from the constraints of specific implementation details, thereby freeing them to think about novel and creative ways to solve a given problem. Porcupine improves the overview researchers have of their processing pipelines, and facilitates both the development and communication of their work. This will reduce the threshold at which less expert users can generate reusable pipelines. With Porcupine, we bridge the gap between a conceptual and an implementational level of analysis and make it easier for researchers to create reproducible and shareable science. We provide a wide range of examples and documentation, as well as installer files for all platforms on our website: https://timvanmourik.github.io/Porcupine. Porcupine is free, open source, and released under the GNU General Public License v3.0.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OPful2fUMb8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Nonlinear decoding of a complex movie from the mammalian retina</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/0tROk9h9FSA/article</link>

Retina is a paradigmatic system for studying sensory encoding: the transformation of light into spiking activity of ganglion cells. The inverse problem, where stimulus is reconstructed from spikes, has received less attention, especially for complex stimuli that should be reconstructed “pixel-by-pixel”. We recorded around a hundred neurons from a dense patch in a rat retina and decoded movies of multiple small randomly-moving discs. We constructed nonlinear (kernelized and neural network) decoders that improved significantly over linear results. An important contribution to this was the ability of nonlinear decoders to reliably separate between neural responses driven by locally fluctuating light signals, and responses at locally constant light driven by spontaneous-like activity. This improvement crucially depended on the precise, non-Poisson temporal structure of individual spike trains, which originated in the spike-history dependence of neural responses. We propose a general principle by which downstream circuitry could discriminate between spontaneous and stimulus-driven activity based solely on higher-order statistical structure in the incoming spike trains.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0tROk9h9FSA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Differential Deployment of Visual Attention During Interactive Approach and Avoidance Behavior</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy105/4994603?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The ability to coordinate approach and avoidance actions in dynamic environments represents the boundary between extinction and the continued survival of many animal species. It is therefore crucial that sensory systems allocate limited attentional resources to the most relevant information to facilitate planning and execution of appropriate actions. Prominent theories of how attention regulates visual processing focus on the distinction between behaviorally relevant and irrelevant visual inputs. To date, however, no study has directly compared the deployment of attention to visual inputs relevant for approach and avoidance behaviors, which naturally occur in dynamic, interactive environments. In two experiments, we combined electroencephalography, frequency tagging, and eye gaze measures to investigate whether the deployment of visual selective attention differs for items relevant for approach and avoidance actions. Participants maneuvered a cursor to approach and avoid contact with moving items in a continuous interactive task. The results indicated that while the approach and avoidance tasks recruited equivalent attentional resources overall, attentional biases were directed toward task-relevant items during approach, and away from task-relevant items during avoidance. We conclude that the deployment of visual attention is guided not only by relevance to a behavioral goal, but also by the nature of that goal.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Independent Early and Late Sensory Processes for Proprioceptive Integration When Planning a Step</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy104/4994602?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Somatosensory inputs to the cortex undergo an early and a later stage of processing which are characterized by an early and a late somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP). The early response is highly representative of the stimulus characteristics whereas the late response reflects a more integrative, task specific, stage of sensory processing. We hypothesized that the later processing stage is independent of the early processing stage. We tested the prediction that a reduction of the first volley of input to the cortex should not prevent the increase of the late SEP. Using the sensory interference phenomenon, we halved the amplitude of the early response to somatosensory input of the ankle joints (evoked by vibration) when participants either planned a step forward or remained still. Despite the initial cortical response to the vibration being massively decreased in both tasks, the late response was still enhanced during step planning. Source localization indicated the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) as the likely origin of the late response modulation. Overall these results support the dissociation between the processes underlying the early and late SEP. The later processing stage could involve both direct and indirect thalamic connections to PPC which bypass the postcentral somatosensory cortex.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Adult Human Hippocampus: No New Neurons in Sight</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy106/4994244?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;In this issue of Cerebral Cortex, Cipriani et al. are following up on the recent report of Sorrels et al. to add novel immunohistological observations indicating that, unlike rodents, adult and aging humans do not acquire new neurons in the hippocampus. The common finding emerging from these 2 different, but almost simultaneous studies is highly significant because the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus was, until recently, considered as the only structure in the human brain that may continue neurogenesis throughout the full life span.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: RIPK3/MLKL-Mediated Neuronal Necroptosis Modulates the M1/M2 Polarization of Microglia/Macrophages in the Ischemic Cortex</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy089/4994243?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Cell death and subsequent inflammation are 2 key pathological changes occurring in cerebral ischemia. Active microglia/macrophages play a double-edged role depending on the balance of their M1/M2 phenotypes. Necrosis is the predominant type of cell death following ischemia. However, how necrotic cells modulate the M1/M2 polarization of microglia/macrophages remains poorly investigated. Here, we reported that ischemia induces a rapid RIPK3/MLKL-mediated neuron-dominated necroptosis, a type of programmed necrosis. Ablating RIPK3 or MLKL could switch the activation of microglia/macrophages from M1 to the M2 type in the ischemic cortex. Conditioned medium of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-treated wild-type (WT) neurons induced M1 polarization, while that of RIPK3&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; neurons favored M2 polarization. OGD treatment induces proinflammatory IL-18 and TNFα in WT but not in RIPK3&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; neurons, which in turn upregulate anti-inflammatory IL-4 and IL-10. Furthermore, the expression of Myd88—a common downstream adaptor of toll-like receptors—is significantly upregulated in the microglia/macrophages of ischemic WT but not of RIPK3&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; or MLKL&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; cortices. Antagonizing the function of Myd88 could phenocopy the effects of RIPK3/MLKL-knockout on the polarization of microglia/macrophages and was neuroprotective. Our data revealed a novel role of necroptotic neurons in modulating the M1/M2 balance of microglia/macrophages in the ischemic cortex, possibly through Myd88 signaling.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;It has been recently found that the human dorso-central insular cortex contributes to the execution and recognition of the affective component of hand actions, most likely through modulation of the activity of the parieto-frontal circuits. While the anatomical connections between the hand representation of the insula and, the parietal and frontal regions controlling reaching/grasping actions is well assessed in the monkey, it is unknown the existence of a homolog circuit in humans. In the present study, we performed a multifiber tractography investigation to trace the tracts possibly connecting the insula to the parieto-frontal circuits by locating seeds in the parietal, premotor, and prefrontal nodes of the reaching/grasping network, in both humans and monkeys. Results showed that, in both species, the insula is connected with the cortical action execution/recognition circuit by similar white matter tracts, running in parallel to the third branch of the superior longitudinal fasciculus and the anterior segment of the arcuate fasciculus.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Many neuronal circuits contain, or are influenced by, colocalized neurotransmitters, which are suggested to fine-tune circuit function. Much of our knowledge about cotransmission derives from studies in non-mammalian model systems, although a growing number of studies have provided insights into the physiological role of cotransmission in more complex mammalian circuits, including the spinal cord. Here we discuss the current picture of colocalized neurotransmitters in spinal circuits of non-mammalian and mammalian systems, as well as the progression towards understanding of their functional roles.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>People with Parkinson’s disease (PD) show impaired decision-making when sensory and memory information must be combined. This recently identified impairment results from an inability to accumulate the proper amount of information needed to make a decision and appears to be independent of dopamine tone and reinforcement learning mechanisms. Although considerable work focuses on PD and decisions involving risk and reward, in this Opinion article we propose that the emerging findings in perceptual decision-making highlight the multisystem nature of PD, and that unraveling the neuronal circuits underlying perceptual decision-making impairment may help in understanding other cognitive impairments in people with PD.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Frequency-specific patterns of neural activity are increasingly interpreted as transient bursts of isolated events rather than as rhythmically sustained oscillations. This has potentially far-reaching implications for theories of how such oscillations originate and how they shape neural computations. As this debate unfolds, we explore alternative interpretations and ask how best to distinguish between them.</content:encoded>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Fornical Closed-Loop Stimulation for Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(18)30083-3?rss=yes</link>
	<content:encoded>Pharmacological neuromodulation strategies have shown limited efficacy in treating memory deficits related to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Despite encouraging results from a few preclinical studies, clinical trials investigating open-loop deep brain stimulation (DBS) for AD have not been successful. Recent refinements in understanding the various phases of memory processes, animal studies investigating phase-specific modulation of hippocampal activity during memorization, and clinical studies using closed-loop DBS strategies to treat patients with movement disorders, all point to the need to investigate closed-loop fornical DBS strategies to better understand memory dynamics and potentially treat memory deficits in AD preclinical models.</content:encoded>
