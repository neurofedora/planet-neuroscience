	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: ClC-2-like Chloride Current Alterations in a Cell Model of Spinal and Bulbar Muscular Atrophy, a Polyglutamine Disease</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-020-01687-5</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a neuromuscular disease caused by expansions of a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the androgen receptor (AR) gene. SBMA is associated with the progressive loss of lower motor neurons, together with muscle weakness and atrophy. PolyQ-AR is converted to a toxic species upon binding to its natural ligands, testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Our previous patch-clamp studies on a motor neuron-derived cell model of SBMA showed alterations in voltage-gated ion currents. Here, we identified and characterized chloride currents most likely belonging to the chloride channel-2 (ClC-2) subfamily, which showed significantly increased amplitudes in the SBMA cells. The treatment with the pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), a neuropeptide with a proven protective effect in a mouse model of SBMA, recovered chloride channel current alterations in SBMA cells. These observations suggest that the CIC-2 currents are affected in SBMA, an alteration that may contribute and potentially determine the pathophysiology of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Identification of Key Genes and Pathways in Mouse Spinal Cord Involved in ddC-Induced Neuropathic Pain by Transcriptome Sequencing</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-020-01686-6</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) works effectively in inhibiting HIV replication in patients. However, the use of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) often causes side effects of neuropathic pain, and its mechanism remains to be elucidated. Therefore, we aim to explore the mechanism of NRTIs-induced neuropathic pain at the transcriptome level. C57BL/6 J mice were given intraperitoneal injection of zalcitabine (ddC) or saline (control) for 2 weeks, during which the mechanical pain threshold of the mice was detected by von Frey test. Then the L3~L5 spinal segments of the mice were isolated and subsequently used for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on the last day of treatment. The mechanical pain threshold of mice given ddC decreased significantly. Compared with the control group, ddC caused significant changes in the expression of 135 genes, of which 66 upregulated and 69 downregulated. Enrichment analysis showed that the functions of these genes are mainly enriched in regulation of transcription, multicellular organism development, and cell differentiation, and the pathway is mainly enriched in the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway and AMPK signaling pathway. Furthermore, key genes such as Gabrd, Kcnd3, Npcd, Insr, Lypd6, Scd2, and Mef2d were also identified. These may serve as drug targets for the prevention or treatment of NRTI-induced neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: The Effect of Optogenetic Inhibition of the Anterior Cingulate Cortex in Neuropathic Pain Following Sciatic Nerve Injury</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-020-01685-7</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cortical disinhibition is the underlying pathological alteration contributing to neuropathic pain associated with peripheral nerve injury. Nerve injury resulting in disinhibition of the anterior cingulate cortex has been reported. However, the effect of optogenetic inhibition of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) on the sensory component of nerve injury–induced neuropathic pain has not been well studied. To investigate the feasibility of optogenetic ACC modulation, we injected an optogenetic virus or a null virus into the ACC of a nerve injury–induced neuropathic pain model. The unilateral ACC was modulated, and the optogenetic effect was measured by mechanical and thermal sensitivity tests. The assessment was performed in “pre—light off,” “stimulation—yellow light on,” and “post—light off” states. Optogenetic inhibition of the ACC in injury models revealed improved mechanical and thermal latencies with profound pain-relieving effects against nerve injury–induced neuropathic pain. The sensory thalamic discharge in electrophysiological in vivo recordings was also altered during laser stimulation. This finding indicates that hyperactivity of the ACC in nerve injury increases output to the spinothalamic tract through direct or indirect pathways. The direct photoinhibition of ACC neurons could play a vital role in restoring equilibrium and provide novel insight into techniques that can assuage peripheral nerve injury–induced neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Cadaverine and Spermine Elicit Ca 2+ Uptake in Human CP Cells via a Trace Amine-Associated Receptor 1 Dependent Pathway</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-020-01684-8</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The choroid plexus (CP) constitutes a barrier between the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which regulates the exchange of substances between these two fluids through mechanisms that are not completely understood. Polyamines as spermine, spermidine and putrescine are produced by all cells and are present in the CSF. Interestingly, their levels are altered in some neuronal disorders as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, thus increasing the interest in their signalling in the central nervous system (CNS). Cadaverine, on the other hand, is synthetized by the intestinal microbiome, suggesting that the presence of this bacterial metabolite in the CSF requires that it is up taken to the CNS across brain barriers. We knew that polyamines are detected by the olfactory signalling cascade operating at the CP, but the receptor involved had not been identified. The zebrafish TAAR13c was the only receptor known to bind a polyamine-cadaverine. Thus, we searched for a human receptor with homology to TAAR13c and found that some human TAARs including TAAR1 showed great homology. Then, we confirmed the expression of TAAR1 mRNA and protein in a human cell line of the CP, and in human CP samples. Calcium imaging assays after TAAR1 knockdown in these cells with a specific siRNA against TAAR1 showed a consistent reduction in the responses of these cells to cadaverine and spermidine, but not to spermine, suggesting that TAAR1 is activated by cadaverine and spermidine, but not spermine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) plays a crucial role in controlling the resolution of inflammation. In this study, we aimed to assess gene expression and the level of IL-10 in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of rats, after a single injection of neurotoxicant trimethyltin chloride (TMT). It was shown that 4 weeks after the treatment with TMT, the level of IL-10 in the prefrontal cortex, but not in the hippocampus of TMT-treated rats, was increased. However, expression level of IL-10 mRNA was upregulated both in the hippocampus and in the prefrontal cortex 3 weeks after the injection. Concomitantly, within the same post-treatment period, the expression level of the cyclooxygenase-2 was upregulated in both brain structures, indicating the induction of neuroinflammation. Considering that TMT leads to the death of neurons mainly in the hippocampus, we assume that in contrast to the prefrontal cortex, the level of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in the hippocampus is not sufficiently increased to prevent the damaging effect of the neurotoxicant. Therefore, an exogenous increase in the level of IL-10 may be useful for the survival of neurons in conditions of neurotoxic damage to the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The previously reported cluster of variants in the last part of exon 30 and the beginning of exon 31 of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CREBBP&lt;/em&gt;, overlapping with the ZNF2 (zinc finger, ZZ-type; residues 1701 to 1744) and ZNF3 (zinc finger, TAZ-type; residues 1764 to 1853) domains, is associated with atypical RSTS. The main features include developmental delay, short stature, microcephaly, distinctive facial features, autistic behavior, feeding difficulties, recurrent upper airway infections, and hearing impairment. Here, we report a 2-year-7-month-old Chinese girl presenting mild cognitive impairments, developmental delay, short stature, recurrent upper airway infections, and facial dysmorphism that resembled the phenotypes of previously reported atypical RSTS patients. The characteristic facial and limb dysmorphism for RSTS was absent in our patient. In addition, our patient exhibited novel phenotypes including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), sleep problem, and abnormal walking posture. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) identified a novel de novo in-frame deletion variant in the beginning of exon 30 of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CREBBP&lt;/em&gt; (NM_004380:c.4897_4899delTTC, p.Phe1633del) in the HAT domain where no pathogenic variants have been previously reported to be responsible for atypical RSTS. Our case allows us to more accurately define the borders of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CREBBP&lt;/em&gt; coding sequence resulting in atypical RSTS, which are extended to the beginning of exon 30 (residue 1633) at the 5′ end of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CREBBP&lt;/em&gt; in the HAT domain, and reveals novel phenotypes observed in our atypical Chinese RSTS patient.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;KLF4 is a zinc-finger transcription factor that plays an essential role in many biological processes, including neuroinflammation, neuron regeneration, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Through effects on these processes, KLF4 has likely roles in Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and traumatic brain injury. However, little is known about the role of KLF4 in more immediate behavioral processes that similarly depend upon broad changes in brain excitability, such as the sleep process. Here, behavioral approaches, western blot, and immunohistochemical experiments were used to explore the role of KLF4 on sedation and the potential mechanisms of those effects. The results showed that overexpression of KLF4 prolonged loss of righting reflex (LORR) duration in pentobarbital-treated mice and increased c-Fos expression in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO), while it decreased c-Fos expression in the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN). Moreover, overexpression of KLF4 reduced the expression of p53 in the hypothalamus and increased the expression of STAT3 in the hypothalamus. Therefore, these results suggest that KLF4 exerts sedative effects through the regulation of p53 and STAT3 expression, and it indicates a role of KLF4 ligands in the treatment of sleep disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Spinal cord microcirculation plays an important role in maintaining the function of spinal cord neurons and other cells. Previous studies have largely focused on the ability of microtubule stabilization to inhibit the fibroblast migration and promote axon regeneration after spinal cord injury (SCI). However, the effect of microtubule stabilization treatment on microcirculation reconstruction after SCI remains unclear. By using immunofluorescence, we found that microtubule stabilization treatment improved microcirculation reconstruction via increasing the number of microvessels, pericytes, and the perfused microvessels after SCI. To clarify the underlying mechanisms, rat brain microvascular endothelial cells and pericytes were subjected to glucose oxygen deprivation. By using flow cytometry and western blotting, we found that microtubule stabilization treatment inhibited apoptosis and migration of endothelial cells and pericytes but promoted proliferation and survival of endothelial cells and pericytes through upregulated expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), VEGF receptor 2, platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGFB), PDGF receptor β, and angiopoietin-1 after SCI. Taken together, this study provides evidence for the mechanisms underlying the promotion of microcirculation reconstruction after SCI by microtubule stabilization treatment. Importantly, this study suggests the potential of microtubule stabilization as a therapeutic target to reduce microcirculation dysfunction after SCI in the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative condition characterized by motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, resting tremor, and rigidity. PD diagnosis is based on medical history, review of signs, symptoms, neurological and physical examinations. Unfortunately, by the time the disease is diagnosed, dopamine (DA) neuronal loss is often extended, thereby resulting in ineffective therapies. Recent evidence suggests that neuroinflammation may be pivotal during PD onset and progression. However, suitable cellular models and biomarkers to detect early signs of neuroinflammation are still missing. In this study, we developed a well-differentiated DAergic neuronal cell line where we triggered a neuroinflammatory response to assess the temporal expression of the tissue- and urokinase plasminogen activators (tPA and uPA) and their endogenous inhibitor (PAI-1) along with that of pro-inflammatory mediators and the neuronal marker nNOS. Human neuroblastoma cells SH-SY5Y were differentiated into DAergic neuronal-like cells using a combination of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and serum depletion. Terminally-differentiated neurons were then exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for short (up to 24 h) or long term (up to 10 days) to mimic acute or chronic inflammation. Results demonstrated that uPA protein expression was stably upregulated during chronic inflammation, whereas the expression of nNOS protein better reflected the cellular response to acute inflammation. Additional studies revealed that the temporal induction of uPA was associated with increased AKT phosphorylation, but did not seem to involve cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) activation, nor the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. In conclusion, our in vitro data suggests that nNOS and uPA may serve as viable candidate biomarkers of acute and chronic neuroinflammation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: The Role of EZH2 Inhibitor, GSK-126, in Seizure Susceptibility</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;GSK-126 is recognized as an inhibitor of enhancer of zeste homolog-2 (EZH2) activity. Because of its inhibition of EZH2 activation, GSK-126 is considered a potential anti-tumor drug. EZH2 is a histone methyltransferase that catalyzes histone 3 tri-methylation at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), resulting in gene silencing. A previous report showed that decreased H3K27me3 levels in the hippocampus may promote seizure susceptibility, possibly restricting the clinical application of GSK-126. The role of GSK-126 in seizure susceptibility was investigated in this study. We first determined a critical concentration of pentamethazol (PTZ) under which mice exhibit no seizures. We then found that mice pretreated with GSK-126 and injected with the same concentration of PTZ experienced marked convulsions. Peripheral injections of GSK-126 decreased H3K27me3 levels in the hippocampus of mice, while some seizure-related genes (Oasl1, Sox7, armcx5, Ncx3, etc.) were found to be differentially expressed in the hippocampus of those mice . These differences in the expression levels might reflect the crucial role of these genes and related pathways in the promotion of seizure susceptibility. Our results suggest that GSK-126 promotes seizure susceptibility due to its role as an EZH2 inhibitor. These findings may provide evidence to support the development of GSK-126 as a clinical drug.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The mutation of the homeostatic iron regulatory genes (HFE) impaired the hepatic hepcidin transcription leading to the chronic excess of the iron pool, with the adverse consequences of free radical oxidative damages. We herein reported the findings of Thai family members who had the compound of uncommon HFE rs2794719, together with transferrin (TF) rs1867504, transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2) rs7385804, and hemojuvelin (HJV) rs16827043 genetic variants involved in the hepcidin transcriptional pathway. These compounded genetic variants could produce the spectrum of clinical phenotypes that spanned from mild to moderate symptoms of chronic anemia to an established motor neuron disorder. The feasible pathophysiologies were the impairment of the transferrin receptor functions, which affected the endocytic uptake of halo-transferrin into the erythroblast precursors. Such a defect left the erythropoiesis depleted of their iron supply. These alterations also promoted the TfR-independent uptake of iron into other target tissues and left the TrF2/BMP-dependent-hepcidin activation pathway unattended. We used the predicted molecular interactive proteomes to support our speculated dysregulated iron metabolism. During the early stage of an elevated ferritin level, there was no inhibition of ferroportin activities from hepcidin. These pathophysiological processes went on to the point of an iron overload threshold. After that, the hepcidin transcription started to kick in with the resulting decreased serum iron levels and deterioration of clinical symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Mechanisms and progression of ischemic injuries in the retina are still incompletely clarified. Therefore, the time course of microglia activation as well as resulting cytokine expression and downstream signaling were investigated. Ischemia was induced in one eye by transiently elevated intraocular pressure (60 min) followed by reperfusion; the other eye served as a control. Eyes were processed for RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry analyses at 2, 6, 12, and 24 h as well as at 3 and 7 days. Already 2 h after ischemia, more microglia/macrophages were in an active state in the ischemia group. This was accompanied by an upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, and TGFβ. Activation of TLR3, TLR2, and the adaptor molecule Myd88 was also observed after 2 h. NFκB revealed a wave-like activation pattern. In addition, an extrinsic caspase pathway activation was noted at early time points, while enhanced numbers of cleaved caspase 3&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells could be observed in ischemic retinae throughout the study. Retinal ischemia induced an early and strong microglia/macrophage response as well as cytokine and apoptotic activation processes. Moreover, in early and late ischemic damaging processes, TLR expression and downstream signaling were involved, suggesting an involvement in neuronal death in ischemic retinae.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The effective prevention of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) needs to be explored, and the effect of preoperative pain on POCD remains unclear. We established a chronic pain model induced by chronic constriction injury (CCI) and models of acute pain and anxiety without pain in mice that were subsequently subjected to partial hepatectomy surgery. Morris water maze (MWM) tests were performed to evaluate the learning and memory abilities of the mice. ELISA was used to measure IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in serum, and HPLC-MS was used to detect neurotransmitters in the prefrontal cortices and hippocampi of the mice. The results indicated that chronic pain induced by CCI might have significantly impaired the learning and memory abilities of mice, while acute pain and anxiety without pain only affected the memory abilities of mice. Perioperative acute pain increased the level of IL-1β in serum, and CCI might have increased the level of IL-6. CCI and acute pain increased dopamine (DA) levels in the cortex, similar to anxiety. Like anxiety, CCI increased 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Acute pain led to a decrease in the acetylcholine (ACH) level in the hippocampus. Our results suggest that acute pain and CCI-induced chronic pain might aggravate postoperative cognitive dysfunction via neurotransmitters and by changing the levels of inflammatory factors such as IL-1β and IL-6.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Even with increased understanding of immunology, the specific etiological trigger of MS remains unknown. Evidence suggests that oxidative/nitroxidative stress is an important contributor to MS etiology, progression, and clinical symptoms. A multifaceted treatment approach aimed at counteracting oxidative/nitroxidative stress including MS disease–modifying medications, Mediterranean style diet, stress-relieving activities, smoking and alcohol cessation, exercise, and peer support programs is the best way to treat the disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Due to molecular mimicry, maternal antibacterial antibodies are suspected to promote neurodevelopmental changes in the offspring that finally can cause disorders like autism and schizophrenia. Using a human first trimester prenatal brain multiprotein array (MPA), we demonstrate here that antibodies to the digestive tract bacteria &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Helicobacter pylori&lt;/em&gt; (α-&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;HPy&lt;/em&gt;) and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Campylobacter jejuni&lt;/em&gt; (α-&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CJe&lt;/em&gt;) interact with different synaptic proteins, including the calcium sensor synaptotagmin 5 (Syt5). Interactions of both antisera with Syt5 were confirmed by Western blot with a HEK293-cells overexpression lysate of this protein. Immunofluorescence and Western blotting revealed SiMa cells to express Syt5, which also co-migrated with a band/spot labeled by either α-&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;HPy&lt;/em&gt; or α-&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CJe&lt;/em&gt;. Functionally, a 12-h pretreatment of SiMa cells with 10 μg/ml of either α-&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;HPy&lt;/em&gt; or α-&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CJe&lt;/em&gt; resulted in a significant reduction of acetylcholine(ACh)-dependent calcium signals as compared to controls. Also ACh-dependent vesicle recycling was significantly reduced in cells pretreated with either α-&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;HPy&lt;/em&gt; or α-&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CJe&lt;/em&gt;. Similar effects were observed upon pretreatment of SiMa cells with Syt5-specific antibodies. In conclusion, the present study supports the view that prenatal maternal antibacterial immune responses towards &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;HPy&lt;/em&gt; and by this to Syt5 are able to cause functional changes, which in the end might contribute also to neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting the ventral midbrain dopaminergic neurons, resulting in motor defects mainly tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia along with a wide array of non-motor symptoms. The current study is focused on determining the potential druggable targets of PD by consolidating gene expression profiling and network methodology. Initially, the differentially expressed genes were established from which the central network was constructed by assimilating the interacting partners. Investigating the topological parameters of the network, the genes &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SYT1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CXCR4&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CDC42&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;KIT&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;RET&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;DRD2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;NTN1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PRKACB&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;KDR&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;NR4A2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SLC18A2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CCK&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TH&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;KCNJ6&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TAC1&lt;/em&gt; were identified as the hub genes and can be explored as potential candidate genes for PD therapeutics. Gene ontology and cluster analysis of the hub genes has provided further insights about the pathophysiology of the disease. Among the hub genes, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PRKACB&lt;/em&gt; is observed in relatively all the enriched pathways which are modulated by G protein-coupled receptors through protein kinases. Further, we noticed &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SYT1&lt;/em&gt; as a novel biomarker for PD. Moreover, the regulatory network was constructed with the hub genes as seed nodes with associated transcription factors (TFs) and microRNA (miRNAs). In this analysis, we identified MYC as the major TF and the miRNAs &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;miR-21&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;miR-155&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;miR-7&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;miR26A1&lt;/em&gt; have a significant role in modulating the hub genes. Briefly, these significant hub genes and their enriched pathways, TFs, and miRNAs have aided in the better understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying PD and its potential core target genes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Recent studies have shed light on the involvement of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the initiation and development of stroke. However, the regulatory function of many lncRNAs in large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) has not been fully elucidated. Based on the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) hypothesis recently proposed by Pandolfi, the present study was conducted using experimental techniques and bioinformatics to investigate the expression and regulatory function of a lncRNA involved in the development of LAA. The lncRNAs differentially expressed in stroke were obtained using meta-analysis, and one lncRNA was selected for experimental studies on patients with LAA (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 100) and healthy controls (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 100) using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The patients were also evaluated through meta-analysis to identify the function of the selected lncRNA, miRNAs, and mRNAs with altered expression in stroke. Finally, the experimental results and meta-analysis findings were integrated, and different functional groups were assigned. The results indicated that the level of lncRNA-RUNX1-IT1 was significantly lower in the patients with LAA compared to the healthy control subjects (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;gt; 0.05). Logistic regression analyses revealed that the expression of lncRNA-RUNX1-IT1 was inversely correlated with LAA (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 009, OR = 0.871, 95% CI: 0.786–0.965). In addition, a network of differentially expressed genes (DE genes) was created for miRNAs and mRNAs based on their association with lncRNA-RUNX1-IT1. Functional analysis showed that the DE genes in the network are involved in the apoptosis and alternative splicing of RNAs. The findings of the present study suggest that the downregulation of lncRNA-RUNX1-IT1 is associated with LAA development by interrupting the regulatory network of cells. The results of network analysis demonstrated that the lncRNA-RUNX1-IT1 could influence the expression of mRNAs and miRNAs involved in the apoptosis and alternative splicing of RNAs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Despite the putative advantages of MgSO&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as a neuroprotective agent in the preterm brain, the short- and long-term molecular function of MgSO&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as a neuroprotective agent has not been fully elucidated. Neuregulin (NRG1)-ErbB4 signaling plays a critical role in embryonic brain development, in the biology of dopaminergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic systems. We hypothesize that this pathway may be associated with the neuroprotective role of MgSO&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The current study aims to investigate the ability of MgSO&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to modulate the normal developing expression pattern of selected genes related to the NRG1-ErbB, dopaminergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic systems. We demonstrate that overall short-term treatment of dam rats with MgSO&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; affects the expression of fetal brain NRG1, NRG3, ErbB4, GAD67, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine D&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, GluN1, and GluN2B. More specifically, the administration of MgSO&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; alters the expression of NRG-ErbB, GAD67, TH, and D2R at early gestation day 16 (GD16) regardless of the activation of the maternal immune system by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Our data suggest that MgSO&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; treatment may affect the expression of major neuronal systems and pathways mostly at an early gestation day. These changes might be an initial clue (foundation stone) in the molecular mechanism that underlies the beneficial effect of MgSO&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as a neuroprotective agent for the developmental brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Psychosocial stress has been widely reported to contribute to psychiatric disturbances. Perturbations in the enzymes of GABAergic and cholinergic systems have been implicated as precursors in different stress-related neuropsychiatric diseases. Targeting glutamic acid decarboxylase-67 kDa (GAD67) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) via oxidative, nitrergic, and neuroinflammatory mechanisms have been recognized as prospective strategies for the prevention of psychosocial stress-induced behavioral impairments. Naringin, a neuro-active flavonoid compound isolated from citrus fruits, has been shown to produce memory-enhancing, antiepileptic, antidepressant, and anti-inflammatory activities similarly to ginseng, a very potent adaptogen. In this communication, we assessed the effect of naringin on social-defeat stress (SDS)-induced behavioral, GABAergic, cholinergic, oxidative, nitrergic, and neuroinflammatory changes in mice using the resident–intruder paradigm. The intruder male mice were culled into six groups. Groups 1 and 2 (normal- and SDS-controls) received sterile saline, groups 3–5 were given naringin (25-100 mg/kg, i.p.) whereas group 6 had ginseng (50 mg/kg, i.p.) daily for 14 days, but followed by 10 min SDS (physical and psychological) exposure to groups 2–6 with aggressor–resident mice. Behavioral effects using Y-maze, elevated-plus maze, sociability, and tail-suspension tests were assessed on day 14. GAD67, AChE enzymes, and biomarkers of oxidative, nitrergic, and neuroinflammatory changes were assayed in the striatum, prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus. Naringin and ginseng reversed all SDS-induced behavioral impairments. Naringin increased the levels of GAD67 and decreased AChE activities in the striatum, prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus. Furthermore, naringin reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6), malondialdehyde, nitrite concentrations, and increased glutathione levels in a region-dependent manner. Our study suggests that naringin attenuated SDS-induced behavioral endophenotypes of neuropsychiatric disease through increased GAD67 synthesis, inhibition of AChE activity, oxidative, nitrergic stress, and neuroinflammatory processes in stress-sensitive brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01633</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We analyze the computational power of discrete-time recurrent neural networks
(NNs) with the saturated-linear activation function within the Chomsky
hierarchy. This model restricted to integer weights coincides with binary-state
NNs with the Heaviside activation function, which are equivalent to finite
automata (Chomsky level 3) recognizing regular languages (REG), while rational
weights make this model Turing-complete even for three analog-state units
(Chomsky level 0). For the intermediate model $\alpha$ANN of a binary-state NN
that is extended with $\alpha\geq 0$ extra analog-state neurons with rational
weights, we have established the analog neuron hierarchy 0ANNs $\subset$ 1ANNs
$\subset$ 2ANNs $\subseteq$ 3ANNs. The separation 1ANNs $\subsetneqq$ 2ANNs has
been witnessed by the non-regular deterministic context-free language (DCFL)
$L_\#=\{0^n1^n\mid n\geq 1\}$ which cannot be recognized by any 1ANN even with
real weights, while any DCFL (Chomsky level 2) is accepted by a 2ANN with
rational weights. In this paper, we strengthen this separation by showing that
any non-regular DCFL cannot be recognized by 1ANNs with real weights, which
means (DCFLs $\setminus$ REG) $\subset$ (2ANNs $\setminus$ 1ANNs), implying
1ANNs $\cap$ DCFLs = 0ANNs. For this purpose, we have shown that $L_\#$ is the
simplest non-regular DCFL by reducing $L_\#$ to any language in this class,
which is by itself an interesting achievement in computability theory.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;High-dimensional depth separation results for neural networks show that
certain functions can be efficiently approximated by two-hidden-layer networks
but not by one-hidden-layer ones in high-dimensions $d$. Existing results of
this type mainly focus on functions with an underlying radial or
one-dimensional structure, which are usually not encountered in practice. The
first contribution of this paper is to extend such results to a more general
class of functions, namely functions with piece-wise oscillatory structure, by
building on the proof strategy of (Eldan and Shamir, 2016).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common theme in the proof of such results is the fact that one-hidden-layer
fail to approximate high-energy functions whose Fourier representation is
spread in the domain. On the other hand, existing approximation results of a
function by one-hidden-layer neural networks rely on the function having a
sparse Fourier representation. The choice of the domain also represents a
source of gaps between upper and lower approximation bounds. Focusing on a
fixed approximation domain, namely the sphere $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ in dimension
$d$, we provide a characterization of both functions which are efficiently
approximable by one-hidden-layer networks and of functions which are provably
not, in terms of their Fourier expansion.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01597</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When facing many options, we narrow down our focus to very few of them.
Although behaviors like this can be a sign of heuristics, they can actually be
optimal under limited cognitive resources. Here we study the problem of how to
optimally allocate limited sampling time to multiple options, modelled as
accumulators of noisy evidence, to determine the most profitable one. We show
that the effective sampling capacity of an agent increases with both available
time and the discriminability of the options, and optimal policies undergo a
sharp transition as a function of it. For small capacity, it is best to
allocate time evenly to exactly five options and to ignore all the others,
regardless of the prior distribution of rewards. For large capacities, the
optimal number of sampled accumulators grows sub-linearly, closely following a
power law for a wide variety of priors. We find that allocating equal times to
the sampled accumulators is better than using uneven time allocations. Our work
highlights that multi-alternative decisions are endowed with breadth-depth
tradeoffs, demonstrates how their optimal solutions depend on the amount of
limited resources and the variability of the environment, and shows that
narrowing down to a handful of options is always optimal for small capacities.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01512</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many cephalopods such as octopus and squid change their skin color
purposefully within a very short time. Furthermore, it is widely known that
some octopuses have the ability to change the color and unevenness of the skin
and to mimic the surroundings in short time. However, much research has not
been done on the entire mimicry mechanism in which the octopus recognizes the
surrounding landscape and changes the skin pattern. It seems that there is no
hypothetical model to explain the whole mimicry mechanism yet. In this study,
the mechanism of octopus skin pattern formation was assumed to be based on the
Turing model. Here, the pattern formation by the Turing model was realized by
the equivalent filter calculation model using the cellular automaton, instead
of directly solving the differential equations. It was shown that this model
can create various patterns with two feature parameters. Furthermore, for the
eyes recognition part where two features are extracted from the Turing pattern
image, our study proposed a method that can be calculated back with small
amount of calculation using the characteristics of the cellular Turing pattern
model. These two calculations can be expressed in the same mathematical frame
based on the cellular automaton model using the convolution filter. As a
result, it can be created a model which is capable of extracting features from
patterns and reconstructing patterns in a short time, the model is considered
to be a basic model for considering the mimicry mechanism of octopus. Also, in
terms of application to machine learning, it is considered that it shows the
possibility of leading to a model with a small amount of learning calculation.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;To plan safe and comfortable trajectories for automated vehicles on highways,
accurate predictions of traffic situations are needed. So far, a lot of
research effort has been spent on detecting lane change maneuvers rather than
on estimating the point in time a lane change actually happens. In practice,
however, this temporal information might be even more useful. This paper deals
with the development of a system that accurately predicts the time to the next
lane change of surrounding vehicles on highways using long short-term
memory-based recurrent neural networks. An extensive evaluation based on a
large real-world data set shows that our approach is able to make reliable
predictions, even in the most challenging situations, with a root mean squared
error around 0.7 seconds. Already 3.5 seconds prior to lane changes the
predictions become highly accurate, showing a median error of less than 0.25
seconds. In summary, this article forms a fundamental step towards downstreamed

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When faced with a new dataset, most practitioners begin by performing
exploratory data analysis to discover interesting patterns and characteristics
within data. Techniques such as association rule mining are commonly applied to
uncover relationships between features (attributes) of the data. However,
association rules are primarily designed for use on binary or categorical data,
due to their use of rule-based machine learning. A large proportion of
real-world data is continuous in nature, and discretisation of such data leads
to inaccurate and less informative association rules. In this paper, we propose
an alternative approach called feature relationship mining (FRM), which uses a
genetic programming approach to automatically discover symbolic relationships
between continuous or categorical features in data. To the best of our
knowledge, our proposed approach is the first such symbolic approach with the
goal of explicitly discovering relationships between features. Empirical
testing on a variety of real-world datasets shows the proposed method is able
to find high-quality, simple feature relationships which can be easily
interpreted and which provide clear and non-trivial insight into data.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Bit Error Tolerance Metrics for Binarized Neural Networks. (arXiv:2102.01344v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01344</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;To reduce the resource demand of neural network (NN) inference systems, it
has been proposed to use approximate memory, in which the supply voltage and
the timing parameters are tuned trading accuracy with energy consumption and
performance. Tuning these parameters aggressively leads to bit errors, which
can be tolerated by NNs when bit flips are injected during training. However,
bit flip training, which is the state of the art for achieving bit error
tolerance, does not scale well; it leads to massive overheads and cannot be
applied for high bit error rates (BERs). Alternative methods to achieve bit
error tolerance in NNs are needed, but the underlying principles behind the bit
error tolerance of NNs have not been reported yet. With this lack of
understanding, further progress in the research on NN bit error tolerance will
be restrained.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, our objective is to investigate the internal changes in the
NNs that bit flip training causes, with a focus on binarized NNs (BNNs). To
this end, we quantify the properties of bit error tolerant BNNs with two
metrics. First, we propose a neuron-level bit error tolerance metric, which
calculates the margin between the pre-activation values and batch normalization
thresholds. Secondly, to capture the effects of bit error tolerance on the
interplay of neurons, we propose an inter-neuron bit error tolerance metric,
which measures the importance of each neuron and computes the variance over all
importance values. Our experimental results support that these two metrics are
strongly related to bit error tolerance.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chaos and Noise are ubiquitous in the Brain. Inspired by the chaotic firing
of neurons and the constructive role of noise in neuronal models, we for the
first time connect chaos, noise and learning. In this paper, we demonstrate
Stochastic Resonance (SR) phenomenon in Neurochaos Learning (NL). SR manifests
at the level of a single neuron of NL and enables efficient subthreshold signal
detection. Furthermore, SR is shown to occur in single and multiple neuronal NL
architecture for classification tasks - both on simulated and real-world spoken
digit datasets. Intermediate levels of noise in neurochaos learning enables
peak performance in classification tasks thus highlighting the role of SR in AI
applications, especially in brain inspired learning architectures.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01303</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The human brain prioritises relevant sensory information to perform different
tasks. Enhancement of task-relevant information requires flexible allocation of
attentional resources, but it is still a mystery how this is operationalised in
the brain. We investigated how attentional mechanisms operate in situations
where multiple stimuli are presented in the same location and at the same time.
In two experiments, participants performed a challenging two-back task on
different types of visual stimuli that were presented simultaneously and
superimposed over each other. Using electroencephalography and multivariate
decoding, we analysed the effect of attention on the neural responses to each
individual stimulus. Whole brain neural responses contained considerable
information about both the attended and unattended stimuli, even though they
were presented simultaneously and represented in overlapping receptive fields.
As expected, attention increased the decodability of stimulus-related
information contained in the neural responses, but this effect was evident
earlier for stimuli that were presented at smaller sizes. Our results show that
early neural responses to stimuli in fast-changing displays contain remarkable
information about the sensory environment but are also modulated by attention
in a manner dependent on perceptual characteristics of the relevant stimuli.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: How higher goals are constructed and collapse under stress: a hierarchical Bayesian control systems perspective. (arXiv:2004.09426v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09426</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we show that organisms can be modeled as hierarchical Bayesian
control systems with small world and information bottleneck (bow-tie) network
structure. Such systems combine hierarchical perception with hierarchical goal
setting and hierarchical action control. We argue that hierarchical Bayesian
control systems produce deep hierarchies of goal states, from which it follows
that organisms must have some form of 'highest goals'. For all organisms, these
involve internal (self) models, external (social) models and overarching
(normative) models. We show that goal hierarchies tend to decompose in a
top-down manner under severe and prolonged levels of stress. This produces
behavior that favors short-term and self-referential goals over long term,
social and/or normative goals. The collapse of goal hierarchies is universally
accompanied by an increase in entropy (disorder) in control systems that can
serve as an early warning sign for tipping points (disease or death of the
organism). In humans, learning goal hierarchies corresponds to personality
development (maturation). The failure of goal hierarchies to mature properly
corresponds to personality deficits. A top-down collapse of such hierarchies
under stress is identified as a common factor in all forms of episodic mental
disorders (psychopathology). The paper concludes by discussing ways of testing
these hypotheses empirically.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.12287</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Randomized Neural Networks explore the behavior of neural systems where the
majority of connections are fixed, either in a stochastic or a deterministic
fashion. Typical examples of such systems consist of multi-layered neural
network architectures where the connections to the hidden layer(s) are left
untrained after initialization. Limiting the training algorithms to operate on
a reduced set of weights inherently characterizes the class of Randomized
Neural Networks with a number of intriguing features. Among them, the extreme
efficiency of the resulting learning processes is undoubtedly a striking
advantage with respect to fully trained architectures. Besides, despite the
involved simplifications, randomized neural systems possess remarkable
properties both in practice, achieving state-of-the-art results in multiple
domains, and theoretically, allowing to analyze intrinsic properties of neural
architectures (e.g. before training of the hidden layers' connections). In
recent years, the study of Randomized Neural Networks has been extended towards
deep architectures, opening new research directions to the design of effective
yet extremely efficient deep learning models in vectorial as well as in more
complex data domains. This chapter surveys all the major aspects regarding the
design and analysis of Randomized Neural Networks, and some of the key results
with respect to their approximation capabilities. In particular, we first
introduce the fundamentals of randomized neural models in the context of
feed-forward networks (i.e., Random Vector Functional Link and equivalent
models) and convolutional filters, before moving to the case of recurrent
systems (i.e., Reservoir Computing networks). For both, we focus specifically
on recent results in the domain of deep randomized systems, and (for recurrent
models) their application to structured domains.

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Rapid and Reversible Development of Axonal Varicosities: A New Form of Neural Plasticity</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.610857</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Axonal varicosities are enlarged, heterogeneous structures along axonal shafts, profoundly affecting axonal conduction and synaptic transmission. They represent a key pathological feature believed to develop via slow accumulation of axonal damage that occurs during irreversible degeneration, for example in mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and multiple sclerosis. Here this review first discusses recent in vitro results showing that axonal varicosities can be rapidly and reversibly induced by mechanical stress in cultured primary neurons from the central nervous system (CNS). This notion is further supported by in vivo studies revealing the induction of axonal varicosities across various brain regions in different mTBI mouse models, as a prominent feature of axonal pathology. Limited progress in understanding intrinsic and extrinsic regulatory mechanisms of axonal varicosity induction and development is further highlighted. Rapid and reversible formation of axonal varicosities likely plays a key role in CNS neuron mechanosensation and is a new form of neural plasticity. Future investigation in this emerging research field may reveal how to reverse axonal injury, contributing to the development of new strategies for treating brain injuries and related neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Antidepressant-Like Effect of Geniposide in Mice Exposed to a Chronic Mild Stress Involves the microRNA-298-5p-Mediated Nox1</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00131</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Depression is a common mental disorder that presents a considerable challenge for public health. The natural product geniposide has neuroprotective effects on depression, but the underlying mechanism behind these effects had remained undefined. The present study was designed to investigate the role of microRNAs (miRs) in this mechanism. It studied mice with depression-like behavior established by exposure to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) for 2 months. The CUMS mice were intragastrically fed with geniposide at a dose of 10 ml/kg daily for two consecutive weeks. We monitored the depression-like behaviors of the CUMS mice by the forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST). Then, we measured the cerebral expression of miR-298-5p and NADPH oxidase 1 (Nox1) mRNA in the CUMS mice by the RT-qPCR. The targeting relationship between miR-298-5p and Nox1 was evaluated by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. The concentrations of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined by the CellTiter-Glo&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; and flow cytometry, respectively. The mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was detected using JC-1 staining. Moreover, the expression of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and TGF-β) was determined by ELISA, RT-qPCR, and western blot analysis. We found that miR-298-5p was poorly-expressed while Nox1 was highly-expressed in the brain tissues of the CUMS-induced mice. Intriguingly, Geniposide treatment reversed the behavioral abnormalities of CUMS mice, including shortened immobility time. Geniposide inhibited the Nox1 expression by increasing miR-298-5p levels. There were increased ATP content and MMP and reduced contents of ROS and inflammatory cytokines in the CUMS mice receiving geniposide treatment. Hence, this study revealed an antidepressant effect of geniposide on CUMS-induced depression-like behavior in mice by down-regulating the miR-298-5p-targeted Nox1. This highlights a novel candidate target for the treatment of depression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

In this review, we briefly summarize recent findings and analyze the application of molecular metabolomics in familial and sporadic PD from genetic mutations, mitochondrial dysfunction, and dysbacteriosis.

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: S100A8 Promotes Inflammation via Toll-Like Receptor 4 After Experimental Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.616559</link>
	<content:encoded>Introduction&lt;p&gt;S100 calcium-binding protein A8 (S100A8) is also known as macrophage-related protein 8, which is involved in various pathological processes in the central nervous system post-traumatic brain injury (TBI), and plays a critical role in inducing inflammatory cytokines. Accumulating evidences have indicated that toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is considered to be involved in inflammatory responses post TBI. The present study was designed to analyze the hypothesis that S100A8 is the key molecule that induces inflammation via TLR4 in TBI.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The weight-drop TBI model was used and randomly implemented on mice that were categorized into six groups: Sham, NS, S100A8, S100A8+TAK-242, TBI, and TBI+TAK-242 groups. In the S100A8+TAK-242 and TBI+TAK-242 groups, at half an hour prior to the intracerebroventricular administration of S100A8 or TBI, mice were intraperitoneally treated with TAK-242 that acts as a selective antagonist and inhibitor of TLR4. Furthermore, the protein recombinant of S100A8 was injected into the lateral ventricle of the brain of mice in the S100A8 and S100A8+TAK-242 groups. Sterile normal saline was injected into the lateral ventricle in the NS group. To evaluate the association between S100A8 and TLR4, Western blot, immunofluorescence, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and Nissl staining were employed. Simultaneously, the neurological score and brain water content were assessed. In the in vitro analysis, BV-2 microglial cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide LPS or S100A8 recombinant protein, with or without TAK-242. The expression of the related proteins was subsequently detected by Western blot or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The levels of S100A8 protein and pro-inflammatory cytokines were significantly elevated after TBI. There was a reduction in the neurological scores of non-TBI animals with remarkable severe brain edema after the intracerebroventricular administration of S100A8. Furthermore, the TLR4, p-p65, and myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) levels were elevated after the administration of S100A8 or TBI, which could be restored by TAK-242. Meanwhile, in the in vitro analysis, due to the stimulation of S100A8 or LPS, there was an upregulation of p-p65 and MyD88, which could also be suppressed by TAK-242.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The present study demonstrated that the TLR4-MyD88 pathway was activated by S100A8, which is essential for the development of inflammation in the brain after TBI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.606808</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The aging brain seems to be characterized by neuronal loss leading to cognitive decline and progressively worsening symptoms related to neurodegeneration. Also, pro-inflammatory states, if prolonged, may increase neuronal vulnerability via excessive activation of microglia and their pro-inflammatory by-products, which is seen as individuals increase in age. Consequently, microglial activity is tightly regulated by neuron-microglia communications. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is emerging as a regulator of microglia and the neuronal-microglia communication system. Recently, it has been demonstrated that cannabinoid 1 (CB1) receptor signaling on GABAergic interneurons plays a crucial role in regulating microglial activity. Interestingly, if endocannabinoid signaling on GABAergic neurons are disturbed, the phenotypes mimic central nervous system insult models by activating microglia and leading to accelerated brain aging. Investigating the endocannabinoid receptors, ligands, and genetic deletions yields the potential to understand the communication system and mechanism by which the ECS regulates glial cells and aspects of aging. While there remains much to discover with the ECS, the information gathered and identified already could lead to the development of cell-specific therapeutic interventions that help in reducing the effects of age-related pro-inflammatory states and neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The question of what determines brain laterality for auditory cognitive processing is unresolved. Here, we demonstrate a swap of hemisphere dominance from right to left during semantic interpretation of Chinese lexical tones in native speakers using simultaneously recorded mismatch negativity response and behavioral reaction time during dichotic listening judgment. The mismatch negativity, which is a brain wave response and indexes auditory processing at an early stage, indicated right hemisphere dominance. In contrast, the behavioral reaction time, which reflects auditory processing at a later stage, indicated a right ear listening advantage, or left hemisphere dominance. The observed swap of hemisphere dominance would not occur when the lexical tone was substituted with a meaningless pure tone. This swap reveals dependence of hemisphere labor division initially on acoustic and then on functional cues of auditory inputs in the processing from sound to meaning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is related to a variety of cognitive impairments that may even progress to dementia. Studies have found the angular gyrus (AG) is a cross-modal integration hub that is involved in a variety of cognitive processes.

This study explored the functional connection (FC) between the AG and the whole brain and the relationship between the FC and clinical/cognitive variables in patients with T2DM. 44 patients with T2DM and 43 sex-, age-, and education-matched healthy controls underwent resting-state fMRI and received neuropsychological assessments. Compared with the control group, the T2DM group showed abnormal rsFCs between the AG and multiple brain regions. The FC between the left AG and the left medial temporal lobe in the T2DM group was positively correlated with scores on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, after a Bonferroni correction (r = 0.40, P = 0.009). Collectively, patients with T2DM have abnormal FCs between the AG and extensive brain regions that may be related to various cognitive processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Bilingual child participants were classified as simultaneous or sequential bilinguals to examine the impact of first language, age of second-language acquisition (AoL2A), and the length of second language experience on behavioral performance and cortical activation. Participants were asked to select the agent of four types of sentences: subject-verb-object (SVO), passive (PAS), subject-extracted relative clause (SR), and object-extracted relative clause (OR) adopted from the “Whatdunit” task by Montgomery et al. (2016). Semantic cues were removed by using inanimate nouns for agents and patients, which constrained participants to make decisions based on syntactic knowledge. Behavioral results showed greater accuracy for canonical SVO and SR sentence types than for noncanonical OR and PAS sentence types, which aligns with prior studies. Neuroimaging results revealed greater hemodynamic responses to relative clauses (i.e., SR and OR sentences) than to simple sentences (SVO and PAS), especially for Chinese-English bilinguals suggesting first-language transfer influencing sentence processing in English. The effects AoL2A and the length of second language experience showed no significant differences between simultaneous and sequential bilinguals or between bilingual adults and children for identifying the correct agent in each sentence. However, neuroimaging results demonstrated greater hemodynamic responses in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and left inferior parietal lobule (IPL) in simultaneous bilinguals compared to sequential bilinguals and greater hemodynamic responses in left and right DLPFC and left IPL among bilingual adults. Different behavioral and neural hemodynamic response patterns afford new insights into the effects of syntactic knowledge on sentence processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: An Intracortical Implantable Brain-Computer Interface for Telemetric Real-Time Recording and Manipulation of Neuronal Circuits for Closed-Loop Intervention</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.618626</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recording and manipulating neuronal ensemble activity is a key requirement in advanced neuromodulatory and behavior studies. Devices capable of both recording and manipulating neuronal activity brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) should ideally operate un-tethered and allow chronic longitudinal manipulations in the freely moving animal. In this study, we designed a new intracortical BCI feasible of telemetric recording and stimulating local gray and white matter of visual neural circuit after irradiation exposure. To increase the translational reliance, we put forward a Göttingen minipig model. The animal was stereotactically irradiated at the level of the visual cortex upon defining the target by a fused cerebral MRI and CT scan. A fully implantable neural telemetry system consisting of a 64 channel intracortical multielectrode array, a telemetry capsule, and an inductive rechargeable battery was then implanted into the visual cortex to record and manipulate local field potentials, and multi-unit activity. We achieved a 3-month stability of the functionality of the un-tethered BCI in terms of telemetric radio-communication, inductive battery charging, and device biocompatibility for 3 months. Finally, we could reliably record the local signature of sub- and suprathreshold neuronal activity in the visual cortex with high bandwidth without complications. The ability to wireless induction charging combined with the entirely implantable design, the rather high recording bandwidth, and the ability to record and stimulate simultaneously put forward a wireless BCI capable of long-term un-tethered real-time communication for causal preclinical circuit-based closed-loop interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.609080</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: To investigate the differences between patients returning to work and those who did not after brain tumor surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Patients were evaluated before surgery and after 3 months. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment test, Trail-Making Test (parts A and B), 15-word Rey–Osterrieth Word List (immediate and delayed recall), F-A-S tests, and Karnosfky Performance Status were used to assess cognitive status, attention, executive functions, memory, word fluency, and functional status. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) used to evaluate emotional distress and disability were the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule. Clinical and work-related variables, PROMs, and cognitive tests were compared using chi-squared, t-test or Mann–Whitney U test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Sixty patients were included. Patients returning to work were 61.3 and 31.0% among people with meningioma and glioma, respectively. They reported lower postoperative disability and lesser home-to-work travel time. Patients with meningioma also showed better preoperative and postoperative attention and executive functions, better postoperative functional and cognitive status, and lower frequency of treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: These variables should be considered in a clinical context to plan interventions for people who need support during return to work and in future research to investigate preoperative and postoperative predictive factors of going back to work.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.605190</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The ability to learn sequential contingencies of actions for predicting future outcomes is indispensable for flexible behavior in many daily decision-making contexts. It remains open whether such ability may be enhanced by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). The present study combined tDCS with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to investigate potential tDCS-induced effects on sequential decision-making and the neural mechanisms underlying such modulations. Offline tDCS and sham stimulation were applied over the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in young male adults (N = 29, mean age = 23.4 years, SD = 3.2) in a double-blind between-subject design using a three-state Markov decision task. The results showed (i) an enhanced dlPFC hemodynamic response during the acquisition of sequential state transitions that is consistent with the findings from a previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study; (ii) a tDCS-induced increase of the hemodynamic response in the dlPFC, but without accompanying performance-enhancing effects at the behavioral level; and (iii) a greater tDCS-induced upregulation of hemodynamic responses in the delayed reward condition that seems to be associated with faster decision speed. Taken together, these findings provide empirical evidence for fNIRS as a suitable method for investigating hemodynamic correlates of sequential decision-making as well as functional brain correlates underlying tDCS-induced modulation. Future research with larger sample sizes for carrying out subgroup analysis is necessary in order to decipher interindividual differences in tDCS-induced effects on sequential decision-making process at the behavioral and brain levels.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: A Long-Term Enriched Environment Ameliorates the Accelerated Age-Related Memory Impairment Induced by Gestational Administration of Lipopolysaccharide: Role of Plastic Mitochondrial Quality Control</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.559182</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that gestational inflammation accelerates age-related memory impairment in mother mice. An enriched environment (EE) can improve age-related memory impairment, whereas mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of brain aging. However, it is unclear whether an EE can counteract the accelerated age-related memory impairment induced by gestational inflammation and whether this process is associated with the disruption of mitochondrial quality control (MQC) processes. In this study, CD-1 mice received daily intraperitoneal injections of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 50 μg/kg) or normal saline (CON group) during gestational days 15–17 and were separated from their offspring at the end of normal lactation. The mothers that received LPS were divided into LPS group and LPS plus EE (LPS-E) treatment groups based on whether the mice were exposed to an EE until the end of the experiment. At 6 and 18 months of age, the Morris water maze test was used to evaluate spatial learning and memory abilities. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot were used to measure the messenber RNA (mRNA) and protein levels of MQC-related genes in the hippocampus, respectively. The results showed that all the aged (18 months old) mice underwent a striking decline in spatial learning and memory performances and decreased mRNA/protein levels related to mitochondrial dynamics (Mfn1/Mfn2, OPA1, and Drp1), biogenesis (PGC-1α), and mitophagy (PINK1/parkin) in the hippocampi compared with the young (6 months old) mice. LPS treatment exacerbated the decline in age-related spatial learning and memory and enhanced the reduction in the mRNA and protein levels of MQC-related genes but increased the levels of PGC-1α in young mice. Exposure to an EE could alleviate the accelerated decline in age-related spatial learning and memory abilities and the accelerated changes in MQC-related mRNA or protein levels resulting from LPS treatment, especially in aged mice. In conclusion, long-term exposure to an EE can counteract the accelerated age-related spatial cognition impairment modulated by MQC in CD-1 mother mice that experience inflammation during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.636683</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The torus longitudinalis (TL) is a midbrain structure unique to ray finned fish. Although previously implicated in orienting behaviors elicited by changes in ambient lighting, the role of TL in visual processing is not well-understood. TL is reciprocally connected to tectum and is the only known source of synaptic input to the stratum marginalis (SM) layer of tectal neuropil. Conversely, tectal pyramidal neurons (PyrNs) are the only identified tectal neuron population that forms a dendrite in SM. In this study we describe a zebrafish gal4 transgenic that labels TL neurons that project to SM. We demonstrate that the axonal TL projection to SM in zebrafish is glutamatergic. Consistent with these axons synapsing directly onto PyrNs, SM-targeted dendrites of PyrNs contain punctate enrichments of the glutamatergic post-synaptic marker protein PSD95. Sparse genetic labeling of individual TL axons and PyrN dendrites enabled quantitative morphometric analysis that revealed (1) large, sparsely branched TL axons in SM and (2) small, densely innervated PyrN dendrites in SM. Together this unique combination of morphologies support a wiring diagram in which TL inputs to PyrNs exhibit a high degree of convergence. We propose that this convergence functions to generate large, compound visual receptive fields in PyrNs. This quantitative anatomical data will instruct future functional studies aimed at identifying the precise contribution of TL-PyrN circuitry to visual behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.646017</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Purpose: To investigate the dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) and static parameters of graph theory in individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and the associations of DFC and topological properties with cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Thirty-three control subjects and 32 SCD individuals were enrolled in this study, and neuropsychological evaluations and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning were performed. Thirty-three components were selected by group independent component analysis to construct 7 functional networks. Based on the sliding window approach and k-means clustering, distinct DFC states were identified. We calculated the temporal properties of fractional windows in each state, the mean dwell time in each state, and the number of transitions between each pair of DFC states. The global and local static parameters were assessed by graph theory analysis. The differences in DFC and topological metrics, and the associations of the altered neuroimaging measures with cognitive performance were assessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The whole cohort demonstrated 4 distinct connectivity states. Compared to the control group, the SCD group showed increased fractional windows and an increased mean dwell time in state 4, characterized by hypoconnectivity both within and between networks. The SCD group also showed decreased fractional windows and a decreased mean dwell time in state 2, dominated by hyperconnectivity within and between the auditory, visual and somatomotor networks. The number of transitions between state 1 and state 2, between state 2 and state 3, and between state 2 and state 4 was significantly reduced in the SCD group compared to the control group. No significant differences in global or local topological metrics were observed. The altered DFC properties showed significant correlations with cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our findings indicated DFC network reconfiguration in the SCD stage, which may underlie the early cognitive decline in SCD subjects and serve as sensitive neuroimaging biomarkers for the preclinical detection of individuals with incipient Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Irisin Contributes to Neuroprotection by Promoting Mitochondrial Biogenesis After Experimental Subarachnoid Hemorrhage</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.640215</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a devastating form of stroke, which poses a series of intractable challenges to clinical practice. Imbalance of mitochondrial homeostasis has been thought to be the crucial pathomechanism in early brain injury (EBI) cascade after SAH. Irisin, a protein related to metabolism and mitochondrial homeostasis, has been reported to play pivotal roles in post-stroke neuroprotection. However, whether this myokine can exert neuroprotection effects after SAH remains unknown. In the present study, we explored the protective effects of irisin and the underlying mechanisms related to mitochondrial biogenesis in a SAH animal model. Endovascular perforation was used to induce SAH, and recombinant irisin was administered intracerebroventricularly. Neurobehavioral assessments, TdT-UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, dihydroethidium (DHE) staining, immunofluorescence, western blot, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed for post-SAH assessments. We demonstrated that irisin treatment improved neurobehavioral scores, reduced neuronal apoptosis, and alleviated oxidative stress in EBI after SAH. More importantly, the administration of exogenous irisin conserved the mitochondrial morphology and promoted mitochondrial biogenesis. The protective effects of irisin were partially reversed by the mitochondrial uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2) inhibitor. Taken together, irisin may have neuroprotective effects against SAH via improving the mitochondrial biogenesis, at least in part, through UCP-2 related targets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Differential Patterns of Gyral and Sulcal Morphological Changes During Normal Aging Process</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.625931</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The cerebral cortex is a highly convoluted structure with distinct morphologic features, namely the gyri and sulci, which are associated with the functional segregation or integration in the human brain. During the lifespan, the brain atrophy that is accompanied by cognitive decline is a well-accepted aging phenotype. However, the detailed patterns of cortical folding change during aging, especially the changing age-dependencies of gyri and sulci, which is essential to brain functioning, remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the morphology of the gyral and sulcal regions from pial and white matter surfaces using MR imaging data of 417 healthy participants across adulthood to old age (21–92 years). To elucidate the age-related changes in the cortical pattern, we fitted cortical thickness and intrinsic curvature of gyri and sulci using the quadratic model to evaluate their age-dependencies during normal aging. Our findings show that comparing to gyri, the sulcal thinning is the most prominent pattern during the aging process, and the gyrification of pial and white matter surfaces were also affected differently, which implies the vulnerability of functional segregation during aging. Taken together, we propose a morphological model of aging that may provide a framework for understanding the mechanisms underlying gray matter degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Gray Matter Deterioration Pattern During Alzheimer's Disease Progression: A Regions-of-Interest Based Surface Morphometry Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.593898</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Accurate detection of the regions of Alzheimer's disease (AD) lesions is critical for early intervention to effectively slow down the progression of the disease. Although gray matter volumetric abnormalities are commonly detected in patients with mild cognition impairment (MCI) and patients with AD, the gray matter surface-based deterioration pattern associated with the progression of the disease from MCI to AD stages is largely unknown. To identify group differences in gray matter surface morphometry, including cortical thickness, the gyrification index (GI), and the sulcus depth, 80 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database were split into healthy controls (HCs; N = 20), early MCIs (EMCI; N = 20), late MCIs (LMCI; N = 20), and ADs (N = 20). Regions-of-interest (ROI)-based surface morphometry was subsequently studied and compared across the four stage groups to characterize the gray matter deterioration during AD progression. Co-alteration patterns (Spearman's correlation coefficient) across the whole brain were also examined. Results showed that patients with MCI and AD exhibited a significant reduction in cortical thickness (p &amp;lt; 0.001) mainly in the cingulate region (four subregions) and in the temporal (thirteen subregions), parietal (five subregions), and frontal (six subregions) lobes compared to HCs. The sulcus depth of the eight temporal, four frontal, four occipital, and eight parietal subregions were also significantly affected (p &amp;lt; 0.001) by the progression of AD. The GI was shown to be insensitive to AD progression (only three subregions were detected with a significant difference, p &amp;lt; 0.001). Moreover, Spearman's correlation analysis confirmed that the co-alteration pattern of the cortical thickness and sulcus depth indices is predominant during AD progression. The findings highlight the relevance between gray matter surface morphometry and the stages of AD, laying the foundation for in vivo tracking of AD progression. The co-alteration pattern of surface-based morphometry would improve the researchers' knowledge of the underlying pathologic mechanisms in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Cerebral metabolites are associated with different physiological processes in brain aging. Cortical and limbic structures play important roles in cognitive aging; however, the relationship between these structures and age remains unclear with respect to physiological underpinnings. Regional differences in metabolite levels may be related to different structural and cognitive changes in aging.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy were obtained from 117 cognitively healthy older adults. Limbic and other key structural volumes were measured. Concentrations of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and choline-containing compounds (Cho) were measured in frontal and parietal regions. Neuropsychological testing was performed including measures of crystallized and fluid intelligence and memory.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;NAA in the frontal voxel was associated with limbic and cortical volumes, whereas Cho in parietal cortex was negatively associated with hippocampal and other regional volumes. Hippocampal volume was associated with forgetting, independent of age. Further, parietal Cho and hippocampal volume contributed independent variance to age corrected discrepancy between fluid and crystallized abilities.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that physiological changes with age in the frontal and parietal cortices may be linked to structural changes in other connected brain regions. These changes are differentially associated with cognitive performance, suggesting potentially divergent mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A population’s spatial structure affects the rate of genetic change and the outcome of natural selection. These effects can be modeled mathematically using the Birth-death process on graphs. Individuals occupy the vertices of a weighted graph, and reproduce into neighboring vertices based on fitness. A key quantity is the probability that a mutant type will sweep to fixation, as a function of the mutant’s fitness. Graphs that increase the fixation probability of beneficial mutations, and decrease that of deleterious mutations, are said to amplify selection. However, fixation probabilities are difficult to compute for an arbitrary graph. Here we derive an expression for the fixation probability, of a weakly-selected mutation, in terms of the time for two lineages to coalesce. This expression enables weak-selection fixation probabilities to be computed, for an arbitrary weighted graph, in polynomial time. Applying this method, we explore the range of possible effects of graph structure on natural selection, genetic drift, and the balance between the two. Using exhaustive analysis of small graphs and a genetic search algorithm, we identify families of graphs with striking effects on fixation probability, and we analyze these families mathematically. Our work reveals the nuanced effects of graph structure on natural selection and neutral drift. In particular, we show how these notions depend critically on the process by which mutations arise.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/44-W4ntRh6c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Yiran Huang, Yusi Xie, Cheng Zhong, Fengfeng Zhou&lt;/p&gt;

Finding non-standard or new metabolic pathways has important applications in metabolic engineering, synthetic biology and the analysis and reconstruction of metabolic networks. Branched metabolic pathways dominate in metabolic networks and depict a more comprehensive picture of metabolism compared to linear pathways. Although progress has been developed to find branched metabolic pathways, few efforts have been made in identifying branched metabolic pathways via atom group tracking. In this paper, we present a pathfinding method called BPFinder for finding branched metabolic pathways by atom group tracking, which aims to guide the synthetic design of metabolic pathways. BPFinder enumerates linear metabolic pathways by tracking the movements of atom groups in metabolic network and merges the linear atom group conserving pathways into branched pathways. Two merging rules based on the structure of conserved atom groups are proposed to accurately merge the branched compounds of linear pathways to identify branched pathways. Furthermore, the integrated information of compound similarity, thermodynamic feasibility and conserved atom groups is also used to rank the pathfinding results for feasible branched pathways. Experimental results show that BPFinder is more capable of recovering known branched metabolic pathways as compared to other existing methods, and is able to return biologically relevant branched pathways and discover alternative branched pathways of biochemical interest. The online server of BPFinder is available at http://114.215.129.245:8080/atomic/.

The availability of bacterial transcriptomes has dramatically increased in recent years. This data deluge could result in detailed inference of underlying regulatory networks, but the diversity of experimental platforms and protocols introduces critical biases that could hinder scalable analysis of existing data. Here, we show that the underlying structure of the &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; transcriptome, as determined by Independent Component Analysis (ICA), is conserved across multiple independent datasets, including both RNA-seq and microarray datasets. We subsequently combined five transcriptomics datasets into a large compendium containing over 800 expression profiles and discovered that its underlying ICA-based structure was still comparable to that of the individual datasets. With this understanding, we expanded our analysis to over 3,000 &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; expression profiles and predicted three high-impact regulons that respond to oxidative stress, anaerobiosis, and antibiotic treatment. ICA thus enables deep analysis of disparate data to uncover new insights that were not visible in the individual datasets.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EcNJqX3LQOQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Relaxed clock models enable estimation of molecular substitution rates across lineages and are widely used in phylogenetics for dating evolutionary divergence times. Under the (uncorrelated) relaxed clock model, tree branches are associated with molecular substitution rates which are independently and identically distributed. In this article we delved into the internal complexities of the relaxed clock model in order to develop efficient MCMC operators for Bayesian phylogenetic inference. We compared three substitution rate parameterisations, introduced an adaptive operator which learns the weights of other operators during MCMC, and we explored how relaxed clock model estimation can benefit from two cutting-edge proposal kernels: the AVMVN and Bactrian kernels. This work has produced an operator scheme that is up to 65 times more efficient at exploring continuous relaxed clock parameters compared with previous setups, depending on the dataset. Finally, we explored variants of the standard narrow exchange operator which are specifically designed for the relaxed clock model. In the most extreme case, this new operator traversed tree space 40% more efficiently than narrow exchange. The methodologies introduced are adaptive and highly effective on short as well as long alignments. The results are available via the open source optimised relaxed clock (ORC) package for BEAST 2 under a GNU licence (https://github.com/jordandouglas/ORC).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/f31NdELZDlI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Tracking statistical regularities of the environment is important for shaping human behavior and perception. Evidence suggests that the brain learns environmental dependencies using Bayesian principles. However, much remains unknown about the employed algorithms, for somesthesis in particular. Here, we describe the cortical dynamics of the somatosensory learning system to investigate both the form of the generative model as well as its neural surprise signatures. Specifically, we recorded EEG data from 40 participants subjected to a somatosensory roving-stimulus paradigm and performed single-trial modeling across peri-stimulus time in both sensor and source space. Our Bayesian model selection procedure indicates that evoked potentials are best described by a non-hierarchical learning model that tracks transitions between observations using leaky integration. From around 70ms post-stimulus onset, secondary somatosensory cortices are found to represent confidence-corrected surprise as a measure of model inadequacy. Indications of Bayesian surprise encoding, reflecting model updating, are found in primary somatosensory cortex from around 140ms. This dissociation is compatible with the idea that early surprise signals may control subsequent model update rates. In sum, our findings support the hypothesis that early somatosensory processing reflects Bayesian perceptual learning and contribute to an understanding of its precise mechanisms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/O3XzADZGdIk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Evolutionarily conserved microRNAs (miRNAs) usually have high copy numbers in the genome. The redundant and specific roles of each member of a multimember miRNA gene family are poorly understood. Previous studies have shown that the miR156-SPL-miR172 axis constitutes a signaling cascade in regulating plant developmental transitions. Here, we report the feasibility and utility of CRISPR-Cas9 technology to investigate the functions of all 5 &lt;i&gt;MIR172&lt;/i&gt; family members in Arabidopsis. We show that an Arabidopsis plant devoid of miR172 is viable, although it displays pleiotropic morphological defects. &lt;i&gt;MIR172&lt;/i&gt; family members exhibit distinct expression pattern and exert functional specificity in regulating meristem size, trichome initiation, stem elongation, shoot branching, and floral competence. In particular, we find that the miR156-SPL-miR172 cascade is bifurcated into specific flowering responses by matching pairs of coexpressed &lt;i&gt;SPL&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;MIR172&lt;/i&gt; genes in different tissues. Our results thus highlight the spatiotemporal changes in gene expression that underlie evolutionary novelties of a miRNA gene family in nature. The expansion of &lt;i&gt;MIR172&lt;/i&gt; genes in the Arabidopsis genome provides molecular substrates for the integration of diverse floral inductive cues, which ensures that plants flower at the optimal time to maximize seed yields.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Tg40oSdlBOo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in regulating flowering and reproduction of angiosperms. Mature miRNAs are encoded by multiple &lt;i&gt;MIRNA&lt;/i&gt; genes that can differ in their spatiotemporal activities and their contributions to gene regulatory networks, but the functions of individual &lt;i&gt;MIRNA&lt;/i&gt; genes are poorly defined. We functionally analyzed the activity of all 5 &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana MIR172&lt;/i&gt; genes, which encode miR172 and promote the floral transition by inhibiting the accumulation of APETALA2 (AP2) and APETALA2-LIKE (AP2-LIKE) transcription factors (TFs). Through genome editing and detailed confocal microscopy, we show that the activity of miR172 at the shoot apex is encoded by 3 &lt;i&gt;MIR172&lt;/i&gt; genes, is critical for floral transition of the shoot meristem under noninductive photoperiods, and reduces accumulation of AP2 and TARGET OF EAT2 (TOE2), an AP2-LIKE TF, at the shoot meristem. Utilizing the genetic resources generated here, we show that the promotion of flowering by miR172 is enhanced by the MADS-domain TF FRUITFULL, which may facilitate long-term silencing of &lt;i&gt;AP2-LIKE&lt;/i&gt; transcription, and that their activities are partially coordinated by the TF SQUAMOSA PROMOTER-BINDING-LIKE PROTEIN 15. Thus, we present a genetic framework for the depletion of AP2 and AP2-LIKE TFs at the shoot apex during floral transition and demonstrate that this plays a central role in floral induction.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/0b1Xm_ge5bc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Morphology of Satb2 expressing ganglion cells in macaque, human and marmoset retinas. The study shows that Satb2 expression in retinal ganglion cells is not conserved across Old World and New World primate species.






Abstract
In primates, the retinal ganglion cells contributing to high acuity spatial vision (midget cells and parasol cells), and blue‐yellow color vision (small bistratified cells) are well understood. Many other ganglion cell types with large dendritic fields (named wide‐field ganglion cells) have been identified, but their spatial density and distribution are largely unknown. Here we took advantage of the recently established molecular diversity of ganglion cells to study wide‐field ganglion cell populations in three primate species. We used antibodies against the transcription factor Special AT‐rich binding protein 2 (Satb2) to explore its expression in macaque (Macaca fascicularis, M. nemestrina), human and marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) retinas. In all three species, Satb2 cells make up a low proportion (1.5 to 4%) of the ganglion cell population, with a slight increase from central to peripheral retina. Intracellular dye injections revealed that in macaque and human retinas, the large majority (over 80%) of Satb2 cells are inner and outer stratifying large sparse cells. By contrast, in marmoset retina the majority (over 60%) of Satb2 expressing cells were broad thorny cells, with smaller proportions of recursive bistratified (putative direction‐selective), large bistratified, and outer stratifying narrow thorny cells. Our findings highlight that Satb2 expression has undergone rapid species specific adaptations during primate evolution, because expression is not conserved across Old World (macaque, human) and New World (marmoset) suborders.

	<content:encoded>This study provides data on how sensory inputs from the perineal region interact with sensorimotor circuits that generate locomotor‐like activity and reflexes from the foot in spinal cats. We observed that inputs from the perineal region facilitate spinal locomotor activity and modulate cutaneous reflexes.

Abstract
It is well known that mechanically stimulating the perineal region potently facilitates hindlimb locomotion and weight support in mammals with a spinal transection (spinal mammals). However, how perineal stimulation mediates this excitatory effect is poorly understood. We evaluated the effect of mechanically stimulating (vibration or pinch) the perineal region on ipsilateral (9–14 ms onset) and contralateral (14–18 ms onset) short‐latency cutaneous reflex responses evoked by electrically stimulating the superficial peroneal or distal tibial nerve in seven adult spinal cats where hindlimb movement was restrained. Cutaneous reflexes were evoked before, during, and after mechanical stimulation of the perineal region. We found that vibration or pinch of the perineal region effectively triggered rhythmic activity, ipsilateral and contralateral to nerve stimulation. When electrically stimulating nerves, adding perineal stimulation modulated rhythmic activity by decreasing cycle and burst durations and by increasing the amplitude of flexors and extensors. Perineal stimulation also disrupted the timing of the ipsilateral rhythm, which had been entrained by nerve stimulation. Mechanically stimulating the perineal region decreased ipsilateral and contralateral short‐latency reflex responses evoked by cutaneous inputs, a phenomenon we observed in muscles crossing different joints and located in different limbs. The results suggest that the excitatory effect of perineal stimulation on locomotion and weight support is mediated by increasing the excitability of central pattern‐generating circuitry and not by increasing excitatory inputs from cutaneous afferents of the foot. Our results are consistent with a state‐dependent modulation of reflexes by spinal interneuronal circuits.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurons in the brain represent information in their collective activity. The
fidelity of this neural population code depends on whether and how variability
in the response of one neuron is shared with other neurons. Two decades of
studies have investigated the influence of these noise correlations on the
properties of neural coding. We provide an overview of the theoretical
developments on the topic. Using simple, qualitative and general arguments, we
discuss, categorize, and relate the various published results. We emphasize the
relevance of the fine structure of noise correlation, and we present a new
approach to the issue. Throughout we emphasize a geometrical picture of how
noise correlations impact the neural code.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00554</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The growing energy and performance costs of deep learning have driven the
community to reduce the size of neural networks by selectively pruning
components. Similarly to their biological counterparts, sparse networks
generalize just as well, if not better than, the original dense networks.
Sparsity can reduce the memory footprint of regular networks to fit mobile
devices, as well as shorten training time for ever growing networks. In this
paper, we survey prior work on sparsity in deep learning and provide an
extensive tutorial of sparsification for both inference and training. We
describe approaches to remove and add elements of neural networks, different
training strategies to achieve model sparsity, and mechanisms to exploit
sparsity in practice. Our work distills ideas from more than 300 research
papers and provides guidance to practitioners who wish to utilize sparsity
today, as well as to researchers whose goal is to push the frontier forward. We
include the necessary background on mathematical methods in sparsification,
describe phenomena such as early structure adaptation, the intricate relations
between sparsity and the training process, and show techniques for achieving
acceleration on real hardware. We also define a metric of pruned parameter
efficiency that could serve as a baseline for comparison of different sparse
networks. We close by speculating on how sparsity can improve future workloads
and outline major open problems in the field.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00524</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are powerful generative models that
achieved strong results, mainly in the image domain. However, the training of
GANs is not trivial, presenting some challenges tackled by different
strategies. Evolutionary algorithms, such as COEGAN, were recently proposed as
a solution to improve the GAN training, overcoming common problems that affect
the model, such as vanishing gradient and mode collapse. In this work, we
propose an evaluation method based on t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour
Embedding (t-SNE) to assess the progress of GANs and visualize the distribution
learned by generators in training. We propose the use of the feature space
extracted from trained discriminators to evaluate samples produced by
generators and from the input dataset. A metric based on the resulting t-SNE
maps and the Jaccard index is proposed to represent the model quality.
Experiments were conducted to assess the progress of GANs when trained using
COEGAN. The results show both by visual inspection and metrics that the
Evolutionary Algorithm gradually improves discriminators and generators through
generations, avoiding problems such as mode collapse.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00434</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Several recent works have shown separation results between deep neural
networks, and hypothesis classes with inferior approximation capacity such as
shallow networks or kernel classes. On the other hand, the fact that deep
networks can efficiently express a target function does not mean this target
function can be learned efficiently by deep neural networks. In this work we
study the intricate connection between learnability and approximation capacity.
We show that learnability with deep networks of a target function depends on
the ability of simpler classes to approximate the target. Specifically, we show
that a necessary condition for a function to be learnable by gradient descent
on deep neural networks is to be able to approximate the function, at least in
a weak sense, with shallow neural networks. We also show that a class of
functions can be learned by an efficient statistical query algorithm if and
only if it can be approximated in a weak sense by some kernel class. We give
several examples of functions which demonstrate depth separation, and conclude
that they cannot be efficiently learned, even by a hypothesis class that can
efficiently approximate them.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Niching Diversity Estimation for Multi-modal Multi-objective Optimization. (arXiv:2102.00383v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00383</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Niching is an important and widely used technique in evolutionary
multi-objective optimization. Its applications mainly focus on maintaining
diversity and avoiding early convergence to local optimum. Recently, a special
class of multi-objective optimization problems, namely, multi-modal
multi-objective optimization problems (MMOPs), started to receive increasing
attention. In MMOPs, a solution in the objective space may have multiple
inverse images in the decision space, which are termed as equivalent solutions.
Since equivalent solutions are overlapping (i.e., occupying the same position)
in the objective space, standard diversity estimators such as crowding distance
are likely to select one of them and discard the others, which may cause
diversity loss in the decision space. In this study, a general niching
mechanism is proposed to make standard diversity estimators more efficient when
handling MMOPs. In our experiments, we integrate our proposed niching diversity
estimation method into SPEA2 and NSGA-II and evaluate their performance on
several MMOPs. Experimental results show that the proposed niching mechanism
notably enhances the performance of SPEA2 and NSGA-II on various MMOPs.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00337</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can generate levels for a variety of
games. This paper focuses on combining GAN-generated segments in a snaking
pattern to create levels for Mega Man. Adjacent segments in such levels can be
orthogonally adjacent in any direction, meaning that an otherwise fine segment
might impose a barrier between its neighbor depending on what sorts of segments
in the training set are being most closely emulated: horizontal, vertical, or
corner segments. To pick appropriate segments, multiple GANs were trained on
different types of segments to ensure better flow between segments. Flow was
further improved by evolving the latent vectors for the segments being joined
in the level to maximize the length of the level's solution path. Using
multiple GANs to represent different types of segments results in significantly
longer solution paths than using one GAN for all segment types, and a human
subject study verifies that these levels are more fun and have more human-like
design than levels produced by one GAN.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00292</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This paper proposes a novel evolutionary algorithm called Epistocracy which
incorporates human socio-political behavior and intelligence to solve complex
optimization problems. The inspiration of the Epistocracy algorithm originates
from a political regime where educated people have more voting power than the
uneducated or less educated. The algorithm is a self-adaptive, and
multi-population optimizer in which the evolution process takes place in
parallel for many populations led by a council of leaders. To avoid stagnation
in poor local optima and to prevent a premature convergence, the algorithm
employs multiple mechanisms such as dynamic and adaptive leadership based on
gravitational force, dynamic population allocation and diversification,
variance-based step-size determination, and regression-based leadership
adjustment. The algorithm uses a stratified sampling method called Latin
Hypercube Sampling (LHS) to distribute the initial population more evenly for
exploration of the search space and exploitation of the accumulated knowledge.
To investigate the performance and evaluate the reliability of the algorithm,
we have used a set of multimodal benchmark functions, and then applied the
algorithm to the MNIST dataset to further verify the accuracy, scalability, and
robustness of the algorithm. Experimental results show that the Epistocracy
algorithm outperforms the tested state-of-the-art evolutionary and swarm
intelligence algorithms in terms of performance, precision, and convergence.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04796</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are an adversarial model that achieved
impressive results on generative tasks. In spite of the relevant results, GANs
present some challenges regarding stability, making the training usually a
hit-and-miss process. To overcome these challenges, several improvements were
proposed to better handle the internal characteristics of the model, such as
alternative loss functions or architectural changes on the neural networks used
by the generator and the discriminator. Recent works proposed the use of
evolutionary algorithms on GAN training, aiming to solve these challenges and
to provide an automatic way to find good models. In this context, COEGAN
proposes the use of coevolution and neuroevolution to orchestrate the training
of GANs. However, previous experiments detected that some of the fitness
functions used to guide the evolution are not ideal. In this work we propose
the evaluation of a game-based fitness function to be used within the COEGAN
method. Skill rating is a metric to quantify the skill of players in a game and
has already been used to evaluate GANs. We extend this idea using the skill
rating in an evolutionary algorithm to train GANs. The results show that skill
rating can be used as fitness to guide the evolution in COEGAN without the
dependence of an external evaluator.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08028</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Active inference is a normative framework for explaining behaviour under the
free energy principle -- a theory of self-organisation originating in
neuroscience. It specifies neuronal dynamics for state-estimation in terms of a
descent on (variational) free energy -- a measure of the fit between an
internal (generative) model and sensory observations. The free energy gradient
is a prediction error -- plausibly encoded in the average membrane potentials
of neuronal populations. Conversely, the expected probability of a state can be
expressed in terms of neuronal firing rates. We show that this is consistent
with current models of neuronal dynamics and establish face validity by
synthesising plausible electrophysiological responses. We then show that these
neuronal dynamics approximate natural gradient descent, a well-known
optimisation algorithm from information geometry that follows the steepest
descent of the objective in information space. We compare the information
length of belief updating in both schemes, a measure of the distance traveled
in information space that has a direct interpretation in terms of metabolic
cost. We show that neural dynamics under active inference are metabolically
efficient and suggest that neural representations in biological agents may
evolve by approximating steepest descent in information space towards the point
of optimal inference.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Automated benchmarking environments aim to support researchers in
understanding how different algorithms perform on different types of
optimization problems. Such comparisons provide insights into the strengths and
weaknesses of different approaches, which can be leveraged into designing new
algorithms and into the automation of algorithm selection and configuration.
With the ultimate goal to create a meaningful benchmark set for iterative
optimization heuristics, we have recently released IOHprofiler, a software
built to create detailed performance comparisons between iterative optimization
heuristics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this present work we demonstrate that IOHprofiler provides a suitable
environment for automated benchmarking. We compile and assess a selection of 23
discrete optimization problems that subscribe to different types of fitness
landscapes. For each selected problem we compare performances of twelve
different heuristics, which are as of now available as baseline algorithms in
IOHprofiler.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also provide a new module for IOHprofiler which extents the fixed-target
and fixed-budget results for the individual problems by ECDF results, which
allows one to derive aggregated performance statistics for groups of problems.

In this Review, Meisler and colleagues discuss the neurological disorders associated with these mutations and also the therapeutic opportunities that are being investigated as a result of these recent mechanistic insights.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nrn/rss/current/~4/ULBslNNlsDM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Here, the authors present the crystal structures of SAMHD1-oligonucleotide complexes, which reveal that the allosteric binding sites of SAMHD1 are plastic and can fit oligonucleotides in place of the two allosteric activators GTP and dNTP, and they also show that SAMHD1 recognises GpsN phosphorothioation modifications in nucleic acids, which is of interest in drug design.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/kCQxlj47aSc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Computational Neuroscience: Energetics of stochastic BCM type synaptic plasticity and storing of accurate information</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Excitatory synaptic signaling in cortical circuits is thought to be metabolically expensive. Two fundamental brain functions, learning and memory, are associated with long-term synaptic plasticity, but we know very little about energetics of these slow biophysical processes. This study investigates the energy requirement of information storing in plastic synapses for an extended version of BCM plasticity with a decay term, stochastic noise, and nonlinear dependence of neuron’s firing rate on synaptic current (adaptation). It is shown that synaptic weights in this model exhibit bistability. In order to analyze the system analytically, it is reduced to a simple dynamic mean-field for a population averaged plastic synaptic current. Next, using the concepts of nonequilibrium thermodynamics, we derive the energy rate (entropy production rate) for plastic synapses and a corresponding Fisher information for coding presynaptic input. That energy, which is of chemical origin, is primarily used for battling fluctuations in the synaptic weights and presynaptic firing rates, and it increases steeply with synaptic weights, and more uniformly though nonlinearly with presynaptic firing. At the onset of synaptic bistability, Fisher information and memory lifetime both increase sharply, by a few orders of magnitude, but the plasticity energy rate changes only mildly. This implies that a huge gain in the precision of stored information does not have to cost large amounts of metabolic energy, which suggests that synaptic information is not directly limited by energy consumption. Interestingly, for very weak synaptic noise, such a limit on synaptic coding accuracy is imposed instead by a derivative of the plasticity energy rate with respect to the mean presynaptic firing, and this relationship has a general character that is independent of the plasticity type. An estimate for primate neocortex reveals that a relative metabolic cost of BCM type synaptic plasticity, as a fraction of neuronal cost related to fast synaptic transmission and spiking, can vary from negligible to substantial, depending on the synaptic noise level and presynaptic firing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Seeing motion of controlled object improves grip timing in adults with autism spectrum condition: evidence for use of inverse dynamics in motor control</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00221-021-06046-3</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Previous studies (Haswell et al. in Nat Neurosci 12:970–972, 2009; Marko et al. in Brain J Neurol 138:784–797, 2015) reported that people with autism rely less on vision for learning to reach in a force field. This suggested a possibility that they have difficulties in extracting force information from visual motion signals, a process called inverse dynamics computation. Our recent study (Takamuku et al. in J Int Soc Autism Res 11:1062–1075, 2018) examined the ability of inverse computation with two perceptual tasks and found similar performances in typical and autistic adults. However, this tested the computation only in the context of sensory perception while it was possible that the suspected disability is specific to the motor domain. Here, in order to address the concern, we tested the use of inverse dynamics computation in the context of motor control by measuring changes in grip timing caused by seeing/not seeing a controlled object. The motion of the object was informative of its inertial force and typical participants improved their grip timing based on the visual feedback. Our interest was on whether the autism participants show the same improvement. While some autism participants showed atypical hand slowing when seeing the controlled object, we found no evidence of abnormalities in the inverse computation in our grip timing task or in a replication of the perceptual task. This suggests that the ability of inverse dynamics computation is preserved not only for sensory perception but also for motor control in adults with autism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Measures of prefrontal functional near-infrared spectroscopy in visuomotor learning</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00221-021-06039-2</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a promising technique for non-invasively assessing cortical brain activity during learning. This technique is safe, portable, and, compared to other imaging techniques, relatively robust to head motion, ocular and muscular artifacts and environmental noise. Moreover, the spatial resolution of fNIRS is superior to electroencephalography (EEG), a more commonly applied technique for measuring brain activity non-invasively during learning. Outcomes from fNIRS measures during learning might therefore be both sensitive to learning and to feedback on learning, in a different way than EEG. However, few studies have examined fNIRS outcomes in learning and no study to date additionally examined the effects of feedback. To address this apparent gap in the literature, the current study examined prefrontal cortex activity measured through fNIRS during visuomotor learning and how this measure is affected by task feedback. Activity in the prefrontal cortex decreased over the course of learning while being unaffected by task feedback. The findings demonstrate that fNIRS in the prefrontal cortex is valuable for assessing visuomotor learning and that this measure is robust to task feedback. The current study highlights the potential of fNIRS in assessing learning even under different task feedback conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Selective H3 Antagonist (ABT-239) Differentially Modifies Cognitive Function Under the Impact of Restraint Stress</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.614810</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: A considerable number of competitive antagonists/inverse agonists of histamine H3 receptor (H3R) have progressed to clinical assessment, with pitolisant approved for the treatment of narcolepsy. H3R, highly expressed in the CNS, is regarded as a relevant target in CNS disorders. At the same time, new compounds including ABT-239 H3R antagonist (ABT; benzonitrile, 4-[2-[2-[(2R)-2-methyl-1-pyrrolidinyl]ethyl]-5-benzofuranyl]-) are continually being tested. The study aimed to test ABT-239 as a prophylactic agent in stress-induced memory impairments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Stressed and non-stressed rats were pre-treated with ABT-239 and subsequently subjected to several behavioral tests aimed at assessing the animals’ working and spatial reference memory [Morris water maze (MWM), Barnes maze (BM)], assessing the locomotor function and anxiety-like behavior [Open field (OF), elevated “plus” maze—EPM].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Chronically stressed rats displayed a significant decline in spatial (working and reference) memory. In the MWM test, we observed an improvement in spatial reference memory in stressed animals and a positive after ABT-239 pre-treatment. In the BM test, the effect of ABT-239 administration on spatial memory changed in successive attempts, from negative initially to favorable in subsequent attempts, and negative in the last trial of the test in the control group of rats. However, a beneficial effect is noted in the group of stressed animals, which remained throughout the entire testing period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Presented findings demonstrate that ABT-239 shows the potential to abolish or prevent restraint stress-induced spatial memory impairments and cognitive deficits. However, in conditions of appetitive modulation, it could increase damage to memory (unstressed animals).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Harnessing Neuroimaging to Reduce Socioeconomic Disparities in Chronic Disease: A Conceptual Framework for Improving Health Messaging</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.576749</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Socioeconomic status (SES)-related health disparities persist for numerous chronic diseases, with lower-SES individuals exhibiting greater risk of morbidity and mortality compared to their higher-SES counterparts. One likely contributor is disparities in health messaging efforts, which are currently less effective for motivating health behavior change among those lower in SES. Drawing on communication neuroscience and social neuroscience research, we describe a conceptual framework to improve health messaging effectiveness in lower SES communities. The framework is based on evidence that health-message-induced activity in the ventral striatum (VS) and subdivisions of the medial pre-frontal cortex (MPFC) predicts behavior change. Additionally, we draw from social neuroscience work showing that activity in these regions during valuation and the processing of self-related vs. social information, differs as a function of SES. Bringing together these previously disparate lines of work, we argue that health messages emphasizing the benefits to close others (vs. the self) of engaging in behavior change will be more effective among lower SES individuals. We also outline a research agenda based on our framework. Ultimately, we hope that this framework utilizing a “brain-as-predictor” approach generates novel insights about the neural underpinnings of message-induced behavior change among lower SES individuals, and helps to close the gap in SES-based health disparities by harnessing the power of neuroimaging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Numerical Study on Electrode Design for Rodent Deep Brain Stimulation With Implantations Cranial to Targeted Nuclei</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.631188</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The globus pallidus internus and the subthalamic nucleus are common targets for deep brain stimulation to alleviate symptoms of Parkinson's disease and dystonia. In the rodent models, however, their direct targeting is hindered by the relatively large dimensions of applied electrodes. To reduce the neurological damage, the electrodes are usually implanted cranial to the nuclei, thus exposing the non-targeted brain regions to large electric fields and, in turn, possible undesired stimulation effects. In this numerical study, we analyze the spread of the fields for the conventional electrodes and several modifications. As a result, we present a relatively simple electrode design that allows an efficient focalization of the stimulating field in the inferiorly located nuclei.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Recent Advances in Neural Circuits for Taste Perception in Hunger</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.609824</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Feeding is essential for survival and taste greatly influences our feeding behaviors. Palatable tastes such as sweet trigger feeding as a symbol of a calorie-rich diet containing sugar or proteins, while unpalatable tastes such as bitter terminate further consumption as a warning against ingestion of harmful substances. Therefore, taste is considered a criterion to distinguish whether food is edible. However, perception of taste is also modulated by physiological changes associated with internal states such as hunger or satiety. Empirically, during hunger state, humans find ordinary food more attractive and feel less aversion to food they usually dislike. Although functional magnetic resonance imaging studies performed in primates and in humans have indicated that some brain areas show state-dependent response to tastes, the mechanisms of how the brain senses tastes during different internal states are poorly understood. Recently, using newly developed molecular and genetic tools as well as in vivo imaging, researchers have identified many specific neuronal populations or neural circuits regulating feeding behaviors and taste perception process in the central nervous system. These studies could help us understand the interplay between homeostatic regulation of energy and taste perception to guide proper feeding behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Disruption of Glutamate Transport and Homeostasis by Acute Metabolic Stress</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.637784</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;High-affinity, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent glutamate transporters are the primary means by which synaptically released glutamate is removed from the extracellular space. They restrict the spread of glutamate from the synaptic cleft into the perisynaptic space and reduce its spillover to neighboring synapses. Thereby, glutamate uptake increases the spatial precision of synaptic communication. Its dysfunction and the entailing rise of the extracellular glutamate concentration accompanied by an increased spread of glutamate result in a loss of precision and in enhanced excitation, which can eventually lead to neuronal death via excitotoxicity. Efficient glutamate uptake depends on a negative resting membrane potential as well as on the transmembrane gradients of the co-transported ions (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and thus on the proper functioning of the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase. Consequently, numerous studies have documented the impact of an energy shortage, as occurring for instance during an ischemic stroke, on glutamate clearance and homeostasis. The observations range from rapid changes in the transport activity to altered expression of glutamate transporters. Notably, while astrocytes account for the majority of glutamate uptake under physiological conditions, they may also become a source of extracellular glutamate elevation during metabolic stress. However, the mechanisms of the latter phenomenon are still under debate. Here, we review the recent literature addressing changes of glutamate uptake and homeostasis triggered by acute metabolic stress, i.e., on a timescale of seconds to minutes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Dynamic Cholinergic Tone in the Basal Forebrain Reflects Reward-Seeking and Reinforcement During Olfactory Behavior</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.635837</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sensory perception underlies how we internalize and interact with the external world. In order to adapt to changing circumstances and interpret signals in a variety of contexts, sensation needs to be reliable, but perception of sensory input needs to be flexible. An important mediator of this flexibility is top-down regulation from the cholinergic basal forebrain. Basal forebrain projection neurons serve as pacemakers and gatekeepers for downstream neural networks, modulating circuit activity across diverse neuronal populations. This top-down control is necessary for sensory cue detection, learning, and memory, and is disproportionately disrupted in neurodegenerative diseases associated with cognitive decline. Intriguingly, cholinergic signaling acts locally within the basal forebrain to sculpt the activity of basal forebrain output neurons. To determine how local cholinergic signaling impacts basal forebrain output pathways that participate in top-down regulation, we sought to define the dynamics of cholinergic signaling within the basal forebrain during motivated behavior and learning. Toward this, we utilized fiber photometry and the genetically encoded acetylcholine indicator GAChR2.0 to define temporal patterns of cholinergic signaling in the basal forebrain during olfactory-guided, motivated behaviors and learning. We show that cholinergic signaling reliably increased during reward seeking behaviors, but was strongly suppressed by reward delivery in a go/no-go olfactory-cued discrimination task. The observed transient reduction in cholinergic tone was mirrored by a suppression in basal forebrain GABAergic neuronal activity. Together, these findings suggest that cholinergic tone in the basal forebrain changes rapidly to reflect reward-seeking behavior and positive reinforcement and may impact downstream circuitry that modulates olfaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Anti-apoptosis Effect of Single Electroacupuncture Treatment via Suppressing Neuronal Autophagy in the Acute Stage of Ischemic Stroke Without Infarct Alleviation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.633280</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The main purpose of the study was to investigate the antiapoptotic effect of electroacupuncture (EA) in the acute stage of ischaemic stroke in rats. The cerebral ischemia model was established by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)/reperfusion in rats. A single EA treatment was performed at the acute stage of ischaemic stroke. The neurological function, brain water content, apoptotic cell number, and cerebral infarct volume were assessed in stroke rats. The expression of autophagy-related proteins (LC3II/I, Beclin1, P62, and LAMP1), Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), p-JNK, p-ERK1/2, and cleaved caspase-3 (CCAS3) were measured by Western blot, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry. Rapamycin (RAP, an activator of autophagy) was used to confirm the antiapoptotic effect of EA via regulating autophagy. The brain edema infarct size and apoptotic cell number were increasing within 3 days following stroke, and brain edema reached its peak at 24 h after stroke. EA treatment at 24 h after ischaemic stroke obviously suppressed the number of apoptotic cells and brain edema. However, there were no significant differences in infarct volumes among EA-12 h, EA-24 h, and MCAO/R group. Moreover, EA treatment at 24 h after ischaemic stroke obviously suppressed the expression of CCAS3, LC3II/I, Beclin1 while increasing the level of P62 and LAMP1 and hence mediating autophagy, which was reversed by RAP. Meanwhile, the expression of SIRT1, p-ERK1/2, p-JNK were promoted by EA at 24 h after ischaemic stroke. In conclusion, EA treatment may suppress apoptosis possibly via regulating autophagy in the acute period after ischaemic stroke, hence reducing brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Chronic Exposure to Cadmium and Antioxidants Does Not Affect the Dynamics of Expanded CAG•CTG Trinucleotide Repeats in a Mouse Cell Culture System of Unstable DNA</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.606331</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;More than 30 human disorders are caused by the expansion of simple sequence DNA repeats, among which triplet repeats remain the most frequent. Most trinucleotide repeat expansion disorders affect primarily the nervous system, through mechanisms of neurodysfunction and/or neurodegeneration. While trinucleotide repeat tracts are short and stably transmitted in unaffected individuals, disease-associated expansions are highly dynamic in the germline and in somatic cells, with a tendency toward further expansion. Since longer repeats are associated with increasing disease severity and earlier onset of symptoms, intergenerational repeat size gains account for the phenomenon of anticipation. In turn, higher levels of age-dependent somatic expansion have been linked with increased disease severity and earlier age of onset, implicating somatic instability in the onset and progression of disease symptoms. Hence, tackling the root cause of symptoms through the control of repeat dynamics may provide therapeutic modulation of clinical manifestations. DNA repair pathways have been firmly implicated in the molecular mechanism of repeat length mutation. The demonstration that repeat expansion depends on functional DNA mismatch repair (MMR) proteins, points to MMR as a potential therapeutic target. Similarly, a role of DNA base excision repair (BER) in repeat expansion has also been suggested, particularly during the removal of oxidative lesions. Using a well-characterized mouse cell model system of an unstable CAG•CTG trinucleotide repeat, we tested if expanded repeat tracts can be stabilized by small molecules with reported roles in both pathways: cadmium (an inhibitor of MMR activity) and a variety of antioxidants (capable of neutralizing oxidative species). We found that chronic exposure to sublethal doses of cadmium and antioxidants did not result in significant reduction of the rate of trinucleotide repeat expansion. Surprisingly, manganese yielded a significant stabilization of the triplet repeat tract. We conclude that treatment with cadmium and antioxidants, at doses that do not interfere with cell survival and cell culture dynamics, is not sufficient to modify trinucleotide repeat dynamics in cell culture.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Reversible Tau Phosphorylation Induced by Synthetic Torpor in the Spinal Cord of the Rat</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.592288</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tau is a key protein in neurons, where it affects the dynamics of the microtubule system. The hyperphosphorylation of Tau (PP-Tau) commonly leads to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, as it occurs in tauopathies, a group of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's. Hypothermia-related accumulation of PP-Tau has been described in hibernators and during synthetic torpor (ST), a torpor-like condition that has been induced in rats, a non-hibernating species. Remarkably, in ST PP-Tau is reversible and Tau de-phosphorylates within a few hours following the torpor bout, apparently not evolving into pathology. These observations have been limited to the brain, but in animal models of tauopathies, PP-Tau accumulation also appears to occur in the spinal cord (SpCo). The aim of the present work was to assess whether ST leads to PP-Tau accumulation in the SpCo and whether this process is reversible. Immunofluorescence (IF) for AT8 (to assess PP-Tau) and Tau-1 (non-phosphorylated Tau) was carried out on SpCo coronal sections. AT8-IF was clearly expressed in the dorsal horns (DH) during ST, while in the ventral horns (VH) no staining was observed. The AT8-IF completely disappeared after 6 h from the return to euthermia. Tau-1-IF disappeared in both DH and VH during ST, returning to normal levels during recovery. To shed light on the cellular process underlying the PP-Tau pattern observed, the inhibited form of the glycogen-synthase kinase 3β (the main kinase acting on Tau) was assessed using IF: VH (i.e., in motor neurons) were highly stained mainly during ST, while in DH there was no staining. Since tauopathies are also related to neuroinflammation, microglia activation was also assessed through morphometric analyses, but no ST-induced microglia activation was found in the SpCo. Taken together, the present results show that, in the DH of SpCo, ST induces a reversible accumulation of PP-Tau. Since during ST there is no motor activity, the lack of AT8-IF in VH may result from an activity-related process at a cellular level. Thus, ST demonstrates a newly-described physiological mechanism that is able to resolve the accumulation of PP-Tau and apparently avoid the neurodegenerative outcome.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Cerebrotypes in Cephalopods: Brain Diversity and Its Correlation With Species Habits, Life History, and Physiological Adaptations</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.565109</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Here we analyze existing quantitative data available for cephalopod brains based on classical contributions by J.Z. Young and colleagues, to cite some. We relate the relative brain size of selected regions (area and/or lobe), with behavior, life history, ecology and distribution of several cephalopod species here considered. After hierarchical clustering we identify and describe ten clusters grouping 52 cephalopod species. This allows us to describe cerebrotypes, i.e., differences of brain composition in different species, as a sign of their adaptation to specific niches and/or clades in cephalopod molluscs for the first time. Similarity reflecting niche type has been found in vertebrates, and it is reasonable to assume that it could also occur in Cephalopoda. We also attempted a phylogenetic PCA using data by Lindgren et al. (2012) as input tree. However, due to the limited overlap in species considered, the final analysis was carried out on &amp;lt;30 species, thus reducing the impact of this approach. Nevertheless, our analysis suggests that the phylogenetic signal alone cannot be a justification for the grouping of species, although biased by the limited set of data available to us. Based on these preliminary findings, we can only hypothesize that brains evolved in cephalopods on the basis of different factors including phylogeny, possible development, and the third factor, i.e., life-style adaptations. Our results support the working hypothesis that the taxon evolved different sensorial and computational strategies to cope with the various environments (niches) occupied in the oceans. This study is novel for invertebrates, to the best of our knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.632382</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: This study assessed the methylation of peripheral NCAPH2 in individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), identified its correlation with the hippocampal volume, and explored whether the correlation is influenced by apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE ε4) status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Cognitively normal controls (NCs, n = 56), individuals with SCD (n = 81), and patients with objective cognitive impairment (OCI, n = 51) were included from the Sino Longitudinal Study on Cognitive Decline (NCT03370744). All participants completed neuropsychological assessments, blood tests, and structural MRI. NCAPH2 methylation was compared according to the diagnostic and APOE ε4 status. Partial correlation analysis was conducted to assess the correlations between the hippocampal volume, cognitive tests, and the NCAPH2 methylation levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Individuals with SCD and patients with OCI showed significantly lower levels of NCAPH2 methylation than NCs, which were independent of the APOE ε4 status. The NCAPH2 methylation levels and the hippocampal volumes were positively correlated in the SCD APOE ε4 non-carriers but not in the OCI group. No association was found between the NCAPH2 methylation levels and the cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Abnormal changes in blood NCAPH2 methylation were found to occur in SCD, indicating its potential to be used as a useful peripheral biomarker in the early stage of Alzheimer's disease screening.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Multimodal Retinal Imaging for Detection of Ischemic Stroke</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.615813</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: This study aims to evaluate ocular changes in patients with ischemic stroke using multimodal imaging and explore the predictive value of ocular abnormalities for ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A total of 203 patients (ischemic stroke group, 62; control group, 141) were enrolled in this study. Basic data from patients, including age; gender; height; weight; history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, alcohol use, and coronary heart disease; and smoking status, were collected. Consequently, Doppler color ultrasound, color fundus photography, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) examinations were conducted. Differences in traditional risk factors and ocular parameters between the two groups were compared, and binary logistic regression was used for multivariate analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The central retinal artery equivalent (CRAE) in the ischemic stroke group was 150.72 ± 20.15 μm and that in the control group was 159.68 ± 20.05 μm. The difference was statistically significant (P = 0.004). Moreover, the subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFChT) in the ischemic stroke group was 199.90 ± 69.27 μm and that in the control group was 227.40 ± 62.20 μm. The difference was statistically significant (P = 0.006). Logistic regression results showed that smoking [odds ratio (OR) = 2.823; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.477–5.395], CRAE (OR = 0.980; 95% CI = 0.965–0.996), and SFChT (OR = 0.994; 95% CI = 0.989–0.999) are associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke when ocular parameters were combined with traditional risk factors. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.726, which shows good diagnostic accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: SFChT may be a diagnostic marker for early detection and monitoring of ischemic stroke. Combined with traditional risks, retinal artery diameter, and choroidal thickness, the prediction model can improve ischemic stroke prediction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Detection Gap of Right-Asymmetric Neuronal Degeneration by CERAD Test Battery in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.611595</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objectives: Asymmetric disease characteristics on neuroimaging are common in structural and functional imaging of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly in Alzheimer‘s disease (AD). However, a standardized clinical evaluation of asymmetric neuronal degeneration and its impact on clinical findings has only sporadically been investigated for F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (F-18-FDG-PET). This study aimed to evaluate the impact of lateralized neuronal degeneration on the detection of AD by detailed clinical testing. Furthermore, we compared associations between clinical evaluation and lateralized neuronal degeneration between FDG-PET hypometabolism and hippocampal atrophy. Finally, we investigated if specific subtests show associations with lateralized neuronal degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: One-hundred and forty-six patients with a clinical diagnosis of AD (age 71 ± 8) were investigated by FDG-PET and the “Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s disease” (CERAD) test battery. For assessment of neuronal degeneration, FDG-PET hypometabolism in brain regions typically affected in AD were graded by visual (3D-surface projections) and semiquantitative analysis. Asymmetry of the hippocampus (left-right) in magnetic resonance tomography (MRI) was rated visually by the Scheltens scale. Measures of asymmetry were calculated to quantify lateralized neuronal degeneration and asymmetry scores were subsequently correlated with CERAD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Asymmetry with left-dominant neuronal degeneration to FDG-PET was an independent predictor of cognitive impairment (visual: β = −0.288, p &amp;lt; 0.001; semiquantitative: β = −0.451, p &amp;lt; 0.001) when controlled for age, gender, years of education and total burden of neuronal degeneration, whereas hippocampal asymmetry to MRI was not (β = −0.034; p = 0.731). Direct comparison of CERAD-PET associations in cases with right- and left-lateralized neuronal degeneration estimated a detection gap of 2.7 years for right-lateralized cases. Left-hemispheric neuronal degeneration was significantly associated with the total CERAD score and multiple subscores, whereas only MMSE (semiquantitative: β = 0.429, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and constructional praxis (semiquantitative: β = 0.292, p = 0.008) showed significant associations with right-hemispheric neuronal degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Asymmetry of deteriorated cerebral glucose metabolism has a significant impact on the coupling between neuronal degeneration and cognitive function. Right dominant neuronal degeneration shows a delayed detection by global CERAD testing and requires evaluation of specific subdomains of cognitive testing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Therapeutic Targets of Fingolimod (FTY720) Are Involved in Pathological Processes in the Frontal Cortex of Alzheimer's Disease Patients: A Network Pharmacology Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.609679</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: The sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) modulator fingolimod (FTY720), which is commonly used as an immunomodulator in multiple sclerosis treatment, has recently been found to reduce pathological changes in the brain tissue of Alzheimer's disease (AD) animal models, but this has yet to be verified in human brain tissue. In this study, network pharmacology methods were applied to determine the potential pharmacological mechanisms of fingolimod in the frontal cortex of AD patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: The pharmacological macromolecular targets of fingolimod and fingolimod phosphate were downloaded from SwissTarget and DrugBank. Systematic intersection analysis of the expression profiles of brain frontal cortex tissues (423 AD tissues and 266 control tissues) was performed to obtain AD-associated fingolimod targets (F-ADGs). Immune cell infiltration analysis and a primary mouse cortical culture RNA-seq drug screen database were used to identify immune-related F-ADGs and cortex-related F-ADGs. Then, the expression values of F-ADGs were correlated with the disease severity score (MMSE score) of AD patients to identify severity-related F-ADGs. We also analyzed miRNA expression microarray data in the frontal cortex of AD patients associated with disease severity to obtain severity-related F-ADG-miRNAs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A total of 188 F-ADGs were detected in the frontal cortices of AD patients and were enriched in biological processes such as synaptic signaling, inflammatory response, and response to oxygen-containing compounds. Eleven immune-related F-ADGs (like FPR1, BLNK.) and 17 cortex-related F-ADGs (like ALDH1L1, DUSP1.) were detected. Other F-ADGs, such as S1PR1 and GABBR2, although not classified into the above two categories, were still predicted by bioinformatics methods to play an important role in the development of AD. Two F-ADGs (GNAQ and MMP14) and 28 miRNAs (like miR- 323a-3p, miR-181a-5p.) were found to be associated with AD severity (MMSE 0-27 group). Fifteen F-ADGs (like ALDH1L1, FPR1, and IL6.) and 46 miRNAs (like miR-212-5p, miR-93-5p.) were found to be associated with mild or moderate dementia AD patients' severity (MMSE11-22 subgroup).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Fingolimod may affect the brain frontal cortex function of AD patients in many different ways, such as affecting immune cell infiltration, nerve cell, or glial cell function, and synaptic function. miRNAs may also be involved. ALDH1L1, FPR1, S1PR1, and GABBR2 may be core drug targets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Convergent organization of aberrant MYB complex controls oncogenic gene expression in acute myeloid leukemia</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65905</link>
	<content:encoded>Dysregulated gene expression contributes to most prevalent features in human cancers. Here, we show that most subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) depend on the aberrant assembly of MYB transcriptional co-activator complex. By rapid and selective peptidomimetic interference with the binding of CBP/P300 to MYB, but not CREB or MLL1, we find that the leukemic functions of MYB are mediated by CBP/P300 co-activation of a distinct set of transcription factor complexes. These MYB complexes assemble aberrantly with LYL1, E2A, C/EBP family members, LMO2 and SATB1. They are organized convergently in genetically diverse subtypes of AML, and are at least in part associated with inappropriate transcription factor co-expression. Peptidomimetic remodeling of oncogenic MYB complexes is accompanied by specific proteolysis and dynamic redistribution of CBP/P300 with alternative transcription factors such as RUNX1 to induce myeloid differentiation and apoptosis. Thus, aberrant assembly and sequestration of MYB:CBP/P300 complexes provide a unifying mechanism of oncogenic gene expression in AML. This work establishes a compelling strategy for their pharmacologic reprogramming and therapeutic targeting for diverse leukemias and possibly other human cancers caused by dysregulated gene control.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65180</link>
	<content:encoded>Evolutionary medicine argues that disease can arise because modern conditions do not match those in which we evolved. For example, a decline in exposure to commensal microbes and gastrointestinal helminths in developed countries has been linked to increased prevalence of allergic and autoimmune inflammatory disorders (the hygiene hypothesis). Accordingly, probiotic therapies that restore ‘old friend’ microbes and helminths have been explored as Darwinian treatments for these disorders. A further possibility is that loss of old friend commensals also increases the sterile, aging-associated inflammation known as inflammaging, which contributes to a range of age-related diseases, including cardiovascular disease, dementia, and cancer. Interestingly, Crowe et al., 2020 recently reported that treatment with a secreted glycoprotein from a parasitic nematode can protect against murine aging by induction of anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Here, we explore the hypothesis that restorative helminth therapy would have anti-inflammaging effects. Could worm infections provide broad-spectrum protection against age-related disease?</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64370</link>
	<content:encoded>Recent genomic and scRNA-seq analyses of melanoma demonstrated a lack of recurrent genetic drivers of metastasis, while identifying common transcriptional states correlating with invasion or drug resistance. To test whether transcriptional adaptation can drive melanoma progression, we made use of a zebrafish mitfa:&lt;i&gt;BRAFV600E&lt;/i&gt;;&lt;i&gt;tp53-/-&lt;/i&gt; model, in which malignant progression is characterized by minimal genetic evolution. We undertook an overexpression-screen of 80 epigenetic/transcriptional regulators and found neural crest-mesenchyme developmental regulator SATB2 to accelerate aggressive melanoma development. Its overexpression induces invadopodia formation and invasion in zebrafish tumors and human melanoma cell lines. SATB2 binds and activates neural crest-regulators, including &lt;i&gt;pdgfab&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;snai2&lt;/i&gt;. The transcriptional program induced by SATB2 overlaps with known MITF&lt;sup&gt;low&lt;/sup&gt;AXL&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; and AQP1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;NGFR1&lt;sup&gt;high &lt;/sup&gt;drug resistant states and functionally drives enhanced tumor propagation and resistance to Vemurafenib &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Here we show that melanoma transcriptional rewiring by SATB2 to a neural crest mesenchyme-like program can drive invasion and drug resistance in endogenous tumors.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63671</link>
	<content:encoded>Animal behavior and metabolism are tightly coordinated with sleep-wake cycles governed by the brain in harmony with environmental light:dark cycles. Within the brain, the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH) has been implicated in the integrative control of feeding, energy homeostasis, and circadian rhythms,&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; but the underlying cell types are unknown. Here, we identify a role for DMH leptin receptor-expressing neurons (DMH&lt;sup&gt;LepR&lt;/sup&gt;) in this integrative control. Using a viral approach, we show that silencing neurotransmission in DMH&lt;sup&gt;LepR&lt;/sup&gt; neurons in adult mice not only increases body weight and adiposity, but also phase-advances diurnal rhythms of feeding and metabolism into the light-cycle and abolishes the normal increase in dark-cycle locomotor activity (LMA) characteristic of nocturnal rodents. Finally, DMH&lt;sup&gt;LepR&lt;/sup&gt;-silenced mice fail to entrain to a restrictive change in food availability. Together, these findings identify DMH&lt;sup&gt;LepR&lt;/sup&gt; neurons as critical determinants of the daily time of feeding and associated metabolic rhythms.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63284</link>
	<content:encoded>A farnesylated and methylated form of prelamin A called progerin causes Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS). Inhibiting progerin methylation by inactivating the isoprenylcysteine carboxylmethyltransferase (ICMT) gene stimulates proliferation of HGPS cells and improves survival of &lt;i&gt;Zmpste24&lt;/i&gt;-deficient mice. However, we don't know whether &lt;i&gt;Icmt&lt;/i&gt; inactivation improves phenotypes in an authentic HGPS mouse model. Moreover, it is unknown whether pharmacologic targeting of ICMT would be tolerated by cells and produce similar cellular effects as genetic inactivation. Here, we show that knockout of &lt;i&gt;Icmt&lt;/i&gt; improves survival of HGPS mice and restores vascular smooth muscle cell numbers in the aorta. We also synthesized a potent ICMT inhibitor called C75 and found that it delays senescence and stimulates proliferation of late-passage HGPS cells and &lt;i&gt;Zmpste24&lt;/i&gt;-deficient mouse fibroblasts. Importantly, C75 did not influence proliferation of wild-type human cells or &lt;i&gt;Zmpste24&lt;/i&gt;-deficient mouse cells lacking &lt;i&gt;Icmt&lt;/i&gt;, indicating drug specificity. These results raise hopes that ICMT inhibitors could be useful for treating children with HGPS.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Traditional clinical prediction models focus on parameters of the individual patient. For infectious diseases, sources external to the patient, including characteristics of prior patients and seasonal factors, may improve predictive performance. We describe the development of a predictive model that integrates multiple sources of data in a principled statistical framework using a post-test odds formulation. Our method enables electronic real-time updating and flexibility, such that components can be included or excluded according to data availability. We apply this method to the prediction of etiology of pediatric diarrhea, where 'pre-test’ epidemiologic data may be highly informative. Diarrhea has a high burden in low-resource settings, and antibiotics are often over-prescribed. We demonstrate that our integrative method outperforms traditional prediction in accurately identifying cases with a viral etiology, and show that its clinical application, especially when used with an additional diagnostic test, could result in a 61% reduction in inappropriately prescribed antibiotics.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/62174</link>
	<content:encoded>Heart failure is a major public health problem, and abnormal iron metabolism is common in patients with heart failure. Although iron is necessary for metabolic homeostasis, it induces a programmed necrosis. Iron release from ferritin storage is through nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4)-mediated autophagic degradation, known as ferritinophagy. However, the role of ferritinophagy in the stressed heart remains unclear. Deletion of &lt;i&gt;Ncoa4&lt;/i&gt; in mouse hearts reduced left ventricular chamber size and improved cardiac function along with the attenuation of the upregulation of ferritinophagy-mediated ferritin degradation 4 weeks after pressure overload. Free ferrous iron overload and increased lipid peroxidation were suppressed in NCOA4-deficient hearts. A potent inhibitor of lipid peroxidation, ferrostatin-1, significantly mitigated the development of pressure overload-induced dilated cardiomyopathy in wild-type mice. Thus, the activation of ferritinophagy results in the development of heart failure, whereas inhibition of this process protects the heart against hemodynamic stress.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/62097</link>
	<content:encoded>To orchestrate collective polarization across tissues, planar cell polarity (PCP) proteins localize asymmetrically to cell junctions, a conserved feature of PCP that requires the atypical cadherin Celsr1. We report that mouse Celsr1 engages in both &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-interactions, and organizes into dense and highly stable punctate assemblies. We provide evidence suggesting that PCP-mutant variant of Celsr1, Celsr1&lt;sup&gt;Crsh&lt;/sup&gt;, selectively impairs lateral &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-interactions. Although Celsr1&lt;sup&gt;Crsh&lt;/sup&gt; mediates cell adhesion in trans, it displays increased mobility, diminishes junctional enrichment, and fails to engage in homophilic adhesion with the wild-type protein, phenotypes that can be rescued by ectopic &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-dimerization. Using biochemical and super-resolution microscopy approaches, we show that although Celsr1&lt;sup&gt;Crsh&lt;/sup&gt; physically interacts with PCP proteins Frizzled6 and Vangl2, it fails to organize these proteins into asymmetric junctional complexes. Our results suggest mammalian Celsr1 functions not only as a &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-adhesive homodimeric bridge, but also as an organizer of intercellular Frizzled6 and Vangl2 asymmetry through lateral, &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-interactions.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60200</link>
	<content:encoded>Epistasis is often used to probe functional relationships between genes, and it plays an important role in evolution. However, we lack theory to understand how functional relationships at the molecular level translate into epistasis at the level of whole-organism phenotypes, such as fitness. Here, I derive two rules for how epistasis between mutations with small effects propagates from lower- to higher-level phenotypes in a hierarchical metabolic network with first-order kinetics and how such epistasis depends on topology. Most importantly, weak epistasis at a lower level may be distorted as it propagates to higher levels. Computational analyses show that epistasis in more realistic models likely follows similar, albeit more complex, patterns. These results suggest that pairwise inter-gene epistasis should be common and it should generically depend on the genetic background and environment. Furthermore, the epistasis coefficients measured for high-level phenotypes may not be sufficient to fully infer the underlying functional relationships.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Understanding how injury to the Central Nervous System (CNS) induces de novo neurogenesis in animals would help promote regeneration in humans. Regenerative neurogenesis could originate from glia and glial Neuron-Glia antigen-2 (NG2) may sense injury-induced neuronal signals, but these are unknown. Here, we used &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; to search for genes functionally related the &lt;i&gt;NG2&lt;/i&gt; homologue &lt;i&gt;kon-tiki (kon),&lt;/i&gt; and identified &lt;i&gt;Islet Antigen-2 (Ia-2),&lt;/i&gt; required in neurons for insulin secretion. Alterations in Ia-2 function induced neural stem cell gene expression, injury increased &lt;i&gt;ia-2&lt;/i&gt; expression and induced ectopic neural stem cells. Using genetic analysis and lineage tracing, we demonstrate that Ia-2 and Kon regulate &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; insulin-like peptide 6 (Dilp-6), to induce glial proliferation and neural stem cells from glia. Ectopic neural stem cells can divide, and limited de novo neurogenesis could be traced back to glial cells. Altogether, Ia-2 and Dilp-6 drive a neuron-glia relay that restores glia, and reprograms glia into neural stem cells for regeneration.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58744</link>
	<content:encoded>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a prominent risk factor for dementias including tauopathies like chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The mechanisms that promote prion-like spreading of Tau aggregates after TBI are not fully understood, in part due to lack of tractable animal models. Here, we test the putative role of seizures in promoting the spread of tauopathy. We introduce ‘tauopathy reporter’ zebrafish expressing a genetically encoded fluorescent Tau biosensor that reliably reports accumulation of human Tau species when seeded via intraventricular brain injections. Subjecting zebrafish larvae to a novel TBI paradigm produced various TBI features including cell death, post–traumatic seizures, and Tau inclusions. Bath application of dynamin inhibitors or anticonvulsant drugs rescued TBI-induced tauopathy and cell death. These data suggest a role for seizure activity in the prion-like seeding and spreading of tauopathy following TBI. Further work is warranted regarding anti-convulsants that dampen post-traumatic seizures as a route to moderating subsequent tauopathy.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The stress response is multifactorial and enrolls circuitries to build a coordinated reaction, leading to behavioral, endocrine, and autonomic changes. These changes are mainly related to the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation and the organism's integrity. However, when self-regulation is ineffective, stress becomes harmful and predisposes the organism to pathologies. The chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) is a widely used experimental model since it induces physiological and behavioral changes and better mimics the stressors variability encountered in daily life. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and glucocorticoid (GCs) are deeply implicated in the CUS-induced physiological and behavioral changes. Nonetheless, the CUS modulation of CRF receptors and GR and the norepinephrine role in extra-hypothalamic brain areas were not well explored. Here, we show that 14-days of CUS induced a long-lasting HPA axis hyperactivity evidenced by plasmatic corticosterone increase and adrenal gland hypertrophy, which was dependent on both GCs and NE release induced by each stress session. CUS also increased CRF2 mRNA expression and GR protein levels in fundamental brain structures related to HPA regulation and behavior, such as the lateral septal nucleus intermedia part (LSI), ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH), and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). We also showed that NE participates in the CUS-induced increase in CRF2 and GR levels in the LSI, reinforcing the locus coeruleus (LC) involvement in the HPA axis modulation. Despite the CUS-induced molecular changes in essential areas related to anxiety-like behavior, this phenotype was not observed in CUS animals 24 h after the last stress session.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Paradoxical hyperexcitability from NaV1.2 sodium channel loss in neocortical pyramidal cells</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.429423v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Loss-of-function variants in the gene SCN2A, which encodes the sodium channel NaV1.2, are strongly associated with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability. An estimated 20-30% of children with these variants are co-morbid for epilepsy, with altered neuronal activity originating in neocortex, a region where NaV1.2 channels are expressed predominantly in excitatory pyramidal cells. This is paradoxical, as sodium channel loss in excitatory cells would be expected to dampen neocortical activity rather than promote seizure. Here, we examined pyramidal neurons lacking NaV1.2 channels and found that they were intrinsically hyperexcitable, firing high-frequency bursts of action potentials (APs) despite decrements in AP size and speed. Compartmental modeling and dynamic clamp recordings revealed that NaV1.2 loss prevented potassium channels from properly repolarizing neurons between APs, increasing overall excitability by allowing neurons to reach threshold for subsequent APs more rapidly. This cell-intrinsic mechanism may therefore account for why SCN2A loss-of-function can paradoxically promote seizure.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Comparing synaptic proteomes across seven mouse models for autism reveals molecular subtypes and deficits in Rho GTPase signaling</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.429412v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Impaired synaptic function is a common phenotype in animal models for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and ASD risk genes are enriched for synaptic function. Here we leverage the availability of multiple ASD mouse models exhibiting synaptic deficits and behavioral correlates of ASD and use quantitative mass spectrometry with isobaric tandem mass tagging (TMT) to compare the hippocampal synaptic proteomes from 7 mouse models. We identified common altered cellular and molecular pathways at the synapse, including changes in Rho family small GTPase signaling, suggesting that it may be a point of convergence in ASD. Comparative analyses also revealed clusters of synaptic profiles, with similarities observed among models for Fragile X syndrome (Fmr1 knockout), PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (Pten haploinsufficiency), and the BTBR+ model of idiopathic ASD. Opposing changes were found in models for cortical dysplasia focal epilepsy syndrome (Cntnap2 knockout), Phelan McDermid syndrome (Shank3 InsG3680), Timothy syndrome (Cacna1c G406R), and ANKS1B syndrome (Anks1b haploinsufficiency), which were similar to each other. We propose that these clusters of synaptic profiles form the basis for molecular subtypes that explain genetic heterogeneity in ASD despite a common clinical diagnosis. Drawn from an internally controlled survey of the synaptic proteome across animal models, our findings support the notion that synaptic dysfunction in the hippocampus is a shared mechanism of disease in ASD, and that Rho GTPase signaling may be an important pathway leading to disease phenotypes in autism.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Deficits of Hippocampal RNA Editing and Social Interaction Resulting from Prenatal Stress are Mitigated by Clozapine.</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.429408v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Neurodevelopmental deficits resulting from prenatal stress are associated with neurological disorders that include deficits of social behavior, such as schizophrenia and autism. Studies of human brain and animal models indicate that an epitranscriptomic process known as RNA editing contributes to the pathophysiology of these disorders, which occur more frequently in males than in females. RNA editing plays an important role in brain development through its modification of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. Methods: We exposed pregnant mice to restraint stress three times daily during gestational weeks 2 and 3. We treated the adult male offspring with haloperidol (1mg/kg), clozapine (5mg/kg) or saline twice daily for 5 days. Subsequently we measured social interaction behavior (SI) and locomotor activity, followed by next-generation sequencing analyses of hippocampal RNA editing. Results: Mice exposed to PRS exhibited reduced SI, which correlated with hippocampal RNA editing of -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor subunits GluA2, GluA3 and GluA4, the potassium channel Kv1.1, the calcium channel subunit Cav1.3, calcium-dependent secretion activator (CAPS-1) and the calcium-dependent cell adhesion protein, cadherin 22 (CDH22). Treatment with clozapine, but not haloperidol, normalized SI behavior, and selectively reduced the deficits in GluA2 RNA editing in PRS mice. Conclusions: RNA editing may contribute to impaired hippocampal function after exposure to PRS. The efficacy of clozapine in improving SI behavior may include indirect stimulation of GluA2 RNA editing in the hippocampus. Although these data are from male mice and not humans, the results suggest a new molecular pathway by which PRS leads to life-long impairments of hippocampal function.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Synchronous neurotransmission is central to efficient information transfer in neural circuits, requiring precise coupling between action potentials, Ca2+ entry and neurotransmitter release. However, determinations of Ca2+ requirements for release, which may originate from just single channels, remain largely unexplored in simple active zone synapses common in the nervous system, key to addressing synaptic dysfunction in numerous neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we present single channel resolution analyses of evoked active zone Ca2+ entry, using cell attached patch clamp and lattice light sheet microscopy, at single central lamprey reticulospinal presynaptic terminals. Our findings show a small pool of Ca2+ channels at each terminal, comprising subtypes N (CaV2.2), P/Q (CaV2.1) and R (CaV2.3), implicated in neurotransmitter release. Significantly, of this pool only 3-6 channels open upon depolarization. High temporal fidelity lattice light sheet imaging reveals AP-evoked Ca2+ transients exhibiting quantal amplitude variations between action potentials and stochastic variation of precise locations of Ca2+ entry within the active zone. Further, VGCC numbers at each active zone correlate to the number of presynaptic primed synaptic vesicles. Together, our findings indicate 1:1 association of Ca2+ channels with primed vesicles, suggesting Ca2+ entry via as few as one channel may trigger neurotransmitter release.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Severe deficiency of voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.2 elevates neuronal excitability in adult mice</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.429384v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Scn2a encodes voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.2, which mediates neuronal firing. The current paradigm suggests that NaV1.2 gain-of-function variants enhance neuronal excitability resulting in epilepsy, whereas NaV1.2 deficiency impairs neuronal excitability contributing to autism. In this paradigm, however, why about a third of patients with NaV1.2 deficiency still develop seizures remains a mystery. Here we challenge the conventional wisdom, reporting that neuronal excitability is increased with severe NaV1.2 deficiency. Using a unique gene-trap knockout mouse model of Scn2a, we found enhanced intrinsic excitabilities of principal neurons in the cortico-striatal circuit, known to be involved in Scn2a-related seizures. This increased excitability is autonomous, and is reversible by genetic restoration of Scn2a expression in adult mice. Mechanistic investigation reveals a compensatory downregulation of potassium channels including KV1.1, which could be targeted to alleviate neuronal hyperexcitability. Our unexpected findings may explain NaV1.2 deficiency-related epileptic seizures in humans and provide molecular targets for potential interventions.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Angiotensin-II modulates GABAergic neurotransmission in the mouse substantia nigra.</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.429274v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>GABAergic projections neurons of the substantia nigra reticulata (SNr), through an extensive network of dendritic arbors and axon collaterals, provide robust inhibitory input to neighboring dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra compacta (SNc). Angiotensin-II (Ang-II) receptor signaling increases SNc dopaminergic neuronal sensitivity to insult, thus rendering these cells susceptible to dysfunction and destruction. However, the mechanisms by which Ang-II regulates SNc dopaminergic neuronal activity are unclear. Given the complex relationship between SN dopaminergic and GABAergic neurons, we hypothesized that Ang-II could regulate SNc dopaminergic neuronal activity directly and indirectly by modulating SNr GABAergic neurotransmission. Herein, using transgenic mice, slice electrophysiology, and optogenetics, we provide evidence of an AT1 receptor-mediated signaling mechanism in SNr GABAergic neurons where Ang-II suppresses electrically-evoked neuronal output by facilitating postsynaptic GABAA receptors and prolonging the action potential duration. Unexpectedly, Ang-II had no discernable effects on the electrical properties of SNc dopaminergic neurons. Also, and indicating a nonlinear relationship between electrical activity and neuronal output, following phasic photoactivation of SNr GABAergic neurons, Ang-II paradoxically enhanced the feedforward inhibitory input to SNc dopaminergic neurons. In sum, our observations describe an increasingly complex and heterogeneous response of the SN to Ang-II by revealing cell-specific responses and nonlinear effects on intranigral GABAergic neurotransmission. Our data further implicate the renin-angiotensin-system as a functionally relevant neuromodulator in the basal ganglia, thus underscoring a need for additional inquiry.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Midbrain microglia exhibit early proliferative and inflammatory responses during aging that are modulated by CX3CR1 and microglial ablation and repopulation</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.429070v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Microglia maintain tissue health and can critically influence synaptic connectivity and function. During aging, microglia produce inflammatory factors, show reduced tissue surveillance, altered interactions with synapses, and prolonged responses to insults. In addition, risk genes for neurodegenerative disease are highly expressed by microglia. These findings argue that microglial function is likely to critically shape vulnerability or resilience of neurons during aging. We recently discovered that microglia in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of young adult mice differ markedly from their counterparts in other brain regions. Whether this regional variation in microglia persists, diminishes, or increases during aging has not been determined. Here, we analyze microglia in several nuclei of the basal ganglia throughout the lifespan in mice and find that VTA microglia exhibit increased proliferation and production of inflammatory factors months prior to microglia in other basal ganglia nuclei. Comparable early proliferative responses were observed in the substantia nigra pars compacta where disease-vulnerable dopamine neurons reside. These proliferative and inflammatory responses of VTA microglia began as early at 13 months of age in mice and were not accompanied by substantial neuronal loss or changes in local astrocyte number. Finally, these region-specific responses of microglia to aging were enhanced by knockout of the fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) and reduced by microglial ablation and repopulation, identifying two signaling axes by which region-specific responses of microglia to aging can be modulated. Collectively, these findings indicate that VTA and SNc microglia continue to differ from their counterparts in other basal ganglia nuclei during aging. Moreover, the early phenotypic changes in these cells result in local inflammation near dopamine neurons beginning in middle age, which may be linked to enhanced vulnerability of these neurons to functional decline and degenerative disease.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Protein lactylation induced by neural excitation</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.428370v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Lactate is known to have diverse roles in the brain at the molecular and behavioral levels under both physiological and pathophysiological conditions, such as learning and memory and regulation of mood. Recently, a novel post-translational modification called lysine lactylation has been found in histone H3 of mouse macrophages, and the lactylation levels paralleled the intracellular lactate levels. However, it was unknown whether lysine lactylation occurs in brain cells, and if it does, whether lactylation is induced by the stimuli that accompany changes in lactate levels. Herein, for the first time, we reveal that lysine lactylation in brain cells is regulated by systemic changes in lactate levels, neural excitation, and behaviorally relevant stimuli. The expression level of pan-lysine lactylation was increased by lactate treatment and by high-potassium-induced depolarization in cultured primary neurons; these increases were attenuated by pharmacological inhibition of monocarboxylate transporter 2 and lactate dehydrogenase, respectively, suggesting that both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous neuronal mechanisms are involved in overall lysine lactylation. In vivo, electroconvulsive stimulation increased lysine lactylation levels in the prefrontal cortices of mice, and its levels were positively correlated with the expression levels of the neuronal activity marker c-Fos on an individual cell basis. To investigate the behavior of lysine lactylation in the brain in response to physiologically relevant stimuli, we adopted the social defeat stress model of depression in which lactate levels increase in the brains of mice. Lactylation levels were increased in the prefrontal cortices of the defeated mice, which was accompanied by increased c-Fos expression, decreased social behaviors, and increased anxiety-like behaviors, suggesting that stress-induced neuronal excitation may induce lysine lactylation, thereby affecting mood-related behaviors. Further, we identified 53 candidate lysine-lactylated proteins in the mouse cortex and found that lactylation levels in histone H1 increased in response to defeat stress. The present study may open up an avenue for exploration of a novel role of lactate mediated by protein lactylation in the brain.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.425931v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Cognitive dysfunction and dementia are presently recognized as major complications in alpha-synucleinopathies, namely in Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) and Parkinsons disease with dementia (PDD). In these disorders, alpha-Synuclein (aSyn) accumulation affects severely the hippocampus by inducing synaptic dysfunction which culminates in cognitive impairment. To characterize the mechanisms underlying aSyn-induced neuronal dysfunction we analysed the effect of overexpression or extracellular administration of aSyn on hippocampal neurons. We observed that aSyn induces the dysregulation of the actin-binding protein cofilin and its assembly into rod structures in a mechanism mediated by the cellular prion protein (PrPc). Moreover, we unraveled cofilin pathology as mediator of aSyn-induced dendritic spine impairment in hippocampal neurons. Importantly, in a synucleinopathy mouse model with cognitive impairment we validated cofilin dysregulation and synaptic dysfunction at the same age when cognitive deficits were observed. Our data supports cofilin as a novel player on hippocampal synaptic dysfunction triggered by aSyn on Lewy Body dementias.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Although the contents of working memory (WM) can be decoded from activity in visual cortex, these representations may play a limited role if they are not robust to distraction. Here, we used model-based fMRI to estimate the impact that a distracting visual task had on WM representations in several visual field maps in visual and frontoparietal association cortex. Distraction caused the fidelity of WM representations in all maps to briefly dip when both the memorandum and distractor were jointly encoded by the population activities. Moreover, distraction induced small biases in memory errors which were predicted by biases in neural decoding in early visual cortex, but not other regions. Although distraction briefly disrupts WM representations, the widespread redundancy with which WM information is encoded may protect against catastrophic loss. In early visual cortex, nonetheless, the neural representation of information in WM and behavioral performance were intertwined, solidifying its importance in memory.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.429258v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is among the foremost methods for mapping human brain function but provides only an indirect measure of underlying neural activity. Recent findings suggest that the neurophysiological correlates of the fMRI blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal might be regionally specific. We examined the neurophysiological correlates of the fMRI BOLD signal in the hippocampus and neocortex, where differences in neural architecture might result in a different relationship between the respective signals. Fifteen human neurosurgical patients (10 female, 5 male) implanted with depth electrodes performed a verbal free recall task while electrophysiological activity was recorded simultaneously from hippocampal and neocortical sites. The same patients subsequently performed a similar version of the task during a later fMRI session. Subsequent memory effects (SMEs) were computed for both imaging modalities as patterns of encoding-related brain activity predictive of later free recall. Linear mixed-effects modelling revealed that the relationship between BOLD and gamma-band SMEs was moderated by the lobar location of the recording site. BOLD and high gamma (70-150 Hz) SMEs positively covaried across much of the neocortex. This relationship was reversed in the hippocampus, where a negative correlation between BOLD and high gamma SMEs was evident. We also observed a negative relationship between BOLD and low gamma (30-70 Hz) SMEs in the medial temporal lobe more broadly. These results suggest that the neurophysiological correlates of the BOLD signal in the hippocampus differ from those observed in the neocortex.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Slower prefrontal metastable dynamics during deliberation predicts error trials in a distance discrimination task</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.429249v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Previous studies have established the involvement of prefrontal cortex (PFC) neurons in decision processes in many task contexts. Single neurons and populations of neurons have been found to represent stimuli, actions, and internal deliberations. However, it is much less clear which underlying computations are affected during errors. Neural activity during errors can help to disambiguate confounds and clarify which computations are essential during a specific task. Here, we used a hidden Markov model (HMM) to perform a trial-by-trial analysis of ensembles of simultaneously recorded neurons from the dorsolateral prefrontal (PFdl) cortex of two rhesus monkeys performing a distance discrimination task. The HMM segments the neural activity into sequences of metastable states, allowing to link neural ensemble dynamics with task and behavioral features in the absence of external triggers. We report a precise relationship between the modulation of the metastable dynamics and task features. Specifically, we found that errors were made more often when the metastable dynamics slowed down, while trial difficulty influenced the latency of state transitions at a pivotal point during the trial. Both these phenomena occurred during the decision interval and not following the action, with errors occurring in both easy and difficult trials. Thus, modulations of metastable dynamics reflected a state of internal deliberation rather than actions taken or, in the case of error trials, objective trial difficulty. Our results show that temporal modulations of PFdl activity are key determinants of internal deliberations, providing further support for the emerging role of metastable cortical dynamics in mediating complex cognitive functions and behavior.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The primate prefrontal cortex (PFC) is situated at the core of higher brain functions by linking and cooperating with the caudate nucleus (CD) and mediodorsal thalamus (MD) via neural circuits. However, the distinctive roles of these prefronto-subcortical pathways remain elusive. Combining in vivo neuronal projection mapping with chemogenetic synaptic silencing, we reversibly dissected key pathways from PFC to the CD and MD individually in single monkeys. We found that silencing the bilateral PFC-MD projections, but not the PFC-CD projections, impaired performance in a spatial working memory task. Conversely, silencing the unilateral PFC-CD projection, but not the PFC-MD projection, altered preference in a free-choice task. These results revealed dissociable roles of the prefronto-subcortical pathways in working memory and decision-making, representing the technical advantage of imaging-guided pathway-selective chemogenetic manipulation for dissecting neural circuits underlying cognitive functions in primates.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Voluntary alcohol consumption disrupts coupling of prefrontal cortical activity to arousal</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.429229v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Alcohol use disorder (AUD) exacts a major personal, societal, and economic toll. Top-down control from the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a critical hub for decision making, executive, and other cognitive functions, is key for the regulation of alcohol consumption. Arousal exerts profound effects on cortical processing, allowing it to potentially modulate PFC functions relevant for alcohol consumption and AUD. Despite this, it is unclear whether and how arousal-mediated modulation of PFC circuits relates to voluntary alcohol drinking behaviors. Two-photon microscopy is ideally suited for dissecting the neural circuit mechanisms underlying the effect of alcohol on intact circuits in behaving animals. We addressed a major limitation of this technology by developing a novel behavioral paradigm for voluntary drinking in head-fixed mice. We recorded responses of layer 2/3 excitatory neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) subdivision of the PFC as mice voluntarily consumed ethanol, along with video recording of the pupil to track momentary fluctuations in arousal. Ethanol consumption bidirectionally modified the activity of subsets of ACC neurons, both at slow (minutes) and fast (sub-second) time scales. Remarkably, we found that the coupling of arousal to ACC activity before drinking was associated with subsequent ethanol engagement behavior. In turn, ethanol consumption modulated neuronal-arousal coupling. Together, our results suggest neuronal-arousal coupling as a key biomarker for alcohol drinking and lays the groundwork for future studies to dissect the therapeutic potential of this process for AUD and other substance use disorders.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.429222v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The meninges remain an unexplored area of neurobiology. These structures play host to dozens of morbid pathologies. This protocol provides a reliable way to identify and isolate pial cells from mice using robust markers of pial identity in mouse and human tissues. We describe a protocol for the extraction of pia mater cells from mice and their culture as primary cells in vitro. Using an array of transcriptomic, histological, and flow cytometric analyses, we identified Icam1 and Slc38a2 as two novel pia mater markers in vitro and in vivo. Our results confirm the fibroblastoid nature of pial cells and their ability to form a sheet-like layer that covers the brain parenchyma. To our knowledge, this is the first published protocol for the isolation, tissue culture, and marker identification of pial cells from mice. These findings will enable researchers in CNS barriers to describe pial cell functions in both health and disease.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Maladaptive cue-controlled cocaine-seeking habits promote increased relapse severity in rats.</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.429216v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The inflexible pursuit of drug-seeking and great tendency to relapse that characterize addiction has been associated with the recruitment of the dorsolateral striatum-dependent habit system. However, the mechanisms by which maladaptive drug-seeking habits influence subsequent relapse are obscure. Here, we show that rats with a long history of cocaine-seeking, controlled by drug-paired cues and mediated by the habit system, show highly exacerbated drug-seeking at relapse that is not mediated by cocaine withdrawal. This heightened tendency to relapse is underpinned by transient engagement of the dorsomedial striatum goal-directed system and reflects emergent negative urgency resulting from the prevention of enacting the seeking habit during abstinence. These results reveal a novel mechanism underlying the pressure to relapse and indicate a target for preventing it.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Kv1.1 subunits localize to cardiorespiratory brain networks in mice where their absence induces astrogliosis and microgliosis</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.429209v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Cardiorespiratory collapse following a seizure is a suspected cause of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), the leading cause of epilepsy-related mortality. In the commonly used Kcna1 gene knockout (Kcna1-/-) mouse model of SUDEP, cardiorespiratory profiling reveals an array of aberrant breathing patterns that could contribute to risk of seizure-related mortality. However, the brain structures mediating these respiratory abnormalities remain unknown. We hypothesize that Kv1.1 deficiency in respiratory control centers of the brain contribute to respiratory dysfunction in Kcna1-/- mice leading to increased SUDEP risk. Thus, in this study, we first used immunohistochemistry to map expression of Kv1.1 protein in cardiorespiratory brain regions of wild-type Kcna1+/+ (WT) mice. Next, GFAP and Iba1 immunostaining was used to test for the presence of astrogliosis and microgliosis, respectively, in the cardiorespiratory centers of Kcna1-/- mice, which could be indicative of seizure-related brain injury that could impair breathing. In WT type mice, we detected Kv1.1 protein in all cardiorespiratory centers examined, including the basolateral amygdala, dorsal respiratory group, dorsal motor nucleus of vagus, nucleus ambiguus, ventral respiratory column, and pontine respiratory group, as well as chemosensory centers including the retrotrapezoid and median raphae nuclei. Extensive gliosis was observed in the same areas in Kcna1-/- mice suggesting that seizure-associated brain injury could contribute to respiratory abnormalities.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: RIM and RIM-binding protein localize synaptic Cav2 channels in a differential manner to regulate transmission in neuronal circuits</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.429206v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Synapses are intricately organized subcellular compartments in which molecular machines cooperate to ensure spatiotemporally precise transmission of chemical signals. Key components of this machinery are voltage-gated Ca2+-channels (VGCCs), that translate electrical signals into a trigger for fusion of synaptic vesicles (SVs) with the plasma membrane. The VGCCs and the Ca2+ microdomains they generate must be located in the right distance to the primed SV, to elicit transmitter release without delay. Rab3 interacting molecule (RIM) and RIM-binding protein (RIM-BP) were shown in different systems to contribute to the spatial organization of the active zone protein scaffold, and to localize VGCCs next to docked SVs by binding to each other and to the C-terminal region of the Cav2 VGCC -subunit. We asked how this machinery is organized at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) of Caenorhabditis elegans, and whether it can differentially regulate transmission in circuits composed of different neuron types. rimb-1 mutants had mild synaptic defects, through loosening the anchoring of the UNC-2 VGCC and delaying the onset of SV fusion, while RIM deletion had much more severe defects. rimb-1 mutants caused increased cholinergic but reduced GABAergic transmission, while overall transmission at the NMJ was reduced, as shown by voltage imaging. The UNC-2 channel could further be untethered by removing its C-terminal PDZ binding motif, and this untethering could be exacerbated by combining the {Delta}PDZ mutant with the rimb-1 mutation. Similar phenotypes resulted from acute degradation of the UNC-2 {beta}-subunit, indicating that destabilization of the VGCC complex causes the same phenotypes as its untethering.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Properties of multi-vesicular release from rod photoreceptors support transmission of single photon responses</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.429179v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Vision under starlight requires rod photoreceptors to transduce and transmit single photon responses to the visual system. This remarkable sensitivity depends on a small voltage change reliably reducing glutamate release such that post-synaptic rod bipolar cells can robustly detect the signal. To transmit this small signal, we have found that rod vesicle release deviates strongly from a Poisson process under conditions that mimic darkness. Specifically, at their resting membrane potential in darkness, rods exhibit coordinated and regularly timed multivesicular release events. Each release event consisted of ~17 vesicles and occurred 2-3 times more regularly than expected from a Poisson process. Hyperpolarizing rods to mimic the voltage change produced by a single photon response abruptly reduced the probability of multivesicular release nearly to zero with a rebound increase in release probability at stimulus offset. Simulations of these release dynamics indicate that this regularly timed, multivesicular release promotes transmission of single photon responses to post-synaptic neurons. Furthermore, the mechanism is efficient, requiring fewer vesicles to be released per second than uniquantal release governed by Poisson statistics.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.429173v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Biological neural networks operate at several levels of granularity, from the individual neuron to local neural circuits to networks of thousands of cells. The daily oscillation of the brain master clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) rests on a yet to be identified network of connectivity among its 20,000 neurons. The SCN provides an accessible model to explore neural organization at several levels of organization. To relate cellular to local and global network behaviors, we explore network topology by examining SCN slices in three orientations using immunochemistry, light and confocal microscopy, real-time imaging, and mathematical modeling. Importantly, the results reveal small local groupings of neurons that form intermediate structures, here termed phaseomes which can be identified through stable local phase differences of varying magnitude among neighboring cells. These local differences in phase are distinct from the global phase relationship, that between individual cells and the mean oscillation of the overall SCN. The magnitude of the phaseomes local phase differences are associated with a global phase gradient observed in the SCN rostral-caudal extent. Modeling results show that a gradient in connectivity strength can explain the observed gradient of phaseome strength, an extremely parsimonious explanation for the heterogeneous oscillatory structure of the SCN.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Learned movements can be skillfully performed at different paces. What neural strategies produce this flexibility? Can they be predicted and understood by network modeling? We trained monkeys to perform a cycling task at different speeds, and trained artificial recurrent networks to generate the empirical muscle-activity patterns. Network solutions reflected the principle that smooth well-behaved dynamics require low trajectory tangling, and yielded quantitative and qualitative predictions. To evaluate predictions, we recorded motor cortex population activity during the same task. Responses supported the hypothesis that the dominant neural signals reflect not muscle activity, but network-level strategies for generating muscle activity. Single-neuron responses were better accounted for by network activity than by muscle activity. Similarly, neural population trajectories shared their organization not with muscle trajectories, but with network solutions. Thus, cortical activity could be understood based on the need to generate muscle activity via dynamics that allow smooth, robust control over movement speed.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Cortico-amygdalar connectivity and externalizing/internalizing behavior in children with neurodevelopmental disorders</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.429143v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Externalizing and internalizing behaviors are common and contribute to impairment in children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Associations between externalizing or internalizing behaviors and cortico-amygdalar connectivity have been found in children with and without clinically significant internalizing/externalizing behaviors. This study examined whether such associations are present across children with different NDDs. Methods: Multi-modal neuroimaging and behavioral data from the Province of Ontario Neurodevelopmental Disorders (POND) Network were used. POND participants aged 6-18 years with a primary diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), as well as typically developing children (TDC) with T1-weighted, resting-state fMRI or diffusion weighted imaging and parent-report Child Behavioral Checklist (CBCL) data available, were analyzed (n range=157-346). Associations between externalizing or internalizing behavior and cortico-amygdalar structural and functional connectivity indices were examined using linear regressions, controlling for age, gender, and image-modality specific covariates. Behavior-by-diagnosis interaction effects were also examined. Results: No significant linear associations (or diagnosis-by-behavior interaction effects) were found between CBCL-measured externalizing or internalizing behaviors and any of the connectivity indices examined. Post-hoc bootstrapping analyses indicated stability and reliability of these null results. Conclusions: The current study provides evidence in favour of the absence of a shared linear relationship between internalizing or externalizing behaviors and cortico-amygdalar connectivity properties across a transdiagnostic sample of children with various NDDs and TDC. Detecting shared brain-behavior relationships in children with NDDs may benefit from the use of different methodological approaches, including incorporation of multi-dimensional behavioral data (i.e. behavioral assessments, neurocognitive tasks, task-based fMRI) or clustering approaches to delineate whether subgroups of individuals with different brain-behavior profiles are present within heterogeneous cross-disorder samples.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.429125v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>A hallmark of intelligent behavior is that we can separate intention from action. To understand the mechanism that gates the flow of information between motor planning and execution, we compared the activity of frontal eye field neurons with motor unit activity from neck muscles in the presence of an intervening delay period in which spatial information regarding the target was available to plan a response. Whereas we could infer spatially-specific delayed period activity from the activity of frontal eye field neurons, neck motor unit activity during the delay period could not be used to infer the direction of an upcoming movement, Nonetheless, motor unit activity was correlated with the time it took to initiate saccades. Interestingly, we observed a heterogeneity of responses amongst motor units, such that only units with smaller amplitudes showed a clear modulation during the delay period. These small amplitude motor units also had higher spontaneous activity compared to the units which showed modulation only during the movement epoch. Taken together, our results suggest that the temporal information is visible in the periphery amongst smaller motor units during eye movement planning and explains how the delay period primes muscle activity leading to faster reaction times.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The beta component of gamma-band auditory steady-state responses in patients with schizophrenia</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.429120v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The mechanisms underlying circuit dysfunctions in schizophrenia (SCZ) remain poorly understood. Auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs), especially in the gamma and beta band, have been suggested as a potential biomarker for SCZ. While the reduction of 40Hz power for 40Hz drive has been well established and replicated in SCZ patients, studies are inconclusive when it comes to an increase in 20Hz power during 40Hz drive. There might be several factors explaining the inconsistencies, including differences in the sensitivity of the recording modality (EEG vs. MEG), differences in stimuli (click-trains vs. amplitude-modulated tones) and large differences in the amplitude of the stimuli. Here, we used a computational model of ASSR deficits in SCZ and explored the effect of three SCZ-associated microcircuit alterations: reduced GABA activity, increased GABA decay times and NMDA receptor hypofunction. We investigated the effect of input strength on gamma (40 Hz) and beta (20 Hz) band power during gamma ASSR stimulation and saw that the pronounced increase in beta power during gamma stimulation seen experimentally could only be reproduced in the model when GABA decay times were increased and only for a specific range of input strengths. More specifically, when the input was in this specific range, the rhythmic drive at 40Hz produced a strong 40Hz rhythm in the control network; however, in the `SCZ-like' network, the prolonged inhibition led to a so-called `beat-skipping', where the network would only strongly respond to every other input. This mechanism was responsible for the emergence of the pronounced 20Hz beta peak in the power spectrum. The other two microcircuit alterations were not able to produce a substantial 20 Hz component but they further arrowed the input strength range for which the network produced a beta component when combined with increased GABAergic decay times. Our finding that the beta component only existed for a specific range of input strengths might explain the seemingly inconsistent reporting in experimental studies and suggests that future ASSR studies should systematically explore different amplitudes of their stimuli. Furthermore, we provide a mechanistic link between a microcircuit alterations and an electrophysiological marker in schizophrenia and argue that more complex ASSR stimuli are needed to disentangle the nonlinear interactions of microcircuit alterations. The computational modelling approach put forward here is ideally suited to facilitate the development of such stimuli in a theory-based fashion.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.429096v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Microglia are active players in regulating synaptic development and plasticity in the brain. However, how these cells influence the normal functioning of synapses is largely unknown. In this study, we characterized the effects of pharmacological depletion of microglia, achieved by administration of PLX5622, on hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses of adult mice. Following microglial depletion, we observed a reduction of spontaneous and evoked glutamatergic activity associated with a decrease of dendritic spine density. We also observed the appearance of immature synaptic features accompanied by higher levels of plasticity. In addition, microglia depleted mice showed a deficit in the acquisition of the Novel Object Recognition task. Remarkably, microglial repopulation after PLX5622 withdrawal was associated with the recovery of hippocampal synapses and learning functions. Altogether, these data demonstrate that microglia contribute to normal synaptic functioning in the adult brain and that their removal induces reversible changes in synaptic organization and activity of glutamatergic synapses.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.429067v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Purpose: To explore the relationship between the cerebral cortical perivascular space (PVS) and aging in non-active MS subjects by using the multi-echo T2 relaxometry based cerebrospinal fluid fraction (CSFF) map. Methods: Multi-echo spiral T2 data from 111 subjects with non-active multiple sclerosis (MS) were retrospectively investigated by fitting the T2 data into a three-compartment model, the three water compartments including myelin water, intra-extracellular water, and cerebrospinal fluid. Segmentation of T1w image was performed to get the region of interest (ROI) in cerebral cortical regions. The white matter lesion segmentation was conducted using a convolutional neural network (CNN) based segmentation tool. The CSFF in the ROIs were correlated with age by controlling the gender, white matter hyperintensity lesion burden, and MS disease duration. Multiple linear models were created for the analysis of aging effect on the CSFF. Results: The ROI analysis shows that the CSFF in the cerebral cortical regions (temporal, occipital, parietal, front, hippo, and mtl) are significantly linear increasing with age (p&amp;lt;0.01). The intra-extracellular water fraction (IEWF) in the ROIs are significantly linear decreasing (p&amp;lt;0.01). Conclusion: The multi-echo T2 based three-compartment model can be used to quantify the CSFF. The linear increase of CSF water contents in the cerebral cortical regions indicates increased perivascular space load in cortex with aging. The quantification of CSFF may provide a way to understand the glymphatic clearance function in aging and neurodegenerations.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Quality control strategies for brain MRI segmentation and parcellation: practical approaches and recommendations - insights from The Maastricht Study</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.428681v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Quality control of brain segmentation is a fundamental step to ensure data quality. Manual quality control is the current gold standard, despite unfeasible in large neuroimaging samples. Several options for automated quality control have been proposed, providing potential time efficient and reproducible alternatives. However, those have never been compared side to side, which prevents to reach consensus in the appropriate QC strategy to use. This study aims to elucidate the changes manual editing of brain segmentations produce in morphological estimates, and to analyze and compare the effects of different quality control strategies in the reduction of the measurement error. Methods: We used structural MR images from 259 participants of The Maastricht Study. Morphological estimates were automatically extracted using FreeSurfer 6.0. A subsample of the brain segmentations with inaccuracies was manually edited, and morphological estimates were compared before and after editing. In parallel, 11 quality control strategies were applied to the full sample. Those included: a manual strategy, manual-QC, in which images were visually inspected and manually edited; five automated strategies where outliers were excluded based on the tools MRIQC and Qoala-T, and the metrics morphological global measures, Euler numbers and Contrast-to-Noise ratio; and five semi-automated strategies, were the outliers detected through the mentioned tools and metrics were not excluded, but visually inspected and manually edited. We used a regression of morphological brain measures against age as a test case to compare the changes in relative unexplained variance that each quality control strategy produces, using the reduction of relative unexplained variance as a measure of increase in quality. Results: Manually editing brain surfaces produced changes particularly high in subcortical brain volumes and moderate in cortical surface area, thickness and hippocampal volumes. The exclusion of outliers based on Euler numbers yielded a larger reduction of relative unexplained variance for measurements of cortical area, subcortical volumes and hippocampal subfields, while manual editing of brain segmentations performed best for cortical thickness. MRIQC produced a lower, but consistent for all types of measures, reduction in relative unexplained variance. Unexpectedly, the exclusion of outliers based on global morphological measures produced an increase of relative unexplained variance, potentially removing more morphological information than noise from the sample. Conclusion: Overall, the automatic exclusion of outliers based on Euler numbers or MRIQC are reliable and time efficient quality control strategies that can be applied in large neuroimaging cohorts.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The dorsal subiculum lies among a network of interconnected brain regions that collectively map multiple spatial and orientational relationships between an organism and the boundaries and pathways composing its environment. A unique role of the subiculum in spatial information processing has yet to be defined despite reports of small neuron subpopulations that encode relationships to specific boundaries, axes of travel, or locations. We examined the activity patterns among populations of subiculum neurons during performance of a spatial working memory task performed within a complex network of interconnected pathways. Compared to neurons in hippocampal sub-region CA1, a major source of its afferents, subiculum neurons were far more likely to exhibit multiple firing fields at locations that were analogous with respect to path structure and function. Subiculum neuron populations were also found to exhibit a greater dynamic range in scale of spatial representation and for persistent patterns of spiking activity to be aligned to transitions between maze segments. Together, the findings indicate that the subiculum plays a unique role in spatial mapping, one that complements the location-specific firing of CA1 neurons with the encoding of emergent and recurring structural features of a complex path network.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is used for modulating brain functions, but the optimal protocol remains unclear. We found that mouse learning to run on a rotarod was enhanced by anodal tDCS during (&quot;online&quot;) but not before or after (&quot;offline&quot;) the task performance. The enhancement was task-specific, since online tDCS during rotarod learning did not affect learning of beam walking, and vice versa. For mice underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), online anodal tDCS restored motor learning capability in a task-specific manner. Transcranial calcium imaging showed that anodal and cathodal tDCS elevated and suppressed cortical neuronal activity, respectively, suggesting that elevated spiking in task-activated neural circuits underlie the learning enhancement. Thus, the efficacy of tDCS could be elevated by conjunctive activation of targeted neural circuits.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26018?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
The objective of this study was to evaluate patients with ganglionic acetylcholine receptor antibody (gAChR‐Ab) positive autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy using a multimodal testing protocol to characterize their full clinical phenotype and explore biomarkers to quantify immunotherapy response.


Methods
We conducted a cohort study of 13 individuals (7 women, 21–69 years of age) with autonomic failure and gAChR‐Ab &amp;gt;100 pM identified between 2005 and 2019. From 2018, all patients were longitudinally assessed with cardiovascular, pupillary, urinary, sudomotor, lacrimal and salivary testing, and Composite Autonomic Symptom Score (COMPASS‐31) autonomic symptom questionnaires. The orthostatic intolerance ratio was calculated by dividing change in systolic blood pressure over time tolerated on head‐up tilt. Eleven patients received immunotherapy.


Results
At first assessment, all 13 patients had cardiovascular and pupillary impairments, 7 of 8 had postganglionic sudomotor dysfunction, 9 of 11 had urinary retention and xeropthalmia, and 6 of 8 had xerostomia. After immunotherapy, there were significant improvements in orthostatic intolerance ratio (33.3 [17.8–61.3] to 5.2 [1.4–8.2], p = 0.007), heart rate response to deep breathing (1.5 [0.0–3.3] to 4.5 [3.0–6.3], p = 0.02), pupillary constriction to light (12.0 [5.5–18.0] to 19.0 [10.6–23.8]%, p = 0.02), saliva production (0.01 [0.01–0.05] to 0.08 [0.02–0.20] g/min, p = 0.03), and COMPASS‐31 scores (52 to 17, p = 0.03). Orthostatic intolerance ratio correlated with autonomic symptoms at baseline (r = 0.841, p = 0.01) and following immunotherapy (r = 0.889, p = 0.02). Immunofluorescence analyses of skin samples from a patient 32 years after disease onset showed loss of nerve fibers supplying the dermal autonomic adnexa and epidermis, with clear improvements following immunotherapy.


Interpretation
Patients with autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy demonstrated objective evidence of widespread sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic failure, with significant improvements after immunotherapy. Quantitative autonomic biomarkers should be used to define initial deficits, guide therapeutic decisions, and document treatment response. ANN NEUROL 2021</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Reconciling the object and spatial processing views of the perirhinal cortex through task‐relevant unitization</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23304?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
The perirhinal cortex is situated on the border between sensory association cortex and the hippocampal formation. It serves an important function as a transition area between the sensory neocortex and the medial temporal lobe. While the perirhinal cortex has traditionally been associated with object coding and the “what” pathway of the temporal lobe, current evidence suggests a broader function of the perirhinal cortex in solving feature ambiguity and processing complex stimuli. Besides fulfilling functions in object coding, recent neurophysiological findings in freely moving rodents indicate that the perirhinal cortex also contributes to spatial and contextual processing beyond individual sensory modalities. Here, we address how these two opposing views on perirhinal cortex—the object‐centered and spatial‐contextual processing hypotheses—may be reconciled. The perirhinal cortex is consistently recruited when different features can be merged perceptually or conceptually into a single entity. Features that are unitized in these entities include object information from multiple sensory domains, reward associations, semantic features and spatial/contextual associations. We propose that the same perirhinal network circuits can be flexibly deployed for multiple cognitive functions, such that the perirhinal cortex performs similar unitization operations on different types of information, depending on behavioral demands and ranging from the object‐related domain to spatial, contextual and semantic information.</content:encoded>

Newly-translated glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) often undergo cycles of chaperone binding and release in order to assist in folding. Quality control is required to distinguish between proteins that have completed native folding, those that have yet to fold, and those that have misfolded. Using quantitative modeling, we explore how the design of the quality-control pathway modulates its efficiency. Our results show that an energy-consuming cyclic quality-control process, similar to the observed physiological system, outperforms alternative designs. The kinetic parameters that optimize the performance of this system drastically change with protein production levels, while remaining relatively insensitive to the protein folding rate. Adjusting only the degradation rate, while fixing other parameters, allows the pathway to adapt across a range of protein production levels, aligning with &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; measurements that implicate the release of degradation-associated enzymes as a rapid-response system for perturbations in protein homeostasis. The quantitative models developed here elucidate design principles for effective glycoprotein quality control in the ER, improving our mechanistic understanding of a system crucial to maintaining cellular health.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hXRSeWZJ-NQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Rustom Antia, Hasan Ahmed, James J. Bull&lt;/p&gt;

Many viral infections can be prevented by immunizing with live, attenuated vaccines. Early methods of attenuation were hit-and-miss, now much improved by genetic engineering. However, even current methods operate on the principle of genetic harm, reducing the virus’s ability to grow. Reduced viral growth has the undesired side-effect of reducing the host immune response below that of infection with wild-type. Might some methods of attenuation instead lead to an increased immune response? We use mathematical models of the dynamics of virus with innate and adaptive immunity to explore the tradeoff between attenuation of virus pathology and immunity. We find that modification of some virus immune-evasion pathways can indeed reduce pathology yet enhance immunity. Thus, attenuated vaccines can, in principle, be directed to be safe yet create better immunity than is elicited by the wild-type virus.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5bnJLe9pnVE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

While large datasets of HIV-1 sequences are increasingly being generated, many studies rely on a single gene or fragment of the genome and few comparative studies across genes have been done. We performed genome-based and gene-specific Bayesian phylogenetic analyses to investigate how certain factors impact estimates of the infection dates in an acute HIV-1 infection cohort, RV217. In this cohort, HIV-1 diagnosis corresponded to the first RNA positive test and occurred a median of four days after the last negative test, allowing us to compare timing estimates using BEAST to a narrow window of infection. We analyzed HIV-1 sequences sampled one week, one month and six months after HIV-1 diagnosis in 39 individuals. We found that shared diversity and temporal signal was limited in acute infection, and insufficient to allow timing inferences in the shortest HIV-1 genes, thus dated phylogenies were primarily analyzed for &lt;i&gt;env&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;gag&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;pol&lt;/i&gt; and near full-length genomes. There was no one best fitting model across participants and genes, though relaxed molecular clocks (73% of best fitting models) and the Bayesian skyline (49%) tended to be favored. For infections with single founders, the infection date was estimated to be around one week pre-diagnosis for &lt;i&gt;env&lt;/i&gt; (IQR: 3–9 days) and &lt;i&gt;gag&lt;/i&gt; (IQR: 5–9 days), whilst the genome placed it at a median of 10 days (IQR: 4–19). Multiply-founded infections proved problematic to date. Our ability to compare timing inferences to precise estimates of HIV-1 infection (within a week) highlights that molecular dating methods can be applied to within-host datasets from early infection. Nonetheless, our results also suggest caution when using uniform clock and population models or short genes with limited information content.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/iXOEKAnlRoA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

RNA is considered as an attractive target for new small molecule drugs. Designing active compounds can be facilitated by computational modeling. Most of the available tools developed for these prediction purposes, such as molecular docking or scoring functions, are parametrized for protein targets. The performance of these methods, when applied to RNA-ligand systems, is insufficient. To overcome these problems, we developed AnnapuRNA, a new knowledge-based scoring function designed to evaluate RNA-ligand complex structures, generated by any computational docking method. We also evaluated three main factors that may influence the structure prediction, i.e., starting conformer of a ligand, the docking program, and the scoring function used. We applied the AnnapuRNA method for a &lt;i&gt;post-hoc&lt;/i&gt; study of the recently published structures of the FMN riboswitch.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the three primary experimental means of characterizing macromolecular structures, including protein structures. Structure determination by solution NMR spectroscopy has traditionally relied heavily on distance restraints derived from nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) measurements. While structure determination of proteins from NOE-based restraints is well understood and broadly used, structure determination from Residual Dipolar Couplings (RDCs) is relatively less well developed. Here, we describe the new features of the protein structure modeling program REDCRAFT and focus on the new Adaptive Decimation (AD) feature. The AD plays a critical role in improving the robustness of REDCRAFT to missing or noisy data, while allowing structure determination of larger proteins from less data. In this report we demonstrate the successful application of REDCRAFT in structure determination of proteins ranging in size from 50 to 145 residues using experimentally collected data, and of larger proteins (145 to 573 residues) using simulated RDC data. In both cases, REDCRAFT uses only RDC data that can be collected from perdeuterated proteins. Finally, we compare the accuracy of structure determination from RDCs alone with traditional NOE-based methods for the structurally novel PF.2048.1 protein. The RDC-based structure of PF.2048.1 exhibited 1.0 Å BB-RMSD with respect to a high-quality NOE-based structure. Although optimal strategies would include using RDC data together with chemical shift, NOE, and other NMR data, these studies provide proof-of-principle for robust structure determination of largely-perdeuterated proteins from RDC data alone using REDCRAFT.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/E5RdJCBzSo8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The capacity for T cells to become activated and clonally expand during pathogen invasion is pivotal for protective immunity. Our understanding of how T cell receptor (TCR) signaling prepares cells for this rapid expansion remains limited. Here we provide evidence that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cullin-4b (Cul4b) regulates this process. The abundance of total and neddylated Cul4b increased following TCR stimulation. Disruption of Cul4b resulted in impaired proliferation and survival of activated T cells. Additionally, Cul4b-deficient CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells accumulated DNA damage. In T cells, Cul4b preferentially associated with the substrate receptor DCAF1, and Cul4b and DCAF1 were found to interact with proteins that promote the sensing or repair of damaged DNA. While Cul4b-deficient CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells showed evidence of DNA damage sensing, downstream phosphorylation of SMC1A did not occur. These findings reveal an essential role for Cul4b in promoting the repair of damaged DNA to allow survival and expansion of activated T cells.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/zlBCtKQDXOQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Astrocytes contribute to the neuronal recovery promoted by high‐frequency repetitive magnetic stimulation in in vitro models of ischemia</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24792?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Our results show that high‐frequency repetitive magnetic stimulation (HF‐rMS) is a potential therapeutic approach to prevent the ischemic‐induced neuron loss, neurite degeneration and synaptic loss. Moreover, we show that the observed neuroprotective effects of HF‐rMS were dependent on astrocytes.

Abstract
After decades of effort, there are no effective clinical treatments to induce the recovery of ischemia‐injured tissues, and among the several strategies that have been explored, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has proven to be one of the most promising, with beneficial effects in limb motor function, aphasia, hemispatial neglect, or dysphagia. Despite the clinical evidences, little is known about the mechanisms underlying those effects. The present study aimed to explore the cellular and molecular effects of high‐frequency repetitive magnetic stimulation (HF‐rMS) on an in vitro model of ischemia. Using primary cortical cultures exposed to oxygen and glucose deprivation followed by reperfusion, we observed that HF‐rMS treatment prevents the ischemia‐induced neuronal death by 21.2%, and the neurite degeneration triggered by ischemia. Our results also demonstrate that with this treatment there is an increase of 89.2% on the number cells expressing ERK1/2, of 20.1% on the number of cells expressing c‐Fos, and a synaptogenic effect, through an increase of 62.9% in the number of synaptic puncta as well as of 49.4% in their intensity. Interestingly, our results indicate that astrocytes are crucial to the beneficial effects triggered by HF‐rMS after ischemia, thus suggesting a direct effect of HF‐rMS on these cells. The modulation of astrocytes with this non‐invasive brain stimulation technique is a promising approach to promote the recovery of ischemia‐induced injured tissues; however, it is essential to understand how these effects can be modulated in order to optimize the protocols and enhance the beneficial outcomes.</content:encoded>

Here, we evaluate the trajectory various cognitive skill development as a function of CAG repeat length in children and adolescents that carry the mutation that causes HD.

These findings increase our understanding of the relationship between neurodegeneration and neurodevelopment and may have far‐reaching implications for future gene‐therapy treatment strategies.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Advances in artificial intelligence are driven by technologies inspired by
the brain, but these technologies are orders of magnitude less powerful and
energy efficient than biological systems. Inspired by the nonlinear dynamics of
neural networks, new unconventional computing hardware has emerged with the
potential for extreme parallelism and ultra-low power consumption. Physical
reservoir computing demonstrates this with a variety of unconventional systems
from optical-based to spintronic. Reservoir computers provide a nonlinear
projection of the task input into a high-dimensional feature space by
exploiting the system's internal dynamics. A trained readout layer then
combines features to perform tasks, such as pattern recognition and time-series
analysis. Despite progress, achieving state-of-the-art performance without
external signal processing to the reservoir remains challenging. Here we show,
through simulation, that magnetic materials in thin-film geometries can realise
reservoir computers with greater than or similar accuracy to digital recurrent
neural networks. Our results reveal that basic spin properties of magnetic
films generate the required nonlinear dynamics and memory to solve machine
learning tasks. Furthermore, we show that neuromorphic hardware can be reduced
in size by removing the need for discrete neural components and external
processing. The natural dynamics and nanoscale size of magnetic thin-films
present a new path towards fast energy-efficient computing with the potential
to innovate portable smart devices, self driving vehicles, and robotics.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.12559</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Meditation practices have been claimed to have a positive effect on the
regulation of mood and emotion for quite some time by practitioners, and in
recent times there has been a sustained effort to provide a more precise
description of the changes induced by meditation on human brain. Longitudinal
studies have reported morphological changes in cortical thickness and volume in
selected brain regions due to meditation practice, which is interpreted as
evidence for effectiveness of it beyond the subjective self reporting. Evidence
based on real time monitoring of meditating brain by functional imaging
modalities such as MEG or EEG remains a challenge. In this article we consider
MEG data collected during meditation sessions of experienced Buddhist monks
practicing focused attention (Samatha) and open monitoring (Vipassana)
meditation, contrasted by resting state with eyes closed. The MEG data is first
mapped to time series of brain activity averaged over brain regions
corresponding to a standard Destrieux brain atlas, and further by bootstrapping
and spectral analysis to data matrices representing a random sample of power
spectral densities over bandwidths corresponding to $\alpha$, $\beta$,
$\gamma$, and $\theta$ bands in the spectral range. We demonstrate using linear
discriminant analysis (LDA) that the samples corresponding to different
meditative or resting states contain enough fingerprints of the brain state to
allow a separation between different states, and we identify the brain regions
that appear to contribute to the separation. Our findings suggest that
cingulate cortex, insular cortex and some of the internal structures, most
notably accumbens, caudate and putamen nuclei, thalamus and amygdalae stand out
as separating regions, which seems to correlate well with earlier findings
based on longitudinal studies.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;It has come to our notice that there was an inadvertent misupload of Fig. 2 (c, d) in the loading control (GAPDH) for ASIC1a and NLRP1 blots. We would like to replace the same with the correct image. This change anyhow does not affect the conclusion of the study. However, the use of GAPDH as a loading control for stroke studies sometimes is debatable (Zhai et al. 2014; Kang et al. 2018). Hence, we repeated our experiments to check the expression of ASIC1a and NLRP1 at different time points following stroke, using beta actin as a loading control. We found that at 24 h post stroke, maximal and significant expression of both ASIC1a and NLRP1 was observed (Fig. 2 e, f). The expression at 48 and 72 h post stroke were not significantly different as compared to that of sham. The expression results obtained using beta actin as a loading control were concurrent with the previous results published with GAPDH as a loading control.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Parsing Neurodynamic Information Streams to Estimate the Frequency, Magnitude and Duration of Team Uncertainty</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.606823</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurodynamic organizations are information-based abstractions, expressed in bits, of the structure of long duration EEG amplitude levels. Neurodynamic information (NI, the variable of neurodynamic organization) is thought to continually accumulate as EEG amplitudes cycle through periods of persistent activation and deactivation in response to the activities and uncertainties of teamwork. Here we show that (1) Neurodynamic information levels were a better predictor of uncertainty and novice and expert behaviors than were the EEG power levels from which NI was derived. (2) Spatial and temporal parsing of team NI from experienced submarine navigation and healthcare teams showed that it was composed of discrete peaks with durations up to 20–60 s, and identified the involvement of activated delta waves when precise motor control was needed. (3) The relationship between NI and EEG power was complex varying by brain regions, EEG frequencies, and global vs. local brain interactions. The presence of an organizational system of information that parallels the amplitude of EEG rhythms is important as it provides a greatly reduced data dimension while retaining the essential system features, i.e., linkages to higher scale behaviors that span temporal and spatial scales of teamwork. In this way the combinatorial explosion of EEG rhythmic variables at micro levels become compressed into an intermediate system of information and organization which links to macro-scale team and team member behaviors. These studies provide an avenue for understanding how complex organizations arise from the dynamics of underlying micro-scale variables. The study also has practical implications for how micro-scale variables might be better represented, both conceptually and in terms of parsimony, for training machines to recognize human behaviors that span scales of teams.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Single-Cell Transcriptomic Reveals Dual and Multi-Transmitter Use in Neurons Across Metazoans</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.623148</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurotransmitter expression is widely used as a criterion for classifying neurons. It was initially thought that neurons express a single type of neurotransmitter, a phenomenon commonly recognized as Dale's principle: “one neuron, one transmitter.” Consequently, the expression of a single neurotransmitter should determine stable and distinguishable neuronal characteristics. However, this notion has been largely challenged and increasing evidence accumulates supporting a different scenario: “one neuron, multiple neurotransmitters.” Single-cell transcriptomics provides an additional path to address coexpression of neurotransmitters, by investigating the expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis and transmission of fast-acting neuromodulators. Here, we study neuronal phenotypes based on the expression of neurotransmitters, at single-cell resolution, across different animal species representing distinct clades of the tree of life. We take advantage of several existing scRNAseq datasets and analyze them in light of neurotransmitter plasticity. Our results show that while most neurons appear to predominantly express a single type of neurotransmitter, a substantial number of neurons simultaneously expresses a combination of them, across all animal species analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: PGC-1α Signaling Increases GABA(A) Receptor Subunit α2 Expression, GABAergic Neurotransmission and Anxiety-Like Behavior in Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.588230</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) is a master regulator of mitochondria biogenesis and cell stress playing a role in metabolic and degenerative diseases. In the brain PGC-1α expression has been localized mainly to GABAergic interneurons but its overall role is not fully understood. We observed here that the protein levels of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptor-α2 subunit (GABARα2) were increased in hippocampus and brain cortex in transgenic (Tg) mice overexpressing PGC-1α in neurons. Along with this, GABARα2 expression was enhanced in the hippocampus of the PGC-1α Tg mice, as shown by quantitative PCR. Double immunostaining revealed that GABARα2 co-localized with the synaptic protein gephyrin in higher amounts in the striatum radiatum layer of the hippocampal CA1 region in the Tg compared with Wt mice. Electrophysiology revealed that the frequency of spontaneous and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) was increased in the CA1 region in the Tg mice, indicative of an augmented GABAergic transmission. Behavioral tests revealed an increase for anxiety-like behavior in the PGC-1α Tg mice compared with controls. To study whether drugs acting on PPARγ can affect GABARα2, we employed pioglitazone that elevated GABARα2 expression in primary cultured neurons. Similar results were obtained using the specific PPARγ agonist, N-(2-benzoylphenyl)-O-[2-(methyl-2-pyridinylamino) ethyl]-L-tyrosine hydrate (GW1929). These results demonstrate that PGC-1α regulates GABARα2 subunits and GABAergic neurotransmission in the hippocampus with behavioral consequences. This indicates further that drugs like pioglitazone, widely used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, can influence GABARα2 expression via the PPARγ/PGC-1α system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ionotropic receptors (IRs) are a highly divergent subfamily of ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluR) and are conserved across Protostomia, a major branch of the animal kingdom that encompasses both Ecdysozoa and Lophothrochozoa. They are broadly expressed in peripheral sensory systems, concentrated in sensory dendrites, and function in chemosensation, thermosensation, and hygrosensation. As iGluRs, four IR subunits form a functional ion channel to detect environmental stimuli. Most IR receptors comprise individual stimulus-specific tuning receptors and one or two broadly expressed coreceptors. This review summarizes the discoveries of the structure of IR complexes and the expression and function of each IR, as well as discusses the future direction for IR studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Identification of MicroRNA–Potassium Channel Messenger RNA Interactions in the Brain of Rats With Post-traumatic Epilepsy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.610090</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Dysregulated expression of microRNAs and potassium channels have been reported for their contributions to seizure onset. However, the microRNA–potassium channel gene interactions in traumatic brain injury-induced post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE) remain unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: PTE was induced in male rats by intracranial injection with ferrous chloride (0.1 mol/L, 1 μl/min) at the right frontal cortex. Electroencephalography was recorded at 60 min, as well as day 1, 7, and 30, and the behavioral seizures were assessed before injection and at different time points after injection. Rats were killed on day 30 after injection. The right frontal cortex samples were collected and subjected to high throughput messenger RNA (mRNA) and microRNA sequencing. A network of differentially expressed potassium channel mRNAs and microRNAs was constructed using OryCun2.0 and subjected to Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses. The differential mRNA and microRNA expressions were verified using quantitative real-time-PCR. The microRNA–mRNA was subject to the Pearson correlation analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A PTE rat model was successfully established, as evidenced by behavioral seizures and epileptiform discharges on electroencephalography in PTE rats compared with sham rats. Among the 91 mRNAs and 40 microRNAs that were significantly differentially expressed in the PTE rat brain, 4 mRNAs and 10 microRNAs were associated with potassium channels. Except for potassium calcium-activated channel subfamily N member 2, the other three potassium channel mRNAs were negatively correlated with seven microRNAs. These microRNA–mRNA pairs were enriched in annotations and pathways related to neuronal ion channels and neuroinflammation. Quantitative real-time-PCR and correlation analysis verified negative correlations in miR-449a-5p-KCNH2, miR-98-5p-KCNH2, miR-98-5p-KCNK15, miR-19b-3p-KCNK15, and miR-301a-3p-KCNK15 pairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: We identified microRNA–potassium channel mRNA interactions associated with PTE, providing potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for PTE.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Axons in the central nervous system often fail to regenerate after injury due to the limited intrinsic regeneration ability of the central nervous system (CNS) and complex extracellular inhibitory factors. Therefore, it is of vital importance to have a better understanding of potential methods to promote the regeneration capability of injured nerves. Evidence has shown that non-coding RNAs play an essential role in nerve regeneration, especially long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), microRNA (miRNA), and circular RNA (circRNA). In this review, we profile their separate roles in axon regeneration after CNS injuries, such as spinal cord injury (SCI) and optic nerve injury. In addition, we also reveal the interactive networks among non-coding RNAs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Searchlight Classification Informative Region Mixture Model (SCIM): Identification of Cortical Regions Showing Discriminable BOLD Patterns in Event-Related Auditory fMRI Data</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.616906</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The investigation of abstract cognitive tasks, e.g., semantic processing of speech, requires the simultaneous use of a carefully selected stimulus design and sensitive tools for the analysis of corresponding neural activity that are comparable across different studies investigating similar research questions. Multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) methods are commonly used in neuroimaging to investigate BOLD responses corresponding to neural activation associated with specific cognitive tasks. Regions of significant activation are identified by a thresholding operation during multivariate pattern analysis, the results of which are susceptible to the applied threshold value. Investigation of analysis approaches that are robust to a large extent with respect to thresholding, is thus an important goal pursued here. The present paper contributes a novel statistical analysis method for fMRI experiments, searchlight classification informative region mixture model (SCIM), that is based on the assumption that the whole brain volume can be subdivided into two groups of voxels: spatial voxel positions around which recorded BOLD activity does convey information about the present stimulus condition and those that do not. A generative statistical model is proposed that assigns a probability of being informative to each position in the brain, based on a combination of a support vector machine searchlight analysis and Gaussian mixture models. Results from an auditory fMRI study investigating cortical regions that are engaged in the semantic processing of speech indicate that the SCIM method identifies physiologically plausible brain regions as informative, similar to those from two standard methods as reference that we compare to, with two important differences. SCIM-identified regions are very robust to the choice of the threshold for significance, i.e., less “noisy,” in contrast to, e.g., the binomial test whose results in the present experiment are highly dependent on the chosen significance threshold or random permutation tests that are additionally bound to very high computational costs. In group analyses, the SCIM method identifies a physiologically plausible pre-frontal region, anterior cingulate sulcus, to be involved in semantic processing that other methods succeed to identify only in single subject analyses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

More recently, a limited number of studies have examined CES for altering affect, physiology, and behavior in healthy, non-clinical samples. The physiological, neurochemical, and metabolic mechanisms underlying CES effects are currently unknown. Computational modeling suggests that electrical current administered with CES at the earlobes can reach cortical and subcortical regions at very low intensities associated with subthreshold neuromodulatory effects, and studies using electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) show some effects on alpha band EEG activity, and modulation of the default mode network during CES administration. One theory suggests that CES modulates brain stem (e.g., medulla), limbic (e.g., thalamus, amygdala), and cortical (e.g., prefrontal cortex) regions and increases relative parasympathetic to sympathetic drive in the autonomic nervous system. There is no direct evidence supporting this theory, but one of its assumptions is that CES may induce its effects by stimulating afferent projections of the vagus nerve, which provides parasympathetic signals to the cardiorespiratory and digestive systems. In our critical review of studies using CES in clinical and non-clinical populations, we found severe methodological concerns, including potential conflicts of interest, risk of methodological and analytic biases, issues with sham credibility, lack of blinding, and a severe heterogeneity of CES parameters selected and employed across scientists, laboratories, institutions, and studies. These limitations make it difficult to derive consistent or compelling insights from the extant literature, tempering enthusiasm for CES and its potential to alter nervous system activity or behavior in meaningful or reliable ways. The lack of compelling evidence also motivates well-designed and relatively high-powered experiments to assess how CES might modulate the physiological, affective, and cognitive responses to stress. Establishing reliable empirical links between CES administration and human performance is critical for supporting its prospective use during occupational training, operations, or recovery, ensuring reliability and robustness of effects, characterizing if, when, and in whom such effects might arise, and ensuring that any benefits of CES outweigh the risks of adverse events.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Do Auditory Mismatch Responses Differ Between Acoustic Features?</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.613903</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mismatch negativity (MMN) is the electroencephalographic (EEG) waveform obtained by subtracting event-related potential (ERP) responses evoked by unexpected deviant stimuli from responses evoked by expected standard stimuli. While the MMN is thought to reflect an unexpected change in an ongoing, predictable stimulus, it is unknown whether MMN responses evoked by changes in different stimulus features have different magnitudes, latencies, and topographies. The present study aimed to investigate whether MMN responses differ depending on whether sudden stimulus change occur in pitch, duration, location or vowel identity, respectively. To calculate ERPs to standard and deviant stimuli, EEG signals were recorded in normal-hearing participants (N = 20; 13 males, 7 females) who listened to roving oddball sequences of artificial syllables. In the roving paradigm, any given stimulus is repeated several times to form a standard, and then suddenly replaced with a deviant stimulus which differs from the standard. Here, deviants differed from preceding standards along one of four features (pitch, duration, vowel or interaural level difference). The feature levels were individually chosen to match behavioral discrimination performance. We identified neural activity evoked by unexpected violations along all four acoustic dimensions. Evoked responses to deviant stimuli increased in amplitude relative to the responses to standard stimuli. A univariate (channel-by-channel) analysis yielded no significant differences between MMN responses following violations of different features. However, in a multivariate analysis (pooling information from multiple EEG channels), acoustic features could be decoded from the topography of mismatch responses, although at later latencies than those typical for MMN. These results support the notion that deviant feature detection may be subserved by a different process than general mismatch detection.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Stroke Lesion Impact on Lower Limb Function</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.592975</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The impact of stroke on motor functioning is analyzed at different levels. ‘Impairment’ denotes the loss of basic characteristics of voluntary movement. ‘Activity limitation’ denotes the loss of normal capacity for independent execution of daily activities. Recovery from impairment is accomplished by ‘restitution’ and recovery from activity limitation is accomplished by the combined effect of ‘restitution’ and ‘compensation.’ We aimed to unravel the long-term effects of variation in lesion topography on motor impairment of the hemiparetic lower limb (HLL), and gait capacity as a measure of related activity limitation. Gait was assessed by the 3 m walk test (3MWT) in 67 first-event chronic stroke patients, at their homes. Enduring impairment of the HLL was assessed by the Fugl–Meyer Lower Extremity (FMA-LE) test. The impact of variation in lesion topography on HLL impairment and on walking was analyzed separately for left and right hemispheric damage (LHD, RHD) by voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM). In the LHD group, HLL impairment tended to be affected by damage to the posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC). Walking capacity tended to be affected by a larger array of structures: PLIC and corona radiata, external capsule and caudate nucleus. In the RHD group, both HLL impairment and walking capacity were sensitive to damage in a much larger number of brain voxels. HLL impairment was affected by damage to the corona radiata, superior longitudinal fasciculus and insula. Walking was affected by damage to the same areas, plus the internal and external capsules, putamen, thalamus and parts of the perisylvian cortex. In both groups, voxel clusters have been found where damage affected FMA-LE and also 3MWT, along with voxels where damage affected only one of the measures (mainly 3MWT). In stroke, enduring ‘activity limitation’ is affected by damage to a much larger array of brain structures and voxels within specific structures, compared to enduring ‘impairment.’ Differences between the effects of left and right hemisphere damage are likely to reflect variation in motor-network organization and post-stroke re-organization related to hemispheric dominance. Further studies with larger sample size are required for the validation of these results.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Error-Related Activity in Striatal Local Field Potentials and Medial Frontal Cortex: Evidence From Patients With Severe Opioid Abuse Disorder</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.627564</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For successful goal-directed behavior, a performance monitoring system is essential. It detects behavioral errors and initiates behavioral adaptations to improve performance. Two electrophysiological potentials are known to follow errors in reaction time tasks: the error-related negativity (ERN), which is linked to error processing, and the error positivity (Pe), which is associated with subjective error awareness. Furthermore, the correct-related negativity (CRN) is linked to uncertainty about the response outcome. Here we attempted to identify the involvement of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in the aforementioned performance monitoring processes. To this end, we simultaneously recorded cortical activity (EEG) and local field potentials (LFP) during a flanker task performed by four patients with severe opioid abuse disorder who underwent electrode implantation in the NAc for deep brain stimulation. We observed significant accuracy-related modulations in the LFPs at the time of the ERN/CRN in two patients and at the time of Pe in three patients. These modulations correlated with the ERN in 2/8, with CRN in 5/8 and with Pe in 6/8, recorded channels, respectively. Our results demonstrate the functional interrelation of striatal and cortical processes in performance monitoring specifically related to error processing and subjective error awareness.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Identification of Exploration and Exploitation Balance in the Silkmoth Olfactory Search Behavior by Information-Theoretic Modeling</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.629380</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Insects search for and find odor sources as their basic behaviors, such as when looking for food or a mate. This has motivated research to describe how they achieve such behavior under turbulent odor plumes with a small number of neurons. Among different insects, the silk moth has been studied owing to its clear motor response to olfactory input. In past studies, the “programmed behavior” of the silk moth has been modeled as the average duration of a sequence of maneuvers based on the duration of periods without odor hits. However, this model does not fully represent the fine variations in their behavior. In this study, we used silk moth olfactory search trajectories from an experimental virtual reality device. We achieved an accurate input by using optogenetic silk moths that react to blue light. We then modeled such trajectories as a probabilistic learning agent with a belief of possible source locations. We found that maneuvers mismatching the programmed behavior are related to larger entropy decrease, that is, they are more likely to increase the certainty of the belief. This implies that silkmoths include some stochasticity in their search policy to balance the exploration and exploitation of olfactory information by matching or mismatching the programmed behavior model. We believe that this information-theoretic representation of insect behavior is important for the future implementation of olfactory searches in artificial agents such as robots.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Microstructural and Cerebral Blood Flow Abnormalities in Subjective Cognitive Decline Plus: Diffusional Kurtosis Imaging and Three-Dimensional Arterial Spin Labeling Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.625843</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: To explore microstructural and cerebral blood flow (CBF) abnormalities in individuals with subjective cognitive decline plus (SCD plus) using diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) and three-dimensional (3D) arterial spin labeling (ASL).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Twenty-seven patients with SCD plus, 31 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and 33 elderly controls (ECs) were recruited and underwent DKI and 3D ASL using a GE 3.0-T MRI. Mean kurtosis (MK), fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and CBF values were acquired from 24 regions of interest (ROIs) in the brain, including the bilateral hippocampal (Hip) subregions (head, body, and tail), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), precuneus, dorsal thalamus subregions (anterior nucleus, ventrolateral nucleus, and medial nucleus), lenticular nucleus, caput nuclei caudati, white matter (WM) of the frontal lobe, and WM of the occipital lobe. Pearson's correlation analysis was performed to assess the relationships among the DKI-derived parameters, CBF values, and key neuropsychological tests for SCD plus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Compared with ECs, participants with SCD plus showed a significant decline in MK and CBF values, mainly in the Hip head and PCC, and participants with aMCI exhibited more significant abnormalities in the MK and CBF values than individuals with ECs and SCD plus in multiple regions. Combined MK values showed better discrimination between patients with SCD plus and ECs than that obtained using CBF levels, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.874 and 0.837, respectively. Similarly, the AUC in discriminating SCD plus from aMCI patients obtained using combined MK values was 0.823, which was also higher than the combined AUC of 0.779 obtained using CBF values. Moreover, MK levels in the left Hip (h) and left PCC positively correlated with the auditory verbal learning test-delayed recall (AVLT-DR) score in participants with SCD plus. By contrast, only the CBF value in the left Hip head positively correlated with the AVLT-DR score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Our results provide new evidence of microstructural and CBF changes in patients with SCD plus. MK may be used as an early potential neuroimaging biomarker and may be a more sensitive DKI parameter than CBF at the very early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.619945</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: This study aimed to identify potential diagnostic biomarkers of diabetic vascular dementia (DVD) and unravel the underlying mechanisms using mass spectrometry (MS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Label-free liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) proteomic analysis was applied to urine samples from four groups, including 14 patients with vascular dementia (VD), 22 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), 12 patients with DVD, and 21 normal controls (NCs). Searching the MS data by Proteome Discoverer software (ThermoFisher Scientific; Waltham, MA, USA), protein abundances were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively and compared between these groups. Combining bioinformatics analysis using Gene Ontology (GO), pathway crosstalk analysis using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), protein–protein interaction (PPI) network analysis using STRING, and literature searching, the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) of DVD can be comprehensively judged and were further quantified by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The proteomic findings showed quantitative changes in patients with DVD compared to patients with NC, T2DM, and VD groups; among 4,744 identified urine proteins, 1,222, 1,152, and 1,180 proteins displayed quantitative changes unique to DVD vs. NC, T2DM, and VD, respectively, including 481 overlapped common DEPs. Then, nine unique proteins [including HP, SERPIND, ATP5PB, VNN2, ALDH3A1, U2AF2, C6, A0A5C2GRG5 (no name), and A0A5C2FZ29 (no name)] and two composite markers (CM) (A0A5C2GRG5+U2AF2 and U2AF2+C6) were confirmed by a ROC curve method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: This study provided an insight into the potential pathogenesis of DVD and elucidated a method for early detection.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.595288</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Age-related changes in cortico-cortical connectivity in the human motor network in older adults are associated with declines in hand dexterity. Posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is strongly interconnected with motor areas and plays a critical role in many aspects of motor planning. Functional connectivity measures derived from dual-site transcranial magnetic stimulation (dsTMS) studies have found facilitatory inputs from PPC to ipsilateral primary motor cortex (M1) in younger adults. In this study, we investigated whether facilitatory inputs from PPC to M1 are altered by age. We used dsTMS in a conditioning-test paradigm to characterize patterns of functional connectivity between the left PPC and ipsilateral M1 and a standard pegboard test to assess skilled hand motor function in 13 young and 13 older adults. We found a PPC-M1 facilitation in young adults but not older adults. Older adults also showed a decline in motor performance compared to young adults. We conclude that the reduced PPC-M1 facilitation in older adults may be an early marker of age-related decline in the neural control of movement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Systemic Inflammation Increases the Susceptibility to Levodopa-Induced Dyskinesia in 6-OHDA Lesioned Rats by Targeting the NR2B-Medicated PKC/MEK/ERK Pathway</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.625166</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: The long-term administration of levodopa (L-dopa), the gold-standard treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD), is irreparably associated with L-dopa-induced dyskinesia (LID), which dramatically affects the quality of life of patients. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of how LID exacerbates remain unknown. Neuroinflammation in the striatum plays an active role in LID. These findings prompt an investigation of non-neuronal mechanisms of LID. This study will examine the effects of systemic inflammation in the development and progression of LID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: To evaluate the possible influence of systemic inflammation in the appearance of LID, the PD rats received an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of various concentrations of lipopolysaccharides (LPS, 1, 2, and 5 mg/kg) or saline. One day later, these PD rats started to receive daily treatment with L-dopa (6 mg/kg) along with benserazide (6 mg/kg) or saline for 21 days, and dyskinesia was evaluated at several time points. Moreover, the activation of microglia and astrocytes and the molecular changes in NR2B and mGLUR5 signaling pathways were measured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We found that systemic inflammatory stimulation with LPS exacerbated the intensity of abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) induced by L-dopa treatment in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesioned rats. The LPS injection activated the gliocytes and increased the levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the striatum in LID rats. The PD rats that received the LPS injection showed the overexpression of p-NR2B and NR2B, as well as activated PKC/MEK/ERK and NF-κB signal pathways in response to the L-dopa administration. On the contrary, clodronate-encapsulated liposomes (Clo-lipo), which could suppress the inflammatory response induced by peripheral LPS injection, improved behavioral dysfunction, inhibited neuroinflammation, prevented NR2B overexpression, and decreased the phosphorylation of PKC/MEK/ERK and NF-κB signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: This study suggests that systemic inflammation, by exacerbating preexisting neuroinflammation and facilitating NR2B subunit activity, may play a crucial role in the development of LID. The administration of Clo-lipo restores the effects of LPS and decreases the susceptibility to LID in 6-OHDA lesioned rats.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65369</link>
	<content:encoded>Sequencing of cancer genomes has identified recurrent somatic mutations in histones, termed oncohistones, which are frequently poorly understood. Previously we showed that fission yeast expressing only the H3.3G34R mutant identified in aggressive pediatric glioma had reduced H3K36 trimethylation and acetylation, increased genomic instability and replicative stress, and defective homology-dependent DNA damage repair (Yadav et al., 2017). Here we show that surprisingly distinct phenotypes result from G34V (also in glioma) and G34W (giant cell tumors of bone) mutations, differentially affecting H3K36 modifications, subtelomeric silencing, genomic stability, sensitivity to irradiation, alkylating agents, hydroxyurea and influencing DNA repair. In cancer, only one of thirty alleles encoding H3 is mutated. Whilst co-expression of wild-type H3 rescues most G34 mutant phenotypes, G34R causes dominant hydroxyurea sensitivity and homologous recombination defects, and dominant subtelomeric silencing. Together, these studies demonstrate the complexity associated with different substitutions at even a single residue in H3 and highlight the utility of genetically tractable systems for their analysis.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65026</link>
	<content:encoded>Across species, lifespan is highly variable among individuals within a population. Even genetically identical &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; reared in homogeneous environments are as variable in lifespan as outbred human populations. We hypothesized that persistent inter-individual differences in expression of key regulatory genes drives this lifespan variability. As a test, we examined the relationship between future lifespan and the expression of 22 microRNA promoter::GFP constructs. Surprisingly, expression of nearly half of these reporters, well before death, could effectively predict lifespan. This indicates that prospectively long- vs. short-lived individuals have highly divergent patterns of transgene expression and transcriptional regulation. The gene-regulatory processes reported on by two of the most lifespan-predictive transgenes do not require DAF-16, the FOXO transcription factor that is a principal effector of insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) signaling. Last, we demonstrate a hierarchy of redundancy in lifespan-predictive ability among three transgenes expressed in distinct tissues, suggesting that they collectively report on an organism-wide, cell non-autonomous process that acts to set each individual's lifespan.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Heterogeneity in physical and functional characteristics of cells (e.g. size, cycle time, growth rate, protein concentration) proliferates within an isogenic population due to stochasticity in intracellular biochemical processes and in the distribution of resources during divisions. Conversely, it is limited in part by the inheritance of cellular components between consecutive generations. Here we introduce a new experimental method for measuring proliferation of heterogeneity in bacterial cell characteristics, based on measuring how two sister cells become different from each other over time. Our measurements provide the inheritance dynamics of different cellular properties, and the 'inertia' of cells to maintain these properties along time. We find that inheritance dynamics are property-specific, and can exhibit long-term memory (~10 generations) that works to restrain variation among cells. Our results can reveal mechanisms of non-genetic inheritance in bacteria and help understand how cells control their properties and heterogeneity within isogenic cell populations.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63364</link>
	<content:encoded>Plaques of the amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide are a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), the most common form of dementia. Mutations in Aβ also cause familial forms of AD (fAD). Here we use deep mutational scanning to quantify the effects of &amp;gt;14,000 mutations on the aggregation of Aβ. The resulting genetic landscape reveals mechanistic insights into fibril nucleation, including the importance of charge and gatekeeper residues in the disordered region outside of the amyloid core in preventing nucleation. Strikingly, unlike computational predictors and previous measurements, the empirical nucleation scores accurately identify all known dominant fAD mutations in AB42, genetically validating that the mechanism of nucleation in a cell-based assay is likely to be very similar to the mechanism that causes the human disease. These results provide the first comprehensive atlas of how mutations alter the formation of any amyloid fibril and a resource for the interpretation of genetic variation in Aβ.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Pre-existing bilayer stresses modulate triglyceride accumulation in the ER versus lipid droplets</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/62886</link>
	<content:encoded>Cells store energy in the form of neutral lipids packaged into micrometer-sized organelles named lipid droplets (LD). These structures emerge from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) at sites marked by the protein seipin, but the mechanisms regulating their biogenesis remain poorly understood. Using a combination of molecular simulations, yeast genetics and fluorescence microscopy, we show that interactions between lipids' acyl-chains modulate the propensity of neutral lipids to be stored in LD, in turn preventing or promoting their accumulation in the ER membrane. Our data suggest that diacylglycerol, that is enriched at sites of LD formation, promotes the packaging of neutral lipids into LDs, together with ER-abundant lipids, such as phosphatidylethanolamine. On the opposite end, short and saturated acyl-chains antagonize fat storage in LD and promote accumulation of neutral lipids in the ER. Our results provide a new conceptual understanding of LD biogenesis in the context of ER homeostasis and function.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Primary visual cortex (V1) in the mouse projects to numerous brain areas, including several secondary visual areas, frontal cortex, and basal ganglia. While it has been demonstrated that optogenetic silencing of V1 strongly impairs visually-guided behavior, it is not known which downstream areas are required for visual behaviors. Here we trained mice to perform a contrast-increment change detection task, for which substantial stimulus information is present in V1. Optogenetic silencing of visual responses in secondary visual areas revealed that their activity is required for even this simple visual task. In vivo electrophysiology showed that, although inhibiting secondary visual areas could produce some feedback effects in V1, the principal effect was profound suppression at the location of the optogenetic light. The results show that pathways through secondary visual areas are necessary for even simple visual behaviors.</content:encoded>

Understanding the population dynamics of TB's causative agent &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; complex (Mtbc) in-host is vital for understanding the efficacy of antibiotic treatment. We use longitudinally collected clinical Mtbc isolates that underwent Whole-Genome Sequencing from the sputa of 200 patients to investigate Mtbc diversity during the course of active TB disease after excluding 107 cases suspected of reinfection, mixed infection or contamination. Of the 178/200 patients with persistent clonal infection &amp;gt; 2 months, 27 developed new resistance mutations between sampling with 20/27 occurring in patients with pre-existing resistance. Low abundance resistance variants at a purity of ≥19% in the first isolate predict fixation in the subsequent sample.

	<title>eLife: The human Origin Recognition Complex is essential for pre-RC assembly, mitosis and maintenance of nuclear structure</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61797</link>
	<content:encoded>The Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) cooperates with CDC6, MCM2-7, and CDT1 to form pre-RC complexes at origins of DNA replication. Here, using tiling-sgRNA CRISPR screens, we report that each subunit of ORC and CDC6 is essential in human cells. Using an auxin-inducible degradation system, we created stable cell lines capable of ablating ORC2 rapidly, revealing multiple cell division cycle phenotypes. The primary defects in the absence of ORC2 were cells encountering difficulty in initiating DNA replication or progressing through the cell division cycle due to reduced MCM2-7 loading onto chromatin in G1 phase. The nuclei of ORC2 deficient cells were also large, with decompacted heterochromatin. Some ORC2 deficient cells that completed DNA replication entered into, but never exited mitosis. ORC1 knockout cells also demonstrated extremely slow cell proliferation and abnormal cell and nuclear morphology. Thus, ORC proteins and CDC6 are indispensable for normal cellular proliferation and contribute to nuclear organization.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Evolutionary transcriptomics implicates HAND2 in the origins of implantation and regulation of gestation length</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61257</link>
	<content:encoded>The developmental origins and evolutionary histories of cell types, tissues and organ systems contribute to the ways in which their dysfunction leads to disease. In mammals for example, the nature and extent of maternal-fetal interactions, how those interactions develop, and their evolutionary history likely influence diseases of pregnancy such as infertility and preterm birth. Here we show genes that evolved to be expressed at the maternal-fetal interface in Eutherian ('Placental') mammals play essential roles in the evolution of pregnancy and are associated with immune system disorders and preterm birth. Among these genes is the transcription factor &lt;i&gt;HAND2&lt;/i&gt;, which suppresses estrogen signaling, an innovation of Eutherians, thereby allowing blastocyst implantation. We found that &lt;i&gt;HAND2&lt;/i&gt; is dynamically expressed in the decidua throughout the menstrual cycle and pregnancy, gradually decreasing to reach a low at term. HAND2 regulates a small but distinct set of target genes in endometrial stromal fibroblasts including the cytokine &lt;i&gt;IL15&lt;/i&gt;, which was also dynamically expressed throughout the menstrual cycle and gestation, and promoted the migration of natural killer cells and extravillous cytotrophoblasts. Remarkably, we found that the &lt;i&gt;HAND2&lt;/i&gt; promoter loops to a distal enhancer containing SNPs implicated in the regulation of gestation length and birth weight. Collectively, these data connect &lt;i&gt;HAND2&lt;/i&gt; expression at the maternal-fetal interface with the evolution of implantation and gestation length regulation, and preterm birth.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Laminar-specific cortico-cortical loops in mouse visual cortex</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59551</link>
	<content:encoded>Many theories propose recurrent interactions across the cortical hierarchy, but it is unclear if cortical circuits are selectively wired to implement looped computations. Using subcellular channelrhodopsin-2-assisted circuit mapping in mouse visual cortex, we compared feedforward (FF) or feedback (FB) cortico-cortical synaptic input to cells projecting back to the input source (looped neurons) with cells projecting to a different cortical or subcortical area. FF and FB afferents showed similar cell-type selectivity, making stronger connections with looped neurons than with other projection types in layer (L) 5 and L6, but not in L2/3, resulting in selective modulation of activity in looped neurons. In most cases, stronger connections in looped L5 neurons were located on their apical tufts, but not on their perisomatic dendrites. Our results reveal that cortico-cortical connections are selectively wired to form monosynaptic excitatory loops and support a differential role of supragranular and infragranular neurons in hierarchical recurrent computations.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Robustness of the microtubule network self-organization in epithelia</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59529</link>
	<content:encoded>Robustness of biological systems is crucial for their survival, however, for many systems its origin is an open question. Here we analyze one sub-cellular level system, the microtubule cytoskeleton. Microtubules self-organize into a network, along which cellular components are delivered to their biologically relevant locations. While the dynamics of individual microtubules is sensitive to the organism's environment and genetics, a similar sensitivity of the overall network would result in pathologies. Our large-scale stochastic simulations show that the self-organization of microtubule networks is robust in a wide parameter range in individual cells. We confirm this robustness &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; on the tissue-scale using genetic manipulations of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; epithelial cells. Finally, our minimal mathematical model shows that the origin of robustness is the separation of time-scales in microtubule dynamics rates. Altogether, we demonstrate that the tissue-scale self-organization of a microtubule network depends only on cell geometry and the distribution of the microtubule minus-ends.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Dual midbrain and forebrain origins of thalamic inhibitory interneurons</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59272</link>
	<content:encoded>The ubiquitous presence of inhibitory interneurons in the thalamus of primates contrasts with the sparsity of interneurons reported in mice. Here, we identify a larger than expected complexity and distribution of interneurons across the mouse thalamus, where all thalamic interneurons can be traced back to two developmental programs: one specified in the midbrain and the other in the forebrain. Interneurons migrate to functionally distinct thalamocrtical nuclei depending on their origin: the abundant, midbrain-generated class populates the first and higher order sensory thalamus while the rarer, forebrain-generated class is restricted to some higher order associative regions. We also observe that markers for the midbrain-born class are abundantly expressed throughout the thalamus of the New World monkey marmoset. These data therefore reveal that, despite the broad variability in interneuron density across mammalian species, the blueprint of the ontogenetic organisation of thalamic interneurons of larger-brained mammals exists and can be studied in mice.</content:encoded>

After slowing down the spread of the novel coronavirus COVID-19, many countries have started to relax their confinement measures in the face of critical damage to socioeconomic structures. At this stage, it is desirable to monitor the degree to which political measures or social affairs have exerted influence on the spread of disease. Though it is difficult to trace back individual transmission of infections whose incubation periods are long and highly variable, estimating the average spreading rate is possible if a proper mathematical model can be devised to analyze daily event-occurrences. To render an accurate assessment, we have devised a state-space method for fitting a discrete-time variant of the Hawkes process to a given dataset of daily confirmed cases. The proposed method detects changes occurring in each country and assesses the impact of social events in terms of the temporally varying reproduction number, which corresponds to the average number of cases directly caused by a single infected case. Moreover, the proposed method can be used to predict the possible consequences of alternative political measures. This information can serve as a reference for behavioral guidelines that should be adopted according to the varying risk of infection.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/l3J0qpBlzNo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The connection between stimulus perception and time perception remains unknown. The present study combines human and rat psychophysics with sensory cortical neuronal firing to construct a computational model for the percept of elapsed time embedded within sense of touch. When subjects judged the duration of a vibration applied to the fingertip (human) or whiskers (rat), increasing stimulus intensity led to increasing perceived duration. Symmetrically, increasing vibration duration led to increasing perceived intensity. We modeled real spike trains recorded from vibrissal somatosensory cortex as input to dual leaky integrators–an intensity integrator with short time constant and a duration integrator with long time constant–generating neurometric functions that replicated the actual psychophysical functions of rats. Returning to human psychophysics, we then confirmed specific predictions of the dual leaky integrator model. This study offers a framework, based on sensory coding and subsequent accumulation of sensory drive, to account for how a feeling of the passage of time accompanies the tactile sensory experience.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Qk53SeMoaUo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Martina Conte, Sergio Casas-Tintò, Juan Soler&lt;/p&gt;

Glioblastoma is the most aggressive tumor of the central nervous system, due to its great infiltration capacity. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate the Glioblastoma invasion front is a major challenge with preeminent potential clinical relevances. In the infiltration front, the key features of tumor dynamics relate to biochemical and biomechanical aspects, which result in the extension of cellular protrusions known as tumor microtubes. The coordination of metalloproteases expression, extracellular matrix degradation, and integrin activity emerges as a leading mechanism that facilitates Glioblastoma expansion and infiltration in uncontaminated brain regions. We propose a novel multidisciplinary approach, based on in vivo experiments in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; and mathematical models, that describes the dynamics of active and inactive integrins in relation to matrix metalloprotease concentration and tumor density at the Glioblastoma invasion front. The mathematical model is based on a non-linear system of evolution equations in which the mechanisms leading chemotaxis, haptotaxis, and front dynamics compete with the movement induced by the saturated flux in porous media. This approach is able to capture the relative influences of the involved agents and reproduce the formation of patterns, which drive tumor front evolution. These patterns have the value of providing biomarker information that is related to the direction of the dynamical evolution of the front and based on static measures of proteins in several tumor samples. Furthermore, we consider in our model biomechanical elements, like the tissue porosity, as indicators of the healthy tissue resistance to tumor progression.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vza9Fm7jS7Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

A key parameter in epidemiological modeling which characterizes the spread of an infectious disease is the generation time, or more generally the distribution of infectiousness as a function of time since infection. There is increasing evidence supporting a prolonged viral shedding window for COVID-19, but the transmissibility in this phase is unclear. Based on this, we develop a generalized Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Resistant (SEIR) model including an additional compartment of chronically infected individuals who can stay infectious for a longer duration than the reported generation time, but with infectivity reduced to varying degrees. Using the incidence and fatality data from different countries, we first show that such an assumption also yields a plausible model in explaining the data observed prior to the easing of the lockdown measures (relaxation). We then test the predictive power of this model for different durations and levels of prolonged infectiousness using the incidence data after the introduction of relaxation in Switzerland, and compare it with a model without the chronically infected population to represent the models conventionally used. We show that in case of a gradual easing on the lockdown measures, the predictions of the model including the chronically infected population vary considerably from those obtained under a model in which prolonged infectiousness is not taken into account. Although the existence of a chronically infected population still remains largely hypothetical, we believe that our results provide tentative evidence to consider a chronically infected population as an alternative modeling approach to better interpret the transmission dynamics of COVID-19.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0Vs3a-TSzn0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

We consider the following general family of algorithmic problems that arises in transcriptomics, metabolomics and other fields: given a weighted graph G and a subset of its nodes S, find subsets of S that show significant connectedness within G. A specific solution to this problem may be defined by devising a scoring function, the Maximum Clique problem being a classic example, where S includes all nodes in G and where the score is defined by the size of the largest subset of S fully connected within G. Major practical obstacles for the plethora of algorithms addressing this type of problem include computational efficiency and, particularly for more complex scores which take edge weights into account, the computational cost of permutation testing, a statistical procedure required to obtain a bound on the p-value for a connectedness score. To address these problems, we developed CTD “Connect the Dots”, a fast algorithm based on data compression that detects highly connected subsets within S. CTD provides information-theoretic upper bounds on p-values when S contains a small fraction of nodes in G without requiring computationally costly permutation testing. We apply the CTD algorithm to interpret multi-metabolite perturbations due to inborn errors of metabolism and multi-transcript perturbations associated with breast cancer in the context of disease-specific Gaussian Markov Random Field networks learned directly from respective molecular profiling data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-Wd4YcxPwLg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;i&gt;Gambiense&lt;/i&gt; human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT) is a virulent disease declining in burden but still endemic in West and Central Africa. Although it is targeted for elimination of transmission by 2030, there remain numerous questions about the drivers of infection and how these vary geographically.
In this study we focus on the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which accounted for 84% of the global case burden in 2016, to explore changes in transmission across the country and elucidate factors which may have contributed to the persistence of disease or success of interventions in different regions. We present a Bayesian fitting methodology, applied to 168 endemic health zones (∼100,000 population size), which allows for calibration of a mechanistic gHAT model to case data (from the World Health Organization HAT Atlas) in an adaptive and automated framework.
It was found that the model needed to capture improvements in passive detection to match observed trends in the data within former Bandundu and Bas Congo provinces indicating these regions have substantially reduced time to detection. Health zones in these provinces generally had longer burn-in periods during fitting due to additional model parameters.
Posterior probability distributions were found for a range of fitted parameters in each health zone; these included the basic reproduction number estimates for pre-1998 (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) which was inferred to be between 1 and 1.14, in line with previous gHAT estimates, with higher median values typically in health zones with more case reporting in the 2000s.
Previously, it was not clear whether a fall in active case finding in the period contributed to the declining case numbers. The modelling here accounts for variable screening and suggests that underlying transmission has also reduced greatly—on average 96% in former Equateur, 93% in former Bas Congo and 89% in former Bandundu—Equateur and Bandundu having had the highest case burdens in 2000. This analysis also sets out a framework to enable future predictions for the country.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tPdTwUVzmjI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Beta-lactam- and in particular carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae represent a major public health threat. Despite strong variation of resistance across geographical settings, there is limited understanding of the underlying drivers. To assess these drivers, we developed a transmission model of cephalosporin- and carbapenem-resistant &lt;i&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;. The model is parameterized using antibiotic consumption and demographic data from eleven European countries and fitted to the resistance rates for &lt;i&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; for these settings. The impact of potential drivers of resistance is then assessed in counterfactual analyses. Based on reported consumption data, the model could simultaneously fit the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing and carbapenem-resistant &lt;i&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; (ESBL and CRK) across eleven European countries over eleven years. The fit could explain the large between-country variability of resistance in terms of consumption patterns and fitted differences in hospital transmission rates. Based on this fit, a counterfactual analysis found that reducing nosocomial transmission and antibiotic consumption in the hospital had the strongest impact on ESBL and CRK prevalence. Antibiotic consumption in the community also affected ESBL prevalence but its relative impact was weaker than inpatient consumption. Finally, we used the model to estimate a moderate fitness cost of CRK and ESBL at the population level. This work highlights the disproportionate role of antibiotic consumption in the hospital and of nosocomial transmission for resistance in gram-negative bacteria at a European level. This indicates that infection control and antibiotic stewardship measures should play a major role in limiting resistance even at the national or regional level.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GGttMT652VA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Gene regulatory network inference is essential to uncover complex relationships among gene pathways and inform downstream experiments, ultimately enabling regulatory network re-engineering. Network inference from transcriptional time-series data requires accurate, interpretable, and efficient determination of causal relationships among thousands of genes. Here, we develop Bootstrap Elastic net regression from Time Series (BETS), a statistical framework based on Granger causality for the recovery of a directed gene network from transcriptional time-series data. BETS uses elastic net regression and stability selection from bootstrapped samples to infer causal relationships among genes. BETS is highly parallelized, enabling efficient analysis of large transcriptional data sets. We show competitive accuracy on a community benchmark, the DREAM4 100-gene network inference challenge, where BETS is one of the fastest among methods of similar performance and additionally infers whether causal effects are activating or inhibitory. We apply BETS to transcriptional time-series data of differentially-expressed genes from A549 cells exposed to glucocorticoids over a period of 12 hours. We identify a network of 2768 genes and 31, 945 directed edges (FDR ≤ 0.2). We validate inferred causal network edges using two external data sources: Overexpression experiments on the same glucocorticoid system, and genetic variants associated with inferred edges in primary lung tissue in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) v6 project. BETS is available as an open source software package at https://github.com/lujonathanh/BETS.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zCJP259WSfo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Anatomically and biophysically detailed data-driven neuronal models have become widely used tools for understanding and predicting the behavior and function of neurons. Due to the increasing availability of experimental data from anatomical and electrophysiological measurements as well as the growing number of computational and software tools that enable accurate neuronal modeling, there are now a large number of different models of many cell types available in the literature. These models were usually built to capture a few important or interesting properties of the given neuron type, and it is often unknown how they would behave outside their original context. In addition, there is currently no simple way of quantitatively comparing different models regarding how closely they match specific experimental observations. This limits the evaluation, re-use and further development of the existing models. Further, the development of new models could also be significantly facilitated by the ability to rapidly test the behavior of model candidates against the relevant collection of experimental data. We address these problems for the representative case of the CA1 pyramidal cell of the rat hippocampus by developing an open-source Python test suite, which makes it possible to automatically and systematically test multiple properties of models by making quantitative comparisons between the models and electrophysiological data. The tests cover various aspects of somatic behavior, and signal propagation and integration in apical dendrites. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we applied our tests to compare the behavior of several different rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell models from the ModelDB database against electrophysiological data available in the literature, and evaluated how well these models match experimental observations in different domains. We also show how we employed the test suite to aid the development of models within the European Human Brain Project (HBP), and describe the integration of the tests into the validation framework developed in the HBP, with the aim of facilitating more reproducible and transparent model building in the neuroscience community.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZEryzjWRiq4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The song system of songbirds (oscines) is one of the best explored neuroethological model systems. The study presents a histological investigation of the nuclei of the extended song system of the carrion crow (Corvus corone), a songbird of the corvid family that has become an interesting model system for cognitive neuroscience.







Abstract
The song system of songbirds (oscines) is one of the best studied neuroethological model systems. So far, it has been treated as a relatively constrained sensorimotor system. Songbirds such as crows, however, are also known for their capability to cognitively control their audio‐vocal system. Yet, the neuroanatomy of the corvid song system has never been explored systematically. We aim to close this scientific gap by presenting a stereotactic investigation of the extended song system of the carrion crow (Corvus corone), an oscine songbird of the corvid family that has become an interesting model system for cognitive neuroscience. In order to identify and delineate the song nuclei, the ascending auditory nuclei, and the descending vocal‐motor nuclei, four stains were applied. In addition to the classical Nissl‐, myelin‐, and a combination of Nissl‐and‐myelin staining, staining for tyrosine hydroxylase was used to reveal the distribution of catecholaminergic neurons (dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and adrenergic) in the song system. We show that the crow brain contains the important song‐related nuclei, including auditory input and motor output structures, and map them throughout the brain. Fiber‐stained sections reveal putative connection patterns between the crow's song nuclei comparable to other songbirds.</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Pediatric Ischemic Stroke: An Infrequent Complication of SARS‐CoV‐2</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25991?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Severe complications of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) include arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) in adults and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Whether stroke is a frequent complication of pediatric SARS‐CoV‐2 is unknown. This study aimed to determine the proportion of pediatric SARS‐CoV‐2 cases with ischemic stroke and the proportion of incident pediatric strokes with SARS‐CoV‐2 in the first 3 months of the pandemic in an international cohort.


Methods
We surveyed 61 international sites with pediatric stroke expertise. Survey questions included: numbers of hospitalized pediatric (≤ 18 years) patients with SARS‐CoV‐2; numbers of incident neonatal and childhood ischemic strokes; frequency of SARS‐CoV‐2 testing for pediatric patients with stroke; and numbers of stroke cases positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 from March 1 to May 31, 2020.


Results
Of 42 centers with SARS‐CoV‐2 hospitalization numbers, 8 of 971 (0.82%) pediatric patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 had ischemic strokes. Proportions of stroke cases positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 from March to May 2020 were: 1 of 108 with neonatal AIS (0.9%), 0 of 33 with neonatal cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CSVT; 0%), 6 of 166 with childhood AIS (3.6%), and 1 of 54 with childhood CSVT (1.9%). However, only 30.5% of neonates and 60% of children with strokes were tested for SARS‐CoV‐2. Therefore, these proportions represent 2.9, 0, 6.1, and 3.0% of stroke cases tested for SARS‐CoV‐2. Seven of 8 patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 and stroke had additional established stroke risk factors.


Interpretation
As in adults, pediatric stroke is an infrequent complication of SARS‐CoV‐2, and SARS‐CoV‐2 was detected in only 4.6% of pediatric patients with ischemic stroke tested for the virus. However, &amp;lt; 50% of strokes were tested. To understand the role of SARS‐CoV‐2 in pediatric stroke better, SARS‐CoV‐2 testing should be considered in pediatric patients with stroke as the pandemic continues. ANN NEUROL 2021</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Anatomical projections to the dorsal tegmental nucleus and abducens nucleus arise from separate cell populations in the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi, but overlapping cell populations in the medial vestibular nucleus</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25119?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Retrograde tracers were utilized to examine projections to the dorsal tegmental nucleus (DTN), a critical component of the head direction cell circuitry, and the abducens nucleus, an oculomotor structure. We found that the medial vestibular nucleus contains individual neurons that project to both the DTN and abducens nucleus. In contrast, neurons in the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi project to either the DTN or abducens nucleus, but rarely to both structures simultaneously. Additionally, we describe interhemispheric connections between the left and right DTN, and projections from the supragenual nucleus, interpeduncular nucleus, and retrosplenial cortex to the DTN.







Abstract
Specialized circuitry in the brain processes spatial information to provide a sense of direction used for navigation. The dorsal tegmental nucleus (DTN) is a core component of this circuitry and utilizes vestibular inputs to generate neural activity encoding the animal’s directional heading. Projections arising from the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi (NPH) and the medial vestibular nucleus (MVe) are thought to transmit critical vestibular signals to the DTN and other brain areas, including the abducens nucleus (ABN), a component of eye movement circuitry. Here, we utilized a dual retrograde tracer approach in rats to investigate whether overlapping or distinct populations of neurons project from the NPH or MVe to the DTN and ABN. We report that individual MVe neurons project to both the DTN and ABN. In contrast, we observed individual NPH neurons that project to either the DTN or ABN, but rarely to both structures simultaneously. We also examined labeling patterns in other structures located in the brainstem and posterior cortex and observed 1) complex patterns of interhemispheric connectivity between the left and right DTN, 2) projections from the supragenual nucleus, interpeduncular nucleus, and retrosplenial cortex to the DTN, 3) projections from the lateral superior olive to the ABN, and 4) a unique population of cerebrospinal fluid‐contacting neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus . Collectively, our experiments provide valuable new information that extends our understanding of the anatomical organization of the brain’s spatial processing circuitry.

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Activation response and functional connectivity change in rat cortex after bilateral transcranial direct current stimulation—An exploratory study</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24793?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Our study demonstrates that simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in rats is feasible with an MRI‐compatible electrode montage. We found that bilateral tDCS can locally modulate neural activity and functional connectivity in rat brain, while cortical functional connectivity is differentially affected under the tDCS cathode and anode.

Abstract
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique implicated as a promising adjunct therapy to improve motor function through the neuromodulation of brain networks. Particularly bilateral tDCS, which affects both hemispheres, may yield stronger effects on motor learning than unilateral stimulation. Therefore, the aim of this exploratory study was to develop an experimental model for simultaneous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and bilateral tDCS in rats, to measure instant and resultant effects of tDCS on network activity and connectivity. Naïve, male Sprague‐Dawley rats were divided into a tDCS (n = 7) and sham stimulation group (n = 6). Functional MRI data were collected during concurrent bilateral tDCS over the sensorimotor cortex, while resting‐state functional MRI and perfusion MRI were acquired directly before and after stimulation. Bilateral tDCS induced a hemodynamic activation response, reflected by a bilateral increase in blood oxygenation level‐dependent signal in different cortical areas, including the sensorimotor regions. Resting‐state functional connectivity within the cortical sensorimotor network decreased after a first stimulation session but increased after a second session, suggesting an interaction between multiple tDCS sessions. Perfusion MRI revealed no significant changes in cerebral blood flow after tDCS. Our exploratory study demonstrates successful application of an MRI‐compatible bilateral tDCS setup in an animal model. Our results indicate that bilateral tDCS can locally modulate neuronal activity and connectivity, which may underlie its therapeutic potential.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Neuropathological Characterization of a Dravet Syndrome Knock-In Mouse Model Useful for Investigating Cannabinoid Treatments</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.602801</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dravet syndrome (DS) is an epileptic syndrome caused by mutations in the Scn1a gene encoding the α1 subunit of the sodium channel Nav1.1, which is associated with febrile seizures that progress to severe tonic-clonic seizures and associated comorbidities. Treatment with cannabidiol has been approved to reduce seizures in DS, but it may also be active against these comorbidities. The aim of this study was to validate a new mouse model of DS having lower mortality than previous models, which may serve to further evaluate therapies for the long-term comorbidities. This new model consists of heterozygous conditional knock-in mice carrying a missense mutation (A1783V) in Scn1a gene expressed exclusively in neurons of the CNS (Syn-Cre/Scn1a&lt;sup&gt;WT/A1783V&lt;/sup&gt;). These mice have been used here to determine the extent and persistence of the behavioral deterioration in different postnatal days (PND), as well as to investigate the alterations that the disease produces in the endocannabinoid system and the contribution of inflammatory events and impaired neurogenesis in the pathology. Syn-Cre/Scn1a&lt;sup&gt;WT/A1783V&lt;/sup&gt; mice showed a strong reduction in hindlimb grasp reflex at PND10, whereas at PND25, they presented spontaneous convulsions and a greater susceptibility to pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures, marked hyperactivity, deficient spatial working memory, lower levels of anxiety, and altered social interaction behavior. These differences disappeared at PND40 and PND60, except the changes in social interaction and anxiety. The analysis of CNS structures associated with these behavioral alterations revealed an elevated glial reactivity in the prefrontal cortex and the dentate gyrus. This was associated in the dentate gyrus with a greater cell proliferation detected with Ki67 immunostaining, whereas double-labeling analyses identified that proliferating cells were GFAP-positive suggesting failed neurogenesis but astrocyte proliferation. The analysis of the endocannabinoid system of Syn-Cre/Scn1a&lt;sup&gt;WT/A1783V&lt;/sup&gt; mice confirmed reductions in CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors and MAGL and FAAH enzymes, mainly in the cerebellum but also in other areas, whereas CB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors became upregulated in the hippocampus. In conclusion, Syn-Cre/Scn1a&lt;sup&gt;WT/A1783V&lt;/sup&gt; mice showed seizuring susceptibility and several comorbidities (hyperactivity, memory impairment, less anxiety, and altered social behavior), which exhibited a pattern of age expression similar to DS patients. Syn-Cre/Scn1a&lt;sup&gt;WT/A1783V&lt;/sup&gt; mice also exhibited greater glial reactivity and a reactive response in the neurogenic niche, and regional changes in the status of the endocannabinoid signaling, events that could contribute in behavioral impairment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: “The Boundless Realm Where All Form Lies”. Representing Imagination at the Crossway Between Literary and Neurocognitive Studies</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.618605</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;According to ancient texts on poetics, the concept of representation is deeply bound to that of “mimesis;” this last was intended in two main ways: as “imitation” and as “world construction.” In Aristotle's Poetics, mimesis is theorized as the main form of “world simulation,” giving rise to the complex universe of fiction. The concept of simulation plays a pivotal role in the neurocognitive theories on the embodied mind: within this frame, embodied simulation is intended as a functional prelinguistic activation of the human sensorimotor mechanism. This happens not only with regard to intercorporeality and intersubjectivity in the real world but also in relation to the process of imagination giving rise to literary imagery and to the reader's reception of the fictional world, since human beings share a common sensorimotor apparatus. Imagination is a central concept in the recent neurocognitive studies since it plays a core role in human life and in artistic production and reception. Imagination has been considered as a complex emergent cognitive faculty deeply intertwined with perception, memory, and consciousness, shaping human life and transforming the limited horizon of our perceptual affective understanding, being, and acting. Although there is an immense bulk of literature on this topic, imagination is still an elusive concept: its definition and understanding change according to different heuristic frames—mainly the philosophical, aesthetic, poetic, and cognitive ones—giving rise to debates about its modalities and effects, particularly in relation to the construction of aesthetic and symbolic constraints. In this paper, we claim that scientific research may take advantage from the literary representation of the imaginative faculties, which occurs in specific tests characterized by dynamic images and motion. In such meta-representation of the imagination, we witness the phenomenological emergence of endogenous dynamic processes involving a cluster of cognitive faculties, activated by triggering the reader's embodied simulation. One of the main German poets, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, in the second part of his masterwork Faust II, intuitively represents the very process of the imagination and its responding to embodied simulation with regard both to the author's creative act and to its reception by the reader. At the crossway between literary and neurocognitive, this study aims to highlight the advantage offered to future transdisciplinary inquiries by the literary representation showing features and dynamics of the still mysterious phenomenon of the imagination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Effects of Priming Intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation on Movement-Related and Mirror Visual Feedback-Induced Sensorimotor Desynchronization</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.626887</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The potential benefits of priming intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) with continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) have not been examined in regard to sensorimotor oscillatory activities recorded in electroencephalography (EEG). The objective of this study was to investigate the modulatory effect of priming iTBS (cTBS followed by iTBS) delivered to the motor cortex on movement-related and mirror visual feedback (MVF)-induced sensorimotor event-related desynchronization (ERD), compared with iTBS alone, on healthy adults. Twenty participants were randomly allocated into Group 1: priming iTBS—cTBS followed by iTBS, and Group 2: non-priming iTBS—sham cTBS followed by iTBS. The stimulation was delivered to the right primary motor cortex daily for 4 consecutive days. EEG was measured before and after 4 sessions of stimulation. Movement-related ERD was evaluated during left-index finger tapping and MVF-induced sensorimotor ERD was evaluated by comparing the difference between right-index finger tapping with and without MVF. After stimulation, both protocols increased movement-related ERD and MVF-induced sensorimotor ERD in high mu and low beta bands, indicated by significant time effects. A significant interaction effect favoring Group 1 in enhancing movement-related ERD was observed in the high mu band [F&lt;sub&gt;(1,18)&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.47, p = 0.049], compared with Group 2. Our experiment suggests that among healthy adults priming iTBS with cTBS delivered to the motor cortex yields similar effects with iTBS alone on enhancing ERD induced by MVF-based observation, while movement-related ERD was more enhanced in the priming iTBS condition, specifically in the high mu band.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Feature-Based Attentional Weighting and Re-weighting in the Absence of Visual Awareness</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.610347</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Visual attention evolved as an adaptive mechanism allowing us to cope with a rapidly changing environment. It enables the facilitated processing of relevant information, often automatically and governed by implicit motives. However, despite recent advances in understanding the relationship between consciousness and visual attention, the functional scope of unconscious attentional control is still under debate. Here, we present a novel masking paradigm in which volunteers were to distinguish between varying orientations of a briefly presented, masked grating stimulus. Combining signal detection theory and subjective measures of awareness, we show that performance on unaware trials was consistent with visual selection being weighted towards repeated orientations of Gabor patches and reallocated in response to a novel unconsciously processed orientation. This was particularly present in trials in which the prior feature was strongly weighted and only if the novel feature was invisible. Thus, our results provide evidence that invisible orientation stimuli can trigger the reallocation of history-guided visual selection weights.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Walking Speed Reliably Measures Clinically Significant Changes in Gait by Directional Deep Brain Stimulation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.618366</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Although deep brain stimulation (DBS) often improves levodopa-responsive gait symptoms, robust therapies for gait dysfunction from Parkinson's disease (PD) remain a major unmet need. Walking speed could represent a simple, integrated tool to assess DBS efficacy but is often not examined systematically or quantitatively during DBS programming. Here we investigate the reliability and functional significance of changes in gait by directional DBS in the subthalamic nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Nineteen patients underwent unilateral subthalamic nucleus DBS surgery with an eight-contact directional lead (1-3-3-1 configuration) in the most severely affected hemisphere. They arrived off dopaminergic medications &amp;gt;12 h preoperatively and for device activation 1 month after surgery. We measured a comfortable walking speed using an instrumented walkway with DBS off and at each of 10 stimulation configurations (six directional contacts, two virtual rings, and two circular rings) at the midpoint of the therapeutic window. Repeated measures of ANOVA contrasted preoperative vs. maximum and minimum walking speeds across DBS configurations during device activation. Intraclass correlation coefficients examined walking speed reliability across the four trials within each DBS configuration. We also investigated whether changes in walking speed related to modification of step length vs. cadence with a one-sample t-test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Mean comfortable walking speed improved significantly with DBS on vs. both DBS off and minimum speeds with DBS on (p &amp;lt; 0.001, respectively). Pairwise comparisons showed no significant difference between DBS off and minimum comfortable walking speed with DBS on (p = 1.000). Intraclass correlations were ≥0.949 within each condition. Changes in comfortable walk speed were conferred primarily by changes in step length (p &amp;lt; 0.004).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Acute assessment of walking speed is a reliable, clinically meaningful measure of gait function during DBS activation. Directional and circular unilateral subthalamic DBS in appropriate configurations elicit acute and clinically significant improvements in gait dysfunction related to PD. Next-generation directional DBS technologies have significant potential to enhance gait by individually tailoring stimulation parameters to optimize efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: New Insights Into the Anatomy, Connectivity and Clinical Implications of the Middle Longitudinal Fasciculus</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.610324</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The middle longitudinal fascicle (MdLF) is a long, associative white matter tract connecting the superior temporal gyrus (STG) with the parietal and occipital lobe. Previous studies show different cortical terminations, and a possible segmentation pattern of the tract. In this study, we performed a post-mortem white matter dissection of 12 human hemispheres and an in vivo deterministic fiber tracking of 24 subjects acquired from the Human Connectome Project to establish whether a constant organization of fibers exists among the MdLF subcomponents and to acquire anatomical information on each subcomponent. Moreover, two clinical cases of brain tumors impinged on MdLF territories are reported to further discuss the anatomical results in light of previously published data on the functional involvement of this bundle. The main finding is that the MdLF is consistently organized into two layers: an antero-ventral segment (aMdLF) connecting the anterior STG (including temporal pole and planum polare) and the extrastriate lateral occipital cortex, and a posterior-dorsal segment (pMdLF) connecting the posterior STG, anterior transverse temporal gyrus and planum temporale with the superior parietal lobule and lateral occipital cortex. The anatomical connectivity pattern and quantitative differences between the MdLF subcomponents along with the clinical cases reported in this paper support the role of MdLF in high-order functions related to acoustic information. We suggest that pMdLF may contribute to the learning process associated with verbal-auditory stimuli, especially on left side, while aMdLF may play a role in processing/retrieving auditory information already consolidated within the temporal lobe.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Relationship Between Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer Thickness and Clinical Symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.584244</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background/Aim: Retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness (RT), which can reflect the status of the retinal optic nerve cells, may be affected in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). There are few studies on the correlation of RT of patients with AD (AD-RT) with clinical symptoms of various cognitive domains, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and activities of daily living (ADL). This study is to investigate the relationships between RT and the abovementioned clinical symptoms of AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A total of 96 patients with AD were included in this study. RT was measured in these patients using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Demographic variables, RT, and clinical symptoms were compared between the normal and the abnormal AD-RT groups. Clinical symptoms, including cognitive symptoms, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and ADL, were evaluated using a series of rating scales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The relationships between RT and cognitive symptoms scores were analyzed in patients with AD. Reduced RT was found in 54.4% of patients with AD. The average RT, RT of the superior 1/2 quadrant, and RT of the inferior 1/2 quadrant of both eyes were all significantly decreased in the abnormal AD-RT group (p &amp;lt; 0.001). Overall cognitive function and performance in multiple cognitive domains, including memory, language, attention, and executive function, were also significantly impaired in the abnormal AD-RT group (p &amp;lt; 0.05). For lower RT value, the global cognitive function and the performance in multiple cognitive domains were worse. ADL was significantly compromised in patients with AD having lower RT values (p &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Lower RT value appear to be correlated with cognitive impairment, and RT may be an indicator of cognitive decline in patients with AD. Further studies are required to confirm our findings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65443</link>
	<content:encoded>Mutations in the fukutin-related protein (FKRP) cause Walker-Warburg Syndrome (WWS), a severe form of congenital muscular dystrophy. Here we established a WWS human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived myogenic model that recapitulates hallmarks of WWS pathology. We used this model to investigate the therapeutic effect of metabolites of the pentose phosphate pathway in human WWS. We show that functional recovery of WWS myotubes is promoted not only by ribitol but also its precursor ribose. Moreover, we found that the combination of each of these metabolites with NAD+ results in a synergistic effect, as demonstrated by rescue of α-dystroglycan glycosylation and laminin binding capacity. Mechanistically, we find that FKRP residual enzymatic capacity, characteristic of many recessive FKRP mutations, is required for rescue as supported by functional and structural mutational analysis. These findings provide the rationale for testing ribose/ribitol in combination with NAD+ to treat WWS and other diseases associated with FKRP mutations.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65041</link>
	<content:encoded>The risk of developing cancer is correlated with body size and lifespan within species. Between species, however, there is no correlation between cancer and either body size or lifespan, indicating that large, long-lived species have evolved enhanced cancer protection mechanisms. Elephants and their relatives (Proboscideans) are a particularly interesting lineage for the exploration of mechanisms underlying the evolution of augmented cancer resistance because they evolved large bodies recently within a clade of smaller bodied species (Afrotherians). Here, we explore the contribution of gene duplication to body size and cancer risk in Afrotherians. Unexpectedly, we found that tumor suppressor duplication was pervasive in Afrotherian genomes, rather than restricted to Proboscideans. Proboscideans, however, have duplicates in unique pathways that may underlie some aspects of their remarkable anti-cancer cell biology. These data suggest that duplication of tumor suppressor genes facilitated the evolution of increased body size by compensating for decreasing intrinsic cancer risk.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Senescent cells, damaged cells that permanently exit the cell cycle, play important roles in development, tissue homeostasis, and tumorigenesis. Although many of these roles are beneficial in acute responses to stress and damage, the persistent accumulation of senescent cells is associated with many chronic diseases through their proinflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). SASP expression is linked to DNA damage; however, the mechanisms that control the SASP are incompletely understood. More recently, it has been shown that senescent cells shed fragments of nuclear chromatin into the cytoplasm, so called cytoplasmic chromatin fragments (CCF). Here, we provide an overview of the current evidence linking DNA damage to the SASP through the formation of CCF. We describe mechanisms of CCF generation and their functional role in senescent cells, with emphasis on therapeutic potential.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: DNA damage—how and why we age?</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/62852</link>
	<content:encoded>Aging is a complex process that results in loss of the ability to reattain homeostasis following stress, leading, thereby, to increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Many factors contribute to aging, such as the time-dependent accumulation of macromolecular damage, including DNA damage. The integrity of the nuclear genome is essential for cellular, tissue, and organismal health. DNA damage is a constant threat because nucleic acids are chemically unstable under physiological conditions and vulnerable to attack by endogenous and environmental factors. To combat this, all organisms possess highly conserved mechanisms to detect and repair DNA damage. Persistent DNA damage (genotoxic stress) triggers signaling cascades that drive cells into apoptosis or senescence to avoid replicating a damaged genome. The drawback is that these cancer avoidance mechanisms promote aging. Here, we review evidence that DNA damage plays a causal role in aging. We also provide evidence that genotoxic stress is linked to other cellular processes implicated as drivers of aging, including mitochondrial and metabolic dysfunction, altered proteostasis and inflammation. These links between damage to the genetic code and other pillars of aging support the notion that DNA damage could be the root of aging.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/62501</link>
	<content:encoded>Insights into the conformational organization and dynamics of proteins complexes at membranes is essential for our mechanistic understanding of numerous key biological processes. Here, we introduce graphene-induced energy transfer (GIET) to probe axial orientation of arrested macromolecules at lipid monolayers. Based on a calibrated distance-dependent efficiency within a dynamic range of 25 nm, we analyzed the conformational organization of proteins and complexes involved in tethering and fusion at the lysosome-like yeast vacuole. We observed that the membrane-anchored Rab7-like GTPase Ypt7 shows conformational reorganization upon interactions with effector proteins. Ensemble and time-resolved single-molecule GIET experiments revealed that the HOPS tethering complex, when recruited via Ypt7 to membranes, is dynamically alternating between a ‘closed’ and an ‘open’ conformation, with the latter possibly interacting with incoming vesicles. Our work highlights GIET as a unique spectroscopic ruler to reveal the axial orientation and dynamics of macromolecular complexes at biological membranes with sub-nanometer resolution.</content:encoded>

Abstract
A recent randomized controlled trial in young patients with long‐term post‐concussion symptoms showed that a novel behavioral intervention “Get going After concussIoN” is superior to enhanced usual care in terms of symptom reduction. It is unknown whether these interventional effects are associated with microstructural brain changes. The aim of this study was to examine whether diffusion‐weighted MRI indices, which are sensitive to the interactions between cellular structures and water molecules' Brownian motion, respond differently to the interventions of the above‐mentioned trial and whether such differences correlate with the improvement of post‐concussion symptoms. Twenty‐three patients from the intervention group (mean age 22.8, 18 females) and 19 patients from the control group (enhanced usual care) (mean age 23.9, 14 females) were enrolled. The primary outcome measure was the mean kurtosis tensor, which is sensitive to the microscopic complexity of brain tissue. The mean kurtosis tensor was significantly increased in the intervention group (p = 0.003) in the corpus callosum but not in the thalamus (p = 0.78) and the hippocampus (p = 0.34). An increase in mean kurtosis tensor in the corpus callosum tended to be associated with a reduction in symptoms, but this association did not reach significance (p = 0.059). Changes in diffusion tensor imaging metrics did not differ between intervention groups and were not associated with symptoms. The current study found different diffusion‐weighted MRI responses from the microscopic cellular structures of the corpus callosum between patients receiving a novel behavioral intervention and patients receiving enhanced usual care. Correlations with improvement of post‐concussion symptoms were not evident.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>iTBS has a stronger decision promoting effect than 20 Hz, which can be used as an effective way to alter choice and presents an improvement on standard rTMS protocols.

Abstract
Traditional repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation can only produce a significant but weak effect on the cortex while theta burst stimulation (TBS), a patterned accelerated form of stimulation, can produce a stronger poststimulation effect, which may improve decision‐making abilities. We designed a comparative assessment of the effect of intermittent TBS (iTBS), 20 Hz, in two risk decision‐making tasks on healthy controls. Participants were randomized and assigned to the iTBS (n = 29), 20 Hz (n = 29), or sham (n = 29) groups. The effects of the different methods of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex stimulation on risk decision‐making functions were compared based on subjects’ performance in the Game of Dice Task (GDT) and Risky Gains Task (RGT). The main indicators were positive and negative feedback utilization rates of GDT and RGT. Both iTBS and 20 Hz stimulation resulted in significant improvements upon negative feedback in the GDT, with increases in safe options and reductions in risky options; iTBS stimulation increased subjects’ use of positive feedback in the GDT and RGT (all p &amp;lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the iTBS group had a stronger feedback risk reduction effect than the 20 Hz or sham group following RGT negative feedback (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Individuals would integrate positive and negative information more efficiently, leading to them making rational choices after excitatory transcranial magnetic stimulation. Moreover, iTBS has a stronger risk reduction effect following negative feedback than the 20Hz stimulation did. In summary, iTBS might have clinical value in decision promotion.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Axonal mitochondria adjust in size depending on g‐ratio of surrounding myelin during homeostasis and advanced remyelination</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24767?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Axonal mitochondrial size correlates with g‐ratio during homeostasis in multiple species and during advanced remyelination. But not during early remyelination. Oligodendrocyte mitochondria function influence myelin thickness which influence axonal mitochondria size.

Abstract
Demyelinating pathology is common in many neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis, stroke, and Alzheimer's disease and results in axonal energy deficiency, dysfunctional axonal propagation, and neurodegeneration. During myelin repair and also during myelin homeostasis, mutual regulative processes between axons and myelin sheaths are known to be essential. However, proficient tools are lacking to characterize axon‐myelin interdependence during (re)myelination. Thus, we herein investigated adaptions in myelin sheath g‐ratio as a proxy for myelin thickness and axon metabolic status during homeostasis and myelin repair, by using axonal mitochondrial size as a proxy for axonal metabolic status. We found that axons with thinner myelin sheaths had larger axonal mitochondria; this was true for across different central nervous system tracts as well as across species, including humans. The link between myelin sheath thickness and mitochondrial size was temporarily absent during demyelination but reestablished during advanced remyelination, as shown in two commonly used animal models of toxic demyelination. By further exploring this association in mice with either genetically induced mitochondrial or myelin dysfunction, we show that axonal mitochondrial size adjusts in response to the thickness of the myelin sheath but not vice versa. This pinpoints the relevance of mitochondrial adaptation upon myelin repair and might open a new therapeutic window for remyelinating therapies.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Endocannabinoids regulate cerebellar GABAergic transmission in a synapse type‐dependent manner</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24765?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Endocannabinoids (eCBs) elicit inhibitory modulation of synaptic transmission at various brain sites. We now show that neither a CB1/CB2 receptor agonist WIN55212 nor an eCB affect GABA release from axon terminals of cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) making synaptic contacts with their target neurons, globular cells in the cerebellar cortex and principal neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei. The finding is in sharp contrast to the fact that PCs receive abundant excitatory and inhibitory inputs that are under eCB‐mediated presynaptic modulation, suggesting that the synapse type‐selective action of eCBs in the cerebellar neural circuitry allows the precise control of motor coordination and learning associated with the cerebellum.

Abstract
Endocannabinoids (eCBs) act as ubiquitous modulators of synaptic transmission via the activation of cannabinoid receptors (CBRs). Cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) make strong inhibitory synaptic contacts not only with neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) but also with Lugaro cells and globular cells, whose cell bodies are located underneath the PC layer. However, little is known about the modulatory actions of eCBs on GABA release from PC axon terminals. Here, we examined the effects of eCBs on the GABAergic transmission at PC‐globular cell synapses and PC‐large DCN neuron synapses electrophysiologically using mouse cerebellar slices. We showed that the types 1 and 2 CBR agonist WIN55212 did not affect either spontaneous or miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in globular cells under control conditions and in a state of enhanced synaptic activity. By contrast, another Gi/o protein‐coupled receptor agonist, baclofen, significantly reduced the miniature IPSC frequency in globular cells. WIN55212 had no effects on IPSCs in large DCN neurons. A type 2 CBR agonist, HU308, also had no effects on IPSCs in either globular cells or large DCN neurons. Moreover, the PCs' target neurons did not elicit depolarization‐induced suppression of inhibition. These results suggest the lack of a functional role of CBRs at PCs' axon terminals. This is in sharp contrast to the fact that PCs receive abundant excitatory and inhibitory inputs that are under eCB‐mediated presynaptic inhibitory modulation. The actions of eCBs are selective to distinct synapses and possibly contribute to information processes and rigorous signal transmission in the cerebellum.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Increased brain plasmin levels following experimental ischemic stroke in male mice</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24764?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Following permanent right middle cerebral artery occlusion, we measured plasmin activity in mouse brain slices utilizing a novel direct method. Positive correlation between plasmin level and infarct volume was found and demonstrated by a representative tetrazolium chloride staining of slice no. 6. Scale bars: 1 mm.

Abstract
Many coagulation factor proteases are increased in the brain during ischemic stroke. One of these proteases is plasmin. In this study we established a novel method for direct quantitative measurement of plasmin activity in male mouse brain slices using a sensitive fluorescent substrate in the presence of specific protease inhibitors. In both the ischemic and contralateral hemispheres, plasmin activity increased 3, 6, and 24 hr following stroke in comparison to healthy mice (F(3, 72) = 39.5, p &amp;lt; 0.0001, repeated measures ANOVA) after the induction of permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (PMCAo). Plasmin activity was higher in the ischemic hemisphere (F(1,36) = 9.1, p = 0.005) and there was a significant interaction between time and ischemic hemisphere (F(3,36) = 4.4, p = 0.009). Plasmin activity was correlated with infarct volume (R2 = 0.5289, p = 0.0009 by Spearman). The specificity of the assay was verified utilizing tissue‐type plasminogen activator (tPA)‐deficient mice which, as expected, had significantly lower levels of plasmin 24 hr following ischemia compared to wild‐type mice (ischemic (0.6 ± 0.23 and 1.94 ± 0.5, respectively), p = 0.049 and contralateral hemispheres (0.13 ± 0.14 and 0.75 ± 0.10, respectively), p = 0.018 by t test). There is a time‐dependent increase in plasmin levels and an association of higher levels of plasmin with larger infarct volumes in an experimental stroke model. This suggests caution in the use of recombinant tPA (rtPA) and that plasmin inhibition in the brain may be a therapeutic target in acute ischemic stroke.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>We find that the levels of the m6A methylase Mettl3 are upregulated following spinal cord injury (SCI) in both zebrafish and mice. Additionally, Mettl3 disruption leads to poor motor function recovery in zebrafish SCI.

Abstract
RNA methylation is involved in multiple physiological and pathological processes. However, the role of RNA methylation in spinal cord regeneration has not been reported. In this study, we find an altered m6A (N6‐methyladenosine) RNA methylation profiling following zebrafish spinal cord injury (SCI), in line with an altered transcription level of the m6A methylase Mettl3. Interestingly, many of the differential m6A‐tagged genes associated with neural regeneration are hypomethylated, but their transcription levels are upregulated in SCI. Moreover, we find that METTL3 may be important for spinal cord regeneration. We also show a conserved feature of METTL3 changes in mouse SCI model, in which the expression of METTL3 is increased in both astrocytes and neural stem cells. Together, our results indicate that m6A RNA methylation is dynamic and conserved following SCI and may contribute to spinal cord regeneration.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Graph theory analysis of the dopamine D2 receptor network in Parkinson’s disease patients with cognitive decline</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24760?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Graph theory analysis can be used to detect subtle changes in brain networks that may be missed by regional comparisons. The present study found evidence that compensatory network reorganization likely occurs in a frontal dopamine D2 receptor network to preserve cognitive function in Parkinson's disease patients without cognitive impairment. 

Abstract
Cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common sequela of the disorder that has a large impact on patient well‐being. Its physiological etiology, however, remains elusive. Our study used graph theory analysis to investigate the large‐scale topological patterns of the extrastriatal dopamine D2 receptor network. We used positron emission tomography with [11C]FLB‐457 to measure the binding potential of cortical dopamine D2 receptors in two networks: the meso‐cortical dopamine network and the meso‐limbic dopamine network. We also investigated the application of partial volume effect correction (PVEC) in conjunction with graph theory analysis. Three groups were investigated in this study divided according to their cognitive status as measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment score, with a score ≤25 considered cognitively impaired: (a) healthy controls (n = 13, 11 female), (b) cognitively unimpaired PD patients (PD‐CU, n = 13, 5 female), and (c) PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD‐MCI, n = 17, 4 female). In the meso‐cortical network, we observed increased small‐worldness, normalized clustering, and local efficiency in the PD‐CU group compared to the PD‐MCI group, as well as a hub shift in the PD‐MCI group. Compensatory reorganization of the meso‐cortical dopamine D2 receptor network may be responsible for some of the cognitive preservation observed in PD‐CU. These results were found without PVEC applied and PVEC proved detrimental to the graph theory analysis. Overall, our findings demonstrate how graph theory analysis can be used to detect subtle changes in the brain that would otherwise be missed by regional comparisons of receptor density.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24759?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), glutamate aspartate transporter (GLAST), glutamine synthetase (GS), ALDH1L1, and SOX9 stained different percentages of cortical and spinal cord astrocytes in vitro. SOX9 in cortical and ALDH1L1 in spinal cord cultures consistently stained astrocytes in naïve and transforming growth factor‐β‐treated cultures.

Abstract
Astrocytes are responsible for a wide variety of essential functions throughout the central nervous system. The protein markers glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), glutamate aspartate transporter (GLAST), glutamate transporter‐1 (GLT‐1), glutamine synthetase (GS), 10‐formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (ALDH1L1), and the transcription factor SOX9 are routinely used to label astrocytes in primary rodent cultures. However, GLAST, GLT‐1, GS, and SOX9 are also produced by microglia and oligodendrocytes and GFAP, GLAST, GLT‐1, and GS production levels are affected by astrocyte phenotypic changes associated with reactive astrogliosis. No group has performed a comprehensive immunocytochemical evaluation to quantify the percentage of cells labeled by these markers in vitro, nor compared changes in staining between cortex‐ and spinal cord‐derived cells in naïve and stimulated cultures. Here, we quantified the percentage of cells positively stained for these six markers in astrocyte, microglia, and oligodendrocyte cultures isolated from neonatal rat cortices and spinal cords. Additionally, we incubated the astrocytes with transforming growth factor (TGF)‐β1 or TGF‐β3 to determine if the labeling of these markers is altered by these stimuli. We found that only SOX9 in cortical cultures and ALDH1L1 in spinal cord cultures labeled more than 75% of the cells in naïve and stimulated astrocyte cultures and stained less than 5% of the cells in microglia and oligodendrocyte cultures. Furthermore, significantly more cortical than spinal cord astrocytes stained for GFAP, GLAST, and ALDH1L1 in naïve cultures, whereas significantly more spinal cord than cortical astrocytes stained for GLAST and GS in TGF‐β1‐treated cultures. These findings are important as variability in marker staining may lead to misinterpretation of the astrocyte response in cocultures, migration assays, or engineered disease models.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Illumination of nonmyelinating corneal Schwann cells (nm‐cSCs) of the transparent and avascular cornea. (a) Outline of experimental procedures for the endothelial cell‐depleted central corneal cell preparation for scRNA‐seq analysis from rabbit. (b) Major corneal cell populations were identified by unsupervised clustering, with the nm‐cSCs being represented by the purple colored dots. Each dot represents a single cell that was designated by color of the cluster. Dickkopf‐related protein 1 (DKK1) is one of the novel cornea‐specific SC targets identified and cross‐species validated in mouse corneas. The proteolipid protein 1 promoter‐enhanced green fluorescent protein (Plp1‐eGFP) reporter mouse cornea was immunostained for DKK1 (red), revealing its co‐localization with eGFP (green) reporter expression in SCs. (c) The image on the left shows a cartoon representation of the cornea corresponding to the immunostained images (panels on the right) from the central cornea (dotted circle, top panel) and limbal/peripheral area (dotted rectangle, bottom panel). Detailed magnified views reveal DKK1‐positive staining in nm‐cSCs of the central cornea, as well as myelinated SCs of the peripheral cornea. Scale bars, 10 µm. 

Abstract
The cornea is the most innervated tissue in the human body. Myelinated axons upon inserting into the peripheral corneal stroma lose their myelin sheaths and continue into the central cornea wrapped by only nonmyelinating corneal Schwann cells (nm‐cSCs). This anatomical organization is believed to be important for central vision. Here we employed single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq), microscopy, and transgenics to characterize these nm‐cSCs of the central cornea. Using principal component analysis, uniform manifold approximation and projection, and unsupervised hierarchal cell clustering of scRNA‐seq data derived from central corneal cells of male rabbits, we successfully identified several clusters representing different corneal cell types, including a unique cell cluster representing nm‐cSCs. To confirm protein expression of cSC genes, we performed cross‐species validation, employing corneal whole‐mount immunostaining with confocal microscopy in mouse corneas. The expression of several representative proteins of nm‐cSCs were validated. As the proteolipid protein 1 (PLP1) gene was also expressed in nm‐cSCs, we explored the Plp1‐eGFP transgenic reporter mouse line to visualize cSCs. Specific and efficient eGFP expression was observed in cSCs in adult mice of different ages. Of several putative cornea‐specific SC genes identified, Dickkopf‐related protein 1 was shown to be present in nm‐cSCs. Taken together, our findings, for the first time, identify important insights and tools toward the study nm‐cSCs in isolated tissue and adult animals. We expect that our results will advance the future study of nm‐cSCs in applications of nerve repair, and provide a resource for the study of corneal sensory function.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Neuron‐specific cilia loss differentially alters locomotor responses to amphetamine in mice</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24755?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>All neurons possess a primary cilium that projects from the cell body into the extracellular space. This study investigates the behavioral responses of mice engineered to lack a primary cilium on either Gad2 expressing GABAergic neurons, or Dopaminergic neurons, to injections of amphetamine.

Abstract
The neural mechanisms that underlie responses to drugs of abuse are complex, and impacted by a number of neuromodulatory peptides. Within the past 10 years it has been discovered that several of the receptors for neuromodulators are enriched in the primary cilia of neurons. Primary cilia are microtubule‐based organelles that project from the surface of nearly all mammalian cells, including neurons. Despite what we know about cilia, our understanding of how cilia regulate neuronal function and behavior is still limited. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the contributions of primary cilia on specific neuronal populations to behavioral responses to amphetamine. To test the consequences of cilia loss on amphetamine‐induced locomotor activity we selectively ablated cilia from dopaminergic or GAD2‐GABAergic neurons in mice. Cilia loss had no effect on baseline locomotion in either mouse strain. In mice lacking cilia on dopaminergic neurons, locomotor activity compared to wild‐ type mice was reduced in both sexes in response to acute administration of 3.0 mg/kg amphetamine. In contrast, changes in the locomotor response to amphetamine in mice lacking cilia on GAD2‐GABAergic neurons were primarily driven by reductions in locomotor activity in males. Following repeated amphetamine administration (1.0 mg kg−1 day−1 over 5 days), mice lacking cilia on GAD2‐GABAergic neurons exhibited enhanced sensitization of the locomotor stimulant response to the drug, whereas mice lacking cilia on dopaminergic neurons did not differ from wild‐type controls. These results indicate that cilia play neuron‐specific roles in both acute and neuroplastic responses to psychostimulant drugs of abuse.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24752?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Without protective and/or therapeutic agents the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection known as coronavirus disease 2019 is quickly spreading worldwide. It has surprising transmissibility potential, since it could infect all ages, gender, and human sectors. It attacks respiratory, gastrointestinal, urinary, hepatic, and endovascular systems and can reach the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS) through known and unknown mechanisms. The reports on the neurological manifestations and complications of the SARS‐CoV‐2 infection are increasing exponentially. Herein, we enumerate seven candidate routes, which the mature or immature SARS‐CoV‐2 components could use to reach the CNS and PNS, utilizing the within‐body cross talk between organs. The majority of SARS‐CoV‐2–infected patients suffer from some neurological manifestations (e.g., confusion, anosmia, and ageusia). It seems that although the mature virus did not reach the CNS or PNS of the majority of patients, its unassembled components and/or the accompanying immune‐mediated responses may be responsible for the observed neurological symptoms. The viral particles and/or its components have been specifically documented in endothelial cells of lung, kidney, skin, and CNS. This means that the blood–endothelial barrier may be considered as the main route for SARS‐CoV‐2 entry into the nervous system, with the barrier disruption being more logical than barrier permeability, as evidenced by postmortem analyses.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24751?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Preterm birth is a global public health problem. A large number of preterm infants survive with preterm white matter injury (PWMI), which leads to neurological deficits, and has multifaceted etiology, clinical course, monitoring, and outcomes. The principal upstream insults leading to PWMI initiation are hypoxia‐ischemia and infection and/or inflammation and the key target cells are late oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Current PWMI treatments are mainly supportive, and thus have little effect in terms of protecting the immature brain or repairing injury to improve long‐term outcomes. Umbilical cord blood (UCB) cells comprise abundant immunomodulatory and stem cells, which have the potential to reduce brain injury, mainly due to anti‐inflammatory and immunomodulatory mechanisms, and also through their release of neurotrophic or growth factors to promote endogenous neurogenesis. In this review, we briefly summarize PWMI pathogenesis and pathophysiology, and the specific properties of different cell types in UCB. We further explore the potential mechanism by which UCB can be used to treat PWMI, and discuss the advantages of and potential issues related to UCB cell therapy. Finally, we suggest potential future studies of UCB cell therapy in preterm infants.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>By using targeted metabolomics methods, the differential metabolites of hippocampal tissues of triple transgenic Alzheimer's disease male mice and wild‐type mice at an early age and the pathogenesis associated with these metabolites were obtained.

Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a serious neurodegenerative disease in people of age 65 or above. The detailed etiology and pathogenesis of AD have not been elucidated yet. In this study, the hippocampi of 2‐ and 6‐month‐old triple transgenic Alzheimer's disease male mice and age–sex‐matched wild‐type (WT) mice were analyzed by using targeted metabolomics approach. Compared with WT mice, 24 and 60 metabolites were found with significant differences in 2‐ and 6‐month‐old AD mice. Among these, 14 metabolites were found common while 10 metabolites showed consistent variable trends in both groups. These differential metabolites are found associated with amino acid, lipid, vitamin, nucleotide‐related base, neurotransmitter and energy metabolisms, and oxidative stress. The results suggest that these differential metabolites might play a critical role in AD pathophysiology, and may serve as potential biomarkers for AD. Moreover, the results highlight the involvement of abnormal purine, pyrimidine, arginine, and proline metabolism, along with glycerophospholipid metabolism in early pathology of AD. For the first time, several differential metabolites are found to be associated with AD in this study. Targeted metabolomics can be used for rapid and accurate quantitative analysis of specific target metabolites associated with AD.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Activation of TRPV4 inhibited IK through activating CaMKII in hippocampal pyramidal neurons and decreased the expression of Kv1.2 and Kv2.1 in hippocampi.

TRPV4‐induced decrease of Kv1.2 and Kv2.1 expression and IK may be involved in the pathological changes following PISE.










Abstract
Activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) can increase hippocampal neuronal excitability. TRPV4 has been reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. Voltage‐gated potassium channels (VGPCs) play an important role in regulating neuronal excitability and abnormal VGPCs expression or function is related to epilepsy. Here, we examined the effect of TRPV4 activation on the delayed rectifier potassium current (IK) in hippocampal pyramidal neurons and on the Kv subunits expression in male mice. We also explored the role of TRPV4 in changes in Kv subunits expression in male mice following pilocarpine‐induced status epilepticus (PISE). Application of TRPV4 agonists, GSK1016790A and 5,6‐EET, markedly reduced IK in hippocampal pyramidal neurons and shifted the voltage‐dependent inactivation curve to the hyperpolarizing direction. GSK1016790A‐ and 5,6‐EET‐induced inhibition of IK was blocked by TRPV4 specific antagonists, HC‐067047 and RN1734. GSK1016790A‐induced inhibition of IK was markedly attenuated by calcium/calmodulin‐dependent kinase II (CaMKII) antagonist. Application of GSK1016790A for up to 1 hr did not change the hippocampal protein levels of Kv1.1, Kv1.2, or Kv2.1. Intracerebroventricular injection of GSK1016790A for 3 d reduced the hippocampal protein levels of Kv1.2 and Kv2.1, leaving that of Kv1.1 unchanged. Kv1.2 and Kv2.1 protein levels as well as IK reduced markedly in hippocampi on day 3 post PISE, which was significantly reversed by HC‐067047. We conclude that activation of TRPV4 inhibits IK in hippocampal pyramidal neurons, possibly by activating CaMKII. TRPV4‐induced decrease in Kv1.2 and Kv2.1 expression and IK may be involved in the pathological changes following PISE.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Standard phase lag index (standard‐PLI) and offset‐PLI (insensitive and sensitive to zero‐lag connectivity, respectively) for pairs of electrodes separated by more than 105 mm plotted against their homotopic distance. Significant connectivity (dots above the red‐dashed line) is found only between homotopic regions and mostly for zero‐lag connectivity (offset‐PLI).

Abstract
Whether neuronal populations exhibit zero‐lag (in‐phase or in‐antiphase) functional connectivity is a fundamental question when conceptualizing communication between cell assemblies. It also has profound implications on how we assess such interactions. Given that the brain is a delayed network due to the finite conduction velocity of the electrical impulses traveling across its fibers, the existence of long‐distance zero‐lag functional connectivity may be considered improbable. However, in this study, using human intracranial recordings we demonstrate that most interhemispheric connectivity between homotopic cerebral regions is zero‐lagged and that this type of connectivity is ubiquitous. Volume conduction can be safely discarded as a confounding factor since it is known to drop almost completely within short interelectrode distances (&amp;lt;20 mm) in intracranial recordings. This finding should guide future electrophysiological connectivity studies and highlight the importance of considering the role of zero‐lag connectivity in our understanding of communication between cell assemblies.</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Evaluation of Adult Neurology Residency Program Websites</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26016?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Neurology residency program websites often serve as the initial face of a program for prospective residents early in the application process. We evaluated adult neurology residency program websites to determine their comprehensiveness to identify areas for improvement.


Methods
A list of adult neurology residency programs in the United States was compiled using information on the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) and Fellowship and Residency Electronic Interactive Database (FREIDA) websites. A total of 24 website criteria covering educational, recruitment, and compensation content were assessed for comprehensiveness. Programs’ website comprehensiveness was compared based on geographic location, program affiliation (community and/or academic), program size, and program/hospital Doximity and U.S. News &amp;amp; World Report rankings.


Results
A total of 153 US adult neurology residency program websites were evaluated. Fewer than one‐half of program websites were accessible with a direct link from either FREIDA or ERAS. The number of residency program websites reporting each content criterion varied greatly. Mean percentage of overall website comprehensiveness among neurology residency programs was 65.9%. Northeast location, academic affiliation, larger programs, and top‐ranked programs on Doximity were associated with greater program website comprehensiveness.


Interpretation
There is opportunity for all neurology residency programs to improve their websites to provide prospective applicants with a more informed and comprehensive perspective of programs during the application process. ANN NEUROL 2021</content:encoded>

Ventroposterior medialis parvocellularis (VPMP) nucleus of the primate thalamus receives direct input from the nucleus of the solitary tract, whereas the homologous thalamic structure in the rodent does not. To reveal whether the synaptic circuitries in these nuclei lend evidence for conservation of design principles in the taste thalamus across species or across sensory thalamus in general, we characterized the ultrastructural and molecular properties of the VPMP in a close relative of primates, the tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri), and compared these to known properties of the taste thalamus in rodent, and the visual thalamus in mammals. Electron microscopy analysis to categorize the synaptic inputs in the VPMP revealed that the largest‐size terminals contained many vesicles and formed large synaptic zones with thick postsynaptic density on multiple, medium‐caliber dendrite segments. Some formed triads within glomerular arrangements. Smaller‐sized terminals contained dark mitochondria; most formed a single asymmetric or symmetric synapse on small‐diameter dendrites. Immuno‐EM experiments revealed that the large‐size terminals contained VGLUT2, whereas the small‐size terminal populations contained VGLUT1 or ChAT. These findings provide evidence that the morphological and molecular characteristics of synaptic circuitry in the tree shrew VPMP are similar to that in nonchemical sensory thalamic nuclei. Furthermore, the results indicate that all primary sensory nuclei of the thalamus in higher mammals share a structural template for processing thalamocortical sensory information. In contrast, substantial morphological and molecular differences in rodent versus tree shrew taste nuclei suggest a fundamental divergence in cellular processing mechanisms of taste input in these two species.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: A selective role for the mPFC during choice and deliberation, but not spatial memory retention over short delays</title>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
Important interactions between memory and decision‐making processes are required to maintain high‐levels of spatial working memory task performance. Past research reveals that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus (HPC) are both vital structures involved in these processes. Recent evidence suggests that interactions between these two structures are dynamic and task dependent. However, there exists uncertainty surrounding the specific conditions that recruit mPFC contributions to these tasks, specifically regarding its role in retaining information online during delay periods. To address this issue, we tested rats on a spatial‐delayed alternation task in which we utilized a closed‐loop optogenetic system to transiently disrupt mPFC activity during different task epochs (delay, choice, return). By analyzing the effects of mPFC disruption on choice accuracy and a deliberative behavior known as vicarious‐trial‐and‐error (VTE), our study revealed several interesting findings regarding the role of the mPFC in spatial‐working memory tasks. The main findings include: (a) choice accuracy in the spatial‐delayed alternation (SDA) task was impaired when the mPFC was disrupted during the choice epoch and not delay or return epochs, (b) mPFC disruption resulted in a non‐epoch specific reduction in VTE occurrence which correlated with impairments in task performance. Taken together, findings from this study suggest that, during spatial decision‐making, contributions made by the mPFC are specific to points of deliberation and choice (not delay), and that VTEs are a deliberative behavior which relies on intact mPFC function.</content:encoded>

Computational methods for protein structure modelling are routinely used to complement experimental structure determination, thus they help to address a broad spectrum of scientific questions in biomedical research. The most accurate methods today are based on homology modelling, i.e. detecting a homologue to the desired target sequence that can be used as a template for modelling. Here we present a versatile open source homology modelling toolbox as foundation for flexible and computationally efficient modelling workflows. ProMod3 is a fully scriptable software platform that can perform all steps required to generate a protein model by homology. Its modular design aims at fast prototyping of novel algorithms and implementing flexible modelling pipelines. Common modelling tasks, such as loop modelling, sidechain modelling or generating a full protein model by homology, are provided as production ready pipelines, forming the starting point for own developments and enhancements. ProMod3 is the central software component of the widely used SWISS-MODEL web-server.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/97Mrsj-avHY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Departures of normal blood flow and metabolite distribution from the cerebral microvasculature into neuronal tissue have been implicated with age-related neurodegeneration. Mathematical models informed by spatially and temporally distributed neuroimage data are becoming instrumental for reconstructing a coherent picture of normal and pathological oxygen delivery throughout the brain. Unfortunately, current mathematical models of cerebral blood flow and oxygen exchange become excessively large in size. They further suffer from boundary effects due to incomplete or physiologically inaccurate computational domains, numerical instabilities due to enormous length scale differences, and convergence problems associated with condition number deterioration at fine mesh resolutions. Our proposed simple finite volume discretization scheme for blood and oxygen microperfusion simulations does not require expensive mesh generation leading to the critical benefit that it drastically reduces matrix size and bandwidth of the coupled oxygen transfer problem. The compact problem formulation yields rapid and stable convergence. Moreover, boundary effects can effectively be suppressed by generating very large replica of the cortical microcirculation &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; using an image-based cerebrovascular network synthesis algorithm, so that boundaries of the perfusion simulations are far removed from the regions of interest. Massive simulations over sizeable portions of the cortex with feature resolution down to the micron scale become tractable with even modest computer resources. The feasibility and accuracy of the novel method is demonstrated and validated with &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; oxygen perfusion data in cohorts of young and aged mice. Our oxygen exchange simulations quantify steep gradients near penetrating blood vessels and point towards pathological changes that might cause neurodegeneration in aged brains. This research aims to explain mechanistic interactions between anatomical structures and how they might change in diseases or with age. Rigorous quantification of age-related changes is of significant interest because it might aide in the search for imaging biomarkers for dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/64hQmuiH4h0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; calcium imaging through microendoscopic lenses enables imaging of neuronal populations deep within the brains of freely moving animals. Previously, a constrained matrix factorization approach (CNMF-E) has been suggested to extract single-neuronal activity from microendoscopic data. However, this approach relies on offline batch processing of the entire video data and is demanding both in terms of computing and memory requirements. These drawbacks prevent its applicability to the analysis of large datasets and closed-loop experimental settings. Here we address both issues by introducing two different online algorithms for extracting neuronal activity from streaming microendoscopic data. Our first algorithm, OnACID-E, presents an online adaptation of the CNMF-E algorithm, which dramatically reduces its memory and computation requirements. Our second algorithm proposes a convolution-based background model for microendoscopic data that enables even faster (real time) processing. Our approach is modular and can be combined with existing online motion artifact correction and activity deconvolution methods to provide a highly scalable pipeline for microendoscopic data analysis. We apply our algorithms on four previously published typical experimental datasets and show that they yield similar high-quality results as the popular offline approach, but outperform it with regard to computing time and memory requirements. They can be used instead of CNMF-E to process pre-recorded data with boosted speeds and dramatically reduced memory requirements. Further, they newly enable online analysis of live-streaming data even on a laptop.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MbzP7cZysSc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Predicting synchronous firing of large neural populations from sequential recordings</title>

A major goal in neuroscience is to understand how populations of neurons code for stimuli or actions. While the number of neurons that can be recorded simultaneously is increasing at a fast pace, in most cases these recordings cannot access a complete population: some neurons that carry relevant information remain unrecorded. In particular, it is hard to simultaneously record all the neurons of the same type in a given area. Recent progress have made possible to profile each recorded neuron in a given area thanks to genetic and physiological tools, and to pool together recordings from neurons of the same type across different experimental sessions. However, it is unclear how to infer the activity of a full population of neurons of the same type from these sequential recordings. Neural networks exhibit collective behaviour, e.g. noise correlations and synchronous activity, that are not directly captured by a conditionally-independent model that would just put together the spike trains from sequential recordings. Here we show that we can infer the activity of a full population of retina ganglion cells from sequential recordings, using a novel method based on copula distributions and maximum entropy modeling. From just the spiking response of each ganglion cell to a repeated stimulus, and a few pairwise recordings, we could predict the noise correlations using copulas, and then the full activity of a large population of ganglion cells of the same type using maximum entropy modeling. Remarkably, we could generalize to predict the population responses to different stimuli with similar light conditions and even to different experiments. We could therefore use our method to construct a very large population merging cells’ responses from different experiments. We predicted that synchronous activity in ganglion cell populations saturates only for patches larger than 1.5mm in radius, beyond what is today experimentally accessible.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7wrZDCq4TQs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Tools from the field of graph signal processing, in particular the graph Laplacian operator, have recently been successfully applied to the investigation of structure-function relationships in the human brain. The eigenvectors of the human connectome graph Laplacian, dubbed “connectome harmonics”, have been shown to relate to the functionally relevant resting-state networks. Whole-brain modelling of brain activity combines structural connectivity with local dynamical models to provide insight into the large-scale functional organization of the human brain. In this study, we employ the graph Laplacian and its properties to define and implement a large class of neural activity models directly on the human connectome. These models, consisting of systems of stochastic integrodifferential equations on graphs, are dubbed &lt;i&gt;graph neural fields&lt;/i&gt;, in analogy with the well-established continuous neural fields. We obtain analytic predictions for harmonic and temporal power spectra, as well as functional connectivity and coherence matrices, of graph neural fields, with a technique dubbed CHAOSS (shorthand for &lt;i&gt;Connectome-Harmonic Analysis Of Spatiotemporal Spectra&lt;/i&gt;). Combining graph neural fields with appropriate observation models allows for estimating model parameters from experimental data as obtained from electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). As an example application, we study a stochastic Wilson-Cowan graph neural field model on a high-resolution connectome graph constructed from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and structural MRI data. We show that the model equilibrium fluctuations can reproduce the empirically observed harmonic power spectrum of resting-state fMRI data, and predict its functional connectivity, with a high level of detail. Graph neural fields natively allow the inclusion of important features of cortical anatomy and fast computations of observable quantities for comparison with multimodal empirical data. They thus appear particularly suitable for modelling whole-brain activity at mesoscopic scales, and opening new potential avenues for connectome-graph-based investigations of structure-function relationships.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_L_aix2QVJg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Dissecting the regulatory roles of ORM proteins in the sphingolipid pathway of plants</title>

Sphingolipids are a vital component of plant cellular endomembranes and carry out multiple functional and regulatory roles. Different sphingolipid species confer rigidity to the membrane structure, facilitate trafficking of secretory proteins, and initiate programmed cell death. Although the regulation of the sphingolipid pathway is yet to be uncovered, increasing evidence has pointed to orosomucoid proteins (ORMs) playing a major regulatory role and potentially interacting with a number of components in the pathway, including both enzymes and sphingolipids. However, experimental exploration of new regulatory interactions is time consuming and often infeasible. In this work, a computational approach was taken to address this challenge. A metabolic network of the sphingolipid pathway in plants was reconstructed. The steady-state rates of reactions in the network were then determined through measurements of growth and cellular composition of the different sphingolipids in Arabidopsis seedlings. The Ensemble modeling framework was modified to accurately account for activation mechanisms and subsequently used to generate sets of kinetic parameters that converge to the measured steady-state fluxes in a thermodynamically consistent manner. In addition, the framework was appended with an additional module to automate screening the parameters and to output models consistent with previously reported network responses to different perturbations. By analyzing the network’s response in the presence of different combinations of regulatory mechanisms, the model captured the experimentally observed repressive effect of ORMs on serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT). Furthermore, predictions point to a second regulatory role of ORM proteins, namely as an activator of class II (or LOH1 and LOH3) ceramide synthases. This activating role was found to be modulated by the concentration of free ceramides, where an accumulation of these sphingolipid species dampened the activating effect of ORMs on ceramide synthase. The predictions pave the way for future guided experiments and have implications in engineering crops with higher biotic stress tolerance.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tZW9gJ9j7K8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Mathematical models of metabolic networks utilize simulation to study system-level mechanisms and functions. Various approaches have been used to model the steady state behavior of metabolic networks using genome-scale reconstructions, but formulating dynamic models from such reconstructions continues to be a key challenge. Here, we present the Mass Action Stoichiometric Simulation Python (MASSpy) package, an open-source computational framework for dynamic modeling of metabolism. MASSpy utilizes mass action kinetics and detailed chemical mechanisms to build dynamic models of complex biological processes. MASSpy adds dynamic modeling tools to the COnstraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis Python (COBRApy) package to provide an unified framework for constraint-based and kinetic modeling of metabolic networks. MASSpy supports high-performance dynamic simulation through its implementation of libRoadRunner: the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) simulation engine. Three examples are provided to demonstrate how to use MASSpy: (1) a validation of the MASSpy modeling tool through dynamic simulation of detailed mechanisms of enzyme regulation; (2) a feature demonstration using a workflow for generating ensemble of kinetic models using Monte Carlo sampling to approximate missing numerical values of parameters and to quantify biological uncertainty, and (3) a case study in which MASSpy is utilized to overcome issues that arise when integrating experimental data with the computation of functional states of detailed biological mechanisms. MASSpy represents a powerful tool to address challenges that arise in dynamic modeling of metabolic networks, both at small and large scales.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/32Dat5YWkCs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Many cellular processes require cell polarization to be maintained as the cell changes shape, grows or moves. Without feedback mechanisms relaying information about cell shape to the polarity molecular machinery, the coordination between cell polarization and morphogenesis, movement or growth would not be possible. Here we theoretically and computationally study the role of a genetically-encoded mechanical feedback (in the Cell Wall Integrity pathway) as a potential coordination mechanism between cell morphogenesis and polarity during budding yeast mating projection growth. We developed a coarse-grained continuum description of the coupled dynamics of cell polarization and morphogenesis as well as 3D stochastic simulations of the molecular polarization machinery in the evolving cell shape. Both theoretical approaches show that in the absence of mechanical feedback (or in the presence of weak feedback), cell polarity cannot be maintained at the projection tip during growth, with the polarization cap wandering off the projection tip, arresting morphogenesis. In contrast, for mechanical feedback strengths above a threshold, cells can robustly maintain cell polarization at the tip and simultaneously sustain mating projection growth. These results indicate that the mechanical feedback encoded in the Cell Wall Integrity pathway can provide important positional information to the molecular machinery in the cell, thereby enabling the coordination of cell polarization and morphogenesis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5mkWl042d4s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The study of response to cancer treatments has benefited greatly from the contribution of different omics data but their interpretation is sometimes difficult. Some mathematical models based on prior biological knowledge of signaling pathways, facilitate this interpretation but often require fitting of their parameters using perturbation data. We propose a more qualitative mechanistic approach, based on logical formalism and on the sole mapping and interpretation of omics data, and able to recover differences in sensitivity to gene inhibition without model training. This approach is showcased by the study of BRAF inhibition in patients with melanomas and colorectal cancers who experience significant differences in sensitivity despite similar omics profiles.
We first gather information from literature and build a logical model summarizing the regulatory network of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway surrounding BRAF, with factors involved in the BRAF inhibition resistance mechanisms. The relevance of this model is verified by automatically assessing that it qualitatively reproduces response or resistance behaviors identified in the literature. Data from over 100 melanoma and colorectal cancer cell lines are then used to validate the model’s ability to explain differences in sensitivity. This generic model is transformed into personalized cell line-specific logical models by integrating the omics information of the cell lines as constraints of the model. The use of mutations alone allows personalized models to correlate significantly with experimental sensitivities to BRAF inhibition, both from drug and CRISPR targeting, and even better with the joint use of mutations and RNA, supporting multi-omics mechanistic models. A comparison of these untrained models with learning approaches highlights similarities in interpretation and complementarity depending on the size of the datasets.
This parsimonious pipeline, which can easily be extended to other biological questions, makes it possible to explore the mechanistic causes of the response to treatment, on an individualized basis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/s9TOALdB3dg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The United States witnessed an unprecedented politicization of biomedical science starting in 2015 that has exploded into a complex, multimodal anti-science empire operating through mass media, political elections, legislation, and even health systems. Anti-science activities now pervade the daily lives of many Americans, and threaten to infect other parts of the world. We can attribute the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans from COVID-19, measles, and other vaccine-preventable diseases to anti-science. The acceleration of anti-science activities demands not only new responses and approaches but also international coordination. Vaccines and other biomedical advances will not be sufficient to halt COVID-19 or future potentially catastrophic illnesses, unless we simultaneously counter anti-science aggression.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Vk3iDm8mdcc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Lyme disease is common in the northeastern United States, but rare in the southeast, even though the tick vector is found in both regions. Infection prevalence of Lyme spirochetes in host-seeking ticks, an important component to the risk of Lyme disease, is also high in the northeast and northern midwest, but declines sharply in the south. As ticks must acquire Lyme spirochetes from infected vertebrate hosts, the role of wildlife species composition on Lyme disease risk has been a topic of lively academic discussion. We compared tick–vertebrate host interactions using standardized sampling methods among 8 sites scattered throughout the eastern US. Geographical trends in diversity of tick hosts are gradual and do not match the sharp decline in prevalence at southern sites, but tick–host associations show a clear shift from mammals in the north to reptiles in the south. Tick infection prevalence declines north to south largely because of high tick infestation of efficient spirochete reservoir hosts (rodents and shrews) in the north but not in the south. Minimal infestation of small mammals in the south results from strong selective attachment to lizards such as skinks (which are inefficient reservoirs for Lyme spirochetes) in the southern states. Selective host choice, along with latitudinal differences in tick host-seeking behavior and variations in tick densities, explains the geographic pattern of Lyme disease in the eastern US.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/cQR89AeJ09s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Axon‐Myelin Unit Blistering as Early Event in MS Normal Appearing White Matter</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26014?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disease of unknown etiology. Although the prevalent view regards a CD4+‐lymphocyte autoimmune reaction against myelin at the root of the disease, recent studies propose autoimmunity as a secondary reaction to idiopathic brain damage. To gain knowledge about this possibility we investigated the presence of axonal and myelinic morphological alterations, which could implicate imbalance of axon‐myelin units as primary event in MS pathogenesis.


Methods
Using high resolution imaging histological brain specimens from patients with MS and non‐neurological/non‐MS controls, we explored molecular changes underpinning imbalanced interaction between axon and myelin in normal appearing white matter (NAWM), a region characterized by normal myelination and absent inflammatory activity.


Results
In MS brains, we detected blister‐like swellings formed by myelin detachment from axons, which were substantially less frequently retrieved in non‐neurological/non‐MS controls. Swellings in MS NAWM presented altered glutamate receptor expression, myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG) distribution, and lipid biochemical composition of myelin sheaths. Changes in tethering protein expression, widening of nodes of Ranvier and altered distribution of sodium channels in nodal regions of otherwise normally myelinated axons were also present in MS NAWM. Finally, we demonstrate a significant increase, compared with controls, in citrullinated proteins in myelin of MS cases, pointing toward biochemical modifications that may amplify the immunogenicity of MS myelin.


Interpretation
Collectively, the impaired interaction of myelin and axons potentially leads to myelin disintegration. Conceptually, the ensuing release of (post‐translationally modified) myelin antigens may elicit a subsequent immune attack in MS. ANN NEUROL 2021</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Identification and localization of a gonadotropin‐releasing hormone‐related neuropeptide in Biomphalaria, an intermediate host for schistosomiasis</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25099?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Histological methods were used to localize a neuropeptide related to gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone in the central nervous system and periphery of Biomphalaria glabrata, an intermediate host for intestinal schistosomiasis.







Abstract
Freshwater snails of the genus Biomphalaria serve as obligatory hosts for the digenetic trematode Schistosoma mansoni, the causative agent for the most widespread form of intestinal schistosomiasis. Within Biomphalaria, S. mansoni larvae multiply and transform into the cercariae form that can infect humans. Trematode development and proliferation is thought to be facilitated by modifications of host behavior and physiological processes, including a reduction of reproduction known as “parasitic castration.” As neuropeptides participate in the control of reproduction across phylogeny, a neural transcriptomics approach was undertaken to identify peptides that could regulate Biomphalaria reproductive physiology. The present study identified a transcript in Biomphalaria alexandrina that encodes a peptide belonging to the gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) superfamily. The precursor and the predicted mature peptide, pQIHFTPDWGNN‐NH2 (designated Biom‐GnRH), share features with peptides identified in other molluscan species, including panpulmonates, opisthobranchs, and cephalopods. An antibody generated against Biom‐GnRH labeled neurons in the cerebral, pedal, and visceral ganglia of Biomphalaria glabrata. GnRH‐like immunoreactive fiber systems projected to all central ganglia. In the periphery, immunoreactive material was detected in the ovotestis, oviduct, albumen gland, and nidamental gland. As these structures serve crucial roles in the production, transport, nourishment, and encapsulation of eggs, disruption of the GnRH system of Biomphalaria could contribute to reduced reproductive activity in infected snails.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: This study aimed to investigate how early A-waves could occur in type II diabetes, and what it implied functionally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We performed conduction velocity distribution (CVD) test in peroneal nerves of 37 type II diabetic patients with normal nerve conduction study (NCS) and 22 age-matched controls. The electrophysiological data and clinical information were analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A-waves were observed in 45.9% of diabetic patients and only in 1 person in healthy controls, all detected in the tibial nerves. The diabetic patients with A-waves showed faster conduction velocity in all quartiles in the motor peroneal nerves compared to the patients without A-waves, and their CVD histograms were shifted to the right side, consisting of a significantly larger percentage of fast conducting fibers. There was no significant difference in the CVD values of the upper extremity nerves among the patients with and without A-waves and the healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: A-waves could occur in type II diabetes as early as when NCS showed normal, and represented as a sign of neuropathy as well as a sign of rescued motor nerve function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: The Effect of Media Professionalization on Cognitive Neurodynamics During Audiovisual Cuts</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.598383</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Experts apply their experience to the proper development of their routine activities. Their acquired expertise or professionalization is expected to help in the development of those recurring tasks. Media professionals spend their daily work watching narrative contents on screens, so learning how they manage visual perception of those contents could be of interest in an increasingly audiovisual society. Media works require not only the understanding of the storytelling, but also the decoding of the formal rules and presentations. We recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) signals from 36 participants (18 media professionals and 18 non-media professionals) while they were watching audiovisual contents, and compared their eyeblink rate and their brain activity and connectivity. We found that media professionals decreased their blink rate after the cuts, suggesting that they can better manage the loss of visual information that blinks entail by sparing them when new visual information is being presented. Cuts triggered similar activation of basic brain processing in the visual cortex of the two groups, but different processing in medial and frontal cortical areas, where media professionals showed a lower activity. Effective brain connectivity occurred in a more organized way in media professionals–possibly due to a better communication between cortical areas that are coordinated for decoding new visual content after cuts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Alterations of Spinal Epidural Stimulation-Enabled Stepping by Descending Intentional Motor Commands and Proprioceptive Inputs in Humans With Spinal Cord Injury</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.590231</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Regaining control of movement following a spinal cord injury (SCI) requires utilization and/or functional reorganization of residual descending, and likely ascending, supraspinal sensorimotor pathways, which may be facilitated via task-specific training through body weight supported treadmill (BWST) training. Recently, epidural electrical stimulation (ES) combined with task-specific training demonstrated independence of standing and stepping functions in individuals with clinically complete SCI. The restoration of these functions may be dependent upon variables such as manipulation of proprioceptive input, ES parameter adjustments, and participant intent during step training. However, the impact of each variable on the degree of independence achieved during BWST stepping remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: To describe the effects of descending intentional commands and proprioceptive inputs, specifically body weight support (BWS), on lower extremity motor activity and vertical ground reaction forces (vGRF) during ES-enabled BWST stepping in humans with chronic sensorimotor complete SCI. Furthermore, we describe perceived changes in the level of assistance provided by clinicians when intent and BWS are modified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Two individuals with chronic, mid thoracic, clinically complete SCI, enrolled in an IRB and FDA (IDE G150167) approved clinical trial. A 16-contact electrode array was implanted in the epidural space between the T11-L1 vertebral regions. Lower extremity motor output and vertical ground reaction forces were obtained during clinician-assisted ES-enabled treadmill stepping with BWS. Consecutive steps were achieved during various experimentally-controlled conditions, including intentional participation and varied BWS (60% and 20%) while ES parameters remain unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: During ES-enabled BWST stepping, the knee extensors exhibited an increase in motor activation during trials in which stepping was passive compared to active or during trials in which 60% BWS was provided compared to 20% BWS. As a result of this increased motor activation, perceived clinician assistance increased during the transition from stance to swing. Intentional participation and 20% BWS resulted in timely and purposeful activation of the lower extremities muscles, which improved independence and decreased clinician assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Maximizing participant intention and optimizing proprioceptive inputs through BWS during ES-enabled BWST stepping may facilitate greater independence during BWST stepping for individuals with clinically complete SCI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration:ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02592668.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Sex Differences in Autism Spectrum Disorder: An Investigation on Core Symptoms and Psychiatric Comorbidity in Preschoolers</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.594082</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Findings regarding sex differences in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as far as core symptoms and psychiatric comorbidities (PC) are concerned, are inconsistent, inconclusive, or conflicting among studies. The lower prevalence of ASD in females than in males and the age and intelligence quotient (IQ) heterogeneity among samples made it difficult to investigate these differences. This case–control study tries to deepen the impact of sex differences on core symptoms of autism and PC in 214 preschoolers with ASD (mean age, 45.26) without impairment in non-verbal IQ (nvIQ ≥70). A total of 107 ASD females (mean age, 44.51 ± 13.79 months) were matched one by one with 107 males (mean age, 46.01 ± 13.42 months) for chronological age (±6 months) and nvIQ (±6 points). We used the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule 2 (ADOS-2) and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) 1.5–5 to explore autism severity and PC. The results highlight that ASD females did not significantly differ from ASD males regarding the severity of autism. Statistically significant lower levels of emotionally reactive (p = 0.005, η&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.04), anxious-depressed (p = 0.001, η&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.05), internalizing problems (p = 0.04, η&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.02), and DSM-Oriented Scales anxiety problems (p = 0.02, η&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.04) in ASD females than in ASD males were also detected. Our findings of no difference in the autism severity and lower internalizing problems in females than males with ASD extend the knowledge of autism in females during preschool years. Compared to other similar studies on this topic, we can state that these results are not supported by differences in nvIQ between sexes nor by the presence of cognitive impairment. It confirms the need for clinicians to consider sex differences when describing autism psychopathology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Inflammatory Diseases Among Norwegian LRRK2 Mutation Carriers. A 15-Years Follow-Up of a Cohort</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.634666</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The first families with LRRK2 related Parkinson’s disease (PD) were presented around 15 years ago and numerous papers have described the characteristics of the LRRK2 phenotype. The prevalence of autosomal dominant PD varies around the world mainly depending on local founder effects. The highest prevalence of LRRK2 G2019S PD in Norway is located to the central part of the country and most families could be traced back to common ancestors. The typical Norwegian LRRK2 phenotype is not different from classical PD and similar to that seen in most other LRRK2 families. The discovery of LRRK2 PD has allowed us to follow-up multi-incident families and to study their phenotype longitudinally. In the Norwegian LRRK2 families there has been a significantly higher incidence of inflammatory diseases like multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis that seen in other PD populations. Recent studies in LRRK2 mechanisms have indicated that this protein may be crucial in initiating disease processes. In this short survey of 100 Norwegian mutation carriers followed through more than 15 years are presented. The prevalence of inflammatory diseases among these cases is highlighted. The role of LRRK2 in the conversion process from carrier status to PD phenotype is still unknown and disease generating mechanisms important for initiating LRRK2 PD are still to be identified.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Using Muse: Rapid Mobile Assessment of Brain Performance</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.634147</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The advent of mobile electroencephalography (mEEG) has created a means for large scale collection of neural data thus affording a deeper insight into cognitive phenomena such as cognitive fatigue. Cognitive fatigue – a neural state that is associated with an increased incidence of errorful performance – is responsible for accidents on a daily basis which at times can cost human lives. To gain better insight into the neural signature of cognitive fatigue in the present study we used mEEG to examine the relationship between perceived cognitive fatigue and human-event related brain potentials (ERPs) and electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations in a sample of 1,000 people. As a secondary goal, we wanted to further demonstrate the capability of mEEG to accurately measure ERP and EEG data. To accomplish these goals, participants performed a standard visual oddball task on an Apple iPad while EEG data were recorded from a Muse EEG headband. Counter to traditional EEG studies, experimental setup and data collection was completed in less than seven minutes on average. An analysis of our EEG data revealed robust N200 and P300 ERP components and neural oscillations in the delta, theta, alpha, and beta bands. In line with previous findings we observed correlations between ERP components and EEG power and perceived cognitive fatigue. Further, we demonstrate here that a linear combination of ERP and EEG features is a significantly better predictor of perceived cognitive fatigue than any ERP or EEG feature on its own. In sum, our results provide validation of mEEG as a viable tool for research and provide further insight into the impact of cognitive fatigue on the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Test-Retest Reliability of Neural Correlates of Response Inhibition and Error Monitoring: An fMRI Study of a Stop-Signal Task</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.624911</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Response inhibition (RI) and error monitoring (EM) are important processes of adaptive goal-directed behavior, and neural correlates of these processes are being increasingly used as transdiagnostic biomarkers of risk for a range of neuropsychiatric disorders. Potential utility of these purported biomarkers relies on the assumption that individual differences in brain activation are reproducible over time; however, available data on test-retest reliability (TRR) of task-fMRI are very mixed. This study examined TRR of RI and EM-related activations using a stop signal task in young adults (n = 56, including 27 pairs of monozygotic (MZ) twins) in order to identify brain regions with high TRR and familial influences (as indicated by MZ twin correlations) and to examine factors potentially affecting reliability. We identified brain regions with good TRR of activations related to RI (inferior/middle frontal, superior parietal, and precentral gyri) and EM (insula, medial superior frontal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). No subcortical regions showed significant TRR. Regions with higher group-level activation showed higher TRR; increasing task duration improved TRR; within-session reliability was weakly related to the long-term TRR; motion negatively affected TRR, but this effect was abolished after the application of ICA-FIX, a data-driven noise removal method.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome causes a spectrum of cognitive disorders, including intellectual disability and autism. We assessed the ability of the EEG analysis algorithm Brain Network Analysis (BNA) to measure cognitive function in 15q13.3 deletion patients, and to differentiate between patient and control groups. EEG data was collected from 10 individuals with 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome (14–18 years of age), as well as 30 age-matched healthy controls, as the subjects responded to Auditory Oddball (AOB) and Go/NoGo cognitive tasks. It was determined that BNA can be used to evaluate cognitive function in 15q13.3 microdeletion patients. This analysis also significantly differentiates between patient and control groups using 5 scores, all of which are produced from ERP peaks related to late cortical components that represent higher cognitive functions of attention allocation and response inhibition (P &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Reduction in Nesfatin-1 Levels in the Cerebrospinal Fluid and Increased Nigrostriatal Degeneration Following Ventricular Administration of Anti-nesfatin-1 Antibody in Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.621173</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Nesfatin-1 is one of several brain-gut peptides that have a close relationship with the central dopaminergic system. Our previous studies have shown that nesfatin-1 is capable of protecting nigral dopaminergic neurons against 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced neurotoxicity. A recent study also revealed a reduced blood level of nesfatin-1 in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). The current study was designed to investigate whether reduced nesfatin-1 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) induces nigrostriatal system degeneration. An intra-cerebroventricular (ICV) injection technique was used to administer anti-nesfatin-1 antibody directly into the lateral ventricle of the brain. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results showed that ICV injection of anti-nesfatin-1 antibody into the lateral ventricle of the brain once daily for 2 weeks caused a significant reduction in nesfatin-1 levels in the CSF (93.1%). Treatment with anti-nesfatin-1 antibody resulted in a substantial loss (23%) of TH-positive (TH+) dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), as shown by immunofluorescence staining, a depletion in dopamine and its metabolites in the striatum detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and obvious nuclear shrinkage and mitochondrial lesions in dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc detected by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Furthermore, the results from our Western blot and ELISA experiments demonstrated that anti-nesfatin-1 antibody injection induced an upregulation of caspase-3 activation, increased the expression of p-ERK, and elevated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in the SNpc. Taken together, these observations suggest that reduced nesfatin-1 in the brain may induce nigrostriatal dopaminergic system degeneration; this effect may be mediated via mitochondrial dysfunction-related apoptosis. Our data support a role of nesfatin-1 in maintaining the normal physiological function of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Pathophysiological Changes and the Role of Notch-1 Activation After Decompression in a Compressive Spinal Cord Injury Rat Model</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.579431</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Surgical decompression is the primary treatment for cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) patients with compressive spinal cord injury (CSCI). However, the prognosis of patients with CSCI varies, and the pathophysiological changes following decompression remain poor. This study aimed to investigate the pathophysiological changes and the role of Notch-1 activation after decompression in a rat CSCI model. Surgical decompression was conducted at 1 week post-injury (wpi). DAPT was intraperitoneally injected to down-regulate Notch-1 expression. Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scores and an inclined plane test were used to evaluate the motor function recovery. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed to assess pathophysiological changes, while hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), von Willebrand factor (vWF), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, MMP-2, Notch-1, and Hes-1 expression in the spinal cord were examined by immunohistochemical analysis or quantitative PCR. The results show that early decompression can partially promote motor function recovery. Improvements in structural and cellular damage and hypoxic levels were also observed in the decompressed spinal cord. Moreover, decompression resulted in increased VEGF and vWF expression, but decreased MMP-9 and MMP-2 expression at 3 wpi. Expression levels of Notch-1 and its downstream gene Hes-1 were increased after decompression, and the inhibition of Notch-1 significantly reduced the decompression-induced motor function recovery. This exploratory study revealed preliminary pathophysiological changes in the compressed and decompressed rat spinal cord. Furthermore, we confirmed that early surgical decompression partially promotes motor function recovery may via activation of the Notch-1 signaling pathway after CSCI. These results could provide new insights for the development of drug therapy to enhance recovery following surgery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.629630</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a range of neurodevelopmental disorders with behavioral and cognitive impairment and brings huge burdens to the patients’ families and the society. To accurately identify patients with ASD from typical controls is important for early detection and early intervention. However, almost all the current existing classification methods for ASD based on structural MRI (sMRI) mainly utilize the independent local morphological features and do not consider the covariance patterns of these features between regions. In this study, by combining the convolutional neural network (CNN) and individual structural covariance network, we proposed a new framework to classify ASD patients with sMRI data from the ABIDE consortium. Moreover, gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) was applied to characterize the weight of features contributing to the classification. The experimental results showed that our proposed method outperforms the currently used methods for classifying ASD patients with the ABIDE data and achieves a high classification accuracy of 71.8% across different sites. Furthermore, the discriminative features were found to be mainly located in the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum, which may be the early biomarkers for the diagnosis of ASD. Our study demonstrated that CNN is an effective tool to build the framework for the diagnosis of ASD with individual structural covariance brain network.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The inter- and intra-subject transfer learning approaches can improve the low-precision classification performance for experimental feedback.

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: To Go or Not to Go: Degrees of Dynamic Inhibitory Control Revealed by the Function of Grip Force and Early Electrophysiological Indices</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.614978</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A critical issue in executive control is how the nervous system exerts flexibility to inhibit a prepotent response and adapt to sudden changes in the environment. In this study, force measurement was used to capture “partial” unsuccessful trials that are highly relevant in extending the current understanding of motor inhibition processing. Moreover, a modified version of the stop-signal task was used to control and eliminate potential attentional capture effects from the motor inhibition index. The results illustrate that the non-canceled force and force rate increased as a function of stop-signal delay (SSD), offering new objective indices for gauging the dynamic inhibitory process. Motor response (time and force) was a function of delay in the presentation of novel/infrequent stimuli. A larger lateralized readiness potential (LRP) amplitude in go and novel stimuli indicated an influence of the novel stimuli on central motor processing. Moreover, an early N1 component reflects an index of motor inhibition in addition to the N2 component reported in previous studies. Source analysis revealed that the activation of N2 originated from inhibitory control associated areas: the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG), pre-motor cortex, and primary motor cortex. Regarding partial responses, LRP and error-related negativity (ERNs) were associated with error correction processes, whereas the N2 component may indicate the functional overlap between inhibition and error correction. In sum, the present study has developed reliable and objective indices of motor inhibition by introducing force, force-rate and electrophysiological measures, further elucidating our understandings of dynamic motor inhibition and error correction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Determinants of Neural Plastic Changes Induced by Motor Practice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.613867</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Short-term motor practice leads to plasticity in the primary motor cortex (M1). The purpose of this study is to investigate the factors that determine the increase in corticospinal tract (CST) excitability after motor practice, with special focus on two factors; “the level of muscle activity” and “the presence/absence of a goal of keeping the activity level constant.” Fifteen healthy subjects performed four types of rapid thumb adduction in separate sessions. In the “comfortable task” (C) and “forceful task” (F), the subjects adducted their thumb using comfortable and strong forces. In the “comfortable with a goal task” (CG) and “forceful with a goal task” (FG), subjects controlled the muscle activity at the same level as in the C and F, respectively, by adjusting the peak electromyographic amplitude within the target ranges. Paired associative stimulation (PAS), which combines peripheral nerve (median nerve) stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), with an inter-stimulus interval of 25 ms (PAS25) was also done. Before and after the motor tasks and PAS25, TMS was applied to the M1. None of the four tasks showed any temporary changes in behavior, meaning no learning occurred. Motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude increased only after the FG and it exhibited a positive correlation with the MEP increase after PAS25, suggesting that FG and PAS25 share at least similar plasticity mechanisms in the M1. Resting motor threshold (RMT) decreased only after FG, suggesting that FG would also be associated with the membrane depolarization of M1 neurons. These results suggest task-dependent plasticity from the synergistic effect of forceful muscle activity and of setting a goal of keeping the activity level constant.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Viability of Preictal High-Frequency Oscillation Rates as a Biomarker for Seizure Prediction</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.612899</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Motivation: There is an ongoing search for definitive and reliable biomarkers to forecast or predict imminent seizure onset, but to date most research has been limited to EEG with sampling rates &amp;lt;1,000 Hz. High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) have gained acceptance as an indicator of epileptic tissue, but few have investigated the temporal properties of HFOs or their potential role as a predictor in seizure prediction. Here we evaluate time-varying trends in preictal HFO rates as a potential biomarker of seizure prediction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: HFOs were identified for all interictal and preictal periods with a validated automated detector in 27 patients who underwent intracranial EEG monitoring. We used LASSO logistic regression with several features of the HFO rate to distinguish preictal from interictal periods in each individual. We then tested these models with held-out data and evaluated their performance with the area-under-the-curve (AUC) of their receiver-operating curve (ROC). Finally, we assessed the significance of these results using non-parametric statistical tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: There was variability in the ability of HFOs to discern preictal from interictal states across our cohort. We identified a subset of 10 patients in whom the presence of the preictal state could be successfully predicted better than chance. For some of these individuals, average AUC in the held-out data reached higher than 0.80, which suggests that HFO rates can significantly differentiate preictal and interictal periods for certain patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significance: These findings show that temporal trends in HFO rate can predict the preictal state better than random chance in some individuals. Such promising results indicate that future prediction efforts would benefit from the inclusion of high-frequency information in their predictive models and technological architecture.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Importance of Childhood for Adult Health and Development—Study Protocol of the Zurich Longitudinal Studies</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.612453</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Evidence is accumulating that individual and environmental factors in childhood and adolescence should be considered when investigating adult health and aging-related processes. The data required for this is gathered by comprehensive long-term longitudinal studies. This article describes the protocol of the Zurich Longitudinal Studies (ZLS), a set of three comprehensive cohort studies on child growth, health, and development that are currently expanding into adulthood. Between 1954 and 1961, 445 healthy infants were enrolled in the first ZLS cohort. Their physical, motor, cognitive, and social development and their environment were assessed comprehensively across childhood, adolescence, and into young adulthood. In the 1970s, two further cohorts were added to the ZLS and assessed with largely matched study protocols: Between 1974 and 1979, the second ZLS cohort included 265 infants (103 term-born and 162 preterm infants), and between 1970 and 2002, the third ZLS cohort included 327 children of participants of the first ZLS cohort. Since 2019, the participants of the three ZLS cohorts have been traced and invited to participate in a first wave of assessments in adulthood to investigate their current health and development. This article describes the ZLS study protocol and discusses opportunities, methodological and conceptual challenges, and limitations arising from a long-term longitudinal cohort recruited from a study about development in early life. In the future, the ZLS will provide data to investigate childhood antecedents of adult health outcomes and, ultimately, will help respond to the frequent call of scientists to shift the focus of aging research into the first decades of life and, thus, to take a lifespan perspective on aging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Electromyographic Patterns and the Identification of Subtypes of Awake Bruxism</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.601881</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The future of awake bruxism assessment will incorporate physiological data, possibly electromyography (EMG) of the temporal muscles. But up to now, temporal muscle contraction patterns in awake bruxism have not been characterized to demonstrate clinical utility. The present study aimed to perform surface EMG evaluations of people assessed for awake bruxism to identify possible different subtypes. A 2-year active search for people with awake bruxism in three regions of the country resulted in a total of 303 participants (223 women, 38 ± 13 years, mean and SD). Their inclusion was confirmed through non-instrumental approaches for awake bruxism: self-reported questionnaire and clinical exam, performed by three experienced and calibrated dentists (Kappa = 0.75). Also, 77 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were recruited (49 women, 36 ± 14 years). Temporalis surface EMG was performed with a portable device (Myobox; NeuroUp, Brazil). EMG signals were sent to a computer via Bluetooth 4.0 at a sampling rate of 1,000 Hz. Digital signal processing was performed using the commercial neuroUP software, transformed in RMS and then normalized for peak detection (EMG peaks/min), in a 10 min session. Cluster analysis revealed three distinct subtypes of awake bruxism: phasic, tonic, and intermediate. Individuals with a predominance of EMG peaks/min were classified as the “phasic” subtype (16.8%). Those with the highest EMG rest power were classified as the “tonic” subtype (32.3%). There was also an “intermediate” subtype (50.8%), when both variables remained low. Characterization of awake bruxism physiology is important for future establishment of instrumental assessment protocols and treatment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: POLR3-Related Leukodystrophy: Exploring Potential Therapeutic Approaches</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.631802</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Leukodystrophies are a class of rare inherited central nervous system (CNS) disorders that affect the white matter of the brain, typically leading to progressive neurodegeneration and early death. Hypomyelinating leukodystrophies are characterized by the abnormal formation of the myelin sheath during development. POLR3-related or 4H (hypomyelination, hypodontia, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism) leukodystrophy is one of the most common types of hypomyelinating leukodystrophy for which no curative treatment or disease-modifying therapy is available. This review aims to describe potential therapies that could be further studied for effectiveness in pre-clinical studies, for an eventual translation to the clinic to treat the neurological manifestations associated with POLR3-related leukodystrophy. Here, we discuss the therapeutic approaches that have shown promise in other leukodystrophies, as well as other genetic diseases, and consider their use in treating POLR3-related leukodystrophy. More specifically, we explore the approaches of using stem cell transplantation, gene replacement therapy, and gene editing as potential treatment options, and discuss their possible benefits and limitations as future therapeutic directions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Proteomic Characterization of Human Neural Stem Cells and Their Secretome During in vitro Differentiation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.612560</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cell therapies represent a promising approach to slow down the progression of currently untreatable neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), as well as to support the reconstruction of functional neural circuits after spinal cord injuries. In such therapies, the grafted cells could either functionally integrate into the damaged tissue, partially replacing dead or damaged cells, modulate inflammatory reaction, reduce tissue damage, or support neuronal survival by secretion of cytokines, growth, and trophic factors. Comprehensive characterization of cells and their proliferative potential, differentiation status, and population purity before transplantation is crucial to preventing safety risks, e.g., a tumorous growth due to the proliferation of undifferentiated stem cells. We characterized changes in the proteome and secretome of human neural stem cells (NSCs) during their spontaneous (EGF/FGF2 withdrawal) differentiation and differentiation with trophic support by BDNF/GDNF supplementation. We used LC-MS/MS in SWATH-MS mode for global cellular proteome profiling and quantified almost three thousand cellular proteins. Our analysis identified substantial protein differences in the early stages of NSC differentiation with more than a third of all the proteins regulated (including known neuronal and NSC multipotency markers) and revealed that the BDNF/GDNF support affected more the later stages of the NSC differentiation. Among the pathways identified as activated during both spontaneous and BDNF/GDNF differentiation were the HIF-1 signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway, and VEGF signaling pathway. Our follow-up secretome analysis using Luminex multiplex immunoassay revealed significant changes in the secretion of VEGF and IL-6 during NSC differentiation. Our results further demonstrated an increased expression of neuropilin-1 as well as catenin β-1, both known to participate in the regulation of VEGF signaling, and showed that VEGF-A isoform 121 (VEGF121), in particular, induces proliferation and supports survival of differentiating cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Characterization of Subcellular Organelles in Cortical Perisynaptic Astrocytes</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.573944</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Perisynaptic astrocytic processes (PAPs) carry out several different functions, from metabolite clearing to control of neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity. All these functions are likely orchestrated by complex cellular machinery that resides within the PAPs and relies on a fine interplay between multiple subcellular components. However, traditional transmission electron microscopy (EM) studies have found that PAPs are remarkably poor of intracellular organelles, failing to explain how such a variety of PAP functions are achieved in the absence of a proportional complex network of intracellular structures. Here, we use serial block-face scanning EM to reconstruct and describe in three dimensions PAPs and their intracellular organelles in two different mouse cortical regions. We described five distinct organelles, which included empty and full endosomes, phagosomes, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) cisternae, distributed within three PAPs categories (branches, branchlets, and leaflets). The majority of PAPs belonged to the leaflets category (~60%), with branchlets representing a minority (~37%). Branches were rarely in contact with synapses (&amp;lt;3%). Branches had a higher density of mitochondria and ER cisternae than branchlets and leaflets. Also, branches and branchlets displayed organelles more frequently than leaflets. Endosomes and phagosomes, which accounted for more than 60% of all the organelles detected, were often associated with the same PAP. Likewise, mitochondria and ER cisternae, representing ~40% of all organelles were usually associated. No differences were noted between the organelle distribution of the somatosensory and the anterior cingulate cortex. Finally, the organelle distribution in PAPs did not largely depend on the presence of a spine apparatus or a pre-synaptic mitochondrion in the synapse that PAPs were enwrapping, with some exceptions regarding the presence of phagosomes and ER cisternae, which were slightly more represented around synapses lacking a spine apparatus and a presynaptic mitochondrion, respectively. Thus, PAPs contain several subcellular organelles that could underlie the diverse astrocytic functions carried out at central synapses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Hypoglossal Nerve Abnormalities as Biomarkers for Central Nervous System Defects in Mouse Lines Producing Embryonically Lethal Offspring</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.625716</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An essential step in researching human central nervous system (CNS) disorders is the search for appropriate mouse models that can be used to investigate both genetic and environmental factors underlying the etiology of such conditions. Identification of murine models relies upon detailed pre- and post-natal phenotyping since profound defects are not only the result of gross malformations but can be the result of small or subtle morphological abnormalities. The difficulties in identifying such defects are compounded by the finding that many mouse lines show quite a variable penetrance of phenotypes. As a result, without analysis of large numbers, such phenotypes are easily missed. Indeed for null mutations, around one-third have proved to be pre- or perinatally lethal, their analysis resting entirely upon phenotyping of accessible embryonic stages.To simplify the identification of potentially useful mouse mutants, we have conducted three-dimensional phenotype analysis of approximately 500 homozygous null mutant embryos, produced from targeting a variety of mouse genes and harvested at embryonic day 14.5 as part of the “Deciphering the Mechanisms of Developmental Disorders” www.dmdd.org.uk program. We have searched for anatomical features that have the potential to serve as biomarkers for CNS defects in such genetically modified lines. Our analysis identified two promising biomarker candidates. Hypoglossal nerve (HGN) abnormalities (absent, thin, and abnormal topology) and abnormal morphology or topology of head arteries are both frequently associated with the full spectrum of morphological CNS defects, ranging from exencephaly to more subtle defects such as abnormal nerve cell migration. Statistical analysis confirmed that HGN abnormalities (especially those scored absent or thin) indeed showed a significant correlation with CNS defect phenotypes. These results demonstrate that null mutant lines showing HGN abnormalities are also highly likely to produce CNS defects whose identification may be difficult as a result of morphological subtlety or low genetic penetrance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: New Mechanistic Insights, Novel Treatment Paradigms, and Clinical Progress in Cerebrovascular Diseases</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.623751</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The past decade has brought tremendous progress in diagnostic and therapeutic options for cerebrovascular diseases as exemplified by the advent of thrombectomy in ischemic stroke, benefitting a steeply increasing number of stroke patients and potentially paving the way for a renaissance of neuroprotectants. Progress in basic science has been equally impressive. Based on a deeper understanding of pathomechanisms underlying cerebrovascular diseases, new therapeutic targets have been identified and novel treatment strategies such as pre- and post-conditioning methods were developed. Moreover, translationally relevant aspects are increasingly recognized in basic science studies, which is believed to increase their predictive value and the relevance of obtained findings for clinical application.This review reports key results from some of the most remarkable and encouraging achievements in neurovascular research that have been reported at the 10th International Symposium on Neuroprotection and Neurorepair. Basic science topics discussed herein focus on aspects such as neuroinflammation, extracellular vesicles, and the role of sex and age on stroke recovery. Translational reports highlighted endovascular techniques and targeted delivery methods, neurorehabilitation, advanced functional testing approaches for experimental studies, pre-and post-conditioning approaches as well as novel imaging and treatment strategies. Beyond ischemic stroke, particular emphasis was given on activities in the fields of traumatic brain injury and cerebral hemorrhage in which promising preclinical and clinical results have been reported. Although the number of neutral outcomes in clinical trials is still remarkably high when targeting cerebrovascular diseases, we begin to evidence stepwise but continuous progress towards novel treatment options. Advances in preclinical and translational research as reported herein are believed to have formed a solid foundation for this progress.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Motor Dyscoordination and Alteration of Functional Correlation Between DGKγ and PKCγ in Senescence-Accelerated Mouse Prone 8 (SAMP8)</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.573966</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) is an animal model of age-related central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Although SAMP8 shows deficits in learning, memory, and emotion, its motor coordination has not been clarified. We have recently reported that DGKγ-regulated PKCγ activity is important for cerebellar motor coordination. However, involvement of the functional correlation between the kinases in age-related motor dyscoordination still remains unknown. Therefore, we have investigated the motor coordination in SAMP8 and involvement of the functional correlation between DGKγ and PKCγ in the age-related motor dyscoordination. Although 6 weeks old SAMP8 showed equivalent motor coordination with control mice (SAMR1) in the rotarod test, 24 weeks old SAMP8 exhibited significantly less latency in the rotarod test and more frequent slips in the beam test compared to the age-matched SAMR1. Furthermore, 24 weeks old SAMP8 showed the higher locomotor activity in open field test and Y-maze test. Western blotting revealed that DGKγ expression decreased in the cerebellum of 24 weeks old SAMP8, while PKCγ was upregulated. These results suggest that SAMP8 is a useful model of age-related motor dysfunction and that the DGKγ-regulated PKCγ activity is involved in the age-related motor dyscoordination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.630743</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain aging is characterized by a time-dependent decline of tissue integrity and function, and it is a major risk for neurodegenerative diseases and brain cancer. Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a selective form of autophagy specialized in protein degradation, which is based on the individual translocation of a cargo protein through the lysosomal membrane. Regulation of processes such as proteostasis, cellular energetics, or immune system activity has been associated with CMA, indicating its pivotal role in tissue homeostasis. Since first studies associating Parkinson’s disease (PD) to CMA dysfunction, increasing evidence points out that CMA is altered in both physiological and pathological brain aging. In this review article, we summarize the current knowledge regarding the impact of CMA during aging in brain physiopathology, highlighting the role of CMA in neurodegenerative diseases and glioblastoma, the most common and aggressive brain tumor in adults.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.622360</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuroinflammation is a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We sought to study the glial derangement in AD using diverse experimental models and human brain tissue. Besides classical pro-inflammatory cytokines, we analyzed chitinase 3 like 1 (CHI3L1 or YKL40) and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) that are increasingly being associated with astrogliosis and microgliosis in AD, respectively. The SAMP8 mouse model of accelerated aging and AD traits showed elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines and activated microglia phenotype. Furthermore, 6-month-old SAMP8 showed an exacerbated inflammatory response to peripheral lipopolysaccharide in the hippocampus and null responsiveness at the advanced age (for this strain) of 12 months. Gene expression of TREM2 was increased in the hippocampus of transgenic 5XFAD mice and in the cingulate cortex of autosomal dominant AD patients, and to a lesser extent in aged SAMP8 mice and sporadic early-onset AD patients. However, gene expression of CHI3L1 was increased in mice but not in human AD brain samples. The results support the relevance of microglia activation in the pathways leading to neurodegeneration and suggest diverse neuroinflammatory responses according to the AD process. Therefore, the SAMP8 mouse model with marked alterations in the dynamics of microglia activation and senescence may provide a complementary approach to transgenic mouse models for the study of the neuroinflammatory mechanisms underlying AD risk and progression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Evolution of Apathy in Early Parkinson's Disease: A 4-Years Prospective Cohort Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.620762</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: We investigated the prevalence, evolution, associated factors, and risk factors of apathy in a cohort of patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD), who underwent a 4-years prospective follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: This study included 188 patients with PD (baseline disease duration &amp;lt;3 years) who underwent an annual evaluation using the Lille Apathy Rating Scale (LARS). Based on the cut-off value of −21 observed on the LARS, patients were categorized as PD with and without apathy. The generalized estimating equations (GEE) model was utilized to determine the factors associated with apathy, and the Cox proportional-hazards regression model was used to determine the predictors of apathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Apathy increased from a baseline rate of 18.6–28.8% after 4 years; notably, this rate was not persistent across patients' visits. The LARS score was independently associated with the male sex (B 8.131, p = 0.009), low Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) scores (B 0.567, p = 0.011), low attention scores on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) test (B 0.217, p = 0.026), high Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores (B 1.362, p &amp;lt; 0.001), high Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III scores (B 1.147, p &amp;lt; 0.001), and prolonged follow-up time (B 1.785, p = 0.048). A high HDRS score was the only predictor of apathy in PD [hazard ratio (HR) 1.043, p = 0.026].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The risk of apathy is higher in men with progressive PD accompanied by disease-specific motor and non-motor symptoms. Depression during early-stage PD is a primary risk factor for apathy in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: White Matter Abnormalities in Patients With Parkinson's Disease: A Meta-Analysis of Diffusion Tensor Imaging Using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.610962</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) studies based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have revealed extensive abnormalities in white matter (WM) fibers of Parkinson's disease (PD); however, the results were inconsistent. Therefore, a meta-analytical approach was used in this study to find the most prominent and replicable WM abnormalities of PD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Online databases were systematically searched for all TBSS studies comparing fractional anisotropy (FA) between patients with PD and controls. Subsequently, we performed the meta-analysis using a coordinate-based meta-analytic software called seed-based d mapping. Meanwhile, meta-regression was performed to explore the potential correlation between the alteration of FA and the clinical characteristics of PD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Out of a total of 1,701 studies that were identified, 23 studies were included. Thirty datasets, including 915 patients (543 men) with PD and 836 healthy controls (449 men), were included in the current study. FA reduction was identified in the body of the corpus callosum (CC; 245 voxels; z = −1.739; p &amp;lt; 0.001) and the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) 118 voxels; z = −1.182; p &amp;lt; 0.001). Both CC and IFOF maintained significance in the sensitivity analysis. No increase in FA was identified, but the percentage of male patients with PD was positively associated with the value of FA in the body of the CC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Although some limitations exist, DTI is regarded as a valid way to identify the pathophysiology of PD. It could be more beneficial to integrate DTI parameters with other MRI techniques to explore brain degeneration in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The reliable, valid and economic assessment of social cognition is more relevant than ever in the field of clinical psychology. Theory of Mind is one of the most important socio-cognitive abilities but standardized assessment instruments for adults are rare. The Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) is well-established and captures the ability to identify mental states from gaze. Here, we computed standard scores for the German version of the RMET derived from a large, community-dwelling sample of healthy adults (20–79 years). The standardization sample contains 966 healthy adult individuals of the population-based Leipzig Research Center for Civilization Diseases (LIFE) study. Before standardization, weighting factors were applied to match the current sample with distribution characteristics of the German population regarding age, sex, and education. RMET scores were translated into percentage ranks for men and women of five age groups (20–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59, 60+ years). Age-specific percentage ranks are provided for men and women. Independent of age, men present a larger variance in test scores compared to women. Within the specific age groups, women score higher and their scoring range is less variable. With increasing age, the scoring variance increases in both men and women. This is the first study providing age- and sex-specific RMET standard scores. Data was weighted to match German population characteristics, enabling the application of standard scores across German-speaking areas. Our results contribute to the standardized assessment of socio-cognitive abilities in clinical diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.598606</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the functions and regulatory mechanisms of lncRNA are largely unclear. Herein, we obtained 3,158 lncRNAs by microarray re-annotation. A global network of competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) was developed for AD and normal samples were based on the gene expressions profiles. A total of 255 AD-deficient messenger RNA (mRNA)-lncRNAs were identified by the expression correlation analysis. Genes in the dysregulated ceRNAs were found to be mainly enriched in transcription factors and micro RNAs (miRNAs). Analysis of the disordered miRNA in the lncRNA-mRNA network revealed that 40 pairs of lncRNA shared more than one disordered miRNA. Among them, nine lncRNAs were closely associated with AD, Parkinson's disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases. Of note, five lncRNAs were found to be potential biomarkers for AD. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) assay revealed that PART1 was downregulated, while SNHG14 was upregulated in AD serum samples when compared to normal samples. This study elucidates the role of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of AD and presents new lncRNAs that can be exploited to design diagnostic and therapeutic agents for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Mapping of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) reads to a single arbitrary reference genome is a frequently used approach in microbial genomics. However, the choice of a reference may represent a source of errors that may affect subsequent analyses such as the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and phylogenetic inference. In this work, we evaluated the effect of reference choice on short-read sequence data from five clinically and epidemiologically relevant bacteria (&lt;i&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Legionella pneumophila&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Serratia marcescens&lt;/i&gt;). Publicly available whole-genome assemblies encompassing the genomic diversity of these species were selected as reference sequences, and read alignment statistics, SNP calling, recombination rates, d&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;/d&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt; ratios, and phylogenetic trees were evaluated depending on the mapping reference. The choice of different reference genomes proved to have an impact on almost all the parameters considered in the five species. In addition, these biases had potential epidemiological implications such as including/excluding isolates of particular clades and the estimation of genetic distances. These findings suggest that the single reference approach might introduce systematic errors during mapping that affect subsequent analyses, particularly for data sets with isolates from genetically diverse backgrounds. In any case, exploring the effects of different references on the final conclusions is highly recommended.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PhvpX7yeFZg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

We investigate the source detection problem in epidemiology, which is one of the most important issues for control of epidemics. Mathematically, we reformulate the problem as one of identifying the relevant component in a multivariate Gaussian mixture model. Focusing on the study of cholera and diseases with similar modes of transmission, we calibrate the parameters of our mixture model using human mobility networks within a stochastic, spatially explicit epidemiological model for waterborne disease. Furthermore, we adopt a Bayesian perspective, so that prior information on source location can be incorporated (e.g., reflecting the impact of local conditions). Posterior-based inference is performed, which permits estimates in the form of either individual locations or regions. Importantly, our estimator only requires first-arrival times of the epidemic by putative observers, typically located only at a small proportion of nodes. The proposed method is demonstrated within the context of the 2000-2002 cholera outbreak in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dIhEt4T9o-0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Antibodies Contributing to Focal Epilepsy Signs and Symptoms Score</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26013?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Diagnosing autoimmune encephalitis (AIE) is difficult in patients with less fulminant diseases such as epilepsy. However, recognition is important, as patients require immunotherapy. This study aims to identify antibodies in patients with focal epilepsy of unknown etiology, and to create a score to preselect patients requiring testing.


Methods
In this prospective, multicenter cohort study, adults with focal epilepsy of unknown etiology, without recognized AIE, were included, between December 2014 and December 2017, and followed for 1 year. Serum, and if available cerebrospinal fluid, were analyzed using different laboratory techniques. The ACES score was created using factors favoring an autoimmune etiology of seizures (AES), as determined by multivariate logistic regression. The model was externally validated and evaluated using the Concordance (C) statistic.


Results
We included 582 patients, with median epilepsy duration of 8 years (interquartile range = 2–18). Twenty patients (3.4%) had AES, of whom 3 had anti–leucine‐rich glioma inactivated 1, 3 had anti–contactin‐associated protein‐like 2, 1 had anti–N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptor, and 13 had anti–glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay concentrations &amp;gt;10,000IU/ml). Risk factors for AES were temporal magnetic resonance imaging hyperintensities (odds ratio [OR] = 255.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 19.6–3332.2, p &amp;lt; 0.0001), autoimmune diseases (OR = 13.31, 95% CI = 3.1–56.6, p = 0.0005), behavioral changes (OR 12.3, 95% CI = 3.2–49.9, p = 0.0003), autonomic symptoms (OR = 13.3, 95% CI = 3.1–56.6, p = 0.0005), cognitive symptoms (OR = 30.6, 95% CI = 2.4–382.7, p = 0.009), and speech problems (OR = 9.6, 95% CI = 2.0–46.7, p = 0.005). The internally validated C statistic was 0.95, and 0.92 in the validation cohort (n = 128). Assigning each factor 1 point, an antibodies contributing to focal epilepsy signs and symptoms (ACES) score ≥ 2 had a sensitivity of 100% to detect AES, and a specificity of 84.9%.


Interpretation
Specific signs point toward AES in focal epilepsy of unknown etiology. The ACES score (cutoff ≥ 2) is useful to select patients requiring antibody testing. ANN NEUROL 2021</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Heritability enrichment implicates microglia in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26032?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Understanding how different parts of the immune system contribute to pathogenesis in Parkinson's disease is a burning challenge with important therapeutic implications. We studied enrichment of common variant heritability for Parkinson's disease stratified by immune and brain cell types.


Methods
We used summary statistics from the most recent meta‐analysis of genome‐wide association studies in Parkinson's disease and partitioned heritability using linkage disequilibrium score regression, stratified for specific cell types as defined by open chromatin regions. We also validated enrichment results using a polygenic risk score approach and intersected disease‐associated variants with epigenetic data and expression quantitative loci to nominate and explore a putative microglial locus.


Results
We found significant enrichment of Parkinson's disease risk heritability in open chromatin regions of microglia and monocytes. Genomic annotations overlapped substantially between these two cell types, and only the enrichment signal for microglia remained significant in a joint model. We present evidence suggesting P2RY12, a key microglial gene and target for the anti‐thrombotic agent clopidogrel, as the likely driver of a significant Parkinson's disease association signal on chromosome 3.


Interpretation
Our results provide further support for the importance of immune mechanisms in PD pathogenesis, highlight microglial dysregulation as a contributing etiological factor and nominate a targetable microglial gene candidate as a pathogenic player. Immune processes can be modulated by therapy, with potentially important clinical implications for future treatment in Parkinson's disease.

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.629056</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The study of neurons is fundamental for basic neuroscience research and treatment of neurological disorders. In recent years ultrasound has been increasingly recognized as a viable method to stimulate neurons. However, traditional ultrasound transducers are limited in the scope of their application by self-heating effects, limited frequency range and cavitation effects during neuromodulation. In contrast, surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices, which are producing wavemodes with increasing application in biomedical devices, generate less self-heating, are smaller and create less cavitation. SAW devices thus have the potential to address some of the drawbacks of traditional ultrasound transducers and could be implemented as miniaturized wearable or implantable devices. In this mini review, we discuss the potential mechanisms of SAW-based neuromodulation, including mechanical displacement, electromagnetic fields, thermal effects, and acoustic streaming. We also review the application of SAW actuation for neuronal stimulation, including growth and neuromodulation. Finally, we propose future directions for SAW-based neuromodulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Evaluation of Cerebral Blood Flow Measured by 3D PCASL as Biomarker of Vascular Cognitive Impairment and Dementia (VCID) in a Cohort of Elderly Latinx Subjects at Risk of Small Vessel Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.627627</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) affects arterioles, capillaries, and venules and can lead to cognitive impairments and clinical symptomatology of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). VCID symptoms are similar to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) but the neurophysiologic alterations are less well studied, resulting in no established biomarkers. The purpose of this study was to evaluate cerebral blood flow (CBF) measured by 3D pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) as a potential biomarker of VCID in a cohort of elderly Latinx subjects at risk of cSVD. Forty-five elderly Latinx subjects (12 males, 69 ± 7 years) underwent repeated MRI scans ∼6 weeks apart. CBF was measured using 3D pCASL in the whole brain, white matter and 4 main vascular territories (leptomeningeal anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral artery (leptoACA, leptoMCA, leptoPCA), as well as MCA perforator). The test-retest repeatability of CBF was assessed by intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and within-subject coefficient of variation (wsCV). Absolute and relative CBF was correlated with gross cognitive measures and domain specific assessment of executive and memory function, vascular risks, and Fazekas scores and volumes of white matter hyperintensity (WMH). Neurocognitive evaluations were performed using Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and neuropsychological test battery in the Uniform Data Set v3 (UDS3). Good to excellent test-retest repeatability was achieved (ICC = 0.77–0.85, wsCV 3–9%) for CBF measurements in the whole brain, white matter, and 4 vascular territories. Relative CBF normalized by global mean CBF in the leptoMCA territory was positively correlated with the executive function composite score, while relative CBF in the leptoMCA and MCA perforator territory was positively correlated with MoCA scores, controlling for age, gender, years of education, and testing language. Relative CBF in WM was negatively correlated with WMH volume and MoCA scores, while relative leptoMCA CBF was positively correlated with WMH volume. Reliable 3D pCASL CBF measurements were achieved in the cohort of elderly Latinx subjects. Relative CBF in the leptomeningeal and perforator MCA territories were the most likely candidate biomarker of VCID. These findings need to be replicated in larger cohorts with greater variability of stages of cSVD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Stimulus Intervals Modulate the Balance of Brain Activity in the Human Primary Somatosensory Cortex: An ERP Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.571369</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal excitation and inhibition occur in the brain at the same time, and brain activation reflects changes in the sum of excitation and inhibition. This principle has been well-established in lower-level sensory systems, including vision and touch, based on animal studies. However, it is unclear how the somatosensory system processes the balance between excitation and inhibition. In the present ERP study, we modified the traditional spatial attention paradigm by adding double stimuli presentations at short intervals (i.e., 10, 30, and 100 ms). Seventeen subjects participated in the experiment. Five types of stimulation were used in the experiment: a single stimulus (one raised pin for 40 ms), standard stimulus (eight pins for 40 ms), and double stimuli presented at intervals of 10, 30, and 100 ms. The subjects were asked to attend to a particular finger and detect whether the standard stimulus was presented to that finger. The results showed a clear attention-related ERP component in the single stimulus condition, but the suppression components associated with the three interval conditions seemed to be dominant in somatosensory areas. In particular, we found the strongest suppression effect in the ISI-30 condition (interval of 30 ms) and that the suppression and enhancement effects seemed to be counterbalanced in both the ISI-10 and ISI-100 conditions (intervals of 10 and 100 ms, respectively). This type of processing may allow humans to easily discriminate between multiple stimuli on the same body part.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Relationship Between Socioeconomic Status and Scalp Event-Related Potentials: A Systematic Review</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.601489</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Several decades of behavioral research have established that variations in socioeconomic status (SES) are related to differences in cognitive performance. Neuroimaging and psychophysiological techniques have recently emerged as a method of choice to better understand the neurobiological processes underlying this phenomenon. Here we present a systematic review of a particular sub-domain of this field. Specifically, we used the PICOS approach to review studies investigating potential relationships between SES and scalp event-related brain potentials (ERP). This review found evidence that SES is related to amplitude variations in a diverse range of ERPs: P1, N1, N2, Error-Related Negativities (ERN), N400, auditory evoked potentials, negative difference waves (Nd), P3 and slow waves (SW). These ERPs include early, mid-latency and late potentials that reflect a broad range of cognitive processes (e.g., automatic attentional processes, overt attention, language, executive function, etc.). In this review, all SES effects on ERPs appeared to reflect an impairment or a less efficient form of task-related neural activity for low-SES compared to high-SES individuals. Overall, these results confirm that a wide variety of distinct neural processes with different functional meanings are sensitive to SES differences. The findings of this review also suggest that the relationship between SES and some ERP components may depend on the developmental stage of study participants. Results are further discussed in terms of the current limitations of this field and future avenues of research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Error-Related Negativity Predicts Self-Control Failures in Daily Life</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.614979</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Adaptive behavior critically depends on performance monitoring (PM), the ability to monitor action outcomes and the need to adapt behavior. PM-related brain activity has been linked to guiding decisions about whether action adaptation is warranted. The present study examined whether PM-related brain activity in a flanker task, as measured by electroencephalography (EEG), was associated with adaptive behavior in daily life. Specifically, we were interested in the employment of self-control, operationalized as self-control failures (SCFs), and measured using ecological momentary assessment. Analyses were conducted using an adaptive elastic net regression to predict SCFs from EEG in a sample of 131 participants. The model was fit using within-subject averaged response-locked EEG activity at each electrode and time point within an epoch surrounding the response. We found that higher amplitudes of the error-related negativity (ERN) were related to fewer SCFs. This suggests that lower error-related activity may relate to lower recruitment of interventive self-control in daily life. Altered cognitive control processes, like PM, have been proposed as underlying mechanisms for various mental disorders. Understanding how alterations in PM relate to regulatory control might therefore aid in delineating how these alterations contribute to different psychopathologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Muscle Synergies in Patients With Multiple Sclerosis Reveal Demand-Specific Alterations in the Modular Organization of Locomotion</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.593365</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), deficits in gait significantly reduce the quality of life. Using the concept of muscle synergies, this study investigated the modular organization of motor control during level and inclined walking in MS patients (MSP) compared with healthy participants (HP) to identify the potential demand-specific adjustments in motor control in MSP. We hypothesized a widening of the time-dependent activation patterns (motor primitives) in MSP to increase the overlap of temporally-adjacent muscle synergies, especially during inclined walking, as a strategy to increase the robustness of motor control, thus compensating pathology-related deficits. We analyzed temporal gait parameters and muscle synergies from myoelectric signals of 13 ipsilateral leg muscles using non-negative matrix factorization. Compared with HP, MSP demonstrated a widening in the time-dependent coefficients (motor primitives), as well as altered relative muscle contribution (motor modules), in certain synergies during level and inclined walking. Moreover, inclined walking revealed a demand-specific adjustment in the modular organization in MSP, resulting in an extra synergy compared with HP. This further increased the overlap of temporally-adjacent muscle synergies to provide sufficient robustness in motor control to accomplish the more demanding motor task while coping with pathology-related motor deficits during walking.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Is This Within Reach? Left but Not Right Brain Damage Affects Affordance Judgment Tendencies</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.531893</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The ability to judge accurately whether or not an action can be accomplished successfully is critical for selecting appropriate response options that enable adaptive behaviors. Such affordance judgments are thought to rely on the perceived fit between environmental properties and knowledge of one's current physical capabilities. Little, however, is currently known about the ability of individuals to judge their own affordances following a stroke, or about the underlying neural mechanisms involved. To address these issues, we employed a signal detection approach to investigate the impact of left or right hemisphere injuries on judgments of whether a visual object was located within reach while remaining still (i.e., reachability). Regarding perceptual sensitivity and accuracy in judging reachability, there were no significant group differences between healthy controls (N = 29), right brain damaged (RBD, N = 17) and left brain damaged stroke patients (LBD, N = 17). However, while healthy controls and RBD patients demonstrated a negative response criterion and thus overestimated their reach capability, LBD patients' average response criterion converged to zero, indicating no judgment tendency. Critically, the LBD group's judgment tendency pattern is consistent with previous findings in this same sample on an affordance judgment task that required estimating whether the hand can fit through apertures (Randerath et al., 2018). Lesion analysis suggests that this loss of judgment tendency may be associated with damage to the left insula, the left parietal and middle temporal lobe. Based on these results, we propose that damage to the left ventro-dorsal stream disrupts the retrieval and processing of a stable criterion, leading to stronger reliance on intact on-line body-perceptive processes computed within the preserved bilateral dorsal network.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Every year thousands of patients are diagnosed with a glioma, a type of malignant brain tumor. MRI plays an essential role in the diagnosis and treatment assessment of these patients. Neural networks show great potential to aid physicians in the medical image analysis. This study investigated the creation of synthetic brain T1-weighted (T1), post-contrast T1-weighted (T1CE), T2-weighted (T2), and T2 Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (Flair) MR images. These synthetic MR (synMR) images were assessed quantitatively with four metrics. The synMR images were also assessed qualitatively by an authoring physician with notions that synMR possessed realism in its portrayal of structural boundaries but struggled to accurately depict tumor heterogeneity. Additionally, this study investigated the synMR images created by generative adversarial network (GAN) to overcome the lack of annotated medical image data in training U-Nets to segment enhancing tumor, whole tumor, and tumor core regions on gliomas. Multiple two-dimensional (2D) U-Nets were trained with original BraTS data and differing subsets of the synMR images. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) was used as the loss function during training as well a quantitative metric. Additionally, Hausdorff Distance 95% CI (HD) was used to judge the quality of the contours created by these U-Nets. The model performance was improved in both DSC and HD when incorporating synMR in the training set. In summary, this study showed the ability to generate high quality Flair, T2, T1, and T1CE synMR images using GAN. Using synMR images showed encouraging results to improve the U-Net segmentation performance and shows potential to address the scarcity of annotated medical images.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Mitochondria: Novel Mechanisms and Therapeutic Targets for Secondary Brain Injury After Intracerebral Hemorrhage</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.615451</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a destructive form of stroke that often results in death or disability. However, the survivors usually experience sequelae of neurological impairments and psychiatric disorders, which affect their daily functionality and working capacity. The recent MISTIE III and STICH II trials have confirmed that early surgical clearance of hematomas does not improve the prognosis of survivors of ICH, so it is vital to find the intervention target of secondary brain injury (SBI) after ICH. Mitochondrial dysfunction, which may be induced by oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and autophagy, among others, is considered to be a novel pathological mechanism of ICH. Moreover, mitochondria play an important role in promoting neuronal survival and improving neurological function after a hemorrhagic stroke. This review summarizes the mitochondrial mechanism involved in cell death, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, inflammatory activation, blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption, and brain edema underlying ICH. We emphasize the potential of mitochondrial protection as a potential therapeutic target for SBI after stroke and provide valuable insight into clinical strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: FOXO Regulates Neuromuscular Junction Homeostasis During Drosophila Aging</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.567861</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The transcription factor foxo is a known regulator of lifespan extension and tissue homeostasis. It has been linked to the maintenance of neuronal processes across many species and has been shown to promote youthful characteristics by regulating cytoskeletal flexibility and synaptic plasticity at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). However, the role of foxo in aging neuromuscular junction function has yet to be determined. We profiled adult Drosophila foxo- null mutant abdominal ventral longitudinal muscles and found that young mutants exhibited morphological profiles similar to those of aged wild-type flies, such as larger bouton areas and shorter terminal branches. We also observed changes to the axonal cytoskeleton and an accumulation of late endosomes in foxo null mutants and motor neuron-specific foxo knockdown flies, similar to those of aged wild-types. Motor neuron-specific overexpression of foxo can delay age-dependent changes to NMJ morphology, suggesting foxo is responsible for maintaining NMJ integrity during aging. Through genetic screening, we identify several downstream factors mediated through foxo-regulated NMJ homeostasis, including genes involved in the MAPK pathway. Interestingly, the phosphorylation of p38 was increased in the motor neuron-specific foxo knockdown flies, suggesting foxo acts as a suppressor of p38/MAPK activation. Our work reveals that foxo is a key regulator for NMJ homeostasis, and it may maintain NMJ integrity by repressing MAPK signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: CaVα2δ Autoimmune Encephalitis: A Novel Antibody and its Characteristics</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26017?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Discovery of a novel antibody would enable diagnosis and early treatment of autoimmune encephalitis. The aim was to discover a novel antibody targeting a synaptic receptor and characterize the pathogenic mechanism.


Method
We screened for unknown antibodies in serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples from autoimmune encephalitis patients. Samples with reactivity to rat brain sections and no reactivity to conventional antibody tests underwent further processing for antibody discovery, using immunoprecipitation to primary neuronal cells, mass‐spectrometry analysis, an antigen‐binding assay on an antigen‐overexpressing cell line, and an electrophysiological assay with cultured hippocampal neurons.


Results
Two patients had a novel antibody against CaVα2δ (voltage‐gated calcium channel alpha‐2/delta subunit). The patient samples stained neuropils of the hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cortex in rat brain sections and bound to a CaVα2δ‐overexpressing cell line. Knockdown of CaVα2δ expression in cultured neurons turned off the immunoreactivity of the antibody from the patients to the neurons. The patients were associated with preceding meningitis or neuroendocrine carcinoma and responded to immunotherapy. In cultured neurons, the antibody reduced neurotransmitter release from presynaptic nerve terminals by interfering with tight coupling of calcium channels and exocytosis.


Interpretation
Here, we discovered a novel autoimmune encephalitis associated with anti‐CaVα2δ antibody. Further analysis of the antibody in autoimmune encephalitis might promote early diagnosis and treatment. ANN NEUROL 2021</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Neural signatures of syntactic variation in speech planning</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/Tm2ZR7VTFaI/article</link>

Planning to speak is a challenge for the brain, and the challenge varies between and within languages. Yet, little is known about how neural processes react to these variable challenges beyond the planning of individual words. Here, we examine how fundamental differences in syntax shape the time course of sentence planning. Most languages treat alike (i.e., align with each other) the 2 uses of a word like “gardener” in “the gardener crouched” and in “the gardener planted trees.” A minority keeps these formally distinct by adding special marking in 1 case, and some languages display both aligned and nonaligned expressions. Exploiting such a contrast in Hindi, we used electroencephalography (EEG) and eye tracking to suggest that this difference is associated with distinct patterns of neural processing and gaze behavior during early planning stages, preceding phonological word form preparation. Planning sentences with aligned expressions induces larger synchronization in the theta frequency band, suggesting higher working memory engagement, and more visual attention to agents than planning nonaligned sentences, suggesting delayed commitment to the relational details of the event. Furthermore, plain, unmarked expressions are associated with larger desynchronization in the alpha band than expressions with special markers, suggesting more engagement in information processing to keep overlapping structures distinct during planning. Our findings contrast with the observation that the form of aligned expressions is simpler, and they suggest that the global preference for alignment is driven not by its neurophysiological effect on sentence planning but by other sources, possibly by aspects of production flexibility and fluency or by sentence comprehension. This challenges current theories on how production and comprehension may affect the evolution and distribution of syntactic variants in the world’s languages.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Tm2ZR7VTFaI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Tsetse transmit African trypanosomiasis, which is a disease fatal to both humans and animals. A vaccine to protect against this disease does not exist so transmission control relies on eliminating tsetse populations. Although neurotoxic insecticides are the gold standard for insect control, they negatively impact the environment and reduce populations of insect pollinator species. Here we present a promising, environment-friendly alternative to current insecticides that targets the insect tyrosine metabolism pathway. A bloodmeal contains high levels of tyrosine, which is toxic to haematophagous insects if it is not degraded and eliminated. RNA interference (RNAi) of either the first two enzymes in the tyrosine degradation pathway (tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD)) was lethal to tsetse. Furthermore, nitisinone (NTBC), an FDA-approved tyrosine catabolism inhibitor, killed tsetse regardless if the drug was orally or topically applied. However, oral administration of NTBC to bumblebees did not affect their survival. Using a novel mathematical model, we show that NTBC could reduce the transmission of African trypanosomiasis in sub-Saharan Africa, thus accelerating current disease elimination programmes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/hY4KuzQ60os&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Astrocytes in Rare Neurological Conditions: Morphological and Functional Considerations</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25118?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Astrocytes are a population of central nervous system (CNS) cells with distinctive morphological and functional characteristics that differ within specific areas of the brain and are widely distributed throughout the CNS. There are mainly two types of astrocytes, protoplasmic and fibrous, which differ in morphologic appearance and location. Astrocytes are important cells of the CNS that not only provide structural support, but also modulate synaptic activity, regulate neuroinflammatory responses, maintain the blood‐brain barrier, and supply energy to neurons. As a result, astrocytic disruption can lead to widespread detrimental effects and can contribute to the pathophysiology of several neurological conditions. The characteristics of astrocytes in more common neuropathologies such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease have significantly been described and continue to be widely studied. However, there still exist numerous rare neurological conditions in which astrocytic involvement is unknown and needs to be explored. Accordingly, this review will summarize functional and morphological changes of astrocytes in various rare neurological conditions based on current knowledge thus far and highlight remaining neuropathologies where astrocytic involvement has yet to be investigated.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) is a matricellular protein involved in the extracellular matrix and interactions between cells during neural development of the central nervous system (CNS). Oxidative glutamate toxicity is involved in CNS diseases, including epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, and ischemic stroke. However, the molecular mechanism of nerve injury is not fully understood in CNS diseases. Herein, the glutamate-induced nerve damage model was used to explore the molecular mechanisms affecting nerve damage. The levels of SPARC and autophagy were increased in glutamate-induced HT22 hippocampal nerve injury. In summary, the current study confirmed that SPARC regulates autophagy in HT22 hippocampal nerve cells, and its knockdown reduces the glutamate-induced HT22 hippocampal nerve injury by inhibiting autophagy. These findings suggested that SPARC plays a crucial role in nerve injury of CNS diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

WISDoM can be applied to tasks of supervised learning, like classification, in particular when such matrices are generated by data of different dimensionality (e.g., time series with same number of variables but different time sampling). We show the application of the method in two different scenarios. The first is the ranking of features associated with electro encephalogram (EEG) data with a time series design, providing a theoretically sound approach for this type of studies. The second is the classification of autistic subjects of the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange study using brain connectivity measurements.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) nowadays can match human performance in challenging complex tasks, but it remains unknown whether DCNNs achieve human-like performance through human-like processes. Here we applied a reverse-correlation method to make explicit representations of DCNNs and humans when performing face gender classification. We found that humans and a typical DCNN, VGG-Face, used similar critical information for this task, which mainly resided at low spatial frequencies. Importantly, the prior task experience, which the VGG-Face was pre-trained to process faces at the subordinate level (i.e., identification) as humans do, seemed necessary for such representational similarity, because AlexNet, a DCNN pre-trained to process objects at the basic level (i.e., categorization), succeeded in gender classification but relied on a completely different representation. In sum, although DCNNs and humans rely on different sets of hardware to process faces, they can use a similar and implementation-independent representation to achieve the same computation goal.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Leukodystrophies HBSL and LBSL—Correlates and Distinctions</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.626610</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) accurately charge tRNAs with their respective amino acids. As such, they are vital for the initiation of cytosolic and mitochondrial protein translation. These enzymes have become increasingly scrutinized in recent years for their role in neurodegenerative disorders caused by the mutations of ARS-encoding genes. This review focuses on two such genes—DARS1 and DARS2—which encode cytosolic and mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetases, and the clinical conditions associated with mutations of these genes. We also describe attempts made at modeling these conditions in mice, which have both yielded important mechanistic insights. Leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation (LBSL) is a disease caused by a range of mutations in the DARS2 gene, initially identified in 2003. Ten years later, hypomyelination with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and leg spasticity (HBSL), caused by mutations of cytosolic DARS1, was discovered. Multiple parallels have been drawn between the two conditions. The Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) patterns are strikingly similar, but still set these two conditions apart from other leukodystrophies. Clinically, both conditions are characterized by lower limb spasticity, often associated with other pyramidal signs. However, perhaps due to earlier detection, a wider range of symptoms, including peripheral neuropathy, as well as visual and hearing changes have been described in LBSL patients. Both HBSL and LBSL are spectrum disorders lacking genotype to phenotype correlation. While the fatal phenotype of Dars1 or Dars2 single gene deletion mouse mutants revealed that the two enzymes lack functional redundancy, further pursuit of disease modeling are required to shed light onto the underlying disease mechanism, and enable examination of experimental treatments, including gene therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Identification of Heterogeneous Subtypes of Mild Cognitive Impairment Using Cluster Analyses Based on PET Imaging of Tau and Astrogliosis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.615467</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a condition with diverse causes and clinical outcomes that can be categorized into subtypes. [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]THK5351 has been known to detect reactive astrogliosis as well as tau which is accompanied by neurodegenerative changes. Here, we identified heterogeneous groups of MCI patients using THK retention patterns and a graph theory approach, allowing for the comparison of risk of progression to dementia in these MCI subgroups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Ninety-seven participants including 60 MCI patients and individuals with normal cognition (NC, n = 37) were included and undertook 3T MRI, [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]THK5351 PET, and detailed neuropsychological tests. [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]Flutemetamol PET was also performed in 62 participants. We calculated similarities between MCI patients using their regional standardized uptake value ratio of THK retention in 75 ROIs, and clustered subjects with similar retention patterns using the Louvain method based on the modularity of the graph. The clusters of patients identified were compared with an age-matched control group using a general linear model. Dementia conversion was evaluated after a median follow-up duration of 34.6 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: MCI patients were categorized into four groups according to their THK retention patterns: (1) limbic type; (2) diffuse type; (3) sparse type; and (4) AD type (retention pattern as in AD). Subjects of the limbic type were characterized by older age, small hippocampal volumes, and reduced verbal memory and frontal/executive functions. Patients of the diffuse type had relatively large vascular burden, reduced memory capacity and some frontal/executive functions. Co-morbidity and mortality were more frequent in this subgroup. Subjects of the sparse type were younger and declined only in terms of visual memory and attention. No individuals in this subgroup converted to dementia. Patients in the AD type group exhibited the poorest cognitive function. They also had the smallest hippocampal volumes and the highest risk of progression to dementia (90.9%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Using cluster analyses with [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]THK5351 retention patterns, it is possible to identify clinically-distinct subgroups of MCI patients and those at greater risk of progression to dementia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.611494</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The mechanism of brain injury following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) has not yet been clarified. The glymphatic system (GS), a glia-dependent waste clearance pathway, drains away soluble waste proteins and metabolic products, even some toxic factors from the brain. Aquaporin-4 (Aqp4) is highly expressed on the astrocyte foot processes and facilitates the interstitial fluid (ISF) transportation in the GS system. In this study, the role of Aqp4 in the GS injury after SAH was explored using Aqp4 gene knockout (Aqp4&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;) Sprague Dawley rats. The results of MRI, fluorescent imaging, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicated that, after SAH, the inflow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into the brain and the clearance of ISF from the brain were both significantly decreased. Meanwhile, the expression level of Aqp4 around the artery was markedly higher than that around the vein following SAH. Aqp4 knockout exacerbated the GS damage after SAH. In summary, after SAH, there was an apparent GS impairment, and Aqp4 played key roles in modulating the function of GS in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Protein expression alteration in hippocampus upon genetic repression of AMPKα isoforms</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23305?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
The AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a molecular sensor to help maintain cellular energy homeostasis. AMPK is a heterotrimeric complex and its enzymatic catalytic subunit includes two isoforms: α1 and α2. Dysregulation of AMPK signaling is linked to neuronal diseases characterized with cognitive impairments. Emerging evidence also suggest isoform‐specific roles of AMPK in the brain. AMPK regulates protein synthesis, which is critical for memory formation and neuronal plasticity. However, the consequence of altering AMPK activity on the translation of specific proteins in the brain is unknown. Here, we use unbiased mass spectrometry‐based proteomics approach to analyze protein profile alterations in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of transgenic mice in which the genes for the two AMPKα isoforms are conditionally deleted. The study revealed identities of proteins whose expression is sensitive to suppression of AMPKα1 and/or α2 isoform. These data may serve as a basis for future in‐depth study. Elucidation of the functional relevance of the alteration of specific proteins could provide insights into identification of novel therapeutic targets for neuronal disorders characterized with AMPK signaling dysregulation and impaired cellular energy metabolism.</content:encoded>

The selection pressures that have shaped the evolution of complex traits in humans remain largely unknown, and in some contexts highly contentious, perhaps above all where they concern mean trait differences among groups. To date, the discussion has focused on whether such group differences have any genetic basis, and if so, whether they are without fitness consequences and arose via random genetic drift, or whether they were driven by selection for different trait optima in different environments. Here, we highlight a plausible alternative that many complex traits evolve under stabilizing selection in the face of shifting environmental effects. Under this scenario, there will be rapid evolution at the loci that contribute to trait variation, even when the trait optimum remains the same. These considerations underscore the strong assumptions about environmental effects that are required in ascribing trait differences among groups to genetic differences.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/rzF9EYLWEHA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Noradrenaline‐induced l‐lactate production requires d‐glucose entry and transit through the glycogen shunt in single‐cultured rat astrocytes</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24783?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>d‐glucose uptake in astrocytes is an essential source for the noradrenaline‐induced increase in intracellular L‐lactate. We found that intracellular l‐lactate arises exclusively from the glycogen—a temporary energy store in the brain. The glycolytic pathway intermediates also support oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. At rest, a large proportion of d‐glucose is metabolized in the Krebs cycle, since the resting l‐lactate concentration is low. This is increased when the Krebs cycle is blocked or when cells are stimulated with noradrenaline.

Abstract
During cognitive efforts mediated by local neuronal networks, approximately 20% of additional energy is required; this is mediated by chemical messengers such as noradrenaline (NA). NA targets astroglial aerobic glycolysis, the hallmark of which is the end product l‐lactate, a fuel for neurons. Biochemical studies have revealed that astrocytes exhibit a prominent glycogen shunt, in which a portion of d‐glucose molecules entering the cytoplasm is transiently incorporated into glycogen, a buffer and source of d‐glucose during increased energy demand. Here, we studied single astrocytes by measuring cytosolic L‐lactate ([lac]i) with the FRET nanosensor Laconic. We examined whether NA‐induced increase in [lac]i is influenced by: (a) 2‐deoxy‐d‐glucose (2‐DG, 3 mM), a molecule that enters the cytosol and inhibits the glycolytic pathway; (b) 1,4‐dideoxy‐1,4‐imino‐d‐arabinitol (DAB, 300 µM), a potent inhibitor of glycogen phosphorylase and glycogen degradation; and (c) 3‐nitropropionic acid (3‐NPA, 1 mM), an inhibitor of the Krebs cycle. The results of these pharmacological experiments revealed that d‐glucose uptake is essential for the NA‐induced increase in [lac]i, and that this exclusively arises from glycogen degradation, indicating that most, if not all, d‐glucose molecules in NA‐stimulated cells transit the glycogen shunt during glycolysis. Moreover, under the defined transmembrane d‐glucose gradient, the glycolytic intermediates were not only used to produce l‐lactate, but also to significantly support oxidative phosphorylation, as demonstrated by an elevation in [lac]i when Krebs cycle was inhibited. We conclude that l‐lactate production via aerobic glycolysis is an essential energy pathway in NA‐stimulated astrocytes; however, oxidative metabolism is important at rest.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Defined Tau Phosphospecies Differentially Inhibit Fast Axonal Transport Through Activation of Two Independent Signaling Pathways</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.610037</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tau protein is subject to phosphorylation by multiple kinases at more than 80 different sites. Some of these sites are associated with tau pathology and neurodegeneration, but other sites are modified in normal tau as well as in pathological tau. Although phosphorylation of tau at residues in the microtubule-binding repeats is thought to reduce tau association with microtubules, the functional consequences of other sites are poorly understood. The AT8 antibody recognizes a complex phosphoepitope site on tau that is detectable in a healthy brain but significantly increased in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other tauopathies. Previous studies showed that phosphorylation of tau at the AT8 site leads to exposure of an N-terminal sequence that promotes activation of a protein phosphatase 1 (PP1)/glycogen synthase 3 (GSK3) signaling pathway, which inhibits kinesin-1-based anterograde fast axonal transport (FAT). This finding suggests that phosphorylation may control tau conformation and function. However, the AT8 includes three distinct phosphorylated amino acids that may be differentially phosphorylated in normal and disease conditions. To evaluate the effects of specific phosphorylation sites in the AT8 epitope, recombinant, pseudophosphorylated tau proteins were perfused into the isolated squid axoplasm preparation to determine their effects on axonal signaling pathways and FAT. Results from these studies suggest a mechanism where specific phosphorylation events differentially impact tau conformation, promoting activation of independent signaling pathways that differentially affect FAT. Implications of findings here to our understanding of tau function in health and disease conditions are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Insights Into the Role and Potential of Schwann Cells for Peripheral Nerve Repair From Studies of Development and Injury</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.608442</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Peripheral nerve injuries arising from trauma or disease can lead to sensory and motor deficits and neuropathic pain. Despite the purported ability of the peripheral nerve to self-repair, lifelong disability is common. New molecular and cellular insights have begun to reveal why the peripheral nerve has limited repair capacity. The peripheral nerve is primarily comprised of axons and Schwann cells, the supporting glial cells that produce myelin to facilitate the rapid conduction of electrical impulses. Schwann cells are required for successful nerve regeneration; they partially “de-differentiate” in response to injury, re-initiating the expression of developmental genes that support nerve repair. However, Schwann cell dysfunction, which occurs in chronic nerve injury, disease, and aging, limits their capacity to support endogenous repair, worsening patient outcomes. Cell replacement-based therapeutic approaches using exogenous Schwann cells could be curative, but not all Schwann cells have a “repair” phenotype, defined as the ability to promote axonal growth, maintain a proliferative phenotype, and remyelinate axons. Two cell replacement strategies are being championed for peripheral nerve repair: prospective isolation of “repair” Schwann cells for autologous cell transplants, which is hampered by supply challenges, and directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells or lineage conversion of accessible somatic cells to induced Schwann cells, with the potential of “unlimited” supply. All approaches require a solid understanding of the molecular mechanisms guiding Schwann cell development and the repair phenotype, which we review herein. Together these studies provide essential context for current efforts to design glial cell-based therapies for peripheral nerve regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Electrical Source Imaging in Freely Moving Rats: Evaluation of a 12-Electrode Cortical Electroencephalography System</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.589228</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This work presents and evaluates a 12-electrode intracranial electroencephalography system developed at the National Institute of Mental Health (Klecany, Czech Republic) in terms of an electrical source imaging (ESI) technique in rats. The electrode system was originally designed for translational research purposes. This study demonstrates that it is also possible to use this well-established system for ESI, and estimates its precision, accuracy, and limitations. Furthermore, this paper sets a methodological basis for future implants. Source localization quality is evaluated using three approaches based on surrogate data, physical phantom measurements, and in vivo experiments. The forward model for source localization is obtained from the FieldTrip-SimBio pipeline using the finite-element method. Rat brain tissue extracted from a magnetic resonance imaging template is approximated by a single-compartment homogeneous tetrahedral head model. Four inverse solvers were tested: standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography, exact low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA), linear constrained minimum variance (LCMV), and dynamic imaging of coherent sources. Based on surrogate data, this paper evaluates the accuracy and precision of all solvers within the brain volume using error distance and reliability maps. The mean error distance over the whole brain was found to be the lowest in the eLORETA solution through signal to noise ratios (SNRs) (0.2 mm for 25 dB SNR). The LCMV outperformed eLORETA under higher SNR conditions, and exhibiting higher spatial precision. Both of these inverse solvers provided accurate results in a phantom experiment (1.6 mm mean error distance across shallow and 2.6 mm across subcortical testing dipoles). Utilizing the developed technique in freely moving rats, an auditory steady-state response experiment provided results in line with previously reported findings. The obtained results support the idea of utilizing a 12-electrode system for ESI and using it as a solid basis for the development of future ESI dedicated implants.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Analysis of Human Gait Using Hybrid EEG-fNIRS-Based BCI System: A Review</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.613254</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human gait is a complex activity that requires high coordination between the central nervous system, the limb, and the musculoskeletal system. More research is needed to understand the latter coordination's complexity in designing better and more effective rehabilitation strategies for gait disorders. Electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) are among the most used technologies for monitoring brain activities due to portability, non-invasiveness, and relatively low cost compared to others. Fusing EEG and fNIRS is a well-known and established methodology proven to enhance brain–computer interface (BCI) performance in terms of classification accuracy, number of control commands, and response time. Although there has been significant research exploring hybrid BCI (hBCI) involving both EEG and fNIRS for different types of tasks and human activities, human gait remains still underinvestigated. In this article, we aim to shed light on the recent development in the analysis of human gait using a hybrid EEG-fNIRS-based BCI system. The current review has followed guidelines of preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-Analyses (PRISMA) during the data collection and selection phase. In this review, we put a particular focus on the commonly used signal processing and machine learning algorithms, as well as survey the potential applications of gait analysis. We distill some of the critical findings of this survey as follows. First, hardware specifications and experimental paradigms should be carefully considered because of their direct impact on the quality of gait assessment. Second, since both modalities, EEG and fNIRS, are sensitive to motion artifacts, instrumental, and physiological noises, there is a quest for more robust and sophisticated signal processing algorithms. Third, hybrid temporal and spatial features, obtained by virtue of fusing EEG and fNIRS and associated with cortical activation, can help better identify the correlation between brain activation and gait. In conclusion, hBCI (EEG + fNIRS) system is not yet much explored for the lower limb due to its complexity compared to the higher limb. Existing BCI systems for gait monitoring tend to only focus on one modality. We foresee a vast potential in adopting hBCI in gait analysis. Imminent technical breakthroughs are expected using hybrid EEG-fNIRS-based BCI for gait to control assistive devices and Monitor neuro-plasticity in neuro-rehabilitation. However, although those hybrid systems perform well in a controlled experimental environment when it comes to adopting them as a certified medical device in real-life clinical applications, there is still a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Predicting Grating Orientations With Cross-Frequency Coupling and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator in V1 and V4 of Rhesus Monkeys</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.605104</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Orientation selectivity, as an emergent property of neurons in the visual cortex, is of critical importance in the processing of visual information. Characterizing the orientation selectivity based on neuronal firing activities or local field potentials (LFPs) is a hot topic of current research. In this paper, we used cross-frequency coupling and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to predict the grating orientations in V1 and V4 of two rhesus monkeys. The experimental data were recorded by utilizing two chronically implanted multi-electrode arrays, which were placed, respectively, in V1 and V4 of two rhesus monkeys performing a selective visual attention task. The phase–amplitude coupling (PAC) and amplitude–amplitude coupling (AAC) were employed to characterize the cross-frequency coupling of LFPs under sinusoidal grating stimuli with different orientations. Then, a LASSO logistic regression model was constructed to predict the grating orientation based on the strength of PAC and AAC. Moreover, the cross-validation method was used to evaluate the performance of the model. It was found that the average accuracy of the prediction based on the combination of PAC and AAC was 73.9%, which was higher than the predicting accuracy with PAC or AAC separately. In conclusion, a LASSO logistic regression model was introduced in this study, which can predict the grating orientations with relatively high accuracy by using PAC and AAC together. Our results suggest that the principle behind the LASSO model is probably an alternative direction to explore the mechanism for generating orientation selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Motor Progression in Early-Stage Parkinson's Disease: A Clinical Prediction Model and the Role of Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.627199</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: The substantial heterogeneity of clinical symptoms and lack of reliable progression markers in Parkinson's disease (PD) present a major challenge in predicting accurate progression and prognoses. Increasing evidence indicates that each component of the neurovascular unit (NVU) and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption may take part in many neurodegenerative diseases. Since some portions of CSF are eliminated along the neurovascular unit and across the BBB, disturbing the pathways may result in changes of these substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Four hundred seventy-four participants from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) study (NCT01141023) were included in the study. Thirty-six initial features, including general information, brief clinical characteristics and the current year's classical scale scores, were used to build five regression models to predict PD motor progression represented by the coming year's Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III score after redundancy removal and recursive feature elimination (RFE)-based feature selection. Then, a threshold range was added to the predicted value for more convenient model application. Finally, we evaluated the CSF and blood biomarkers' influence on the disease progression model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Eight hundred forty-nine cases were included in the study. The adjusted R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; values of three different categories of regression model, linear, Bayesian and ensemble, all reached 0.75. Models of the same category shared similar feature combinations. The common features selected among the categories were the MDS-UPDRS Part III score, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) and Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder Questionnaire (RBDSQ) score. It can be seen more intuitively that the model can achieve certain prediction effect through threshold range. Biomarkers had no significant impact on the progression model within the data in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: By using machine learning and routinely gathered assessments from the current year, we developed multiple dynamic models to predict the following year's motor progression in the early stage of PD. These methods will allow clinicians to tailor medical management to the individual and identify at-risk patients for future clinical trials examining disease-modifying therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Protective Effect of the α7 Nicotinic Receptor Agonist PNU-282987 on Dopaminergic Neurons Against 6-Hydroxydopamine, Regulating Anti-neuroinflammatory and the Immune Balance Pathways in Rat</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.606927</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuroinflammation and inner immune dysfunction are increasingly accepted as important components of the etiopathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). According to emerging evidence, a7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR), a ligand-gated ion channel, plays an important role in inflammatory reactions and is also expressed on the surface of T cells. In particular, regulatory T cells (Tregs) are critical for the maintenance of immunological tolerance. In the present study, we investigated the roles of α7nAChR in inhibiting inflammation and maintaining the immune balance in rats with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced lesions and the possible mechanisms regulating the proportion of Tregs in vivo. Adult male Wistar rats (n = 90) were subjected to a unilateral injection of 6-OHDA into the left medial forebrain bundle, and PNU-282987, an α7nAChR agonist, was intraperitoneally injected 2 h prior to the induction of lesions by 6-OHDA and again at days 1, 7, and 13 postlesion. Behavioral tests and immunohistochemical staining to detect the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the bilateral substantial nigra (SN) were performed. Subsequently, CD4+ T lymphocytes and the expression of forkhead/winged helix transcription factor p3 (Foxp3, which is a marker of Treg cells) in the SN were also assessed using immunofluorescence staining. The expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the SN was determined by performing immunohistochemical staining. Additionally, the protein levels of α7nAChR, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) phosphorylated-Erk (p-Erk) and Foxp3 in the ventral midbrain were determined using Western blotting, and the relative expression of the TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-10 mRNAs were detected using real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We found that PNU-282987 significantly improved the motor deficits induced by 6-OHDA, reduced the loss of TH in the SN, suppressed the overactivation of GFAP+ cells and expression of related inflammatory cytokines, and increased the number of Foxp3+ cells. In addition, we also showed that PNU-282987 significantly increased the protein expression of the a7nAchR, p-Erk, and Foxp3 in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats (p &amp;lt; 0.05). These results indicated that α7nAChR activation could exert an anti-inflammatory effect and participate in the process of modulating the immune balance during 6-OHDA-induced injury, potentially through the α7nAChR/p-Erk/Foxp3 signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Dynamics and Concordance Abnormalities Among Indices of Intrinsic Brain Activity in Individuals With Subjective Cognitive Decline: A Temporal Dynamics Resting-State Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Analysis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.584863</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) are more likely to develop into Alzheimer disease (AD) in the future. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) studies have shown alterations of intrinsic brain activity (IBA) in SCD individuals. However, rs-fMRI studies to date have mainly focused on static characteristics of IBA, with few studies reporting dynamics- and concordance-related changes in IBA indices in SCD individuals. To investigate these aberrant changes, a temporal dynamic analysis of rs-fMRI data was conducted on 94 SCD individuals (71.07 ± 6.18 years, 60 female), 75 (74.36 ± 8.42 years, 35 female) mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and 82 age-, gender-, and education-matched controls (NCs; 73.88 ± 7.40 years, 49 female) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. The dynamics and concordance of the rs-fMRI indices were calculated. The results showed that SCD individuals had a lower amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations dynamics in bilateral hippocampus (HP)/parahippocampal gyrus (PHG)/fusiform gyrus (FG) and bilateral cerebellum, a lower fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation dynamics in bilateral precuneus (PreCu) and paracentral lobule, and a lower regional homogeneity dynamics in bilateral cerebellum, vermis, and left FG compared with the other two groups, whereas those in MCI patients were higher (Gaussian random field–corrected, voxel-level P &amp;lt; 0.001, cluster-level P &amp;lt; 0.05). Furthermore, SCD individuals had higher concordance in bilateral HP/PHG/FG, temporal lobe, and left midcingulate cortex than NCs, but those in MCI were lower than those in NCs. No correlation between concordance values and neuropsychological scale scores was found. SCD individuals showed both dynamics and concordance-related alterations in IBA, which indicates a compensatory mechanism in SCD individuals. Temporal dynamics analysis offers a novel approach to capturing brain alterations in individuals with SCD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Noradrenaline‐induced l‐lactate production requires d‐glucose entry and transit through the glycogen shunt in single‐cultured rat astrocytes&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a304576b-bfc9-4946-a3f0-44ef934f0f5f/jnr24783-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;‐glucose uptake in astrocytes is an essential source for the noradrenaline‐induced increase in intracellular L‐lactate. We found that intracellular &lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;‐lactate arises exclusively from the glycogen—a temporary energy store in the brain. The glycolytic pathway intermediates also support oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. At rest, a large proportion of &lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;‐glucose is metabolized in the Krebs cycle, since the resting &lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;‐lactate concentration is low. This is increased when the Krebs cycle is blocked or when cells are stimulated with noradrenaline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During cognitive efforts mediated by local neuronal networks, approximately 20% of additional energy is required; this is mediated by chemical messengers such as noradrenaline (NA). NA targets astroglial aerobic glycolysis, the hallmark of which is the end product &lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;‐lactate, a fuel for neurons. Biochemical studies have revealed that astrocytes exhibit a prominent glycogen shunt, in which a portion of &lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;‐glucose molecules entering the cytoplasm is transiently incorporated into glycogen, a buffer and source of &lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;‐glucose during increased energy demand. Here, we studied single astrocytes by measuring cytosolic L‐lactate ([lac]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) with the FRET nanosensor Laconic. We examined whether NA‐induced increase in [lac]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is influenced by: (a) 2‐deoxy‐&lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;‐glucose (2‐DG, 3 mM), a molecule that enters the cytosol and inhibits the glycolytic pathway; (b) 1,4‐dideoxy‐1,4‐imino‐d‐arabinitol (DAB, 300 µM), a potent inhibitor of glycogen phosphorylase and glycogen degradation; and (c) 3‐nitropropionic acid (3‐NPA, 1 mM), an inhibitor of the Krebs cycle. The results of these pharmacological experiments revealed that &lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;‐glucose uptake is essential for the NA‐induced increase in [lac]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, and that this exclusively arises from glycogen degradation, indicating that most, if not all, &lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;‐glucose molecules in NA‐stimulated cells transit the glycogen shunt during glycolysis. Moreover, under the defined transmembrane &lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;‐glucose gradient, the glycolytic intermediates were not only used to produce &lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;‐lactate, but also to significantly support oxidative phosphorylation, as demonstrated by an elevation in [lac]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; when Krebs cycle was inhibited. We conclude that &lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;‐lactate production via aerobic glycolysis is an essential energy pathway in NA‐stimulated astrocytes; however, oxidative metabolism is important at rest.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

ABSTRACT
The hippocampus is a key brain structure for cognitive and emotional functions. Among the hippocampal subregions, the dentate gyrus (DG) is the first station that receives multimodal sensory information from the cortex. Local‐circuit inhibitory GABAergic interneurons (INs) regulate the excitation–inhibition balance in the DG principal neurons (PNs) and therefore are critical for information processing. Similar to PNs, GABAergic INs also receive distinct inhibitory inputs. Among various classes of INs, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide‐expressing (VIP+) INs preferentially target other INs in several brain regions and thereby directly modulate the GABAergic system. However, the morpho‐physiological characteristics and postsynaptic targets of VIP+ INs in the DG are poorly understood. Here, we report that VIP+ INs in the mouse DG are highly heterogeneous based on their morpho‐physiological characteristics. In approximately two‐thirds of morphologically reconstructed cells, their axons ramify in the hilus. The remaining cells project their axons exclusively to the molecular layer (15%), to both the molecular layer and hilus (10%), or throughout the entire DG layers (8%). Generally, VIP+ INs display variable intrinsic properties and discharge patterns without clear correlation with their morphologies. Finally, VIP+ INs are recruited with a long latency in response to theta‐band cortical inputs and preferentially innervate GABAergic INs over glutamatergic PNs. In summary, VIP+ INs in the DG are composed of highly diverse subpopulations and control the DG output via disinhibition.

The distributions of mRNA of opn3/tmt‐opsins in the retina and brain of medaka were investigated by in situ hybridization. These opsins are differentially expressed in the multiple retinal and brain regions.

Abstract
The photoreceptor protein, opsin, is one of the major components for vision and photoreceptive function in animals. Although many opsins have been discovered from animal genomes, only a few nonimage‐forming functions mediated by opsins have been identified. Understanding the mRNA distribution of photoreceptor proteins is one crucial step in uncovering their photoreceptive function in animals. Here, we focus on the medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) Opsin 3 (Opn3)/Teleost multiple opsin (Tmt) system, which constitutes a separate phylogenetic group, having putative blue light photoreceptors for nonimage‐forming functions. In medaka, there is one opn3 and five tmt‐opsin orthologs. The expression pattern of the opn3/tmt‐opsins in the retina and brain was investigated by in situ hybridization. mRNAs for opn3/tmt‐opsins were distributed in the retinal ganglion cells as well as interneurons and specific brain nuclei. Specifically, hybridization signals were observed in the glutamate decarboxylase 1 (gad1)‐expressing amacrine cells for opn3, tmt1a, tmt1b, and tmt2, in the caudal lobe of the cerebellum for tmt1b and tmt2, in the cranial nerve nuclei for opn3, tmt1a, tmt1b, tmt2, and in the rostral pars distalis (adenohypophysis) for opn3. These expression patterns suggest that blue light sensing in the fish retina and brain may be involved in the integration of visual inputs, vestibular function, somatosensation, motor outputs, and pituitary endocrine regulation.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Chronic stress has different immediate and delayed effects on hippocampal calretinin‐ and somatostatin‐positive cells</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23285?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Past studies find that chronic stress alters inhibitory, GABAergic circuitry of neurons in distinct hippocampal subregions. Less clear is whether these effects persist weeks after chronic stress ends, and whether these effects involve changes in the total number of hippocampal GABAergic neurons or modulates the function of specific GABAergic subtypes. A transgenic mouse line (VGAT:Cre Ai9) containing an indelible marker for GABAergic neurons (tdTomato) throughout the brain was used to determine whether chronic stress alters total GABAergic neuronal number or the expression of two key GABAergic cell subtypes, calretinin expressing (CR+) and somatostatin expressing (SOM+) neurons, and whether these changes endure weeks later. Male and female mice were chronically stressed in wire mesh restrainers for 6h/d/21d (Str) or not (Con), and then allowed a 3 week rest period (Str‐Rest) and compared to those without a rest period (Str‐NoRest). Epifluorescent microscope images of immunohistochemistry‐processed brains were quantified to estimate the total number of fluorescently‐labeled hippocampal GABAergic neurons and the proportion that were CR+ or SOM+. Neither chronic stress nor sex altered the total number of GABAergic cells. In contrast, chronic stress reduced the expression of CR+ in the CA3 region of the hippocampus in both males and females, with robust reductions in the DG region of males, but not females, and these changes reversed following a rest period. Chronic stress also reduced the proportion of hippocampal SOM+ neurons and this reduction persisted even with a rest period. These results show chronic stress dynamically reduced CR expression without changing total inhibitory neuronal number and point to CR as a potential new lead to understand mechanisms by which chronic stress alters hippocampal function.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
Hippocampal theta oscillations have been implicated in spatial memory function in both rodents and humans. What is less clear is how hippocampal theta interacts with higher frequency oscillations to support long‐term memory. Here we asked 10 presurgical epilepsy patients undergoing intracranial EEG recording to perform a long‐term spatial memory task in desktop virtual reality and found that increased theta power in two discrete bands (“low” 2‐5 Hz and “high” 6‐11 Hz) during cued retrieval was associated with improved task performance. Similarly, increased coupling between “low” theta phase and gamma amplitude during the same period was associated with improved task performance. Finally, low and high gamma amplitude appeared to peak at different phases of the theta cycle; providing a novel connection between human hippocampal function and rodent data. These results help to elucidate the role of theta oscillations and theta‐gamma phase‐amplitude coupling in human long‐term memory.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23281?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Theta oscillations in the hippocampus have many behavioral correlates, with the magnitude and vigor of ongoing movement being the most salient. Many consider correlates of locomotion with hippocampal theta to be a confound in delineating theta contributions to cognitive processes. Theory and empirical experiments suggest theta‐movement relationships are important if spatial navigation is to support higher cognitive processes. In the current study, we tested if variations in speed modulation of hippocampal theta can predict spatial learning rates in the water maze. Using multi‐step regression, we find that the magnitude and robustness of hippocampal theta frequency versus speed scaling can predict water maze learning rates. Using a generalized linear model, we also demonstrate that speed and water maze learning are the best predictors of hippocampal theta frequency and amplitude. Our findings suggest movement‐speed correlations with hippocampal theta frequency may be actively used in spatial learning.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: The effect of body mass index on hippocampal morphology and memory performance in late childhood and adolescence</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23280?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Childhood obesity is associated with negative physiological and cognitive health outcomes. The hippocampus is a diverse subcortical structure involved in learned feeding behaviors and energy regulation, and research has shown that the hippocampus is vulnerable to the effects of excess adiposity. Previous studies have demonstrated reduced hippocampal volume in overweight and obese children; however, it is unclear if certain subregions are selectively affected. The purpose of this study was to determine how excess body weight influences regional hippocampal surface morphology and memory performance in a large cross‐sectional cohort of 588 children and adolescents between 8.33 and 19.92 years of age using body mass index expressed as a percentage of the 95th percentile cutoff (%BMIp95). We demonstrate %BMIp95 is associated with reduced radial thickness in the superior anterior region of the left hippocampus, and this relationship is predominantly driven by children younger than 14 years. We also found %BMIp95 was associated with worse performance on a spatial episodic memory task and this relationship was partially mediated by the radial thickness of the significant shape cluster. These results demonstrate the differential influence of excess body weight on regional hippocampal structure and hippocampal‐dependent behavior in children and adolescents.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Bidirectional modulation of hippocampal and amygdala synaptic plasticity by post‐weaning obesogenic diet intake in male rats: Influence of the duration of diet exposure</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23278?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Obesity is a chronic condition associated with adverse memory and emotional outcomes in humans and animal models. We have recently demonstrated that post‐weaning (i.e., periadolescent) high‐fat diet (HFD)‐induced obesity has opposite effect on hippocampal and amygdala‐dependent memory in rodents: while HFD consumption impairs spatial and relational memory, it enhances cue‐dependent emotional memory. However, it is still not clear whether this bidirectional HFD effect on memory is related to bidirectional alterations of hippocampal and amygdala synaptic plasticity and if it is influenced by the duration of diet intake. In the current study, we compared in male rats the impact of 2–3 and 6–7 months of HFD intake starting at weaning, thus covering adolescence, on in vivo long‐term potentiation (LTP) recorded simultaneously in the hippocampal area CA1 and the basolateral amygdala (BLA). As expected, 6–7 months of HFD intake abolished LTP in the CA1 and enhanced LTP in the BLA. However, 2–3 months of of HFD exposure enhanced LTP in both CA1 and BLA suggesting a transient compensatory mechanism in hippocampus. These results indicate that post‐weaning HFD intake progressively leads to bidirectional modulation of hippocampal and amygdala synaptic plasticity, as we previously demonstrated for related memory processes, yet with a different temporal dynamic.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Effects of adolescent experience of food restriction and exercise on spatial learning and open field exploration of female rats</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23275?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
The hippocampus carries out multiple functions: spatial cognition dorsally (DH) and regulation of emotionality‐driven behavior ventrally (VH). Previously, we showed that dendrites of DH and VH pyramidal neurons of female rats are still developing robustly during adolescence and are altered by the experience of food restriction and voluntary exercise on a wheel. We tested whether such anatomical changes during adolescence impact anxiety‐like behavior and spatial cognition. Four groups of female rats were evaluated for these behaviors: those with wheel access in its cage from postnatal day (P) 36–44 (EX); those with food access restricted to 1 hr per day, from P40 to 44 (FR); those with EX from P36 to 44, combined with FR from P40 to 44, which we will refer to as EX + FR; and controls, CON (no EX, no FR). Open field test for anxiety‐like behavior and active place avoidance test for spatial cognition were conducted at P47–49, the age when food restricted animals have restored body weight, or at P54–56, to identify more enduring effects. Anxiety‐like behavior was elevated for the EX and FR groups at P47–49 but not for the EX + FR group. By P54–56, the EX + FR and EX groups exhibited less anxiety‐like behavior, indicating a beneficial delayed main effect of exercise. There was a beneficial main effect of food restriction upon cognition, as the FR group showed cognition superior to CONs' at P44–46 and P54–56, while the EX + FR animals also showed enhanced spatial learning at P54–56. EX + FR animals with best adaptation to the feeding schedule showed the best spatial learning performance but with a delay. The EX group exhibited only a transient improvement. These findings indicate that FR, EX, and EX + FR in mid‐adolescence are all beneficial in reducing anxiety‐like behavior and improving spatial cognition but with subtle differences in the timing of their manifestation, possibly reflecting the protracted maturation of the hippocampus.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Enhancement of intrinsic neuronal excitability‐mediated by a reduction in hyperpolarization‐activated cation current (Ih) in hippocampal CA1 neurons in a rat model of traumatic brain injury</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23270?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with epileptiform activity in the hippocampus; however, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully determined. The goal was to understand what changes take place in intrinsic neuronal physiology in the hippocampus after blunt force trauma to the cortex. In this context, hyperpolarization‐activated cation current (Ih) currents may have a critical role in modulating the neuronal intrinsic membrane excitability; therefore, its contribution to the TBI‐induced hyperexcitability was assessed. In a model of TBI caused by controlled cortical impact (CCI), the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of pyramidal neurons were examined 1 week after TBI induction in rats. Whole‐cell patch‐clamp recordings were performed under current‐ and voltage‐clamp conditions following ionotropic receptors blockade. Induction of TBI caused changes in the intrinsic excitability of pyramidal neurons, as shown by a significant increase and decrease in firing frequency and in the rheobase current, respectively (p &amp;lt; .05). The evoked firing rate and the action potential time to peak were also significantly increased and decreased, respectively (p &amp;lt; .05). In the TBI group, the amplitude of instantaneous and steady‐state Ih currents was both significantly smaller than those in the control group (p &amp;lt; .05). The Ih current density was also significantly decreased (p &amp;lt; .001). Findings indicated that TBI led to an increase in the intrinsic excitability in CA1 pyramidal neurons and changes in Ih current could be, in part, one of the underlying mechanisms involved in this hyperexcitability.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Molecular mechanisms within the dentate gyrus and the perirhinal cortex interact during discrimination of similar nonspatial memories</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23269?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Differentiating between similar memories is a crucial cognitive function that enables correct episodic memory formation. The ability to separate the components of memories into distinct representations is thought to rely on a computational process known as pattern separation, by which differences are amplified to disambiguate similar events. Although pattern separation has been localized to the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus and shown to occur in a spatial domain, this cognitive function takes place also during processing of other types of information. In particular, there is some debate on whether the DG participates in pattern separation of nonspatial representations. Considering the classic role of the Prh in the acquisition and storage of object memories in general and tasks with similar features in particular, this cognitive function could rely more heavily on perirhinal regions when object‐related information is processed. Here we show that two plasticity‐related proteins, BDNF, and Arc, are required in the DG for nonspatial mnemonic differentiation. Moreover, we found that the crucial role of the DG is transient since activity of AMPAR is only required in the Prh but not the DG during differentiated object memory retrieval. Additionally, this memory is not modifiable by postacquisition rhBDNF infusions in the DG that are known to improve memory when given in the Prh. This highlights a differential role of Prh and DG during differentiated object memory consolidation. Additionally, we found that these molecular mechanisms actively interact in the DG and Prh for the formation of distinguishable memories, with infusions of rhBDNF in the Prh being able to rescue mnemonic deficits caused by reduced Arc expression in the DG. These results reveal a complex interaction between plasticity mechanisms in the Prh and DG for nonspatial pattern separation and posit the Prh as the key structure where unique object representations are stored.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Multi‐omics analysis suggests enhanced epileptogenesis in the Cornu Ammonis 3 of the pilocarpine model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23268?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by the occurrence of seizures, and histopathological abnormalities in the mesial temporal lobe structures, mainly hippocampal sclerosis (HS). We used a multi‐omics approach to determine the profile of transcript and protein expression in the dorsal and ventral hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) and Cornu Ammonis 3 (CA3) in an animal model of MTLE induced by pilocarpine. We performed label‐free proteomics and RNAseq from laser‐microdissected tissue isolated from pilocarpine‐induced Wistar rats. We divided the DG and CA3 into dorsal and ventral areas and analyzed them separately. We performed a data integration analysis and evaluated enriched signaling pathways, as well as the integrated networks generated based on the gene ontology processes. Our results indicate differences in the transcriptomic and proteomic profiles among the DG and the CA3 subfields of the hippocampus. Moreover, our data suggest that epileptogenesis is enhanced in the CA3 region when compared to the DG, with most abnormalities in transcript and protein levels occurring in the CA3. Furthermore, our results show that the epileptogenesis in the pilocarpine model involves predominantly abnormal regulation of excitatory neuronal mechanisms mediated by N‐methyl D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptors, changes in the serotonin signaling, and neuronal activity controlled by calcium/calmodulin‐dependent protein kinase (CaMK) regulation and leucine‐rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2)/WNT signaling pathways.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Chronic stress differentially alters mRNA expression of opioid peptides and receptors in the dorsal hippocampus of female and male rats</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25115?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>US females compared to US males had: 1) more PENK‐expressing granule cells; 2) fewer OPRD1 expressing granule cells; and 3) more OPRM1‐expressing interneurons in CA3b. CIS females compared to CIS males had less: 1) PDYN expression in granule cells; 2) OPRD1 expression in interneurons in CA3b; 3) OPRM1 probe expression in CA2/3a and granule cell expression; 4) OPRK1 expression in interneurons in CA2/3a and the hilus of the dentate gyrus.






ABSTRACT
Chronic immobilization stress (CIS) results in sex‐dependent changes in opioid peptide levels and receptor subcellular distributions within the rat dorsal hippocampus which are paralleled with an inability for males to acquire conditioned place preference (CPP) to oxycodone. Here, RNAScope in situ hybridization was used to determine the expression of hippocampal opioid peptides and receptors in unstressed (US) and CIS estrus female and male adult (~ 14 wk) Sprague Dawley rats. In all groups, dentate granule cells expressed PENK and PDYN; additionally, numerous interneurons expressed PENK. OPRD1 and OPRM1 were primarily expressed in interneurons, and to a lesser extent, in pyramidal and granule cells. OPRK1‐was expressed in sparsely distributed interneurons. There were few baseline sex differences: US females compared to US males had more PENK‐expressing and fewer OPRD1‐expressing granule cells and more OPRM1‐expressing CA3b interneurons. Several expression differences emerged after CIS. Both CIS females and males compared to their US counterparts had elevated: 1) PENK‐expressing dentate granule cells and interneurons in CA1 and CA2/3a; 2) OPRD1 probe number and cell expression in CA1, CA2/3a and CA3b and the dentate gyrus; and 3) OPRK1‐expressing interneurons in the dentate hilus. Also, CIS males compared to US males had elevated: 1) PDYN expression in granule cells; 2) OPRD1 probe and interneuron expression in CA2/3a; 3) OPRM1 in granule cells; and 4) OPRK1 interneuron expression in CA2/3a. The sex‐specific changes in hippocampal opioid gene expression may impact network properties and synaptic plasticity processes that may contribute to the attenuation of oxycodone CPP in CIS males.

&lt;p&gt;Punishment feels bad, but relief from it feels good. Correspondingly, negative memories are formed for cues when these are associated with the occurrence of punishment. In contrast, positive memories result from their association with relief. Such timing‐dependent valence reversal is observed in humans and in animals alike. Using &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; larvae, Weiglein et al. present an odor cue either before or after optogenetically activating single, identified dopaminergic neurons known to mediate punishment. This reveals that these dopaminergic neurons are heterogeneous: DAN‐f1 establishes timing‐dependent valence reversal, whereas DAN‐d1 does not. Together with recent findings in the reward domain and from adult &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, this suggests that such heterogeneity might be a more general principle of reinforcement processing through dopamine neurons.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dopamine serves many functions, and dopamine neurons are correspondingly diverse. We use a combination of optogenetics, behavioral experiments, and high‐resolution video‐tracking to probe for the functional capacities of two single, identified dopamine neurons in larval &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. The DAN‐f1 and the DAN‐d1 neuron were recently found to carry aversive teaching signals during Pavlovian olfactory learning. We enquire into a fundamental feature of these teaching signals, namely their temporal “fingerprint”. That is, receiving punishment feels bad, whereas being relieved from it feels good, and animals and humans alike learn with opposite valence about the occurrence and the termination of punishment (the same principle applies in the appetitive domain, with opposite sign). We find that DAN‐f1 but not DAN‐d1 can mediate such timing‐dependent valence reversal: presenting an odor before DAN‐f1 activation leads to learned avoidance of the odor (punishment memory), whereas presenting the odor upon termination of DAN‐f1 activation leads to learned approach (relief memory). In contrast, DAN‐d1 confers punishment memory only. These effects are further characterized in terms of the impact of the duration of optogenetic activation, the temporal stability of the memories thus established, and the specific microbehavioral patterns of locomotion through which they are expressed. Together with recent findings in the appetitive domain and from adult &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, our results suggest that heterogeneity in the temporal fingerprint of teaching signals might be a more general principle of reinforcement processing through dopamine neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Chronic stress has different immediate and delayed effects on hippocampal calretinin‐ and somatostatin‐positive cells</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past studies find that chronic stress alters inhibitory, GABAergic circuitry of neurons in distinct hippocampal subregions. Less clear is whether these effects persist weeks after chronic stress ends, and whether these effects involve changes in the total number of hippocampal GABAergic neurons or modulates the function of specific GABAergic subtypes. A transgenic mouse line (&lt;i&gt;VGAT:Cre Ai9&lt;/i&gt;) containing an indelible marker for GABAergic neurons (tdTomato) throughout the brain was used to determine whether chronic stress alters total GABAergic neuronal number or the expression of two key GABAergic cell subtypes, calretinin expressing (CR+) and somatostatin expressing (SOM+) neurons, and whether these changes endure weeks later. Male and female mice were chronically stressed in wire mesh restrainers for 6h/d/21d (Str) or not (Con), and then allowed a 3 week rest period (Str‐Rest) and compared to those without a rest period (Str‐NoRest). Epifluorescent microscope images of immunohistochemistry‐processed brains were quantified to estimate the total number of fluorescently‐labeled hippocampal GABAergic neurons and the proportion that were CR+ or SOM+. Neither chronic stress nor sex altered the total number of GABAergic cells. In contrast, chronic stress reduced the expression of CR+ in the CA3 region of the hippocampus in both males and females, with robust reductions in the DG region of males, but not females, and these changes reversed following a rest period. Chronic stress also reduced the proportion of hippocampal SOM+ neurons and this reduction persisted even with a rest period. These results show chronic stress dynamically reduced CR expression without changing total inhibitory neuronal number and point to CR as a potential new lead to understand mechanisms by which chronic stress alters hippocampal function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal theta oscillations have been implicated in spatial memory function in both rodents and humans. What is less clear is how hippocampal theta interacts with higher frequency oscillations to support long‐term memory. Here we asked 10 presurgical epilepsy patients undergoing intracranial EEG recording to perform a long‐term spatial memory task in desktop virtual reality and found that increased theta power in two discrete bands (“low” 2‐5 Hz and “high” 6‐11 Hz) during cued retrieval was associated with improved task performance. Similarly, increased coupling between “low” theta phase and gamma amplitude during the same period was associated with improved task performance. Finally, low and high gamma amplitude appeared to peak at different phases of the theta cycle; providing a novel connection between human hippocampal function and rodent data. These results help to elucidate the role of theta oscillations and theta‐gamma phase‐amplitude coupling in human long‐term memory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theta oscillations in the hippocampus have many behavioral correlates, with the magnitude and vigor of ongoing movement being the most salient. Many consider correlates of locomotion with hippocampal theta to be a confound in delineating theta contributions to cognitive processes. Theory and empirical experiments suggest theta‐movement relationships are important if spatial navigation is to support higher cognitive processes. In the current study, we tested if variations in speed modulation of hippocampal theta can predict spatial learning rates in the water maze. Using multi‐step regression, we find that the magnitude and robustness of hippocampal theta frequency versus speed scaling can predict water maze learning rates. Using a generalized linear model, we also demonstrate that speed and water maze learning are the best predictors of hippocampal theta frequency and amplitude. Our findings suggest movement‐speed correlations with hippocampal theta frequency may be actively used in spatial learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Childhood obesity is associated with negative physiological and cognitive health outcomes. The hippocampus is a diverse subcortical structure involved in learned feeding behaviors and energy regulation, and research has shown that the hippocampus is vulnerable to the effects of excess adiposity. Previous studies have demonstrated reduced hippocampal volume in overweight and obese children; however, it is unclear if certain subregions are selectively affected. The purpose of this study was to determine how excess body weight influences regional hippocampal surface morphology and memory performance in a large cross‐sectional cohort of 588 children and adolescents between 8.33 and 19.92 years of age using body mass index expressed as a percentage of the 95th percentile cutoff (%BMIp95). We demonstrate %BMIp95 is associated with reduced radial thickness in the superior anterior region of the left hippocampus, and this relationship is predominantly driven by children younger than 14 years. We also found %BMIp95 was associated with worse performance on a spatial episodic memory task and this relationship was partially mediated by the radial thickness of the significant shape cluster. These results demonstrate the differential influence of excess body weight on regional hippocampal structure and hippocampal‐dependent behavior in children and adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obesity is a chronic condition associated with adverse memory and emotional outcomes in humans and animal models. We have recently demonstrated that post‐weaning (i.e., periadolescent) high‐fat diet (HFD)‐induced obesity has opposite effect on hippocampal and amygdala‐dependent memory in rodents: while HFD consumption impairs spatial and relational memory, it enhances cue‐dependent emotional memory. However, it is still not clear whether this bidirectional HFD effect on memory is related to bidirectional alterations of hippocampal and amygdala synaptic plasticity and if it is influenced by the duration of diet intake. In the current study, we compared in male rats the impact of 2–3 and 6–7 months of HFD intake starting at weaning, thus covering adolescence, on in vivo long‐term potentiation (LTP) recorded simultaneously in the hippocampal area CA1 and the basolateral amygdala (BLA). As expected, 6–7 months of HFD intake abolished LTP in the CA1 and enhanced LTP in the BLA. However, 2–3 months of of HFD exposure enhanced LTP in both CA1 and BLA suggesting a transient compensatory mechanism in hippocampus. These results indicate that post‐weaning HFD intake progressively leads to bidirectional modulation of hippocampal and amygdala synaptic plasticity, as we previously demonstrated for related memory processes, yet with a different temporal dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Previously, we showed that dendrites of DH and VH pyramidal neurons of female rats are still developing robustly during adolescence and are altered by the experience of food restriction and voluntary exercise on a wheel. We tested whether such anatomical changes during adolescence impact anxiety‐like behavior and spatial cognition. Four groups of female rats were evaluated for these behaviors: those with wheel access in its cage from postnatal day (P) 36–44 (EX); those with food access restricted to 1 hr per day, from P40 to 44 (FR); those with EX from P36 to 44, combined with FR from P40 to 44, which we will refer to as EX + FR; and controls, CON (no EX, no FR). Open field test for anxiety‐like behavior and active place avoidance test for spatial cognition were conducted at P47–49, the age when food restricted animals have restored body weight, or at P54–56, to identify more enduring effects. Anxiety‐like behavior was elevated for the EX and FR groups at P47–49 but not for the EX + FR group. By P54–56, the EX + FR and EX groups exhibited less anxiety‐like behavior, indicating a beneficial delayed main effect of exercise. There was a beneficial main effect of food restriction upon cognition, as the FR group showed cognition superior to CONs' at P44–46 and P54–56, while the EX + FR animals also showed enhanced spatial learning at P54–56. EX + FR animals with best adaptation to the feeding schedule showed the best spatial learning performance but with a delay. The EX group exhibited only a transient improvement. These findings indicate that FR, EX, and EX + FR in mid‐adolescence are all beneficial in reducing anxiety‐like behavior and improving spatial cognition but with subtle differences in the timing of their manifestation, possibly reflecting the protracted maturation of the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Enhancement of intrinsic neuronal excitability‐mediated by a reduction in hyperpolarization‐activated cation current (Ih) in hippocampal CA1 neurons in a rat model of traumatic brain injury</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with epileptiform activity in the hippocampus; however, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully determined. The goal was to understand what changes take place in intrinsic neuronal physiology in the hippocampus after blunt force trauma to the cortex. In this context, hyperpolarization‐activated cation current (I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;) currents may have a critical role in modulating the neuronal intrinsic membrane excitability; therefore, its contribution to the TBI‐induced hyperexcitability was assessed. In a model of TBI caused by controlled cortical impact (CCI), the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of pyramidal neurons were examined 1 week after TBI induction in rats. Whole‐cell patch‐clamp recordings were performed under current‐ and voltage‐clamp conditions following ionotropic receptors blockade. Induction of TBI caused changes in the intrinsic excitability of pyramidal neurons, as shown by a significant increase and decrease in firing frequency and in the rheobase current, respectively (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .05). The evoked firing rate and the action potential time to peak were also significantly increased and decreased, respectively (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .05). In the TBI group, the amplitude of instantaneous and steady‐state I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; currents was both significantly smaller than those in the control group (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .05). The I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; current density was also significantly decreased (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .001). Findings indicated that TBI led to an increase in the intrinsic excitability in CA1 pyramidal neurons and changes in I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; current could be, in part, one of the underlying mechanisms involved in this hyperexcitability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Molecular mechanisms within the dentate gyrus and the perirhinal cortex interact during discrimination of similar nonspatial memories</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23269?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Differentiating between similar memories is a crucial cognitive function that enables correct episodic memory formation. The ability to separate the components of memories into distinct representations is thought to rely on a computational process known as pattern separation, by which differences are amplified to disambiguate similar events. Although pattern separation has been localized to the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus and shown to occur in a spatial domain, this cognitive function takes place also during processing of other types of information. In particular, there is some debate on whether the DG participates in pattern separation of nonspatial representations. Considering the classic role of the Prh in the acquisition and storage of object memories in general and tasks with similar features in particular, this cognitive function could rely more heavily on perirhinal regions when object‐related information is processed. Here we show that two plasticity‐related proteins, BDNF, and Arc, are required in the DG for nonspatial mnemonic differentiation. Moreover, we found that the crucial role of the DG is transient since activity of AMPAR is only required in the Prh but not the DG during differentiated object memory retrieval. Additionally, this memory is not modifiable by postacquisition rhBDNF infusions in the DG that are known to improve memory when given in the Prh. This highlights a differential role of Prh and DG during differentiated object memory consolidation. Additionally, we found that these molecular mechanisms actively interact in the DG and Prh for the formation of distinguishable memories, with infusions of rhBDNF in the Prh being able to rescue mnemonic deficits caused by reduced Arc expression in the DG. These results reveal a complex interaction between plasticity mechanisms in the Prh and DG for nonspatial pattern separation and posit the Prh as the key structure where unique object representations are stored.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Multi‐omics analysis suggests enhanced epileptogenesis in the Cornu Ammonis 3 of the pilocarpine model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by the occurrence of seizures, and histopathological abnormalities in the mesial temporal lobe structures, mainly hippocampal sclerosis (HS). We used a multi‐omics approach to determine the profile of transcript and protein expression in the dorsal and ventral hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) and &lt;i&gt;Cornu Ammonis&lt;/i&gt; 3 (CA3) in an animal model of MTLE induced by pilocarpine. We performed label‐free proteomics and RNAseq from laser‐microdissected tissue isolated from pilocarpine‐induced Wistar rats. We divided the DG and CA3 into dorsal and ventral areas and analyzed them separately. We performed a data integration analysis and evaluated enriched signaling pathways, as well as the integrated networks generated based on the gene ontology processes. Our results indicate differences in the transcriptomic and proteomic profiles among the DG and the CA3 subfields of the hippocampus. Moreover, our data suggest that epileptogenesis is enhanced in the CA3 region when compared to the DG, with most abnormalities in transcript and protein levels occurring in the CA3. Furthermore, our results show that the epileptogenesis in the pilocarpine model involves predominantly abnormal regulation of excitatory neuronal mechanisms mediated by N‐methyl D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptors, changes in the serotonin signaling, and neuronal activity controlled by calcium/calmodulin‐dependent protein kinase (CaMK) regulation and leucine‐rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2)/WNT signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;US females compared to US males had: 1) more &lt;i&gt;PENK&lt;/i&gt;‐expressing granule cells; 2) fewer &lt;i&gt;OPRD1&lt;/i&gt; expressing granule cells; and 3) more &lt;i&gt;OPRM1&lt;/i&gt;‐expressing interneurons in CA3b.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic immobilization stress (CIS) results in sex‐dependent changes in opioid peptide levels and receptor subcellular distributions within the rat dorsal hippocampus which are paralleled with an inability for males to acquire conditioned place preference (CPP) to oxycodone. Here, RNAScope &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization was used to determine the expression of hippocampal opioid peptides and receptors in unstressed (US) and CIS estrus female and male adult (~ 14 wk) Sprague Dawley rats. In all groups, dentate granule cells expressed &lt;i&gt;PENK&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;PDYN&lt;/i&gt;; additionally, numerous interneurons expressed &lt;i&gt;PENK&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;OPRD1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;OPRM1&lt;/i&gt; were primarily expressed in interneurons, and to a lesser extent, in pyramidal and granule cells. &lt;i&gt;OPRK1&lt;/i&gt;‐was expressed in sparsely distributed interneurons. &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;There were few baseline sex differences&lt;/span&gt;: US females compared to US males had more &lt;i&gt;PENK‐&lt;/i&gt;expressing and fewer &lt;i&gt;OPRD1&lt;/i&gt;‐expressing granule cells and more &lt;i&gt;OPRM1‐&lt;/i&gt;expressing CA3b interneurons. &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Several expression differences emerged after CIS&lt;/span&gt;. Both CIS females and males compared to their US counterparts had elevated: 1) &lt;i&gt;PENK&lt;/i&gt;‐expressing dentate granule cells and interneurons in CA1 and CA2/3a; 2) &lt;i&gt;OPRD1&lt;/i&gt; probe number and cell expression in CA1, CA2/3a and CA3b and the dentate gyrus; and 3) &lt;i&gt;OPRK1&lt;/i&gt;‐expressing interneurons in the dentate hilus. Also, CIS males compared to US males had elevated: 1) &lt;i&gt;PDYN&lt;/i&gt; expression in granule cells; 2) &lt;i&gt;OPRD1&lt;/i&gt; probe and interneuron expression in CA2/3a; 3) &lt;i&gt;OPRM1&lt;/i&gt; in granule cells; and 4) &lt;i&gt;OPRK1&lt;/i&gt; interneuron expression in CA2/3a. The sex‐specific changes in hippocampal opioid gene expression may impact network properties and synaptic plasticity processes that may contribute to the attenuation of oxycodone CPP in CIS males.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Administration of 5‐bromo‐2′‐deoxyuridine interferes with neuroblast proliferation and promotes apoptotic cell death in the rat cerebellar neuroepithelium</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25005?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>The present study reveals that low doses of BrdU (from 25 to 75 μg/g) have no deleterious effects on the development of the rat cerebellar neuroepithelium. Our results also denote that the BrdU injection at doses ranging from 100 to 300 μg/g alters neuroblasts proliferation and induces the activation of apoptotic cellular events in the prenatal cerebellum.







Abstract
The current study was conducted to assess whether a single administration of 5‐bromo‐2′‐deoxyuridine (BrdU) interferes with cell proliferation and leads to the activation of apoptotic cellular events in the prenatal cerebellum. BrdU effects across a wide range of doses (25–300 μg/g b.w.) were analyzed using immunohistochemical and ultrastructural procedures. The pregnant rats were injected with BrdU at embryonic day 13, and their fetuses were sacrificed from 5 to 35 hr after exposure. The quantification of several parameters such as the density of mitotic figures, and BrdU and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)‐reactive cells showed that, in comparison with the saline injected rats, the administration of BrdU impairs the proliferative behavior of neuroepithelial cells. The above‐mentioned parameters were significantly reduced in rats injected with 100 μg/g b.w. of BrdU. The reduction was more evident using 200 μg/g b.w. The most severe effects were found with 300 μg/g b.w. of BrdU. The present findings also revealed that high doses of BrdU lead to the activation of apoptotic cellular events as evidenced by both terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick‐end labeling (TUNEL) assay and immunohistochemistry for active caspase‐3. In comparison with saline rats, many apoptotic cells were found in rats injected with 100 μg/g b.w. of BrdU. The number of dying cells increased with 200 μg/g b.w. The most important number of apoptotic cells were observed in animals injected with 300 μg/g b.w. of BrdU. Ultrastructural studies confirmed the presence of neuroblasts at different stages of apoptosis.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: The SNARE regulator Complexin3 is a target of the cone circadian clock</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25004?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Complexin3 (CPLX3) is a SNARE regulator at ribbon synapses. Here, we show that the expression of CPLX3 is rhythmic at the synaptic terminal of cone photoreceptors with high values during the day and lower values at night. Silencing the circadian clock specifically in cones eliminates rhythmic expression of the protein in cone pedicles. Rhythmic expression of CPLX3 may modulate the synaptic transmission of cone signals to downstream retinal circuits between day and night.







Abstract
BMAL1 is a core component of the mammalian circadian clockwork. Removal of BMAL1 from the retina significantly affects visual information processing in both rod and cone pathways. To identify potential pathways and/or molecules through which BMAL1 alters signal transmission at the cone pedicle, we performed an RNA‐seq differential expression analysis between cone‐specific Bmal1 knockout cones (cone‐Bmal1−/−) and wild‐type (WT) cones. We found 88 genes differentially expressed. Among these, Complexin3 (Cplx3), a SNARE regulator at ribbon synapses, was downregulated fivefold in the mutant cones. The purpose of this work was to determine whether BMAL1 and/or the cone clock controls CPLX3 protein expression at cone pedicles. We found that CPLX3 expression level was decreased twofold in cone‐Bmal1−/− cones. Furthermore, CPLX3 expression was downregulated at night compared to the day in WT cones but remained constitutively low in mutant cones both day and night. The transcript and protein expression levels of Cplx4—the other complexin expressed in cones—were similar in WT and mutant cones; in WT cones, CPLX4 protein level did not change with the time of day. In silico analysis revealed four potential BMAL1:CLOCK binding sites upstream from exon one of Cplx3 and none upstream of exon one of Cplx4. Our results suggest that CPLX3 expression is regulated at the transcriptional level by the cone clock. The modulation of CPLX3 may be a mechanism by which the clock controls the cone synaptic transfer function to second‐order cells and thereby impacts retinal signal processing during the day/night cycle.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Ontogeny of the electric organ discharge and of the papillae of the electrocytes in the weakly electric fish Campylomormyrus rhynchophorus (Teleostei: Mormyridae)</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25003?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>The electric organ (EO) of mormyrid weakly electric fish is located in the tail on either side of the spinal cord. It consists of dorsal and ventral columns of serially arranged electrocytes which are derivatives of muscle cells. In Campylomormyrus rhynchophorus it produces a long triphasic discharge. We investigated the development of the EOD and the morphology of the electrocytes in order to correlate ontogenetic changes in length and shape of the EOD with dynamic morphological characteristics of the electrocyte, in particular the formation of surface evaginations (papillae) of the anterior face of electrocytes.







Abstract
The electric organ of the mormyrid weakly electric fish, Campylomormyrus rhynchophorus (Boulenger, 1898), undergoes changes in both the electric organ discharge (EOD) and the light and electron microscopic morphology as the fish mature from the juvenile to the adult form. Of particular interest was the appearance of papillae, surface specializations of the uninnervated anterior face of the electrocyte, which have been hypothesized to increase the duration of the EOD. In a 24.5 mm long juvenile the adult electric organ (EO) was not yet functional, and the electrocytes lacked papillae. A 40 mm long juvenile, which produced a short biphasic EOD of 1.3 ms duration, shows small papillae (average area 136 μm2). In contrast, the EOD of a 79 mm long juvenile was triphasic. The large increase in duration of the EOD to 23.2 ms was accompanied by a small change in size of the papillae (average area 159 μm2). Similarly, a 150 mm long adult produced a triphasic EOD of comparable duration to the younger stage (24.7 ms) but featured a prominent increase in size of the papillae (average area 402 μm2). Thus, there was no linear correlation between EOD duration and papillary size. The most prominent ultrastructural change was at the level of the myofilaments, which regularly extended into the papillae, only in the oldest specimen—probably serving a supporting function. Physiological mechanisms, like gene expression levels, as demonstrated in some Campylomormyrus species, might be more important concerning the duration of the EOD.</content:encoded>
