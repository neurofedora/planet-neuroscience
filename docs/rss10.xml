	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.17244</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The classical XY model is a lattice model of statistical mechanics notable
for its universality in the rich hierarchy of the optical, laser and condensed
matter systems. We show how to build complex structures for machine learning
based on the XY model's nonlinear blocks. The final target is to reproduce the
deep learning architectures, which can perform complicated tasks usually
attributed to such architectures: speech recognition, visual processing, or
other complex classification types with high quality. We developed the robust
and transparent approach for the construction of such models, which has
universal applicability (i.e. does not strongly connect to any particular
physical system), allows many possible extensions while at the same time
preserving the simplicity of the methodology.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: A Framework for Knowledge Integrated Evolutionary Algorithms. (arXiv:2103.16897v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16897</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;One of the main reasons for the success of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) is
their general-purposeness, i.e., the fact that they can be applied
straightforwardly to a broad range of optimization problems, without any
specific prior knowledge. On the other hand, it has been shown that
incorporating a priori knowledge, such as expert knowledge or empirical
findings, can significantly improve the performance of an EA. However,
integrating knowledge in EAs poses numerous challenges. It is often the case
that the features of the search space are unknown, hence any knowledge
associated with the search space properties can be hardly used. In addition, a
priori knowledge is typically problem-specific and hard to generalize. In this
paper, we propose a framework, called Knowledge Integrated Evolutionary
Algorithm (KIEA), which facilitates the integration of existing knowledge into
EAs. Notably, the KIEA framework is EA-agnostic (i.e., it works with any
evolutionary algorithm), problem-independent (i.e., it is not dedicated to a
specific type of problems), expandable (i.e., its knowledge base can grow over
time). Furthermore, the framework integrates knowledge while the EA is running,
thus optimizing the use of the needed computational power. In the preliminary
experiments shown here, we observe that the KIEA framework produces in the
worst case an 80% improvement on the converge time, w.r.t. the corresponding
&quot;knowledge-free&quot; EA counterpart.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: A Signal-Centric Perspective on the Evolution of Symbolic Communication. (arXiv:2103.16882v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16882</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The evolution of symbolic communication is a longstanding open research
question in biology. While some theories suggest that it originated from
sub-symbolic communication (i.e., iconic or indexical), little experimental
evidence exists on how organisms can actually evolve to define a shared set of
symbols with unique interpretable meaning, thus being capable of encoding and
decoding discrete information. Here, we use a simple synthetic model composed
of sender and receiver agents controlled by Continuous-Time Recurrent Neural
Networks, which are optimized by means of neuro-evolution. We characterize
signal decoding as either regression or classification, with limited and
unlimited signal amplitude. First, we show how this choice affects the
complexity of the evolutionary search, and leads to different levels of
generalization. We then assess the effect of noise, and test the evolved
signaling system in a referential game. In various settings, we observe agents
evolving to share a dictionary of symbols, with each symbol spontaneously
associated to a 1-D unique signal. Finally, we analyze the constellation of
signals associated to the evolved signaling systems and note that in most cases
these resemble a Pulse Amplitude Modulation system.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Channel-Based Attention for LCC Using Sentinel-2 Time Series. (arXiv:2103.16836v1 [cs.CV])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16836</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are getting increasing attention to deal with
Land Cover Classification (LCC) relying on Satellite Image Time Series (SITS).
Though high performances can be achieved, the rationale of a prediction yielded
by a DNN often remains unclear. An architecture expressing predictions with
respect to input channels is thus proposed in this paper. It relies on
convolutional layers and an attention mechanism weighting the importance of
each channel in the final classification decision. The correlation between
channels is taken into account to set up shared kernels and lower model
complexity. Experiments based on a Sentinel-2 SITS show promising results.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16812</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Descending predictive feedback (DPF) is an ubiquitous yet unexplained
phenomenon in the central nervous system. Motivated by recent observations on
motor-related signals in the visual system, we approach this problem from a
sensorimotor standpoint and make use of optimal controllers to explain DPF. We
define and analyze DPF in the optimal control context, revisiting several
control problems (state feedback, full control, and output feedback) to explore
conditions that necessitate DPF. We find that even small deviations from the
unconstrained state feedback problem (e.g. incomplete sensing, communication
delay) necessitate DPF in the optimal controller. We also discuss parallels
between controller structure and observations from neuroscience. In particular,
the system level (SLS) controller displays DPF patterns compatible with
predictive coding theory and easily accommodates signaling restrictions (e.g.
delay) typical to neurons, making it a candidate for use in sensorimotor
modeling.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Self-organization through adaptive rewiring of random neural networks
generates brain-like topologies comprising modular small-world structures with
rich club effects, merely as the product of optimizing the network topology. In
the nervous system, spatial organization is optimized no less by rewiring,
through minimizing wiring distance and maximizing spatially aligned wiring
layouts. We show that such spatial organization principles interact
constructively with adaptive rewiring, contributing to establish the networks'
connectedness and modular structures. We use an evolving neural network model
with weighted and directed connections, in which neural traffic flow is based
on consensus and advection dynamics, to show that wiring cost minimization
supports adaptive rewiring in creating convergent-divergent unit structures.
Convergent-divergent units consist of a convergent input-hub, connected to a
divergent output-hub via subnetworks of intermediate nodes, which may function
as the computational core of the unit. The prominence of minimizing wiring
distance in the dynamic evolution of the network determines the extent to which
the core is encapsulated from the rest of the network, i.e., the
context-sensitivity of its computations. This corresponds to the central role
convergent-divergent units play in establishing context-sensitivity in neuronal
information processing.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the current pilot study, we attempt to find out how double neurofeedback
influences functional hemispheric asymmetry and activity. We examined 30
healthy participants (8 males; 22 females, mean age = 29; SD= 8). To measure
functional hemispheric asymmetry and activity, we used computer laterometry in
the 'two-source' lead-lag dichotic paradigm. Double biofeedback included 8
minutes of EEG oscillation recording with five minutes of basic mode. During
the basic mode, the current amplitude of the EEG oscillator gets transformed
into feedback sounds while the current amplitude of alpha EEG oscillator is
used to modulate the intensity of light signals. Double neurofeedback did not
directly influence the asymmetry itself but accelerated individual sound
perception characteristics during dichotic listening in the preceding effect
paradigm. Further research is needed to investigate the effect of double
neurofeedback training on functional brain activity and asymmetry taking into
account participants' age, gender, and motivation.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05164</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Monotonic neural networks have recently been proposed as a way to define
invertible transformations. These transformations can be combined into powerful
autoregressive flows that have been shown to be universal approximators of
continuous probability distributions. Architectures that ensure monotonicity
typically enforce constraints on weights and activation functions, which
enables invertibility but leads to a cap on the expressiveness of the resulting
transformations. In this work, we propose the Unconstrained Monotonic Neural
Network (UMNN) architecture based on the insight that a function is monotonic
as long as its derivative is strictly positive. In particular, this latter
condition can be enforced with a free-form neural network whose only constraint
is the positiveness of its output. We evaluate our new invertible building
block within a new autoregressive flow (UMNN-MAF) and demonstrate its
effectiveness on density estimation experiments. We also illustrate the ability
of UMNNs to improve variational inference.

	<title>The Cerebellum: Using the Schmahmann Syndrome Scale to Assess Cognitive Impairment in Young Adults with Metabolic Syndrome: a Hypothesis-Generating Report</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01212-9</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The posterior cerebellum is the most significantly compromised brain structure in individuals with metabolic syndrome (MetS) (Hum Brain Mapp 40(12):3575–3588, &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus citation-ref citationid-c-r10&quot;&gt;2019&lt;/span&gt;). In light of this, we hypothesized that cognitive decline reported in patients with MetS is likely related to posterior cerebellar atrophy. In this study, we performed a post hoc analyses using T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in the form of voxel-wise tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS), biometric, and psychometric data from young participants with (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 52, aged 18–35 years) and without MetS (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 52, aged 18–35 years). To test the predictive value of components of the Schmahmann syndrome scale (SSS), also known as the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome scale, we used structural equation modeling to adapt available psychometric scores in our participant sample to the SSS and compare them to the composite score of all psychometric data available. Our key findings point to a statistically significant correlation between TBSS fractional anisotropy (FA) values from DTI and adapted SSS psychometric scores in individuals with MetS (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = .139, 95% CI = 0.009, .345). This suggests that the SSS could be applied to assess cognitive and likely neuroanatomical effects associated with MetS. We strongly suggest that future work aimed at investigating the neurocognitive effects of MetS and related comorbidities (i.e., dyslipidemia, diabetes, obesity) would benefit from implementing and further exploring the validity of the SSS in this patient population.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

CD patients with head tremor at onset (Tr-CD) were age- and sex-matched to CD patients without head tremor at onset (nTr-CD). All patients were evaluated for cerebellar disability using the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA), gait variability using ProtoKinetics Zeno Walkway, and cerebellar volume analysis extracted from brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using a semiquantitative scale. Compared to nTr-CD (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 10, median age, 70.5 years), Tr-CD patients (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 10, 71.5 years) exhibited higher median SARA scores (9 vs 7.5, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.03) and greater median gait variability index (131 vs 124, p = 0.03). SARA scores inversely correlated with cerebellar volume in all patients (− 0.4, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.04). Tr-CD patients exhibited greater superior vermian atrophy than nTr-CD patients (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.01). Head tremor at onset heralds a CD subtype with prominent axial cerebellar disability and atrophy of the superior vermis of the cerebellum.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence and electrophysiological features of 3-Hz postural tremor in multiple system atrophy-cerebellar type and spinocerebellar ataxia. A static posturography examination was administered to 37 persons with spinocerebellar ataxia, 58 others with the cerebellar type of multiple system atrophy, and 53 healthy controls. During the sensory organization tests of 5 multiple system atrophy patients, surface electromyograms were recorded from bilateral tibialis anterior and medial gastrocnemius muscles. The patients with multiple system atrophy had, on average, significantly higher scores on the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale and significantly greater prevalence of cross sign. Almost 80% of them fell during the posturography testing compared with two-thirds of the spinocerebellar ataxia patients. Twenty-seven percent of the spinocerebellar ataxia patients and 82.8% of those with multiple system atrophy displayed postural tremor with a frequency of approximately 3 Hz. The tremor’s frequency tended to be lower in the spinocerebellar ataxia patients. The surface electromyography revealed highly coherent tremor activity at about 3 Hz in the patients’ bilateral tibialis anterior and alternating firing in the bilateral antagonist muscles. Combining cross sign with a subject’s static score of the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale and occurrence of the tremor produced an indicator able to differentiate the two conditions with a sensitivity of 87.9% and a specificity of 89.2%. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve for the indicator was 0.942. Three-hertz postural tremor is relatively characteristic of cerebellar type of multiple system atrophy and appears at an early stage of the disease. Identification of the tremor by posturography will facilitate its diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation (ctDCS) modulates cerebellar activity and postural control. However, the effects of ctDCS on postural control learning and the mechanisms associated with these effects remain unclear. To examine the effects of single-session ctDCS on postural control learning and cerebellar brain inhibition (CBI) of the primary motor cortex in healthy individuals. In this triple-blind, sham-controlled study, 36 participants were allocated randomly to one of three groups: (1) anodal ctDCS group, (2) cathodal ctDCS group, and (3) sham ctDCS group. ctDCS (2 mA) was applied to the cerebellar brain for 20 min prior to six blocks of standing postural control training (each block consisted of five trials of a 30-s tracking task). CBI and corticospinal excitability of the tibialis anterior muscle were assessed at baseline, immediately after, 1 day after, and 7 days after training. Skill acquisition following training was significantly reduced in both the anodal and cathodal ctDCS groups compared with the sham ctDCS group. Changes in performance measured 1 day after and 7 days after training did not differ among the groups. In the anodal ctDCS group, CBI significantly increased after training, whereas corticospinal excitability decreased. Anodal ctDCS-induced CBI changes were correlated with the learning formation of postural control (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.55, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.04). Single-session anodal and cathodal ctDCS could suppress the skill acquisition of postural control in healthy individuals. The CBI changes induced by anodal ctDCS may affect the learning process of postural control.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Evidence reported in recent decades increasingly confirms that both the cerebellum and the basal ganglia, which are primarily involved in movement control, also have a significant role in a vast range of cognitive and affective functions. Evidence from pathology indicates that the disorders of some aspects of language production which follow damage of the cerebellum or respectively basal ganglia, i.e., disorders of speech, word fluency, and sentence construction, have identifiable neuropsychological profiles and that most manifestations can be specifically attributed to the dysfunctions of mechanisms supported by one or the other of these structures. The cerebellum and the basal ganglia are reciprocally interconnected. Thus, it is plausible that some disorders observed when damage involves one of these structures could be remote effects of abnormal activity in the other. However, in a purely clinical-neuropsychological perspective, primary and remote effects in the network are difficult to disentangle. Functional neuroimaging and non-invasive brain stimulation techniques likely represent the indispensable support for achieving this goal.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The cerebellum recognizes sequences from prior experiences and uses this information to generate internal models that predict future outcomes in a feedforward manner [Front Hum Neurosci 8: 475, 2014; Cortex 47: 137–44, 2011; Cerebellum 7: 611–5, 2008; J Neurosci 26: 9107–16, 2006]. This process has been well documented in the motor domain, but the cerebellum’s role in cognitive sequencing, within the context of implicit versus explicit processes, is not well characterized. In this study, we tested individuals with cerebellar ataxia and healthy controls to clarify the role of the cerebellum sequencing using variations on implicit versus explicit and motor versus cognitive demands across five experiments. Converging results across these studies suggest that cerebellar feedforward mechanisms may be necessary for sequencing in the implicit domain only. In the ataxia group, rhythmic tapping, rate of motor learning, and implicit sequence learning were impaired. However, for cognitive sequencing that could be accomplished using explicit strategies, the cerebellar group performed normally, as though they shifted to extra-cerebellar mechanisms to compensate. For example, when cognitive and motor functions relied on cerebellar function simultaneously, the ataxia group’s motor function was unaffected, in contrast to that of controls whose motor performance declined as a function of cognitive load. These findings indicated that the cerebellum is not critical for all forms of sequencing per se. Instead, it plays a fundamental role for sequencing within the implicit domain, whether functions are motor or cognitive. Moreover, individuals with cerebellar ataxia are generally able to compensate for cognitive sequencing when explicit strategies are available in order to preserve resources for motor function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

We performed a retrospective review of all patients with anti-GAD ataxia managed at the Sheffield Ataxia Centre over the last 25 years. We identified 50 patients (62% females) with anti-GAD ataxia. The prevalence was 2.5% amongst 2000 patients with progressive ataxia of various causes. Mean age at onset was 55 and mean duration 8 years. Gaze-evoked nystagmus was present in 26%, cerebellar dysarthria in 26%, limb ataxia in 44% and gait ataxia in 100%. Nine patients (18%) had severe, 12 (24%) moderate and 29 (58%) mild ataxia. Ninety percent of patients had a history of additional autoimmune diseases. Family history of autoimmune diseases was seen in 52%. Baseline MR spectroscopy of the vermis was abnormal at presentation in 72%. Thirty-five patients (70%) had serological evidence of gluten sensitivity. All 35 went on gluten-free diet (GFD). Eighteen (51%) improved, 13 (37%) stabilised, 3 have started the GFD too recently to draw conclusions and one deteriorated. Mycophenolate was used in 16 patients, 7 (44%) improved, 2 stabilised, 6 have started the medication too recently to draw conclusions and one did not tolerate the drug. There is considerable overlap between anti-GAD ataxia and gluten ataxia. For those patients with both, strict GFD alone can be an effective treatment. Patients with anti-GAD ataxia and no gluten sensitivity respond well to immunosuppression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Thiamine Deficiency Increases Intrinsic Excitability of Mouse Cerebellar Purkinje Cells</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Thiamine deficiency is associated with cerebellar dysfunction; however, the consequences of thiamine deficiency on the electrophysiological properties of cerebellar Purkinje cells are poorly understood. Here, we evaluated these parameters in brain slices containing cerebellar vermis. Adult mice were maintained for 12–13 days on a thiamine-free diet coupled with daily injections of pyrithiamine, an inhibitor of thiamine phosphorylation. Morphological analysis revealed a 20% reduction in Purkinje cell and nuclear volume in thiamine-deficient animals compared to feeding-matched controls, with no reduction in cell count. Under whole-cell current clamp, thiamine-deficient Purkinje cells required significantly less current injection to fire an action potential. This reduction in rheobase was not due to a change in voltage threshold. Rather, thiamine-deficient neurons presented significantly higher input resistance specifically in the voltage range just below threshold, which increases their sensitivity to current at these critical membrane potentials. In addition, thiamine deficiency caused a significant decrease in the amplitude of the action potential afterhyperpolarization, broadened the action potential, and decreased the current threshold for depolarization block. When thiamine-deficient animals were allowed to recover for 1 week on a normal diet, rheobase, threshold, action potential half-width, and depolarization block threshold were no longer different from controls. We conclude that thiamine deficiency causes significant but reversible changes to the electrophysiology properties of Purkinje cells prior to pathological morphological alterations or cell loss. Thus, the data obtained in the present study indicate that increased excitability of Purkinje cells may represent a leading indicator of cerebellar dysfunction caused by lack of thiamine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Neurochemical Differences in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 14 and 1</title>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Autosomal-dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by progressive ataxia. Here, we report on neurometabolic alterations in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1; SCA-ATXN1) and 14 (SCA14; SCA-PRKCG) assessed by non-invasive &lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Three Tesla &lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H magnetic resonance spectroscopy was performed in 17 SCA14, 14 SCA1 patients, and in 31 healthy volunteers. We assessed metabolites in the cerebellar vermis, right cerebellar hemisphere, pons, prefrontal, and motor cortex. Additionally, clinical characteristics were obtained for each patient to correlate them with metabolites. In SCA14, metabolic changes were restricted to the cerebellar vermis compared with widespread neurochemical alterations in SCA1. In SCA14, total N-acetylaspartate (tNAA) was reduced in the vermis by 34%. In SCA1, tNAA was reduced in the vermis (24%), cerebellar hemisphere (26%), and pons (25%). SCA14 patients showed 24% lower glutamate+glutamine (Glx) and 46% lower γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the vermis, while SCA1 patients showed no alterations in Glx and GABA. SCA1 revealed a decrease of aspartate (Asp) in the vermis (62%) and an elevation in the prefrontal cortex (130%) as well as an elevation of myo-inositol (Ins) in the cerebellar hemisphere (51%) and pons (46%). No changes of Asp and Ins were detected in SCA14. Beyond, glucose (Glc) was increased in the vermis of both SCA14 (155%) and SCA1 (247%). &lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed differing neurochemical profiles in SCA1 and SCA14 and confirmed metabolic changes that may be indicative for neuronal loss and dysfunctional energy metabolism. Therefore, &lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H magnetic resonance spectroscopy represents a helpful tool for in-vivo tracking of disease-specific pathophysiology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The Cerebellum: The Effects of Dual Task Cognitive Interference and Fast-Paced Walking on Gait, Turns, and Falls in Men and Women with FXTAS</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Fragile X–associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a genetic neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cerebellar ataxia, tremor, and cognitive dysfunction. We examined the impact of dual-task (DT) cognitive-motor interference and fast-paced (FP) gait on gait and turning in FXTAS. Thirty participants with FXTAS and 35 age-matched controls underwent gait analysis using an inertial sensor–based 2-min walk test under three conditions: (1) self-selected pace (ST), (2) FP, and (3) DT with a concurrent verbal fluency task. Linear regression analyses were performed to assess the association between FXTAS diagnosis and gait and turn outcomes. Correlations between gait variables and fall frequency were also calculated. FXTAS participants had reduced stride length and velocity, swing time, and peak turn velocity and greater double limb support time and number of steps to turn compared to controls under all three conditions. There was greater dual task cost of the verbal fluency task on peak turn velocity in men with FXTAS compared to controls. Additionally, stride length variability was increased and cadence was reduced in FXTAS participants in the FP condition. Stride velocity variability under FP gait was significantly associated with the number of self-reported falls in the last year. Greater motor control requirements for turning likely made men with FXTAS more susceptible to the negative effects of DT cognitive interference. FP gait exacerbated gait deficits in the domains of rhythm and variability, and increased gait variability with FP was associated with increased falls. These data may inform the design of rehabilitation strategies in FXTAS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Huntington’s disease (HD) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by progressive motor, cognitive, and psychiatric disturbances. Although striatum degeneration might justify most of the motor symptoms, there is an emerging evidence of involvement of extra-striatal structures, such as the cerebellum. To elucidate the cerebellar involvement and its afferences with motor, psychiatric, and cognitive symptoms in HD. A systematic search in the literature was performed in MEDLINE, LILACS, and Google Scholar databases. The research was broadened to include the screening of reference lists of review articles for additional studies. Studies available in the English language, dating from 1993 through May 2020, were included. Clinical presentation of patients with HD may not be considered as the result of an isolated primary striatal dysfunction. There is evidence that cerebellar involvement is an early event in HD and may occur independently of striatal degeneration. Also, the loss of the compensation role of the cerebellum in HD may be an explanation for the clinical onset of HD. Although more studies are needed to elucidate this association, the current literature supports that the cerebellum may integrate the natural history of neurodegeneration in HD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Increased Purkinje Cell Complex Spike and Deep Cerebellar Nucleus Synchrony as a Potential Basis for Syndromic Essential Tremor. A Review and Synthesis of the Literature</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We review advances in understanding Purkinje cell (PC) complex spike (CS) physiology that suggest increased CS synchrony underlies syndromic essential tremor (ET). We searched PubMed for papers describing factors that affect CS synchrony or cerebellar circuits potentially related to tremor. Inferior olivary (IO) neurons are electrically coupled, with the degree of coupling controlled by excitatory and GABAergic inputs. Clusters of coupled IO neurons synchronize CSs within parasagittal bands via climbing fibers (Cfs). When motor cortex is stimulated in rats at varying frequencies, whisker movement occurs at ~10 Hz, correlated with synchronous CSs, indicating that the IO/CS oscillatory rhythm gates movement frequency. Intra-IO injection of the GABA&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonist picrotoxin increases CS synchrony, increases whisker movement amplitude, and induces tremor. Harmaline and 5-HT&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2a&lt;/sub&gt; receptor activation also increase IO coupling and CS synchrony and induce tremor. The &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;hotfoot17&lt;/em&gt; mouse displays features found in ET brains, including cerebellar GluRδ2 deficiency and abnormal PC Cf innervation, with IO- and PC-dependent cerebellar oscillations and tremor likely due to enhanced CS synchrony. Heightened coupling within the IO oscillator leads, through its dynamic control of CS synchrony, to increased movement amplitude and, when sufficiently intense, action tremor. Increased CS synchrony secondary to aberrant Cf innervation of multiple PCs likely also underlies &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;hotfoot17&lt;/em&gt; tremor. Deep cerebellar nucleus (DCN) hypersynchrony may occur secondary to increased CS synchrony but might also occur from PC axonal terminal sprouting during partial PC loss. Through these combined mechanisms, increased CS/DCN synchrony may plausibly underlie syndromic ET.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study aimed to determine the prevalence and mechanism of linear vertigo reported by the patients during the attacks of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). We prospectively evaluated the characteristics (rotational vs. linear) of positional vertigo in 70 patients with posterior and horizontal canal BPPV using a questionnaire allowing multiple choices. In patients with linear vertigo, we further assessed the directionality of linear vertigo. We adopted the velocity-storage model to explain the occurrence and direction of linear vertigo in these patients with BPPV. Patients reported only rotational vertigo in 46 (46/70, 65.7%), only linear vertigo in 10 (14.3%), and both rotational and linear vertigo in 14 (20%). The patients experienced fear from rotational vertigo in 54 (54/70, 77.1%) and from linear vertigo in 20 (20/70, 28.6%). The direction of linear vertigo was concordant with the direction of inertial acceleration predicted by the velocity-storage model. Patients with BPPV may experience linear as well as rotational vertigo during the attacks. This linear vertigo may be ascribed to centrally estimated inertial acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;While cerebellar ataxia (CA) is a neurodegenerative disease known for motor impairment, changes in mood have also been reported. A full account of neuropsychiatric symptomology in CA may guide improvements in treatment regimes, measure the presence and severity of sub-clinical neuropsychiatric disturbance symptomology in CA, and compare patient versus informant symptom recognition. Neuropsychiatric phenomena were gathered from CA patients with genetic and unknown etiologies and their informants (e.g., spouse or parent). Information was obtained from in-person interviews and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Responses were converted to the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire (NPI-Q) scores by consensus ratings. Patient NPI-Q scores were evaluated for symptom prevalence and severity relative to those obtained from healthy controls. Patient-informant NPI-Q score disagreements were evaluated. In this cohort, 95% of patients presented with at least one neuropsychiatric symptom and 51% of patients with three or more symptoms. The most common symptoms were anxiety, depression, nighttime behaviors (e.g., interrupted sleep), irritability, disinhibition, abnormal appetite, and agitation. The prevalence of these neuropsychiatric symptoms was uniform across patients with genetic versus unknown etiologies. Patient and informant symptom report disagreements reflected that patients noted sleep impairment and depression, while informants noted irritability and agitation. Neuropsychiatric disturbance is highly prevalent in patients with CA and contributes to the phenomenology of CA, regardless of etiology. Clinicians should monitor psychiatric health in their CA patients, considering that supplemental information from informants can help gauge the impact on family members and caregivers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Neuronal Activity of Pallidal Versus Cerebellar Receiving Thalamus in Patients with Cervical Dystonia</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cervical dystonia (CD) is a movement disorder characterized by a stereotyped pattern of involuntary turning or tilting of the head, often combined with jerky or tremulous movements. Hypotheses for the origin of CD have traditionally focused on the basal ganglia, but the contemporary discussion has considered the potential role of altered cerebellar function. As basal ganglia and the cerebellum largely project to the different thalamic nuclei, alterations in pallidal versus cerebellar output could be reflected in the activity of these thalamic regions. In this study, we analyzed a unique historic database where the single-unit activity of pallidal and cerebellar receiving thalamic nuclei was measured en route to the mesencephalon. We compared the single-unit activity of pallidal and cerebellar receiving thalamic neurons in three groups of CD patients manifesting as pure dystonia, pure jerky head oscillations, and dystonia plus jerky head oscillations. We found that among different CD manifestations, the characteristics of neuronal firing, such as burst versus a single-spike pattern, vary in cerebellar thalamic receiving nuclei. The cerebellar receiving region in patients with jerky oscillations had single-spikes neurons primarily. Wherein the manifestation of CD did not influence pattern distribution in the pallidal receiving thalamic area. We also found increased neuronal firing rate correlated with strength of theta-band neuronal oscillations during muscle contractions associated with dystonia. These results demonstrate that the manifestations of CD, such as pure dystonia, pure jerky head oscillations, or dystonia and jerky head oscillations, determine the thalamic neuronal properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Sensory ataxic neuropathy, dysarthria, and ophthalmoparesis (SANDO) is a rare mitochondrial disorder associated with mutations in the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;POLG&lt;/em&gt; gene, which encodes the DNA polymerase gamma catalytic subunit. A few POLG-related SANDO cases have been reported, but the genotype–phenotype correlation remains unclear. Here, we report a patient with SANDO carrying two novel missense variants (c.2543G&amp;gt;C, p.G848A and c.452 T&amp;gt;C, p.L151P) in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;POLG.&lt;/em&gt; We also reviewed previously reported cases to systematically evaluate the clinical and genetic features of POLG-related SANDO. A total of 35 distinct variants in the coding region of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;POLG&lt;/em&gt; were identified in 63 patients with SANDO. The most frequent variant was the p.A467T variant, followed by the p.W748S variant. The clinical spectrum of SANDO is heterogeneous. No clear correlation has been observed between the mutation types and clinical phenotypes. Our findings expand the mutational spectrum of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;POLG&lt;/em&gt; and contribute to clinical management and genetic counseling for POLG-related SANDO.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Previous evidence has shown a link between neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), and melatonin. The data in the literature about the impact of the hormone under different experimental PD conditions are quite controversial, and its effect on memory impairment in the disease is very poorly explored. The current research was aimed at investigating the role of melatonin pretreatment on memory and motor behavior in healthy rats and those with the partial 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) model of PD. All rodents were pretreated with melatonin (20 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) for 5 days. At 24 h and 7 days after the first treatment for healthy rats, and at the second and third week post-lesion for those with PD, the animals were tested behaviorally (apomorphine-induced rotations, rotarod, and passive avoidance tests). The neurochemical levels of dopamine (DA), acetylcholine (ACh), noradrenaline (NA), and serotonin (Sero) in the brain were also determined. The results showed that in healthy animals, melatonin pretreatment had amnestic and motor-suppressive effects and did not change the levels of measured brain neurotransmitters. In animals with PD, melatonin pretreatment exerted a neuroprotective effect, manifested as a significantly decreased number of apomorphine-induced rotations, reduced number of falls in the rotarod test, and improved memory performance. The brain DA and ACh concentrations in the same animals were restored to the control levels, and those of NA and Sero did not change. Our results demonstrate a beneficial effect of melatonin on memory and motor disturbance in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Serum levels of DKK-1, TNC, TOS, TAC, and MDA were measured in 40 AD patients and 40 healthy individuals. Additionally, the relative expressions of LRP6, GSK3A, and GSK3B genes in whole blood were evaluated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to investigate the incremental diagnostic value of each factor in the study groups. Mean serum levels of DKK-1, TNC, TOS, TAC, and MDA were significantly higher in the AD group compared to the healthy group (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).

However, the expression of GSK3B did not significantly differ between the two groups (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;gt; 0.05). With considerable sensitivity and specificity, ROC analysis demonstrated the diagnostic efficacy of DKK-1 and TNC serum levels in AD within an area under the ROC curve of ≥ 0.98 (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; ˂ 0.001).

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Dietary zinc deficiency may lead to olfactory deficits, whose mechanism remains largely elusive. Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs), a type of glial cells that support the function and neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb (OB), may play a pivotal role in the maintenance of the olfactory system. In the present study, we established a rat model of dietary zinc deficiency and found that severe zinc deficiency, but not marginal zinc deficiency, caused significantly reduced food intake, growth retardation, and apparent olfactory deficit in growing rats. We showed that severe zinc deficiency resulted in the loss of OECs in the olfactory nerve layer (ONL) of the olfactory bulb. In addition, we revealed that the number of TUNEL-positive cells increased markedly in the region, suggesting an involvement of apoptotic cell death in zinc deficiency-induced loss of OECs. Moreover, we found that treatment with zinc chelator &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;′&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;′,-tetrakis (2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN) triggered the apoptosis of in vitro-cultured primary OECs. The apoptosis of OECs was correlated with significantly elevated expression of p53. Importantly, TUNEL and CCK-8 assays both demonstrated that treatment with p53 antagonist pifithrin-α (PFT-α) markedly attenuated TPEN-induced OEC apoptosis. These findings implicated that p53-triggered apoptosis of OECs might play an integral role in zinc deficiency-induced olfactory malfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Astrocyte activation is characterized by hypertrophy with increased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), whose expression may involve pro-inflammatory cytokines. In this study, the effects of pro-inflammatory IL-6 and TNF-α and anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 on nitric oxide (NO)/cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signalling, intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) and GFAP expression were investigated. In human glioblastoma astrocytoma U-373 MG cells, IL-6 and TNF-α, but not IL-4 or IL-10, increased iNOS, cGMP, [Ca&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and GFAP expression. The inhibitors of iNOS (1400 W), soluble guanylyl cyclase (ODQ) and IP3 receptors (ryanodine and 2-APB) reversed the increase in cGMP or [Ca&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively, and prevented GFAP expression. In rat striatal slices, IL-6 and TNF-α, at variance with IL-4 and IL-10, promoted a concentration-dependent increase in Ca&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; efflux, an effect prevented by 1400 W, ODQ and RY/2APB. These data were confirmed by in vivo studies, where IL-6, TNF-α or the NO donor DETA/NO injected in the striatum of anaesthetised rats increased cGMP levels and increased GFAP expression. The present findings point to NO/cGMP-dependent calcium signalling as part of the mechanism mediating IL-6- and TNF-α-induced GFAP expression. As this process plays a fundamental role in driving neurotoxicity, targeting NO/cGMP-dependent calcium signalling may constitute a new approach for therapeutic interventions in neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Serum miRNAs (miRs) have gained consideration as encouraging molecular markers for cancer diagnosis and prediction of prognosis. The authors aimed to identify the exact role of miR-17-5p, miR-125b, and miR-221 among glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients before and after standard treatment, and correlate their expression with survival pattern. The study included 25 GBM patients and 20 healthy controls. Serum miR-17-5p, miR-125b, and miR-221 expression were analyzed before and after treatment using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The diagnostic efficacy for the tested miRs was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and the relation of miRs expression versus clinical criteria for GBM was assessed. Patients’ survival patterns were examined versus miRs expression levels. A significant difference was reported between miRs expression among the enrolled individuals. Both miR-17-5p and miR-221 reported significant elevations in GBM patients who: are above 60 years old, underwent biopsy resection, have a non-frontal lesion, with tumor size above 5 cm, and with performance status equals 2 according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status. With regard to miR-125b, a significant difference was detected according to surgery strategy, primary lesion of the tumor, and ECOG status. MiRs levels were significantly decreased for GBM patients after treatment. Survival patterns demonstrated an increase in miR-17-5p, miR-125b, and miR-221 in GBM patients with worse progression-free survival and among those with worse overall survival. Detection of serum miR-17-5p, miR-125b, and miR-221 aids in the prediction of prognosis and response to treatment strategy for GBM patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Neurotrauma is among the main causes of human disability and mortality. Nerve injury impairs not only neurons but also causes death of satellite glial cells remote from the injury site. We studied the dynamics of expression of different proapoptotic proteins (E2F1, p53, caspase 3) in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of a rat after sciatic nerve transection. TUNEL staining and immunoblotting were used for analysis of cell apoptosis and axotomy-induced biochemical changes. Apoptosis of glial cells was observed at 24 h after sciatic nerve transection and increased on day 7, when apoptosis of some neurons only started. The earliest proapoptotic event in the injured DRG was overexpression of transcription factor E2F1 at 4 h after sciatic nerve transection. This preceded the induction of p53 and cleavage of caspase 3 at 24-h post-axotomy. The nerve injury marker amyloid precursor protein and the nerve regeneration marker GAP-43 were overexpressed in DRG on day 7 after sciatic nerve transection. We also developed a novel fluorescence method for differential visualization of the rat DRG and nerves by means of double staining with propidium iodide and Hoechst 33342 that impart red and blue-green fluorescence, respectively. The present experiments showed that glial cells remote from the nerve transection site were more vulnerable to axotomy than DRG neurons. E2F1 and p53 may be considered promising molecular targets for development of potential neuroprotective agents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects male and female patients differently. Several studies have been performed to explain the gender differences in MS susceptibility, but the genetic causes underlying gender differences remain unknown. The association between multiple sclerosis and the HLA-DRB1*15:01 haplotype has been confirmed to be female-specific. We hypothesized other immunological components such as lnc-DC may be gender-specific among multiple sclerosis patients, especially when MS patients are negative for the HLA-DRB1*15:01 allele. Therefore, the current study, considering the results of previous studies, aimed to evaluate the expression level of the lnc-DC gene in HLA-DRB1*15:01-negative female patients with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS). A total of 50 MS female patients and 50 female healthy controls were enrolled in this observational case-control study. HLA-DRB1*15:01, as a critical risk factor for MS, was ruled out in all patients. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from all patients and total RNA was isolated and cDNA synthesis was carried out. The gene expression of lnc-DC was evaluated by real-time quantitative PCR. Our results have shown that lnc-DC expression level was significantly higher in total MS female patients compared with female controls (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.0044). In addition, the correlation between lnc-DC with disease duration, EDSS, and age at onset did not reach a statistical significance in our study (r = 0.0336, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.817; r = 0.0914, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.5278 and r = 0.0743, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.6083, respectively). Our results give further evidence that lnc-DC may play a gender-dependent role in MS pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In this study, we explored the effects of propofol on oxidative stress response, cytokine secretion, and autophagy in rats with ischemia–reperfusion (I/R) injury and oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD)-stimulated primary microglia and analyzed the role of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) pathway in this process. Rat models of I/R injury and OGD models of primary microglia were established. Neurobehavioral scores were evaluated 24 h after reperfusion, and oxidative stress indicators, cytokine levels, and autophagy-related markers of rats and OGD-activated primary microglia were evaluated. Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway was also assessed. The results showed that propofol pretreatment can improve nerve function in rats with I/R injury, inhibit oxidative stress response and inflammatory cytokine secretion, and promote autophagy in rats with I/R injury and OGD-activated primary microglia, and that the PI3K-Akt pathway was activated in this process. Following the addition of a PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitor, the effects of propofol on autophagy in rats with I/R injury and primary microglia were inhibited significantly. The results indicate that propofol promotes autophagy via the PI3K/Akt pathway in cerebral I/R injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Stress is considered as an important risk factor in the progression and the onset of many disorders such as multiple sclerosis. However, metabolite changes as a result of demyelination under the detrimental effects of stress are not well understood. Thus, 36 female Wistar rats (i.e., groups (1) no-cuprizone (Cont), (2) no-stress + cuprizone-treated (Cup), (3) physical stress + cuprizone-treated (P-Cup), (4) psychological stress + cuprizone-treated (Psy-Cup), (5) physical stress + no-cuprizone-treated (P), (6) psychological stress + no-cuprizone-treated (Psy)) were used in this study. Following induction of repetitive stress, cuprizone treatment was carried out for 6 weeks to instigate demyelination in all groups except the control animal. Relative metabolite concentrations of the brain were investigated by single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (reporting &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), glycerophosphocholine with phosphocholine (tCho) relative to total creatine (tCr)). According to &lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-MRS, rats in the Cup group indicated a reduction in NAA/ tCr (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) as well as tCho/ tCr (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) compared with that in the Cont group. In contrast, in both stress + cuprizone-treated groups, NAA/tCr and tCho/tCr ratios remarkably increased versus the Cup group (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and the Cont group (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001 for the Psy-Cup group and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05 for the P-Cup group). Both P and Psy groups revealed normal metabolite concentrations similar to the Cont group 6 weeks post stress. Seemingly, in the case of cuprizone alone, decreased level of metabolites is mainly relevant to neuronal cell impairments. Meanwhile, as a result of oxidative stress enhancement due to stress exposure, oligodendrocyte becomes the main victim indicating the increased level of metabolite ratios.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Secreted Amyloid Precursor Protein-Alpha Enhances LTP Through the Synthesis and Trafficking of Ca2+-Permeable AMPA Receptors</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.660208</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Regulation of AMPA receptor expression by neuronal activity and neuromodulators is critical to the expression of both long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory. In particular, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-permeable AMPARs (CP-AMPAR) play a unique role in these processes due to their transient, activity-regulated expression at synapses. Secreted amyloid precursor protein-alpha (sAPPα), a metabolite of the parent amyloid precursor protein (APP) has been previously shown to enhance hippocampal LTP as well as memory formation in both normal animals and in Alzheimer’s disease models. In earlier work we showed that sAPPα promotes trafficking of GluA1-containing AMPARs to the cell surface and specifically enhances synthesis of GluA1. To date it is not known whether de novo synthesized GluA1 form CP-AMPARs or how they contribute to sAPPα-mediated plasticity. Here, using fluorescent non-canonical amino acid tagging–proximity ligation assay (FUNCAT-PLA), we show that brief treatment of primary rat hippocampal neurons with sAPPα (1 nM, 30 min) rapidly enhanced the cell-surface expression of de novo GluA1 homomers and reduced levels of de novo GluA2, as well as extant GluA2/3-AMPARs. The de novo GluA1-containing AMPARs were localized to extrasynaptic sites and later internalized by sAPPα-driven expression of the activity-regulated cytoskeletal-associated protein, Arc. Interestingly, longer exposure to sAPPα increased synaptic levels of GluA1/2 AMPARs. Moreover, the sAPPα-mediated enhancement of LTP in area CA1 of acute hippocampal slices was dependent on CP-AMPARs. Together, these findings show that sAPPα engages mechanisms which specifically enhance the synthesis and cell-surface expression of GluA1 homomers, underpinning the sAPPα-driven enhancement of synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.655412</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has shown promising outcomes as new therapeutic opportunities for patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) who do not respond adequately to several consecutive treatments. This study aims to systematically review and conduct a meta-analysis on the efficacy and safety of DBS for TRD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: The literature was comprehensively reviewed using Medline, Google scholar, Cochrane library, Embase, and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform until January 2019. The studied outcomes included response, remission, recurrence, and adverse events (AEs) rates, and were reported as the rate ratio (RR) or pooled estimate with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Heterogeneity was measured by an I-square test and a sensitive analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A total of 17 studies involving 7 DBS targets were included. For efficacy, DBS treatment was statistically beneficial for TRD, and the response, remission, and recurrence rates were 56% (ranging from 43 to 69%), 35% (ranging from 27 to 44%), and 14% (ranging from 4 to 25%), respectively. However, only two randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) considered the invalidity of DBS (RR = 1.45, 95% CI = 0.50–4.21). For safety, the AEs rate was 67% (ranging from 54 to 80%). The AEs were common and moderate, but the problems related to suicide and suicidal ideation should not be underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: These findings suggest that DBS for TRD is considered promising, which should be confirmed by well-designed and large sample studies. Future basic research and comprehensive clinical trials are needed to reach better understanding on the mechanisms of action and optimal targeted structure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Spiking Neural Network for Augmenting Electroencephalographic Data for Brain Computer Interfaces</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.651762</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;With the advent of advanced machine learning methods, the performance of brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) has improved unprecedentedly. However, electroencephalography (EEG), a commonly used brain imaging method for BCI, is characterized by a tedious experimental setup, frequent data loss due to artifacts, and is time consuming for bulk trial recordings to take advantage of the capabilities of deep learning classifiers. Some studies have tried to address this issue by generating artificial EEG signals. However, a few of these methods are limited in retaining the prominent features or biomarker of the signal. And, other deep learning-based generative methods require a huge number of samples for training, and a majority of these models can handle data augmentation of one category or class of data at any training session. Therefore, there exists a necessity for a generative model that can generate synthetic EEG samples with as few available trials as possible and generate multi-class while retaining the biomarker of the signal. Since EEG signal represents an accumulation of action potentials from neuronal populations beneath the scalp surface and as spiking neural network (SNN), a biologically closer artificial neural network, communicates via spiking behavior, we propose an SNN-based approach using surrogate-gradient descent learning to reconstruct and generate multi-class artificial EEG signals from just a few original samples. The network was employed for augmenting motor imagery (MI) and steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) data. These artificial data are further validated through classification and correlation metrics to assess its resemblance with original data and in-turn enhanced the MI classification performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Despite the acceleration of knowledge and data accumulation in neuroscience over the last years, the highly prevalent neurodegenerative disease of AD remains a growing problem. Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and represents the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease. For AD, disease-modifying treatments are presently lacking, and the understanding of disease mechanisms continues to be incomplete. In the present review, we discuss candidate contributing factors leading to AD, and evaluate novel computational brain simulation methods to further disentangle their potential roles. We first present an overview of existing computational models for AD that aim to provide a mechanistic understanding of the disease. Next, we outline the potential to link molecular aspects of neurodegeneration in AD with large-scale brain network modeling using The Virtual Brain (www.thevirtualbrain.org), an open-source, multiscale, whole-brain simulation neuroinformatics platform. Finally, we discuss how this methodological approach may contribute to the understanding, improved diagnostics, and treatment optimization of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ataxia is a kind of external characteristics when the human body has poor coordination and balance disorder, it often indicates diseases in certain parts of the body. Many internal factors may causing ataxia; currently, observed external characteristics, combined with Doctor’s personal clinical experience play main roles in diagnosing ataxia. In this situation, different kinds of diseases may be confused, leading to the delay in treatment and recovery. Modern high precision medical instruments would provide better accuracy but the economic cost is a non-negligible factor. In this paper, novel non-contact sensing technique is used to detect and distinguish sensory ataxia and cerebellar ataxia. Firstly, Romberg’s test and gait analysis data are collected by the microwave sensing platform; then, after some preprocessing, some machine learning approaches have been applied to train the models. For Romberg’s test, time domain features are considered, the accuracy of all the three algorithms are higher than 96%; for gait detection, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used for dimensionality reduction, and the accuracies of Back Propagation (BP) neural Network, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) are 97.8, 98.9, and 91.1%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Public health guidelines have recommended that elective medical procedures, including deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery for Parkinson’s disease (PD), should not be scheduled during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic to prevent further virus spread and overload on health care systems. However, delaying DBS surgery for PD may not be in the best interest of individual patients and is not called for in regions where virus spread is under control and inpatient facilities are not overloaded.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We administered a newly developed phone questionnaire to 20 consecutive patients with PD who received DBS surgery in Ruijin Hospital in Shanghai during the COVID-19 pandemic. The questionnaire was designed to gather the patients’ experiences and perceptions on the impact of COVID-19 on their everyday activities and access to medical care.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Most of the patients felt confident about the preventive measures taken by the government and hospitals, and they have changed their daily living activities accordingly. Moreover, a large majority of patients felt confident obtaining access to regular and COVID-19-related health care services if needed. Routine clinical referral, sense of security in the hospital during the outbreak, and poor control of PD symptoms were the three main reasons given by patients for seeking DBS surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic has considerably impacted medical care and patients’ lives but elective procedures, such as DBS surgery for PD, do not need to be rescheduled when the health care system is not overloaded and adequate public health regulations are in place.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Spontaneous Activity in Primary Visual Cortex Relates to Visual Creativity</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.625888</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cognitive and neural processes underlying visual creativity have attracted substantial attention. The current research uses a critical time point analysis (CTPA) to examine how spontaneous activity in the primary visual area (PVA) is related to visual creativity. We acquired the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of 16 participants at the resting state and during performing a visual creative synthesis task. According to the CTPA, we then classified spontaneous activity in the PVA into critical time points (CTPs), which reflect the most useful and important functional meaning of the entire resting-state condition, and the remaining time points (RTPs). We constructed functional brain networks based on the brain activity at two different time points and then subsequently based on the brain activity at the task state in a separate manner. We explore the relationship between resting-state and task-fMRI (T-fMRI) functional brain networks. Our results found that: (1) the pattern of spontaneous activity in the PVA may associate with mental imagery, which plays an important role in visual creativity; (2) in comparison with the RTPs-based brain network, the CTP-network showed an increase in global efficiency and a decrease in local efficiency; (3) the regional integrated properties of the CTP-network could predict the integrated properties of the creative-network while the RTP-network could not. Thus, our findings indicated that spontaneous activity in the PVA at CTPs was associated with a visual creative task-evoked brain response. Our findings may provide an insight into how the visual cortex is related to visual creativity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Rethinking the Mechanisms Underlying the McGurk Illusion</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.616049</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The McGurk illusion occurs when listeners hear an illusory percept (i.e., “da”), resulting from mismatched pairings of audiovisual (AV) speech stimuli (i.e., auditory/ba/paired with visual/ga/). Hearing a third percept—distinct from both the auditory and visual input—has been used as evidence of AV fusion. We examined whether the McGurk illusion is instead driven by visual dominance, whereby the third percept, e.g., “da,” represents a default percept for visemes with an ambiguous place of articulation (POA), like/ga/. Participants watched videos of a talker uttering various consonant vowels (CVs) with (AV) and without (V-only) audios of/ba/. Individuals transcribed the CV they saw (V-only) or heard (AV). In the V-only condition, individuals predominantly saw “da”/“ta” when viewing CVs with indiscernible POAs. Likewise, in the AV condition, upon perceiving an illusion, they predominantly heard “da”/“ta” for CVs with indiscernible POAs. The illusion was stronger in individuals who exhibited weak/ba/auditory encoding (examined using a control auditory-only task). In Experiment2, we attempted to replicate these findings using stimuli recorded from a different talker. The V-only results were not replicated, but again individuals predominately heard “da”/“ta”/“tha” as an illusory percept for various AV combinations, and the illusion was stronger in individuals who exhibited weak/ba/auditory encoding. These results demonstrate that when visual CVs with indiscernible POAs are paired with a weakly encoded auditory/ba/, listeners default to hearing “da”/“ta”/“tha”—thus, tempering the AV fusion account, and favoring a default mechanism triggered when both AV stimuli are ambiguous.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Effects of Several Classes of Voltage-Gated Ion Channel Conductances on Gamma and Theta Oscillations in a Hippocampal Microcircuit Model</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.630271</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Gamma and theta oscillations have been functionally associated with cognitive processes, such as learning and memory. Synaptic conductances play an important role in the generation of intrinsic network rhythmicity, but few studies have examined the effects of voltage-gated ion channels (VGICs) on these rhythms. In this report, we have used a pyramidal-interneuron-gamma (PING) network consisting of excitatory pyramidal cells and two types of inhibitory interneurons. We have constructed a conductance-based neural network incorporating a persistent sodium current (I&lt;sub&gt;NaP&lt;/sub&gt;), a delayed rectifier potassium current (I&lt;sub&gt;KDR&lt;/sub&gt;), a inactivating potassium current (I&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;) and a hyperpolarization-activated current (I&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;). We have investigated the effects of several conductances on network theta and gamma frequency oscillations. Variation of all conductances of interest changed network rhythmicity. Theta power was altered by all conductances tested. Gamma rhythmogenesis was dependent on I&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;. The I&lt;sub&gt;KDR&lt;/sub&gt; currents in excitatory pyramidal cells as well as both types of inhibitory interneurons were essential for theta rhythmogenesis and altered gamma rhythm properties. Increasing I&lt;sub&gt;NaP&lt;/sub&gt; suppressed both gamma and theta rhythms. Addition of noise did not alter these patterns. Our findings suggest that VGICs strongly affect brain network rhythms. Further investigations in vivo will be of great interest, including potential effects on neural function and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Transduction and Adaptation Mechanisms in the Cilium or Microvilli of Photoreceptors and Olfactory Receptors From Insects to Humans</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.662453</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sensing changes in the environment is crucial for survival. Animals from invertebrates to vertebrates use both visual and olfactory stimuli to direct survival behaviors including identification of food sources, finding mates, and predator avoidance. In primary sensory neurons there are signal transduction mechanisms that convert chemical or light signals into an electrical response through ligand binding or photoactivation of a receptor, that can be propagated to the olfactory and visual centers of the brain to create a perception of the odor and visual landscapes surrounding us. The fundamental principles of olfactory and phototransduction pathways within vertebrates are somewhat analogous. Signal transduction in both systems takes place in the ciliary sub-compartments of the sensory cells and relies upon the activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to close cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) cation channels in photoreceptors to produce a hyperpolarization of the cell, or in olfactory sensory neurons open CNG channels to produce a depolarization. However, while invertebrate phototransduction also involves GPCRs, invertebrate photoreceptors can be either ciliary and/or microvillar with hyperpolarizing and depolarizing responses to light, respectively. Moreover, olfactory transduction in invertebrates may be a mixture of metabotropic G protein and ionotropic signaling pathways. This review will highlight differences of the visual and olfactory transduction mechanisms between vertebrates and invertebrates, focusing on the implications to the gain of the transduction processes, and how they are modulated to allow detection of small changes in odor concentration and light intensity over a wide range of background stimulus levels.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Role of Mitochondrial Dysfunction and ER Stress in TDP-43 and C9ORF72 ALS</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.653688</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease of the motor system with complex determinants, including genetic and non-genetic factors. Despite this heterogeneity, a key pathological signature is the mislocalization and aggregation of specific proteins in the cytoplasm, suggesting that convergent pathogenic mechanisms focusing on disturbances in proteostasis are important in ALS. In addition, many cellular processes have been identified as potentially contributing to disease initiation and progression, such as defects in axonal transport, autophagy, nucleocytoplasmic transport, ER stress, calcium metabolism, the unfolded protein response and mitochondrial function. Here we review the evidence from in vitro and in vivo models of C9ORF72 and TDP-43-related ALS supporting a central role in pathogenesis for endoplasmic reticulum stress, which activates an unfolded protein response (UPR), and mitochondrial dysfunction. Disruption in the finely tuned signaling between the ER and mitochondria through calcium ions may be a crucial trigger of mitochondrial deficits and initiate an apoptotic signaling cascade, thus acting as a point of convergence for multiple upstream disturbances of cellular homeostasis and constituting a potentially important therapeutic target.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Event-Related Potential Measures of the Passive Processing of Rapidly and Slowly Presented Auditory Stimuli in MCI</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.659618</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Much research effort is currently devoted to the development of a simple, low-cost method to determine early signs of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology. The present study employs a simple paradigm in which event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded to a single auditory stimulus that was presented rapidly or very slowly while the participant was engaged in a visual task. A multi-channel EEG was recorded in 20 healthy older adults and 20 people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In two different conditions, a single 80 dB sound pressure level (SPL) auditory stimulus was presented every 1.5 s (fast condition) or every 12.0 s (slow condition). Participants were instructed to watch a silent video and ignore the auditory stimuli. Auditory processing thus occurred passively. When the auditory stimuli were presented rapidly (every 1.5 s), N1 and P2 amplitudes did not differ between the two groups. When the stimuli were presented very slowly, the amplitude of N1 and P2 increased in both groups and their latencies were prolonged. The amplitude of N1 did not significantly differ between the two groups. However, the subsequent positivity was reduced in people with MCI compared to healthy older adults. This late positivity in the slow condition may reflect a delayed P2 or a summation of a composite P2 + P3a. In people with MCI, the priority of processing may not be switched from the visual task to the potentially much more relevant auditory input. ERPs offer promise as a means to identify the pathology underlying cognitive impairment associated with MCI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Western Diet Induces Impairment of Liver-Brain Axis Accelerating Neuroinflammation and Amyloid Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.654509</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an aging-dependent, irreversible neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of dementia. The prevailing AD hypothesis points to the central role of altered cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and formation of toxic amyloid-β (Aβ) deposits in the brain. The lack of efficient AD treatments stems from incomplete knowledge on AD causes and environmental risk factors. The role of lifestyle factors, including diet, in neurological diseases is now beginning to attract considerable attention. One of them is western diet (WD), which can lead to many serious diseases that develop with age. The aim of the study was to investigate whether WD-derived systemic disturbances may accelerate the brain neuroinflammation and amyloidogenesis at the early stages of AD development. To verify this hypothesis, transgenic mice expressing human APP with AD-causing mutations (APPswe) were fed with WD from the 3rd month of age. These mice were compared to APPswe mice, in which short-term high-grade inflammation was induced by injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and to untreated APPswe mice. All experimental subgroups of animals were subsequently analyzed at 4-, 8-, and 12-months of age. APPswe mice at 4- and 8-months-old represent earlier pre-plaque stages of AD, while 12-month-old animals represent later stages of AD, with visible amyloid pathology. Already short time of WD feeding induced in 4-month-old animals such brain neuroinflammation events as enhanced astrogliosis, to a level comparable to that induced by the administration of pro-inflammatory LPS, and microglia activation in 8-month-old mice. Also, WD feeding accelerated increased Aβ production, observed already in 8-month-old animals. These brain changes corresponded to diet-induced metabolic disorders, including increased cholesterol level in 4-months of age, and advanced hypercholesterolemia and fatty liver disease in 8-month-old mice. These results indicate that the westernized pattern of nourishment is an important modifiable risk factor of AD development, and that a healthy, balanced, diet may be one of the most efficient AD prevention methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Increased Brain Age Gap Estimate (BrainAGE) in Young Adults After Premature Birth</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.653365</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent evidence suggests increased metabolic and physiologic aging rates in premature-born adults. While the lasting consequences of premature birth on human brain development are known, its impact on brain aging remains unclear. We addressed the question of whether premature birth impacts brain age gap estimates (BrainAGE) using an accurate and robust machine-learning framework based on structural MRI in a large cohort of young premature-born adults (n = 101) and full-term (FT) controls (n = 111). Study participants are part of a geographically defined population study of premature-born individuals, which have been followed longitudinally from birth until young adulthood. We investigated the association between BrainAGE scores and perinatal variables as well as with outcomes of physical (total intracranial volume, TIV) and cognitive development (full-scale IQ, FS-IQ). We found increased BrainAGE in premature-born adults [median (interquartile range) = 1.4 (−1.3–4.7 years)] compared to full-term controls (p = 0.002, Cohen’s d = 0.443), which was associated with low Gestational age (GA), low birth weight (BW), and increased neonatal treatment intensity but not with TIV or FS-IQ. In conclusion, results demonstrate elevated BrainAGE in premature-born adults, suggesting an increased risk for accelerated brain aging in human prematurity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Plasma glucose and insulin responses following an oral glucose challenge are representative of glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, key indicators of type 2 diabetes mellitus pathophysiology. A large heterogeneity in individuals’ challenge test responses has been shown to underlie the effectiveness of lifestyle intervention. Currently, this heterogeneity is overlooked due to a lack of methods to quantify the interconnected dynamics in the glucose and insulin time-courses. Here, a physiology-based mathematical model of the human glucose-insulin system is personalized to elucidate the heterogeneity in individuals’ responses using a large population of overweight/obese individuals (n = 738) from the DIOGenes study. The personalized models are derived from population level models through a systematic parameter selection pipeline that may be generalized to other biological systems. The resulting personalized models showed a 4-5 fold decrease in discrepancy between measurements and model simulation compared to population level. The estimated model parameters capture relevant features of individuals’ metabolic health such as gastric emptying, endogenous insulin secretion and insulin dependent glucose disposal into tissues, with the latter also showing a significant association with the Insulinogenic index and the Matsuda insulin sensitivity index, respectively.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Chldma1fi6Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Genome annotation conceptually consists of inferring and assigning biological information to gene products. Over the years, numerous pipelines and computational tools have been developed aiming to automate this task and assist researchers in gaining knowledge about target genes of study. However, even with these technological advances, manual annotation or manual curation is necessary, where the information attributed to the gene products is verified and enriched. Despite being called the gold standard process for depositing data in a biological database, the task of manual curation requires significant time and effort from researchers who sometimes have to parse through numerous products in various public databases. To assist with this problem, we present CODON, a tool for manual curation of genomic data, capable of performing the prediction and annotation process. This software makes use of a finite state machine in the prediction process and automatically annotates products based on information obtained from the Uniprot database. CODON is equipped with a simple and intuitive graphic interface that assists on manual curation, enabling the user to decide about the analysis based on information as to identity, length of the alignment, and name of the organism in which the product obtained a match. Further, visual analysis of all matches found in the database is possible, impacting significantly in the curation task considering that the user has at his disposal all the information available for a given product. An analysis performed on eleven organisms was used to test the efficiency of this tool by comparing the results of prediction and annotation through CODON to ones from the NCBI and RAST platforms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oHRVjyw2MRE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Modeling the circadian regulation of the immune system: Sexually dimorphic effects of shift work</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/cfufBY_Sysg/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Stéphanie M. C. Abo, Anita T. Layton&lt;/p&gt;

The circadian clock exerts significance influence on the immune system and disruption of circadian rhythms has been linked to inflammatory pathologies. Shift workers often experience circadian misalignment as their irregular work schedules disrupt the natural light-dark cycle, which in turn can cause serious health problems associated with alterations in genetic expressions of clock genes. In particular, shift work is associated with impairment in immune function, and those alterations are sex-specific. The goal of this study is to better understand the mechanisms that explain the weakened immune system in shift workers. To achieve that goal, we have constructed a mathematical model of the mammalian pulmonary circadian clock coupled to an acute inflammation model in the male and female rats. Shift work was simulated by an 8h-phase advance of the circadian system with sex-specific modulation of clock genes. The model reproduces the clock gene expression in the lung and the immune response to various doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Under normal conditions, our model predicts that a host is more sensitive to LPS at circadian time (CT) CT12 versus CT0 due to a dynamic change of Interleukin 10 (IL-10), an anti-inflammatory cytokine. We identify REV-ERB as a key modulator of IL-10 activity throughout the circadian day. The model also predicts a reversal of the times of lowest and highest sensitivity to LPS, with males and females exhibiting an exaggerated response to LPS at CT0, which is countered by a blunted immune response at CT12. Overall, females produce fewer pro-inflammatory cytokines than males, but the extent of sequelae experienced by males and females varies across the circadian day. This model can serve as an essential component in an integrative model that will yield mechanistic understanding of how shift work-mediated circadian disruptions affect the inflammatory and other physiological responses.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cfufBY_Sysg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Analysis of cancer mutagenic signatures provides information about the origin of mutations and can inform the use of clinical therapies, including immunotherapy. In particular, APOBEC3A (A3A) has emerged as a major driver of mutagenesis in cancer cells, and its expression results in DNA damage and susceptibility to treatment with inhibitors of the ATR and CHK1 checkpoint kinases. Here, we report the implementation of CRISPR/Cas-9 genetic screening to identify susceptibilities of multiple A3A-expressing lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cell lines. We identify HMCES, a protein recently linked to the protection of abasic sites, as a central protein for the tolerance of A3A expression. HMCES depletion results in synthetic lethality with A3A expression preferentially in a TP53-mutant background. Analysis of previous screening data reveals a strong association between A3A mutational signatures and sensitivity to HMCES loss and indicates that HMCES is specialized in protecting against a narrow spectrum of DNA damaging agents in addition to A3A. We experimentally show that both HMCES disruption and A3A expression increase susceptibility of cancer cells to ionizing radiation (IR), oxidative stress, and ATR inhibition, strategies that are often applied in tumor therapies. Overall, our results suggest that HMCES is an attractive target for selective treatment of A3A-expressing tumors.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/i4RPokSHcKQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The gut-neural axis plays a critical role in the control of several physiological processes, including the communication of signals from the microbiome to the nervous system, which affects learning, memory, and behavior. However, the pathways involved in gut-neural signaling of gut-governed behaviors remain unclear. We found that the intestinal distension caused by the bacterium &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; induces histone H4 Lys8 acetylation (H4K8ac) in the germline of &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;, which is required for both a bacterial aversion behavior and its transmission to the next generation. We show that induction of H4K8ac in the germline is essential for bacterial aversion and that a 14-3-3 chaperone protein family member, PAR-5, is required for H4K8ac. Our findings highlight a role for H4K8ac in the germline not only in the intergenerational transmission of pathogen avoidance but also in the transmission of pathogenic cues that travel through the gut-neural axis to control the aversive behavior.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/0CNQdnAwvj8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Scientists routinely use images to display data. Readers often examine figures first; therefore, it is important that figures are accessible to a broad audience. Many resources discuss fraudulent image manipulation and technical specifications for image acquisition; however, data on the legibility and interpretability of images are scarce. We systematically examined these factors in non-blot images published in the top 15 journals in 3 fields; plant sciences, cell biology, and physiology (&lt;i&gt;n =&lt;/i&gt; 580 papers). Common problems included missing scale bars, misplaced or poorly marked insets, images or labels that were not accessible to colorblind readers, and insufficient explanations of colors, labels, annotations, or the species and tissue or object depicted in the image. Papers that met all good practice criteria examined for all image-based figures were uncommon (physiology 16%, cell biology 12%, plant sciences 2%). We present detailed descriptions and visual examples to help scientists avoid common pitfalls when publishing images. Our recommendations address image magnification, scale information, insets, annotation, and color and may encourage discussion about quality standards for bioimage publishing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/LUYb_6P81As&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15985</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A major approach to saddle point optimization $\min_x\max_y f(x, y)$ is a
gradient based approach as is popularized by generative adversarial networks
(GANs). In contrast, we analyze an alternative approach relying only on an
oracle that solves a minimization problem approximately. Our approach locates
approximate solutions $x'$ and $y'$ to $\min_{x'}f(x', y)$ and $\max_{y'}f(x,
y')$ at a given point $(x, y)$ and updates $(x, y)$ toward these approximate
solutions $(x', y')$ with a learning rate $\eta$. On locally strong
convex--concave smooth functions, we derive conditions on $\eta$ to exhibit
linear convergence to a local saddle point, which reveals a possible
shortcoming of recently developed robust adversarial reinforcement learning
algorithms. We develop a heuristic approach to adapt $\eta$ derivative-free and
implement zero-order and first-order minimization algorithms. Numerical
experiments are conducted to show the tightness of the theoretical results as
well as the usefulness of the $\eta$ adaptation mechanism.

192uJ for the ASIC and achieve a classification time of 276us per
electrocardiographic patient sample. Patients with atrial fibrillation are
correctly identified with a detection rate of 93.7(7)% at 14.0(10)% false
positives. The system is directly applicable to edge inference applications due
to its small size, power envelope and flexible I/O capabilities. Possible
future applications can furthermore combine conventional machine learning
layers with online-learning in spiking neural networks on a single

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Output-Specific Adaptation of Habenula-Midbrain Excitatory Synapses During Cocaine Withdrawal</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2021.643138</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Projections from the lateral habenula (LHb) control ventral tegmental area (VTA) neuronal populations’ activity and both nuclei shape the pathological behaviors emerging during cocaine withdrawal. However, it is unknown whether cocaine withdrawal modulates LHb neurotransmission onto subsets of VTA neurons that are part of distinct neuronal circuits. Here we show that, in mice, cocaine withdrawal, drives discrete and opposing synaptic adaptations at LHb inputs onto VTA neurons defined by their output synaptic connectivity. LHb axons innervate the medial aspect of VTA, release glutamate and synapse on to dopamine and non-dopamine neuronal populations. VTA neurons receiving LHb inputs project their axons to medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), nucleus accumbens (NAc), and lateral hypothalamus (LH). While cocaine withdrawal increases glutamate release from LHb onto VTA-mPFC projectors, it reduces presynaptic release onto VTA-NAc projectors, leaving LHb synapses onto VTA-to-LH unaffected. Altogether, cocaine withdrawal promotes distinct adaptations at identified LHb-to-VTA circuits, which provide a framework for understanding the circuit basis of the negative states emerging during abstinence of drug intake.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: SOX Transcription Factors as Important Regulators of Neuronal and Glial Differentiation During Nervous System Development and Adult Neurogenesis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.654031</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The SOX proteins belong to the superfamily of transcription factors (TFs) that display properties of both classical TFs and architectural components of chromatin. Since the cloning of the Sox/SOX genes, remarkable progress has been made in illuminating their roles as key players in the regulation of multiple developmental and physiological processes. SOX TFs govern diverse cellular processes during development, such as maintaining the pluripotency of stem cells, cell proliferation, cell fate decisions/germ layer formation as well as terminal cell differentiation into tissues and organs. However, their roles are not limited to development since SOX proteins influence survival, regeneration, cell death and control homeostasis in adult tissues. This review summarized current knowledge of the roles of SOX proteins in control of central nervous system development. Some SOX TFs suspend neural progenitors in proliferative, stem-like state and prevent their differentiation. SOX proteins function as pioneer factors that occupy silenced target genes and keep them in a poised state for activation at subsequent stages of differentiation. At appropriate stage of development, SOX members that maintain stemness are down-regulated in cells that are competent to differentiate, while other SOX members take over their functions and govern the process of differentiation. Distinct SOX members determine down-stream processes of neuronal and glial differentiation. Thus, sequentially acting SOX TFs orchestrate neural lineage development defining neuronal and glial phenotypes. In line with their crucial roles in the nervous system development, deregulation of specific SOX proteins activities is associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). The overview of the current knowledge about the link between SOX gene variants and NDDs is presented. We outline the roles of SOX TFs in adult neurogenesis and brain homeostasis and discuss whether impaired adult neurogenesis, detected in neurodegenerative diseases, could be associated with deregulation of SOX proteins activities. We present the current data regarding the interaction between SOX proteins and signaling pathways and microRNAs that play roles in nervous system development. Finally, future research directions that will improve the knowledge about distinct and various roles of SOX TFs in health and diseases are presented and discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Inhibition of the NKCC1/NF-κB Signaling Pathway Decreases Inflammation and Improves Brain Edema and Nerve Cell Apoptosis in an SBI Rat Model</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.641993</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Surgical brain injury (SBI) triggers microglia to release numerous inflammatory factors, leading to brain edema and neurological dysfunction. Reducing neuroinflammation and protecting the blood-brain barrier (BBB) are key factors to improve the neurological function and prognosis after SBI. Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; cotransporter 1 (NKCC1) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) have been implicated in the secretion of inflammatory cytokines by microglia in brain injury. This study aimed to establish the role of NKCC1 in inducing inflammation in SBI, as well as to determine whether NKCC1 controls the release of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) via phosphorylation of NF-κB in microglia, thus affecting BBB permeability and neuronal cell apoptosis. Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were used to establish an SBI model. This study revealed that compared with the sham group, the expression levels of p-NKCC1, p-p65-NF-κB, and related inflammatory factor proteins in SBI model group significantly increased. After p-NKCC1 was inhibited, p-p65-NF-κB, IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α were downregulated, and nerve cell apoptosis and BBB permeability were significantly reduced. These findings suggest that the SBI-induced increase in p-NKCC1 exacerbates neuroinflammation, brain edema, and nerve function injury, which may be mediated by regulating the activity of p65-NF-κB that in turn influences the release of inflammatory factors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Machine Learning Driven Profiling of Cerebrospinal Fluid Core Biomarkers in Alzheimer’s Disease and Other Neurological Disorders</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.647783</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Amyloid-beta (Aβ) 42/40 ratio, tau phosphorylated at threonine-181 (p-tau), and total-tau (t-tau) are considered core biomarkers for the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The use of fully automated biomarker assays has been shown to reduce the intra- and inter-laboratory variability, which is a critical factor when defining cut-off values. The calculation of cut-off values is often influenced by the composition of AD and control groups. Indeed, the clinically defined AD group may include patients affected by other forms of dementia, while the control group is often very heterogeneous due to the inclusion of subjects diagnosed with other neurological diseases (OND). In this context, unsupervised machine learning approaches may overcome these issues providing unbiased cut-off values and data-driven patient stratification according to the sole distribution of biomarkers. In this work, we took advantage of the reproducibility of automated determination of the CSF core AD biomarkers to compare two large cohorts of patients diagnosed with different neurological disorders and enrolled in two centers with established expertise in AD biomarkers. We applied an unsupervised Gaussian mixture model clustering algorithm and found that our large series of patients could be classified in six clusters according to their CSF biomarker profile, some presenting a typical AD-like profile and some a non-AD profile. By considering the frequencies of clinically defined OND and AD subjects in clusters, we subsequently computed cluster-based cut-off values for Aβ42/Aβ40, p-tau, and t-tau. This approach promises to be useful for large-scale biomarker studies aimed at providing efficient biochemical phenotyping of neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Atrophy in the Left Amygdala Predicted Drug Responses in Idiopathic Generalized Epilepsy Patients With Tonic–Clonic Seizures</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.640016</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We aimed to determine the alterations in the subcortical structures of patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy with tonic–clonic seizures (IGE-GTCS) via MRI volumetry and vertex-based shape analysis and to evaluate the relationships between MRI measures and drug responses. In a follow-up sample of 48 patients with IGE-GTCS and 48 matched normal controls (NCs), high-resolution 3D T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;WI was performed at baseline. After 1 year of follow-up, 31 patients were classified as seizure free (SF) and 17 as drug resistant (DR). The volumes of subcortical structures were extracted, and vertex-based shape analysis was performed using FSL-Integrated Registration and Segmentation Toolbox (FSL-FIRST). Comparisons among groups were calculated adjusting for covariates [age, sex, and intracranial volume (ICV)]. Analysis of the relationships among imaging biomarkers along with frequency and duration was assessed using partial correlations. The differential imaging indicators were used as features in a linear support vector machine (LSVM). The DR group displayed significant regional atrophy in the volume of the left amygdala compared with NCs (p = 0.004, false discovery rate corrected) and SF patients (p = 0.029, uncorrected). Meanwhile, vertex-based shape analysis showed focal inward deformation in the basolateral subregion of the left amygdala in DR compared with the results for SF and NC (p &amp;lt; 0.05, FWE corrected). There were significant correlations between the volume changes and seizure frequency (r = −0.324, p = 0.030) and between shape (r = −0.438, p = 0.003) changes and seizure frequency. Moreover, the volume of the left thalamus in the DR group was significantly correlated with seizure frequency (r = −0.689, p = 0.006). The SVM results revealed areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.82, 0.68, and 0.88 for the classification between SF and DR, between SF and NC, and between DR and NC, respectively. This study indicates the presence of focal atrophy in the basolateral region of the left amygdala in patients with IGE drug resistance; this finding may help predict drug responses and suggests a potential therapeutic target.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: No Impact of Functional Connectivity of the Motor System on the Resting Motor Threshold: A Replication Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.627445</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The physiological mechanisms of corticospinal excitability and factors influencing its measurement with transcranial magnetic stimulation are still poorly understood. A recent study reported an impact of functional connectivity (FC) between the primary motor cortex (M1) and the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) on the resting motor threshold (RMT) of the dominant hemisphere. We aimed to replicate these findings in a larger sample of 38 healthy right-handed subjects with data from both hemispheres. Resting-state FC was assessed between the M1 and five a priori defined motor-relevant regions on each hemisphere as well as interhemispherically between both primary motor cortices. Following the procedure by the original authors, we included age, cortical gray matter volume, and coil-to-cortex distance (CCD) as further predictors in the analysis. We report replication models for the dominant hemisphere as well as an extension to data from both hemispheres and support the results with Bayes factors. FC between the M1 and the PMd did not explain the variability in the RMT, and we obtained moderate evidence for the absence of this effect. In contrast, CCD could be confirmed as an important predictor with strong evidence. These findings contradict the previously proposed effect, thus questioning the notion of the PMd playing a major role in modifying corticospinal excitability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Global Variability in Deep Brain Stimulation Practices for Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.667035</link>
	<content:encoded>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has become a standard treatment option for select patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). The selection process and surgical procedures employed have, to date, not been standardized.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A comprehensive 58-question web-based survey was developed with a focus on DBS referral practices and peri-operative management. The survey was distributed to the Parkinson’s Foundation Centers of Excellence, members of the International Parkinson’s Disease and Movement Disorders Society, and the Parkinson Study Group (Functional Neurosurgery Working Group) between December 2015 and May 2016.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;There were 207 individual respondents (20% response rate) drawn from 59 countries and 6 continents, of whom 64% received formal training in DBS. Thirteen percent of centers reported that DBS could proceed despite a confidence level of &amp;lt; 50% for PD diagnosis. A case-based approach to DBS candidacy was applied in 51.3% of centers without a cut-off for levodopa-responsiveness. Surprisingly, 33% of centers regularly used imaging for diagnostic confirmation of idiopathic PD. Thirty-one percent of centers reported that neuropsychological evaluation did not affect DBS target selection. Approximately half of the respondents reported determination of DBS candidacy based on a multidisciplinary committee evaluation and 1/3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; reported that a committee was used for target selection. Eight percent of respondents felt that psychosocial factors should not impact DBS candidacy nor site selection. Involvement of allied health professionals in the preoperative process was sparse. There was high variability in preoperative education about DBS outcome expectations. Approximately half of the respondents did not utilize a “default brain target,” though STN was used more commonly than GPi. Specific DBS procedure techniques applied, as well as follow-up timelines, were highly variable.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Results revealed high variability on the best approaches for DBS candidate selection, brain target selection, procedure type, and postoperative practices. Cognitive and mood assessments were underutilized. There was low reliance on multidisciplinary teams or psychosocial factors to impact the decision-making process. There were small but significant differences in practice across global regions, especially regarding multidisciplinary teams. The wide variability of responses across multiple facets of DBS care highlights the need for prospective studies to inform evidence-based guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Differential Effects of Auditory and Visual Stimuli on Learning, Retention and Reactivation of a Perceptual-Motor Temporal Sequence in Children With Developmental Coordination Disorder</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.616795</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This study investigates the procedural learning, retention, and reactivation of temporal sensorimotor sequences in children with and without developmental coordination disorder (DCD). Twenty typically-developing (TD) children and 12 children with DCD took part in this study. The children were required to tap on a keyboard, synchronizing with auditory or visual stimuli presented as an isochronous temporal sequence, and practice non-isochronous temporal sequences to memorize them. Immediate and delayed retention of the audio-motor and visuo-motor non-isochronous sequences were tested by removing auditory or visual stimuli immediately after practice and after a delay of 2 h. A reactivation test involved reintroducing the auditory and visual stimuli after the delayed recall. Data were computed via circular analyses to obtain asynchrony, the stability of synchronization and errors (i.e., the number of supplementary taps). Firstly, an overall deficit in synchronization with both auditory and visual isochronous stimuli was observed in DCD children compared to TD children. During practice, further improvements (decrease in asynchrony and increase in stability) were found for the audio-motor non-isochronous sequence compared to the visuo-motor non-isochronous sequence in both TD children and children with DCD. However, a drastic increase in errors occurred in children with DCD during immediate retention as soon as the auditory stimuli were removed. Reintroducing auditory stimuli decreased errors in the audio-motor sequence for children with DCD. Such changes were not seen for the visuo-motor non-isochronous sequence, which was equally learned, retained and reactivated in DCD and TD children. All these results suggest that TD children benefit from both auditory and visual stimuli to memorize the sequence, whereas children with DCD seem to present a deficit in integrating an audio-motor sequence in their memory. The immediate effect of reactivation suggests a specific dependency on auditory information in DCD. Contrary to the audio-motor sequence, the visuo-motor sequence was both learned and retained in children with DCD. This suggests that visual stimuli could be the best information for memorizing a temporal sequence in DCD. All these results are discussed in terms of a specific audio-motor coupling deficit in DCD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Optimal Organization of Functional Connectivity Networks for Segregation and Integration With Large-Scale Critical Dynamics in Human Brains</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.641335</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The optimal organization for functional segregation and integration in brain is made evident by the “small-world” feature of functional connectivity (FC) networks and is further supported by the loss of this feature that has been described in many types of brain disease. However, it remains unknown how such optimally organized FC networks arise from the brain's structural constrains. On the other hand, an emerging literature suggests that brain function may be supported by critical neural dynamics, which is believed to facilitate information processing in brain. Though previous investigations have shown that the critical dynamics plays an important role in understanding the relation between whole brain structural connectivity and functional connectivity, it is not clear if the critical dynamics could be responsible for the optimal FC network configuration in human brains. Here, we show that the long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs) in the resting state fMRI blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals are significantly correlated with the topological matrices of the FC brain network. Using structure-dynamics-function modeling approach that incorporates diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data and simple cellular automata dynamics, we showed that the critical dynamics could optimize the whole brain FC network organization by, e.g., maximizing the clustering coefficient while minimizing the characteristic path length. We also demonstrated with a more detailed excitation-inhibition neuronal network model that loss of local excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance causes failure of critical dynamics, therefore disrupting the optimal FC network organization. The results highlighted the crucial role of the critical dynamics in forming an optimal organization of FC networks in the brain and have potential application to the understanding and modeling of abnormal FC configurations in neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Microglia in Health and Disease: The Strength to Be Diverse and Reactive</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.660523</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microglia are the resident immune effector cells of the central nervous system (CNS) rapidly reacting to any perturbation in order to maintain CNS homeostasis. Although their outstanding reactive properties have been elucidated over the last decades, their heterogeneity in healthy tissue, such as across brain regions, as well as their diversity in the development and progression of brain diseases, are currently opening new avenues to understand the cellular and functional states of microglia subsets in a context-dependent manner. Here, we review the main breakthrough studies that helped in elucidating microglia heterogeneity in the healthy and diseased brain and might pave the way to critical functional screenings of the inferred cellular diversity. We suggest that unraveling the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying specific functionalities of microglial subpopulations, which may ultimately support or harm the neuronal network in neurodegenerative diseases, or may acquire pro- or anti-tumorigenic phenotypes in brain tumors, will possibly uncover new therapeutic avenues for to date non-curable neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Sustained Hippocampal Synaptic Pathophysiology Following Single and Repeated Closed-Head Concussive Impacts</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.652721</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI), and related diseases such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and Alzheimer’s (AD), are of increasing concern in part due to enhanced awareness of their long-term neurological effects on memory and behavior. Repeated concussions, vs. single concussions, have been shown to result in worsened and sustained symptoms including impaired cognition and histopathology. To assess and compare the persistent effects of single or repeated concussive impacts on mediators of memory encoding such as synaptic transmission, plasticity, and cellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling, a closed-head controlled cortical impact (CCI) approach was used which closely replicates the mode of injury in clinical cases. Adult male rats received a sham procedure, a single impact, or three successive impacts at 48-hour intervals. After 30 days, hippocampal slices were prepared for electrophysiological recordings and 2-photon Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging, or fixed and immunostained for pathogenic phospho-tau species. In both concussion groups, hippocampal circuits showed hyper-excitable synaptic responsivity upon Schaffer collateral stimulation compared to sham animals, indicating sustained defects in hippocampal circuitry. This was not accompanied by sustained LTP deficits, but resting Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels and voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals were elevated in both concussion groups, while ryanodine receptor-evoked Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; responses decreased with repeat concussions. Furthermore, pathogenic phospho-tau staining was progressively elevated in both concussion groups, with spreading beyond the hemisphere of injury, consistent with CTE. Thus, single and repeated concussions lead to a persistent upregulation of excitatory hippocampal synapses, possibly through changes in postsynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling/regulation, which may contribute to histopathology and detrimental long-term cognitive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Modeling Working Memory in a Spiking Neuron Network Accompanied by Astrocytes</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.631485</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We propose a novel biologically plausible computational model of working memory (WM) implemented by a spiking neuron network (SNN) interacting with a network of astrocytes. The SNN is modeled by synaptically coupled Izhikevich neurons with a non-specific architecture connection topology. Astrocytes generating calcium signals are connected by local gap junction diffusive couplings and interact with neurons via chemicals diffused in the extracellular space. Calcium elevations occur in response to the increased concentration of the neurotransmitter released by spiking neurons when a group of them fire coherently. In turn, gliotransmitters are released by activated astrocytes modulating the strength of the synaptic connections in the corresponding neuronal group. Input information is encoded as two-dimensional patterns of short applied current pulses stimulating neurons. The output is taken from frequencies of transient discharges of corresponding neurons. We show how a set of information patterns with quite significant overlapping areas can be uploaded into the neuron-astrocyte network and stored for several seconds. Information retrieval is organized by the application of a cue pattern representing one from the memory set distorted by noise. We found that successful retrieval with the level of the correlation between the recalled pattern and ideal pattern exceeding 90% is possible for the multi-item WM task. Having analyzed the dynamical mechanism of WM formation, we discovered that astrocytes operating at a time scale of a dozen of seconds can successfully store traces of neuronal activations corresponding to information patterns. In the retrieval stage, the astrocytic network selectively modulates synaptic connections in the SNN leading to successful recall. Information and dynamical characteristics of the proposed WM model agrees with classical concepts and other WM models.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Deep Learning-Based Classification of GAD67-Positive Neurons Without the Immunosignal</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.643067</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Excitatory neurons and GABAergic interneurons constitute neural circuits and play important roles in information processing. In certain brain regions, such as the neocortex and the hippocampus, there are fewer interneurons than excitatory neurons. Interneurons have been quantified via immunohistochemistry, for example, for GAD67, an isoform of glutamic acid decarboxylase. Additionally, the expression level of other proteins varies among cell types. For example, NeuN, a commonly used marker protein for postmitotic neurons, is expressed differently across brain regions and cell classes. Thus, we asked whether GAD67-immunopositive neurons can be detected using the immunofluorescence signals of NeuN and the fluorescence signals of Nissl substances. To address this question, we stained neurons in layers 2/3 of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and the primary motor cortex (M1) of mice and manually labeled the neurons as either cell type using GAD67 immunosignals. We then sought to detect GAD67-positive neurons without GAD67 immunosignals using a custom-made deep learning-based algorithm. Using this deep learning-based model, we succeeded in the binary classification of the neurons using Nissl and NeuN signals without referring to the GAD67 signals. Furthermore, we confirmed that our deep learning-based method surpassed classic machine-learning methods in terms of binary classification performance. Combined with the visualization of the hidden layer of our deep learning algorithm, our model provides a new platform for identifying unbiased criteria for cell-type classification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.650377</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;To explore the evaluation of white matter structural network analysis in the differentiation of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and subcortical ischemic vascular dementia (SIVD), 67 participants [31 AD patients, 19 SIVD patients, and 19 normal control (NC)] were enrolled in this study. Each participant underwent 3.0T MRI scanning. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were analyzed by graph theory (GRETNA toolbox). Statistical analyses of global parameters [gamma, sigma, lambda, global shortest path length (Lp), global efficiency (E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;), and local efficiency (E&lt;sub&gt;loc&lt;/sub&gt;)] and nodal parameters [betweenness centrality (BC)] were obtained. Network-based statistical analysis (NBS) was employed to analyze the group differences of structural connections. The diagnosis efficiency of nodal BC in identifying different types of dementia was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. There were no significant differences of gender and years of education among the groups. There were no significant differences of sigma and gamma in AD vs. NC and SIVD vs. NC, whereas the E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; values of AD and SIVD were statistically decreased, and the lambda values were increased. The BC of the frontal cortex, left superior parietal gyrus, and left precuneus in AD patients were obviously reduced, while the BC of the prefrontal and subcortical regions were decreased in SIVD patients, compared with NC. SIVD patients had decreased structural connections in the frontal, prefrontal, and subcortical regions, while AD patients had decreased structural connections in the temporal and occipital regions and increased structural connections in the frontal and prefrontal regions. The highest area under curve (AUC) of BC was 0.946 in the right putamen for AD vs. SIVD. White matter structural network analysis may be a potential and promising method, and the topological changes of the network, especially the BC change in the right putamen, were valuable in differentiating AD and SIVD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.627919</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) has been widely used to investigate structural alterations in amnesia mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). However, inconsistent results have hindered our understanding of the exact neuropathology related to aMCI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: Our aim was to systematically review the literature reporting VBM on aMCI to elucidate consistent gray matter alterations, their functional characterization, and corresponding co-activation patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: The PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases were searched for VBM studies on aMCI published from inception up to June 2020. Peak coordinates were extracted from clusters that showed significant gray matter differences between aMCI patients and healthy controls (HC). Meta-analysis was performed using seed-based d mapping with the permutation of subject images (SDM-PSI), a newly improved meta-analytic method. Functional characterization and task-based co-activation patterns using the BrainMap database were performed on significant clusters to explore their functional roles. Finally, VBM was performed based on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset to further support the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A total of 31 studies with 681 aMCI patients and 837 HC were included in this systematic review. The aMCI group showed significant gray matter atrophy in the left amygdala and right hippocampus, which was consistent with results from the ADNI dataset. Functional characterization revealed that these regions were mainly associated with emotion, cognition, and perception. Further, meta-regression analysis demonstrated that gray matter atrophy in the left inferior frontal gyrus and the left angular gyrus was significantly associated with cognitive impairment in the aMCI group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The findings of gray matter atrophy in the left amygdala and right hippocampus are highly consistent and robust, and not only offer a better understanding of the underlying neuropathology but also provide accurate potential biomarkers for aMCI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Male pheromones modulate synaptic transmission at the C. elegans neuromuscular junction in a sexually dimorphic manner</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/67170</link>
	<content:encoded>The development of functional synapses in the nervous system is important for animal physiology and behaviors, and its disturbance has been linked with many neurodevelopmental disorders. The synaptic transmission efficacy can be modulated by the environment to accommodate external changes, which is crucial for animal reproduction and survival. However, the underlying plasticity of synaptic transmission remains poorly understood. Here we show that in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;, the male environment increases the hermaphrodite cholinergic transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), which alters hermaphrodites' locomotion velocity and mating efficiency. We identify that the male-specific pheromones mediate this synaptic transmission modulation effect in a developmental stage-dependent manner. Dissection of the sensory circuits reveals that the AWB chemosensory neurons sense those male pheromones and further transduce the information to NMJ using cGMP signaling. Exposure of hermaphrodites to the male pheromones specifically increases the accumulation of presynaptic CaV2 calcium channels and clustering of postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors at cholinergic synapses of NMJ, which potentiates cholinergic synaptic transmission. Thus, our study demonstrates a circuit mechanism for synaptic modulation and behavioral flexibility by sexual dimorphic pheromones.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Somatostatin interneurons activated by 5-HT2A receptor suppress slow oscillations in medial entorhinal cortex</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66960</link>
	<content:encoded>Serotonin (5-HT) is one of the major neuromodulators present in the mammalian brain and has been shown to play a role in multiple physiological processes. The mechanisms by which 5-HT modulates cortical network activity, however, are not yet fully understood. We investigated the effects of 5-HT on slow oscillations (SOs), a synchronized cortical network activity universally present across species. SOs are observed during anesthesia and are considered to be the default cortical activity pattern. We discovered that (±)3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and fenfluramine, two potent 5-HT releasers, inhibit SOs within the entorhinal cortex (EC) in anesthetized mice. Combining opto- and pharmacogenetic manipulations with in vitro electrophysiological recordings, we uncovered that somatostatin-expressing (Sst) interneurons activated by the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor (5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R) play an important role in the suppression of SOs. Since 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R signaling is involved in the etiology of different psychiatric disorders and mediates the psychological effects of many psychoactive serotonergic drugs, we propose that the newly discovered link between Sst interneurons and 5-HT will contribute to our understanding of these complex topics.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Transient kinetic studies of the antiviral Drosophila Dicer-2 reveal roles of ATP in self•nonself discrimination</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65810</link>
	<content:encoded>Some RIG-I-like receptors discriminate viral and cellular dsRNA by their termini, and &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; Dicer-2 (dmDcr-2) differentially processes dsRNA with blunt or 2 nucleotide 3'-overhanging termini. We investigated the transient kinetic mechanism of the dmDcr-2 reaction using a rapid reaction stopped-flow technique and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. Indeed, we found that ATP binding to dmDcr-2's helicase domain impacts association and dissociation kinetics of dsRNA in a termini-dependent manner, revealing termini-dependent discrimination of dsRNA on a biologically-relevant time-scale (seconds). ATP hydrolysis promotes transient unwinding of dsRNA termini followed by slow rewinding, and directional translocation of the enzyme to the cleavage site. Time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy reveals a nucleotide-dependent modulation in conformational fluctuations (nanoseconds) of the helicase and Platform•PAZ domains that is correlated with termini-dependent dsRNA cleavage. Our study offers a kinetic framework for comparison to other Dicers, as well as all members of the RIG-I- like receptors involved in innate immunity.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The evolutionarily conserved TREX complex plays central roles during mRNP (messenger ribonucleoprotein) maturation and export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In yeast, TREX is composed of the THO sub-complex (Tho2, Hpr1, Tex1, Mft1, and Thp2), the DEAD box ATPase Sub2, and Yra1. Here we present a 3.7 Å cryo-EM structure of the yeast THO•Sub2 complex. The structure reveals the intimate assembly of THO revolving around its largest subunit Tho2. THO stabilizes a semi-open conformation of the Sub2 ATPase via interactions with Tho2. We show that THO interacts with the SR-like protein Gbp2 through both the RS domain and RRM domains of Gbp2. Crosslinking mass spectrometry analysis supports the extensive interactions between THO and Gbp2, further revealing that RRM domains of Gbp2 are in close proximity to the C-terminal domain of Tho2. We propose that THO serves as a landing pad to configure Gbp2 to facilitate its loading onto mRNP.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65620</link>
	<content:encoded>It has become evident that activation of heterotrimeric G-proteins by cytoplasmic proteins that are not GPCRs plays a role in physiology and disease. Despite sharing the same biochemical Guanine-nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF) activity as GPCRs &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, the mechanisms by which these cytoplasmic proteins trigger G-protein-dependent signaling in cells have not been elucidated. Heterotrimeric G-proteins can give rise to two active signaling species, Gα-GTP and dissociated Gβγ, with different downstream effectors, but how non-receptor GEFs affect the levels of these two species in cells is not known. Here, a systematic comparison of GPCRs and three unrelated non-receptor proteins with GEF activity &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; (GIV/Girdin, AGS1, and Ric-8A) revealed high divergence in their contribution to generating Gα-GTP and free Gβγ in cells directly measured with live-cell biosensors. These findings demonstrate fundamental differences in how receptor and non-receptor G-protein activators promote signaling in cells despite sharing similar biochemical activities &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>A crucial component of social cognition is to observe and understand the social interactions of other individuals. A promising nonhuman primate model for investigating the neural basis of social interaction observation is the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small New World primate that shares a rich social repertoire with humans. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) acquired at 9.4 Tesla to map the brain areas activated by social interaction observation in awake marmosets. We discovered a network of subcortical and cortical areas, predominately in the anterior lateral frontal and medial frontal cortex, that was specifically activated by social interaction observation. This network resembled that recently identified in Old World macaque monkeys (Sliwa and Freiwald, 2017). Our findings suggest that this network is largely conserved between New and Old World primates and support the use of marmosets for studying the neural basis of social cognition.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64694</link>
	<content:encoded>Adolescence is a critical time for the continued maturation of brain networks. Here, we assessed structural connectome development in a large longitudinal sample ranging from childhood to young adulthood. By projecting high-dimensional connectomes into compact manifold spaces, we identified a marked expansion of structural connectomes with the strongest effects in transmodal regions during adolescence. Findings reflected increased within-module connectivity together with increased segregation, indicating increasing differentiation of higher-order association networks from the rest of the brain. Projection of subcortico-cortical connectivity patterns into these manifolds showed parallel alterations in pathways centered on the caudate and thalamus. Connectome findings were contextualized via spatial transcriptome association analysis, highlighting genes enriched in cortex, thalamus, and striatum. Statistical learning of cortical and subcortical manifold features at baseline and their maturational change predicted measures of intelligence at follow-up. Our findings demonstrate that connectome manifold learning can bridge the conceptual and empirical gaps between macroscale network reconfigurations, microscale processes, and cognitive outcomes in adolescent development.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63768</link>
	<content:encoded>Although the function of microRNAs (miRNAs) during embryonic development has been intensively studied in recent years, their postnatal physiological functions remain largely unexplored due to inherent difficulties with the presence of redundant paralogs of the same seed. Thus, it is particularly challenging to uncover miRNA functions at neural circuit level since animal behaviors would need to be assessed upon complete loss of miRNA family functions. Here, we focused on the neural functions of MiR34/449 that manifests a dynamic expression pattern in the spinal cord from embryonic to postnatal stages. Our behavioral assays reveal that the loss of MiR34/449 miRNAs perturb thermally-induced pain response thresholds and compromised delicate motor output in mice. Mechanistically, MiR34/449 directly target &lt;i&gt;Satb1 &lt;/i&gt;and&lt;i&gt; Satb2&lt;/i&gt; to fine-tune the precise number of a sub-population of motor synergy encoder (MSE) neurons. Thus, MiR34/449 fine-tunes optimal development of Satb1/2&lt;sup&gt;on&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons in the spinal cord, thereby refining explicit sensory-to-motor circuit outputs.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59161</link>
	<content:encoded>Mice emit ultrasonic vocalizations (USV) that communicate socially-relevant information. To detect and classify these USVs, here we describe VocalMat. VocalMat is a software that uses image-processing and differential geometry approaches to detect USVs in audio files, eliminating the need for user-defined parameters. VocalMat also uses computational vision and machine learning methods to classify USVs into distinct categories. In a dataset of &amp;gt;4,000 USVs emitted by mice, VocalMat detected over 98% of manually labeled USVs and accurately classified ~86% of the USVs out of eleven USV categories. We then used dimensionality reduction tools to analyze the probability distribution of USV classification among different experimental groups, providing a robust method to quantify and qualify the vocal repertoire of mice. Thus, VocalMat makes it possible to perform automated, accurate, and quantitative analysis of USVs without the need for user inputs, opening the opportunity for detailed and high-throughput analysis of this behavior.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.31.437953v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The cortical microcircuit can dynamically adjust to dramatic changes in the strength, scale, and complexity of its input. In the primary visual cortex (V1), pyramidal cells (PCs) integrate widely across space when signals are weak, but integrate narrowly when signals are strong, a phenomenon known as contrast-dependent surround suppression. Theoretical work has proposed that local interneurons could mediate a shift from cooperation to competition of PCs across cortical space, underlying this computation. We combine calcium imaging and electrophysiology to constrain a stabilized superlinear network model that explains how the four principal cell types in layer 2/3 (L2/3) of mouse V1, somatostatin (SST), parvalbumin (PV), and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) interneurons, and PCs, transform inputs from layer 4 (L4) PCs to encode drifting gratings of varying size and contrast. Using bidirectional optogenetic perturbations, we confirm key predictions of the model. Our data and modeling show that network nonlinearities set up by recurrent amplification mediate a shift from a positive PC-VIP feedback loop at small size and low contrast to a negative PC-SST feedback loop at large size and high contrast to support this flexible computation. This may represent a widespread mechanism for gating competition across cortical space to optimally meet task demands.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Both working memory (WM) and long-term memory (LTM) utilize non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep for improvement. LTM systems consolidation is supported by hippocampal-cortical communication, whereas WM improvement is associated with the strengthening of prefrontal-autonomic networks. Prior studies have demonstrated that these two networks demonstrate mutual antagonism during sleep; but this trade-off has not been confirmed in human sleep and its functional significance is unknown. Here, we investigated the functional impact of central and autonomic activity on LTM and WM improvement. We pharmacologically enhanced central activity and observed targeted suppression of autonomic activity, and using effective connectivity, we showed greater causal influence of central over autonomic activity. Finally, we demonstrated that the central and autonomic antagonism was reflected in a behavioral trade-off between overnight LTM and WM processing. These results suggest that NREM sleep confers benefits to working and long-term memory by switching between autonomic and central processing.</content:encoded>

Theory of mind tasks activate frontal and temporoparietal regions of cortex in fMRI studies. However, it is unknown whether these regions are critical. We examined this question using multivariate voxel-based lesion symptom mapping in 22 patients with acute right hemisphere brain damage. Studies of acute patients eliminate questions of recovery and reorganization that plague long-term studies of lesioned patients. Damage to temporoparietal and inferior frontal regions impaired thinking about others' perspectives. This impairment held even after adjustment for overall extent of brain damage and language comprehension, memory, comprehension, and attention abilities. These results provide evidence that right temporoparietal and inferior frontal regions are necessary for the human ability to reason about the knowledge and beliefs of others.</content:encoded>

We investigated the neural substrate of flexible information routing by analyzing the activity of populations of visual neurons in the medial temporal area (MT) and oculomotor neurons in the superior colliculus (SC) while rhesus monkeys switched spatial attention. We demonstrated that attention increases the efficacy of visuomotor communication: trial-to-trial variability of the population of SC neurons was better predicted by the activity of MT neurons (and vice versa) when attention was directed toward their joint receptive fields. Surprisingly, this improvement in prediction was not explained or accompanied by changes in the dimensionality of the shared subspace or in local or shared pairwise noise correlations. These results suggest a mechanism by which visual attention can affect perceptual decision-making without altering local neuronal representations.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.31.437922v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The intrinsic network architecture of the brain is continuously shaped by biological and behavioral factors from younger to older adulthood. Differences in functional networks can reveal how a lifetime of learning and lived experience can alter large-scale neurophysiological dynamics, offering a powerful lens into brain and cognitive aging. Quantifying these differences has been hampered by significant methodological challenges. Here, we use multi-echo fMRI and multi-echo ICA processing, individualized cortical parcellation methods, and multivariate (gradient and edge-level) functional connectivity analyses to provide a definitive account of the intrinsic functional architecture of the brain in older adulthood. Twenty minutes of resting-state multi-echo fMRI data were collected in younger (n=181) and older (n=120) adults. Dimensionality, the number of independent, non-noise BOLD components in the fMRI signal, was significantly reduced for older adults. Macroscale functional gradients were largely preserved. In contrast, edge-level functional connectivity was significantly altered. Within-network connections were weaker while connections between networks were stronger for older adults, and this connectivity pattern was associated with lower executive control functioning. Greater integration of sensory and motor regions with transmodal association cortices also emerged as a prominent feature of the aging connectome. These findings implicate network dedifferentiation, reflected here as reduced dimensionality within the BOLD signal and altered edge-level connectivity, as a global and putatively maladaptive feature of functional brain aging. However, greater coherence among specific networks may also signal adaptive functional reorganization in later life. By overcoming persistent and pervasive methodological challenges that have confounded previous research, the results provide a comprehensive account of the intrinsic functional architecture of the aging brain.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.31.437916v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In female rats, pubertal onset is associated with maturation of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and mPFC-mediated behaviors. These behavioral and anatomical changes are likely due to effects of estrogen at the nuclear estrogen receptor beta (ER{beta}), which is expressed at higher levels than the estrogen receptor alpha (ER) isoform in the adult mPFC. Researchers have previously quantified ER{beta} protein and Esr2 RNA in rodents during early postnatal development and adulthood, but an adolescent-specific trajectory of this receptor in the mPFC has not been documented. Given that levels of Esr2 can fluctuate in the presence or absence of estrogens, puberty and the subsequent rise in gonadal hormones could influence ER{beta} expression in the adolescent brain. To further explore this, we used RNAscope to quantify the amount of Esr2 mRNA in pre-pubertal adolescent, recently post-pubertal adolescent, and adult female rats. We show here that Esr2 expression decreases significantly in the mPFC, striatum and motor cortex between pre-pubertal adolescence and adulthood. In the mPFC, this decrease occurs rapidly at pubertal onset, with no significant decrease in Esr2 levels between the recently post-pubertal and adult cohort. In contrast in the striatum and motor cortex, there were no significant differences in the amount of Esr2 between pre- and post-pubertal females. Insofar as the amount of Esr2 is proportional to functional ER{beta}, these results suggest ER{beta} decreases in a region-specific pattern in response to pubertal onset and highlight a role for this receptor in the maturational events that occur in the female rat mPFC at puberty.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI) is a popular method for studying brain function, but it remains unclear to what degree its signals reflect neural activity on a trial-by-trial basis. Here, we answer this question with simultaneous fUSI and neural recordings with Neuropixels probes in awake mice. fUSI signals strongly correlated with the slow (&amp;lt;0.3 Hz) fluctuations in firing rate measured in the same location and were closely predicted by convolving the firing rate with a 2.9 s wide linear filter. This filter matched the hemodynamic response function of awake mouse and was invariant across mice, stimulus conditions, and brain regions. fUSI signals matched neural firing also spatially: recordings with two probes revealed that firing rates were as highly correlated across hemispheres as fUSI signals. We conclude that fUSI signals bear a simple linear relationship to neuronal firing and accurately reflect neural activity both in time and in space.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.31.437904v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>During steady-state walking mediolateral gait stability can be maintained by controlling the center of pressure (CoP). The CoP modulates the moment of the ground reaction force, which brakes and reverses movement of the center of mass (CoM) towards the lateral border of the base of support. In addition to foot placement, ankle moments serve to control the CoP. We hypothesized that, during steady-state walking, single stance ankle moments establish a CoP shift to correct for errors in foot placement. We expected ankle muscle activity to be associated with this complementary CoP shift. During treadmill walking, full-body kinematics, ground reaction forces and electromyography were recorded in thirty healthy participants. We found a negative relationship between preceding foot placement error and CoP displacement during single stance. Too medial steps were compensated for by a lateral CoP shift and vice versa, too lateral steps were compensated for by a medial CoP shift. Peroneus longus, soleus and tibialis anterior activity correlated with these CoP shifts. As such, we identified an (active) ankle strategy during steady-state walking. As expected, absolute explained CoP variance by foot placement error decreased when walking with shoes constraining ankle moments. Yet, contrary to our expectations that ankle moment control would compensate for constrained foot placement, the absolute explained CoP variance by foot placement error did not increase when foot placement was constrained. We argue that this lack of compensation reflects the interdependent nature of ankle moment and foot placement control. We suggest that single stance ankle moments do not only compensate for preceding foot placement errors, but also assist control of the subsequent foot placement. Foot placement and ankle moment control are caught in a circular relationship, in which constraints imposed on one will also influence the other.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Neocortical interneurons provide local inhibition responsible for organizing neuronal activity into brain oscillations that subserve several functions such as memory, attention and neuronal communication. However, little is known about the contribution of interneurons to the entrainment of neocortical oscillations across cortical layers. Here, using layer-specific optogenetic stimulations with micro-Light-Emitting-Diode (LED) arrays, directed toward parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons in non-anesthetized awake mice, we find that supragranular layer stimulations of PV neurons were most efficient at entraining supragranular layer neurons and local field potential (LFP) oscillations at gamma frequencies ({gamma}: 25 - 80 Hz), whereas infragranular layer stimulation of PV neurons better entrained delta ({delta}: 2 - 5 Hz) and theta ({theta}: 6 - 10 Hz) frequency LFP oscillations. We found that PV neurons tightly control the transmission of multiple rhythms to the network across cortical layers in an orientation-selective manner. Intrinsic resonant properties of neurons could underlie such layer-specific properties of rhythm entrainment.</content:encoded>

New Method: NeuriteNet is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) sorting model that uses a novel adaptation of the XRAI saliency map overlay, which is a region-based attribution method. NeuriteNet compares neuronal populations based on differences in neurite growth patterns, sorts them into respective groups, and overlays a saliency map indicating which areas differentiated the image for the sorting procedure. Results: In this study, we demonstrate that NeuriteNet effectively sorts images corresponding to dissociated neurons into control and treatment groups according to known morphological differences. Furthermore, the saliency map overlay highlights the distinguishing features of the neuron when sorting the images into treatment groups. NeuriteNet also identifies novel morphological differences in neurites of neurons cultured from control and genetically modified mouse strains. Comparison with Existing Methods: Unlike other neurite analysis platforms, NeuriteNet does not require manual manipulations, such as segmentation of neurites prior to analysis, and is more accurate than experienced researchers for categorizing neurons according to their pattern of neurite growth. Conclusions: NeuriteNet can be used to effectively screen for morphological differences in a heterogeneous group of neurons and to provide feedback on the key features distinguishing those groups via the saliency map overlay.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Locus coeruleus activity improves cochlear implant performance</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.31.437870v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Cochlear implants are neuroprosthetic devices that can provide hearing to deaf patients1. Despite significant benefits offered by cochlear implants, there are highly variable outcomes in how quickly hearing is restored and perceptual accuracy after months or years of use2,3. Cochlear implant use is believed to require neuroplasticity within the central auditory system, and differential engagement of neuroplastic mechanisms might contribute to outcome variability4-7. Despite extensive studies on how cochlear implants activate the auditory system4,8-12, our understanding of cochlear implant-related neuroplasticity remains limited. One potent factor enabling plasticity is the neuromodulator norepinephrine from the brainstem locus coeruleus. Here we examined behavioral responses and neural activity in locus coeruleus and auditory cortex of deafened rats fitted with multi-channel cochlear implants. Animals were trained on a reward-based auditory task, with considerable individual differences of learning rates and maximum performance. Photometry from locus coeruleus predicted when implanted subjects would begin responding to sounds and longer-term perceptual accuracy, which were augmented by optogenetic locus coeruleus stimulation. Auditory cortical responses to cochlear implant stimulation reflected behavioral performance, with enhanced responses to rewarded stimuli and decreased distinction between unrewarded stimuli. Adequate engagement of central neuromodulatory systems is thus a potential clinically-relevant target for optimizing neuroprosthetic device use.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Two families of ligand-gated ion channels function as olfactory receptors in insects. Here, we show that these canonical olfactory receptors are not necessary for responses to ammonia, a key ecological odor that is attractive to many insects including disease vectors and agricultural pests. Instead, we show that a member of the ancient electrogenic ammonium transporter family, Amt, is a new type of olfactory receptor. We report two hitherto unidentified olfactory neuron populations that mediate neuronal and behavioral responses to ammonia. Their endogenous ammonia responses are Amt-dependent, and ectopic expression of either Drosophila or Anopheles Amt confers ammonia sensitivity. Amt is the first transporter known to function as an olfactory receptor in animals, and its role may be conserved across insect species.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.31.437850v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by phosphorylation and aggregation of the protein -Synuclein and ensuing neuronal death progressing from the noradrenergic locus coeruleus to midbrain dopaminergic neurons. In 2019, Matsui and colleagues reported in Cell Reports a spontaneous age-dependent degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and an even greater neurodegeneration of the noradrenergic neurons in the short-lived killifish Nothobranchius furzeri. Given the great possible relevance of a spontaneous model for PD, we set to confirm their results by whole-brain clarification and 3D nuclei reconstruction to quantify total cell numbers. We observed an age dependent neurodegeneration limited to the locus coeruleus and not involving the posterior tuberculum. In addition, we observed the presence of phospho-Synuclein in the soma of locus coeruleus neurons detectable already at a young age and increasing during aging. Our result demonstrates that N. furzeri models the early stages of PD, but not the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.31.437847v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>When encoding new episodic memories, visual and semantic processing are proposed to make distinct contributions to accurate memory and memory distortions. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and representational similarity analysis to uncover the representations that predict true and false recognition of unfamiliar objects. Two semantic models captured coarse-grained taxonomic categories and specific object features, respectively, while two perceptual models embodied low-level visual properties. Twenty-eight female and male participants encoded images of objects during fMRI scanning, and later had to discriminate studied objects from similar lures and novel objects in a recognition memory test. Both perceptual and semantic models predicted true memory. When studied objects were later identified correctly, neural patterns corresponded to low-level visual representations of these object images in the early visual cortex, lingual, and fusiform gyri. In a similar fashion, alignment of neural patterns with fine-grained semantic feature representations in the fusiform gyrus also predicted true recognition. However, emphasis on coarser taxonomic representations predicted forgetting more anteriorly in ventral anterior temporal lobe, left perirhinal cortex, and left inferior frontal gyrus. In contrast, false recognition of similar lure objects was associated with weaker visual analysis posteriorly in early visual and left occipitotemporal cortex. The results implicate multiple perceptual and semantic representations in successful memory encoding and suggest that fine-grained semantic as well as visual analysis contributes to accurate later recognition, while processing visual image detail is critical for avoiding false recognition errors.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.31.437831v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Spatio-temporal receptive field (STRF) models are frequently used to approximate the computation implemented by a sensory neuron. Typically, such STRFs are assumed to be smooth and sparse. Current state-of-the-art approaches for estimating STRFs based empirical Bayes estimation encode such prior knowledge into a prior covariance matrix, whose hyperparameters are learned from the data, and thus provide STRF estimates with the desired properties even with little or noisy data. However, empirical Bayes methods are often not computationally efficient in high-dimensional settings, as encountered in sensory neuroscience. Here we pursued an alternative approach and encode prior knowledge for estimation of STRFs by choosing a set of basis function with the desired properties: a natural cubic spline basis. Our method is computationally efficient, and can be easily applied to Linear-Gaussian and Linear-Nonlinear-Poisson models as well as more complicated Linear-Nonlinear-Linear-Nonlinear cascade model or spike-triggered clustering methods. We compared the performance of spline-based methods to no-spline ones on simulated and experimental data, showing that spline-based methods consistently outperformed the no-spline versions.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.31.437827v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Hedonic evaluation of sensory objects varies from person to person. While this variability has been linked to differences in experience and personality traits, little is known about why stimuli lead to different evaluations in different people. We used linear mixed effect models to determine the extent to which the openness, contour, and ceiling height of interior architectural spaces influenced the beauty and pleasantness ratings of 18 participants. Then, by analyzing structural brain images acquired for the same group of participants we asked if any regional grey matter volume (rGMV) co-varied with these differences in the extent to which openness, contour and ceiling height influence beauty and pleasantness ratings. Voxel-based morphometry analysis revealed that the influence of openness on pleasantness ratings correlated with rGMV in the anterior prefrontal cortex (BA 10), and the influence of openness on beauty ratings correlated with rGMV in the temporal pole (BA 38) and posterior cingulate cortex (BA 31). There were no significant correlations involving contour or ceiling height. Our results suggest that regional variance in grey matter volume may play a role in the computation of hedonic valuation, and account for differences in the way people weigh certain attributes of interior architectural spaces.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Balance training improves feedback control of perturbed balance in older adults</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.31.437824v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Recovering balance after perturbations becomes challenging with aging, but an effective balance training could reduce such challenges. In this study, we examined the effect of balance training on feedback control after unpredictable perturbations by investigating balance performance, recovery strategy, and muscle synergies. We assessed the effect of balance training on unipedal perturbed balance in twenty older adults (&amp;gt;65 years) after short-term (one session) and long-term (3-weeks) training. Participants were exposed to random medial and lateral perturbations consisting of 8-degree rotations of a robot-controlled balance platform. We measured full-body 3D kinematics and activation of 9 muscles (8 stance leg muscles, one trunk muscle) during 2.5 s after the onset of perturbation. The perturbation was divided into 3 phases: phase1 from the onset to maximum rotation of the platform, phase 2 from the maximum rotation angle to the 0-degree angle and phase 3 after platform movement. Balance performance improved after long-term training as evidenced by decreased amplitudes of center of mass acceleration and rate of change of body angular momentum. The rate of change of angular momentum did not directly contribute to return of the center of mass within the base of support, but it reoriented the body to an aligned and vertical position. The improved performance coincided with altered activation of synergies depending on the direction and phase of the perturbation. We concluded that balance training improves control of perturbed balance, and reorganizes feedback responses, by changing temporal patterns of muscle activation. These effects were more pronounced after long-term than short-term training.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.31.437821v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The zinc finger protein 804A (ZNF804A) and the 5'-nucleotidase cytosolic II (NT5C2) genes have been identified as robust susceptibility genes in large-scale genome-wide association studies of schizophrenia. The ZNF804A and NT5C2 proteins are highly expressed in developing and mature cortical neurons. ZNF804A has been implicated in regulating the development of neuronal morphology; it localises to synapses and is required for activity-dependent modifications of dendritic spines. NT5C2 has been shown to regulate 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase activity and implicated in influencing protein synthesis in neural progenitor cells. But despite these findings, a better understanding of the role these proteins play in regulating neuronal function is needed. A recent yeast two-hybrid screen has identified ZNF804A and NT5C2 as potential interacting proteins, but whether this occurs in situ; and moreover, in cortical neurons, is unknown. Here we show that ZNF804A and Nt5C2 colocalise and interact in hEK293T cells. Furthermore, their rodent homolouges, ZFP804A and NT5C2, specifically colocalise at synapses and form a protein complex in cortical neurons. Knockdown of Zfp804A or Nt5c2 resulted in a significant decrease in synaptic expression of both proteins, suggesting that both proteins are required for the synaptic targeting of each other. Taken together, these data indicate that ZNF804A/ZFP804A and NT5C2 interact together in cortical neurons and indicate that these GWAS risk factors may function as a complex to regulate neuronal function.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.31.437811v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The emerging role of microglia in neurological disorders requires a novel method for obtaining massive amounts of adult microglia because current in vitro methods for microglial study have many limitations, including a limited proliferative capacity, low cell yield, immature form, and too many experimental animals use. Here, we developed a new method for obtaining bankable and expandable adult-like microglial cells using the head neuroepithelial layer (NEL) of mouse E13.5. The NEL includes microglia progenitors that proliferate and ramify over time. Functional validation with a magnetic-activated cell sorting system using the NEL showed that the isolated CD11b-positive cells (NEL-MG) exhibited microglial functions, such as phagocytosis (microbeads, amyloid {beta}, synaptosome), migration, and inflammatory changes following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. NEL was subcultured and the NEL-MG exhibited a higher expression of microglia signature genes than the neonatal microglia, a widely used in vitro surrogate. Banking or long-term subculture of NEL did not affect NEL-MG characteristics. Transcriptome analysis revealed that NEL-MG exhibited better conservation of microglia signature genes with a closer fidelity to freshly isolated adult microglia than neonatal microglia. This new method effectively contributes to obtaining adult-like microglial cells, even when only a small number of experimental animals are available, leading to a broad application in neuroscience-associated fields.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Complex movements require the fine-tuned temporal interplay of several effectors. If the temporal properties of one of these effectors were distorted, all other movement plans would need to be updated in order to produce successful behavior. This requirement of a global motor time stands in direct contrast to the multiple duration-channels in visual time. We explored whether time-critical and goal-oriented movements are indeed globally affected by temporal recalibration. In a ready-set-go paradigm, participants reproduced the interval between ready- and set-signals by performing different movements in Virtual Reality (VR). Halfway through the experiments, movements in VR were artificially slowed down, so that participants had to adapt their behavior. In three experiments, we found that these adaptation effects were not affected by movement type, interval range, location, or environmental context. We conclude that the temporal planning of motor actions is recalibrated globally, suggesting the presence of a global temporal movement controller.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Expressions of voltage-gated sodium channels Nav1.1 and Nav1.2, encoded by SCN1A and SCN2A genes, respectively, have been reported to be mutually exclusive in most brain regions. In adult neocortex, Nav1.1 is dominant in inhibitory neurons while Nav1.2 is dominant in excitatory neurons. Although a distinct subpopulation of neocortical excitatory neurons was also reported to express Nav1.1, their nature has been uncharacterized. By using newly-generated transgenic mouse lines expressing Scn1a promoter-driven green fluorescent protein (GFP), here we confirm mutually-exclusive expressions of Nav1.1 and Nav1.2, absence of Nav1.1 in hippocampal excitatory neurons, and further show that among neocortical excitatory neurons Nav1.1 is expressed in pyramidal tract and a subpopulation of cortico-cortical while Nav1.2 in cortico-striatal, cortico-thalamic and a distinct subpopulation of cortico-cortical projection neurons. These observations now contribute to the elucidation of pathological neural circuits for epilepsies and neurodevelopmental disorders caused by SCN1A and SCN2A mutations including sudden death in Dravet syndrome.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Learning which environmental cues that predict danger is crucial for survival and accomplished through Pavlovian fear conditioning. In humans and rodents alike, fear conditioning is amygdala-dependent and rests on similar neurocircuitry. Rodent studies have implicated a causative role for dopamine in the amygdala during fear memory formation, but the role of dopamine in aversive learning in humans is unclear. Here, we show dopamine release in the amygdala and striatum during fear learning in humans. Using simultaneous positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging, we demonstrate that the amount of dopamine release is linked to strength of conditioned fear responses and linearly coupled to learning-induced memory trace activity in the amygdala. Thus, like in rodents, formation of amygdala-dependent fear memories in humans seems to be facilitated by endogenous dopamine release, supporting an evolutionary conserved neurochemical mechanism for aversive memory formation.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.31.437664v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Ventriloquism aftereffect (VAE), observed as a shift in the perceived locations of sounds after audiovisual stimulation, requires reference frame (RF) alignment since hearing and vision encode space in different RFs (head-centered, HC, vs. eye-centered, EC). Experimental studies examining the RF of VAE found inconsistent results: a mixture of HC and EC RFs was observed for VAE induced in the central region, while a predominantly HC RF was observed in the periphery. Here, a computational model examines these inconsistencies, as well as a newly observed EC adaptation induced by AV-aligned audiovisual stimuli. Methods: The model has two versions, each containing two additively combined components: a saccade-related component characterizing the adaptation in auditory-saccade responses, and auditory space representation adapted by ventriloquism signals either in the HC RF (HC version) or in a combination of HC and EC RFs (HEC version). Results: The HEC model performed better than the HC model in the main simulation considering all the data, while the HC model was more appropriate when only the AV-aligned adaptation data were simulated. Conclusion: Visual signals in a uniform mixed HC+EC RF are likely used to calibrate the auditory spatial representation, even after the EC-referenced auditory-saccade adaptation is accounted for.</content:encoded>

However, in adult humans, visual cortical plasticity is mainly sustained by homeostatic mechanisms, for which the role of sleep is still largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that non-REM sleep stabilizes homeostatic plasticity of ocular dominance in adult humans. We found that the effect of short-term monocular deprivation (boost of the deprived eye) was preserved at the morning awakening (&amp;gt;6 hours after deprivation). Subjects exhibiting stronger consolidation had increased sleep spindle density in frontopolar electrodes, suggesting distributed consolidation processes. Crucially, the individual susceptibility to visual homeostatic plasticity was encoded by changes in sleep slow oscillation rate and shape and spindle power in occipital sites, consistent with an early visual cortical site of ocular dominance homeostatic plasticity.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Population Codes Enable Learning from Few Examples By Shaping Inductive Bias</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.30.437743v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The brain can learn from a limited number of experiences, an ability which requires suitable built in assumptions about the nature of the tasks which must be learned, or inductive biases. While inductive biases are central components of intelligence, how they are reflected in and shaped by population codes are not well-understood. To address this question, we consider biologically-plausible reading out of an arbitrary stimulus-response pattern from an arbitrary population code, and develop an analytical theory that predicts the generalization error of the readout as a function of the number of samples. We find that learning performance is controlled by the eigenspectrum of the population code's inner-product kernel, which measures the similarity of neural responses to two different input stimuli. Many different codes can realize the same kernel; by analyzing recordings from the mouse primary visual cortex, we demonstrate that biological codes are metabolically more efficient than other codes with identical kernels. We demonstrate that the spectral properties of the kernel introduce an inductive bias toward explaining stimulus-response samples with simple functions and determine compatibility of the population code with learning task, and hence the sample-efficiency of learning. While the tail of the spectrum is important for large sample size behavior of learning, for small sample sizes, the bulk of the spectrum governs generalization. We apply our theory to experimental recordings of mouse primary visual cortex neural responses, elucidating a bias towards sample-efficient learning of low frequency orientation discrimination tasks. We demonstrate this emergence of this bias in a simple model of primary visual cortex, and further show how invariances in the code to stimulus variations affect learning performance. Finally, we demonstrate that our methods are applicable to time-dependent neural codes. Overall, our study suggests sample-efficient learning as a general normative coding principle.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Modulation of taste sensitivity by the olfactory system in Drosophila</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.30.437740v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>An animal's sensory percepts are not raw representations of the outside world. Rather, they are constructs influenced by many factors including the species, past experiences, and internal states. One source of perceptual variability that has fascinated researchers for decades is the effect of losing one sensory modality on the performance of another. Typically, dysfunction of one sense has been associated with elevated function of others, creating a type of sensory homeostasis. For example, people with vision loss have been reported to demonstrate enhanced tactile and auditory functions, and deafness has been associated with heightened attention to visual inputs for communication. By contrast, smell and taste - the two chemosensory modalities - are so intrinsically linked in their contributions to flavor that loss of smell is often anecdotally reported as leading to deficiencies in taste. However, human studies specifically examining taste are mixed and generally do not support this widely-held belief, and data from animal models is largely lacking. Here, we examine the impact of olfactory dysfunction on taste sensitivity in Drosophila melanogaster. We find that partial loss of olfactory input (hyposmia) dramatically enhances flies' sensitivity to both appetitive (sugar, low salt) and aversive (bitter, high salt) tastes. This taste enhancement is starvation-independent and occurs following suppression of either first- or second-order olfactory neurons. Moreover, optogenetically increasing olfactory inputs reduces taste sensitivity. Finally, we observed that taste enhancement is not encoded in the activity of peripheral gustatory sensory neurons, but is associated with elevated sugar responses in protocerebrum anterior medial (PAM) dopaminergic neurons of the mushroom bodies. These results suggest a level of homeostatic control over chemosensation, where flies compensate for lack of olfactory input by increasing the salience of taste information.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.30.437721v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In the current pilot study, we attempt to find out how double neurofeedback influences functional hemispheric asymmetry and activity. We examined 30 healthy participants (8 males; 22 females, mean age = 29; SD= 8). To measure functional hemispheric asymmetry and activity, we used computer laterometry in the two-source lead-lag dichotic paradigm. Double biofeedback included 8 minutes of EEG oscillation recording with five minutes of basic mode. During the basic mode, the current amplitude of the EEG oscillator gets transformed into feedback sounds while the current amplitude of alpha EEG oscillator is used to modulate the intensity of light signals. Double neurofeedback did not directly influence the asymmetry itself but accelerated individual sound perception characteristics during dichotic listening in the preceding effect paradigm. Further research is needed to investigate the effect of double neurofeedback training on functional brain activity and asymmetry taking into account participants' age, gender, and motivation.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Depleting Hypothalamic Somatostatinergic Neurons Recapitulates Diabetic Phenotypes in Brain, Bone Marrow, Adipose, and Retina</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.30.437706v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Hypothalamic inflammation and sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity are hallmark features of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Hypothalamic inflammation may aggravate metabolic and immunologic pathologies due to extensive sympathetic activation of peripheral tissues. Loss of somatostatinergic (SST) neurons may contribute to enhanced hypothalamic inflammation. The present data show that leptin receptor deficient (db/db) mice exhibit reduced hypothalamic somatostatinergic cells, particularly in the periventricular nucleus. We model this finding, using adeno-associated virus (AAV) delivery of diphtheria toxin (DTA) driven by an SST-cre system to deplete these cells in SSTcre/gfp mice (SST-DTA). SST-DTA mice exhibit enhanced hypothalamic c-fos expression and brain inflammation as demonstrated by microglial and astrocytic activation. Bone marrow from SST-DTA mice undergoes skewed hematopoiesis, generating excess granulocyte-monocyte precursors and increased pro-inflammatory (CCR2hi) monocytes. Visceral mesenteric adipose tissue from DTA-treated animals was resistant to catecholamine induced lipolysis. Finally, SST-DTA mice exhibited a diabetic retinopathy like phenotype: reduced visual function by optokinetic response and electroretinogram, as well as increased percentages of retinal monocytes. Importantly, hyperglycemia was not observed in SST-DTA mice. Thus, the isolated reduction in hypothalamic somatostatinergic neurons was able to recapitulate several hallmark features of type 2 diabetes in disease relevant tissues.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.30.437701v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The expression of motivated behaviors depends on both external and internally-arising neural stimuli, yet the intrinsic releasing mechanisms for such variably occurring behaviors remain elusive. In isolated nervous system preparations of Aplysia, we have found that irregularly expressed cycles of motor output underlying food-seeking behavior arise from regular membrane potential oscillations of varying magnitude in an identified pair of interneurons (B63) in the bilateral buccal ganglia. This rhythmic signal, which is endogenous and specific to the B63 cells, is generated by organelle-derived intracellular calcium fluxes that activate voltage-independent plasma membrane channels. The resulting voltage oscillation spreads throughout a subset of gap junction-coupled buccal network neurons and by triggering plateau potential-mediated bursts in B63, can initiate motor output driving food-seeking action. Thus, an atypical neuronal pacemaker mechanism, based on rhythmic intracellular calcium store release and intercellular propagation, can act as an autonomous intrinsic releaser for the occurrence of a motivated behavior.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Null models are necessary for assessing whether a dataset exhibits non-trivial statistical properties. These models have recently gained interest in the neuroimaging community as means to explore dynamic properties of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) time series. Interpretation of null-model testing in this context may not be straightforward because (i) null hypotheses associated to different null models are sometimes unclear and (ii) fMRI metrics might be `trivial', i.e. preserved under the null hypothesis, and still be useful in neuroimaging applications. In this commentary, we review several commonly used null models of fMRI time series and discuss the interpretation of the corresponding tests. We argue that, while null-model testing allows for a better characterization of the statistical properties of fMRI time series and associated metrics, it should not be considered as a mandatory validation step to assess their relevance in neuroimaging applications.</content:encoded>

Combined analysis of multiple, large datasets is a common objective in the health- and biosciences. Existing methods tend to require researchers to physically bring data together in one place or follow an analysis plan and share results. Developed over the last 10 years, the DataSHIELD platform is a collection of R packages that reduce the challenges of these methods. These include ethico-legal constraints which limit researchers’ ability to physically bring data together and the analytical inflexibility associated with conventional approaches to sharing results. The key feature of DataSHIELD is that data from research studies stay on a server at each of the institutions that are responsible for the data. Each institution has control over who can access their data. The platform allows an analyst to pass commands to each server and the analyst receives results that do not disclose the individual-level data of any study participants. DataSHIELD uses Opal which is a data integration system used by epidemiological studies and developed by the OBiBa open source project in the domain of bioinformatics. However, until now the analysis of big data with DataSHIELD has been limited by the storage formats available in Opal and the analysis capabilities available in the DataSHIELD R packages. We present a new architecture (“&lt;i&gt;resources&lt;/i&gt;”) for DataSHIELD and Opal to allow large, complex datasets to be used at their original location, in their original format and with external computing facilities. We provide some real big data analysis examples in genomics and geospatial projects. For genomic data analyses, we also illustrate how to extend the resources concept to address specific big data infrastructures such as GA4GH or EGA, and make use of shell commands. Our new infrastructure will help researchers to perform data analyses in a privacy-protected way from existing data sharing initiatives or projects. To help researchers use this framework, we describe selected packages and present an online book (https://isglobal-brge.github.io/resource_bookdown).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FzMxYYtfM5E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The emerging tumor-on-chip (ToC) approaches allow to address biomedical questions out of reach with classical cell culture techniques: in biomimetic 3D hydrogels they partially reconstitute &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; the complexity of the tumor microenvironment and the cellular dynamics involving multiple cell types (cancer cells, immune cells, fibroblasts, &lt;i&gt;etc&lt;/i&gt;.). However, a clear bottleneck is the extraction and interpretation of the rich biological information contained, sometime hidden, in the cell co-culture videos. In this work, we develop and apply novel video analysis algorithms to automatically measure the cytotoxic effects on human cancer cells (lung and breast) induced either by doxorubicin chemotherapy drug or by autologous tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). A live fluorescent dye (red) is used to selectively pre-stain the cancer cells before co-cultures and a live fluorescent reporter for caspase activity (green) is used to monitor apoptotic cell death. The here described open-source computational method, named STAMP (spatiotemporal apoptosis mapper), extracts the temporal kinetics and the spatial maps of cancer death, by localizing and tracking cancer cells in the red channel, and by counting the red to green transition signals, over 2–3 days. The robustness and versatility of the method is demonstrated by its application to different cell models and co-culture combinations. Noteworthy, this approach reveals the strong contribution of primary cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) to breast cancer chemo-resistance, proving to be a powerful strategy to investigate intercellular cross-talks and drug resistance mechanisms. Moreover, we defined a new parameter, the ‘potential of death induction’, which is computed in time and in space to quantify the impact of dying cells on neighbor cells. We found that, contrary to natural death, cancer death induced by chemotherapy or by CTL is transmissible, in that it promotes the death of nearby cancer cells, suggesting the release of diffusible factors which amplify the initial cytotoxic stimulus.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/k1J4aGyy87c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Emerging epidemics are challenging to track. Only a subset of cases is recognized and reported, as seen with the Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic where large proportions of infection were asymptomatic. However, multiple imperfect indicators of infection provide an opportunity to estimate the underlying incidence of infection. We developed a modeling approach that integrates a generic Time-series Susceptible-Infected-Recovered epidemic model with assumptions about reporting biases in a Bayesian framework and applied it to the 2016 Zika epidemic in Puerto Rico using three indicators: suspected arboviral cases, suspected Zika-associated Guillain-Barré Syndrome cases, and blood bank data. Using this combination of surveillance data, we estimated the peak of the epidemic occurred during the week of August 15, 2016 (the 33&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; week of year), and 120 to 140 (50% credible interval [CrI], 95% CrI: 97 to 170) weekly infections per 10,000 population occurred at the peak. By the end of 2016, we estimated that approximately 890,000 (95% CrI: 660,000 to 1,100,000) individuals were infected in 2016 (26%, 95% CrI: 19% to 33%, of the population infected). Utilizing multiple indicators offers the opportunity for real-time and retrospective situational awareness to support epidemic preparedness and response.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FD8Cea-eKX8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Microplastics (MPs), plastic particles &amp;lt;5 mm, are found in environments, including terrestrial ecosystems, planetwide. Most research so far has focused on ecotoxicology, examining effects on performance of soil biota in controlled settings. As research pivots to a more ecosystem and global change perspective, questions about soil-borne biogeochemical cycles become important. MPs can affect the carbon cycle in numerous ways, for example, by being carbon themselves and by influencing soil microbial processes, plant growth, or litter decomposition. Great uncertainty surrounds nano-sized plastic particles, an expected by-product of further fragmentation of MPs. A major concerted effort is required to understand the pervasive effects of MPs on the functioning of soils and terrestrial ecosystems; importantly, such research needs to capture the immense diversity of these particles in terms of chemistry, aging, size, and shape.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/KksWs4w7JbY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Jane Muncke&lt;/p&gt;

The widespread use of plastic packaging for storing, transporting, and conveniently preparing or serving foodstuffs is significantly contributing to the global plastic pollution crisis. This has led to many efforts directed toward amending plastic packaging’s end of life, such as recycling, or alternative material approaches, like increasingly using paper for food packaging. But these approaches often neglect the critical issue of chemical migration: When contacting foodstuffs, chemicals that are present in packaging transfer into food and thus unwittingly become part of the human diet. Hazardous chemicals, such as endocrine disrupters, carcinogens, or substances that bioaccumulate, are collectively referred to as “chemicals of concern.” They can transfer from plastic packaging into food, together with other unknown or toxicologically uncharacterized chemicals. This chemical transfer is scientifically undisputed and makes plastic packaging a known, and avoidable, source of human exposure to synthetic, hazardous, and untested chemicals. Here, I discuss this issue and highlight aspects in need of improvement, namely the way that chemicals present in food packaging are assessed for toxicity. Further, I provide an outlook on how chemical contamination from food packaging could be addressed in the future. Robust innovations must attempt systemic change and tackle the issue of plastic pollution and chemical migration in a way that integrates all existing knowledge.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/jWaiXfzisa4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Public concern over the environmental and public health impacts of the emerging contaminant class “microplastics” has recently prompted government agencies to consider mitigation efforts. Microplastics do not easily fit within traditional risk-based regulatory frameworks because their persistence and extreme diversity (of size, shape, and chemical properties associated with sorbed chemicals) result in high levels of uncertainty in hazard and exposure estimates. Due to these serious complexities, addressing microplastics’ impacts requires open collaboration between scientists, regulators, and policymakers. Here we describe ongoing international mitigation efforts, with California as a case study, and draw lessons from a similarly diverse and environmentally persistent class of emerging contaminants (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) that is already disrupting traditional regulatory paradigms, discuss strategies to address challenges associated with developing health-protective regulations and policies related to microplastics, and suggest ways to maximize impacts of research.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/x9CpqB1G0yk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;While Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have yielded impressive results in
the realm of simulated intelligent behavior, it is important to remember that
they are but sparse approximations of Biological Neural Networks (BNNs). We go
beyond comparison of ANNs and BNNs to introduce principles from BNNs that might
guide the further development of ANNs as embodied neural models. These
principles include representational complexity, complex network
structure/energetics, and robust function. We then consider these principles in
ways that might be implemented in the future development of ANNs. In
conclusion, we consider the utility of this comparison, particularly in terms
of building more robust and dynamic ANNs. This even includes constructing a
morphology and sensory apparatus to create an embodied ANN, which when
complemented with the organizational and functional advantages of BNNs unlocks
the adaptive potential of lifelike networks.

guidance that uses visual features learnt by convolutional neural networks for

and conjunction search experiments revealed that CNN-based search model
considerably underestimates human attention guidance by simple visual features.
A simple explanation is that the model has no bottom-up guidance of attention.
Another view might be that standard CNNs do not learn features required for
human-like attention guidance.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain oscillations are believed to be involved in the different operations
necessary to manipulate information during working memory tasks. We propose a
modular variant of the Lisman-Idiart model for short-term memory, where theta,
alpha and gamma oscillations are traveling waves. Using this model we show that
the interactions between theta and gamma determine the allocation of multiple
information in distinct modules, while the interference between theta and alpha
disrupts the maintenance of current stored information. The effect of alpha in
erasing or blocking storage is robust and seems fairly independent of the
frequency, as long as it stays within the alpha range. The model help us to
understand why the alpha and theta oscillations, which have close frequency
bands, could have opposite roles in working memory.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The majority of model-based learned image reconstruction methods in medical
imaging have been limited to uniform domains, such as pixelated images. If the
underlying model is solved on nonuniform meshes, arising from a finite element
method typical for nonlinear inverse problems, interpolation and embeddings are
needed. To overcome this, we present a flexible framework to extend model-based
learning directly to nonuniform meshes, by interpreting the mesh as a graph and
formulating our network architectures using graph convolutional neural
networks. This gives rise to the proposed iterative Graph Convolutional
Newton's Method (GCNM), which directly includes the forward model into the
solution of the inverse problem, while all updates are directly computed by the
network on the problem specific mesh. We present results for Electrical
Impedance Tomography, a severely ill-posed nonlinear inverse problem that is
frequently solved via optimization-based methods, where the forward problem is
solved by finite element methods. Results for absolute EIT imaging are compared
to standard iterative methods as well as a graph residual network. We show that
the GCNM has strong generalizability to different domain shapes, out of
distribution data as well as experimental data, from purely simulated training
data.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We investigate the hypothesis that within a combination of a 'number concept'
plus a 'substantive concept', such as 'eleven animals,' the identity and
indistinguishability present on the level of the concepts, i.e., all eleven
animals are identical and indistinguishable, gives rise to a statistical
structure of the Bose-Einstein type similar to how Bose-Einstein statistics is
present for identical and indistinguishable quantum particles. We proceed by
identifying evidence for this hypothesis by extracting the statistical data
from the World-Wide-Web utilizing the Google Search tool. By using the
Kullback-Leibler divergence method, we then compare the obtained distribution
with the Maxwell-Boltzmann as well as with the Bose-Einstein distributions and
show that the Bose-Einstein's provides a better fit as compared to the
Maxwell-Boltzmanns.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15090</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Competitive board games have provided a rich and diverse testbed for
artificial intelligence. This paper contends that collaborative board games
pose a different challenge to artificial intelligence as it must balance
short-term risk mitigation with long-term winning strategies. Collaborative
board games task all players to coordinate their different powers or pool their
resources to overcome an escalating challenge posed by the board and a
stochastic ruleset. This paper focuses on the exemplary collaborative board
game Pandemic and presents a rolling horizon evolutionary algorithm designed
specifically for this game. The complex way in which the Pandemic game state
changes in a stochastic but predictable way required a number of specially
designed forward models, macro-action representations for decision-making, and
repair functions for the genetic operations of the evolutionary algorithm.
Variants of the algorithm which explore optimistic versus pessimistic game
state evaluations, different mutation rates and event horizons are compared
against a baseline hierarchical policy agent. Results show that an evolutionary
approach via short-horizon rollouts can better account for the future dangers
that the board may introduce, and guard against them. Results highlight the
types of challenges that collaborative board games pose to artificial
intelligence, especially for handling multi-player collaboration interactions.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15032</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As the field of connectomics has matured, it has expanded from mapping the
existence of connections between brain components to measuring the strength of
connections. This information is increasingly accessible via methodologies such
as pairing functional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and MR tractography in
the same human subject, as well as novel methods in non-human animals using
optogenetics. Systems and network neuroscience have in recent years focused
extensively on explaining correlation patterns of functional activity in the
brain in terms of the degree of connectedness of brain components, the
so-called functional connectivity-structural connectivity relationship (SC-FC).
What has been surprising has been how low the SC-FC correlations are. Why is it
that brain parts that are more well-connected appear not to engender more
correlated activity between them? Several explanations have been proposed but
one possibility has not been considered: perhaps more neural activity doesn't
imply more functional involvement. This article examines this possibility and
proposes a new general framework for understanding brain network dynamics based
on the design constraints of large-scale network communication systems. With
this new perspective, we may start to answer the article's main question, and
perhaps others.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The frequency-specific coupling mechanism of the functional human brain
networks underpins its complex cognitive and behavioral functions.
Nevertheless, it is not well unveiled what are the frequency-specific
subdivisions and network topologies of the human brain. In this study, we
estimated functional connectivity of the human cerebral cortex using spectral
connection, and conducted frequency-specific parcellation using
eigen-clustering and gradient-based methods, and then explored their
topological structures. 7T fMRI data of 184 subjects in the HCP dataset were
used for parcellation and exploring the topological properties of the
functional networks, and 3T fMRI data of another 890 subjects were used to
confirm the stability of the frequency-specific topologies. Seven to ten
functional networks were stably integrated by two to four dissociable hub
categories at specific frequencies, and we proposed an intrinsic functional
atlas containing 456 parcels according to the parcellations across frequencies.
The results revealed that the functional networks contained stable
frequency-specific topologies, which may imply more abundant roles of the
functional units and more complex interactions among them.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00836</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The scale of systems employed in industrial environments demands a large
number of sensors to facilitate meticulous monitoring and functioning. These
requirements could potentially lead to inefficient system designs. The data
coming from various sensors are often correlated due to the underlying
relations in the system parameters that the sensors monitor. In theory, it
should be possible to emulate the output of certain sensors based on other
sensors. Tapping into such possibilities holds tremendous advantages in terms
of reducing system design complexity. In order to identify the subset of
sensors whose readings can be emulated, the sensors must be grouped into
clusters. Complex systems generally have a large quantity of sensors that
collect and store data over prolonged periods of time. This leads to the
accumulation of massive amounts of data. In this paper we propose an end-to-end
algorithmic solution, to realise virtual sensors in such systems. This
algorithm splits the dataset into blocks and clusters each of them
individually. It then fuses these clustering solutions to obtain a global
solution using an Ant Colony inspired technique, FAC2T. Having grouped the
sensors into clusters, we select representative sensors from each cluster.
These sensors are retained in the system while the other sensors readings are
emulated by applying supervised learning algorithms.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: SCANN: Synthesis of Compact and Accurate Neural Networks. (arXiv:1904.09090v2 [cs.NE] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09090</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become the driving force behind recent
artificial intelligence (AI) research. An important problem with implementing a
neural network is the design of its architecture. Typically, such an
architecture is obtained manually by exploring its hyperparameter space and
kept fixed during training. This approach is time-consuming and inefficient.
Another issue is that modern neural networks often contain millions of
parameters, whereas many applications and devices require small inference
models. However, efforts to migrate DNNs to such devices typically entail a
significant loss of classification accuracy. To address these challenges, we
propose a two-step neural network synthesis methodology, called DR+SCANN, that
combines two complementary approaches to design compact and accurate DNNs. At
the core of our framework is the SCANN methodology that uses three basic
architecture-changing operations, namely connection growth, neuron growth, and
connection pruning, to synthesize feed-forward architectures with arbitrary
structure. SCANN encapsulates three synthesis methodologies that apply a
repeated grow-and-prune paradigm to three architectural starting points.
DR+SCANN combines the SCANN methodology with dataset dimensionality reduction
to alleviate the curse of dimensionality. We demonstrate the efficacy of SCANN
and DR+SCANN on various image and non-image datasets. We evaluate SCANN on
MNIST and ImageNet benchmarks. In addition, we also evaluate the efficacy of
using dimensionality reduction alongside SCANN (DR+SCANN) on nine small to
medium-size datasets. We also show that our synthesis methodology yields neural
networks that are much better at navigating the accuracy vs. energy efficiency
space. This would enable neural network-based inference even on
Internet-of-Things sensors.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Modulating Inhibitory Control Processes Using Individualized High Definition Theta Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (HD θ-tACS) of the Anterior Cingulate and Medial Prefrontal Cortex</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.611507</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Increased frontal midline theta activity generated by the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is induced by conflict processing in the medial frontal cortex (MFC). There is evidence that theta band transcranial alternating current stimulation (θ-tACS) modulates ACC function and alters inhibitory control performance during neuromodulation. Multi-electric (256 electrodes) high definition θ-tACS (HD θ-tACS) using computational modeling based on individual MRI allows precise neuromodulation targeting of the ACC via the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and optimizes the required current density with a minimum impact on the rest of the brain. We therefore tested whether the individualized electrode montage of HD θ-tACS with the current flow targeted to the mPFC-ACC compared with a fixed montage (non-individualized) induces a higher post-modulatory effect on inhibitory control. Twenty healthy subjects were randomly assigned to a sequence of three HD θ-tACS conditions (individualized mPFC-ACC targeting; non-individualized MFC targeting; and a sham) in a double-blind cross-over study. Changes in the Visual Simon Task, Stop Signal Task, CPT III, and Stroop test were assessed before and after each session. Compared with non-individualized θ-tACS, the individualized HD θ-tACS significantly increased the number of interference words and the interference score in the Stroop test. The changes in the non-verbal cognitive tests did not induce a parallel effect. This is the first study to examine the influence of individualized HD θ-tACS targeted to the ACC on inhibitory control performance. The proposed algorithm represents a well-tolerated method that helps to improve the specificity of neuromodulation targeting of the ACC.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Spatiotemporal Correlation of Epileptiform Activity and Gene Expression in vitro</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.643763</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Epileptiform activity alters gene expression in the central nervous system, a phenomenon that has been studied extensively in animal models. Here, we asked whether also in vitro models of seizures are in principle suitable to investigate changes in gene expression due to epileptiform activity and tested this hypothesis mainly in rodent and additionally in some human brain slices. We focused on three genes relevant for seizures and epilepsy: FOS proto-oncogene (c-Fos), inducible cAMP early repressor (Icer) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTor). Seizure-like events (SLEs) were induced by 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) in rat entorhinal-hippocampal slices and by 4-AP/8 mM potassium in human temporal lobe slices obtained from surgical treatment of epilepsy. SLEs were monitored simultaneously by extracellular field potentials and intrinsic optical signals (IOS) for 1–4 h, mRNA expression was quantified by real time PCR. In rat slices, both duration of SLE exposure and SLE onset region were associated with increased expression of c-Fos and Icer while no such association was shown for mTor expression. Similar to rat slices, c-FOS induction in human tissue was increased in slices with epileptiform activity. Our results indicate that irrespective of limitations imposed by ex vivo conditions, in vitro models represent a suitable tool to investigate gene expression. Our finding is of relevance for the investigation of human tissue that can only be performed ex vivo. Specifically, it presents an important prerequisite for future studies on transcriptome-wide and cell-specific changes in human tissue with the goal to reveal novel candidates involved in the pathophysiology of epilepsy and possibly other CNS pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Increased Abundance of Nuclear HDAC4 Impairs Neuronal Development and Long-Term Memory</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.616642</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dysregulation of the histone deacetylase HDAC4 is associated with both neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, and a feature common to many of these disorders is impaired cognitive function. HDAC4 shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm in both vertebrates and invertebrates and alterations in the amounts of nuclear and/or cytoplasmic HDAC4 have been implicated in these diseases. In Drosophila, HDAC4 also plays a critical role in the regulation of memory, however, the mechanisms through which it acts are unknown. Nuclear and cytoplasmically-restricted HDAC4 mutants were expressed in the Drosophila brain to investigate a mechanistic link between HDAC4 subcellular distribution, transcriptional changes and neuronal dysfunction. Deficits in mushroom body morphogenesis, eye development and long-term memory correlated with increased abundance of nuclear HDAC4 but were associated with minimal transcriptional changes. Although HDAC4 sequesters MEF2 into punctate foci within neuronal nuclei, no alteration in MEF2 activity was observed on overexpression of HDAC4, and knockdown of MEF2 had no impact on long-term memory, indicating that HDAC4 is likely not acting through MEF2. In support of this, mutation of the MEF2 binding site within HDAC4 also had no impact on nuclear HDAC4-induced impairments in long-term memory or eye development. In contrast, the defects in mushroom body morphogenesis were ameliorated by mutation of the MEF2 binding site, as well as by co-expression of MEF2 RNAi, thus nuclear HDAC4 acts through MEF2 to disrupt mushroom body development. These data provide insight into the mechanisms through which dysregulation of HDAC4 subcellular distribution impairs neurological function and provides new avenues for further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers of Myeloid and Glial Cell Activation Are Correlated With Multiple Sclerosis Lesional Inflammatory Activity</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.649876</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Multiple sclerosis (MS)-related inflammation can be divided into lesional activity, mediated by immune cells migrating from the periphery to the central nervous system (CNS) and non-lesional activity, mediated by inflammation compartmentalized to CNS tissue. Lesional inflammatory activity, reflected by contrast-enhancing lesions (CELs) on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is effectively inhibited by current disease modifying therapies (DMTs). While, the effect of DMTs on non-lesional inflammatory activity is currently unknown. Reliable and simultaneous measurements of both lesional and non-lesional MS activity is necessary to understand their contribution to CNS tissue destruction in individual patients. We previously demonstrated that CNS compartmentalized inflammation can be measured by combined quantification of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) immune cells and cell-specific soluble markers. The goal of this study is to develop and validate a CSF-biomarker-based molecular surrogate of MS lesional activity. The training cohort was dichotomized into active (CELs &amp;gt; 1 or clinical relapse) and inactive lesional activity (no CELs or relapse) groups. Matched CSF and serum samples were analyzed for 20 inflammatory and axonal damage biomarkers in a blinded fashion. Only the findings from the training cohort with less than 0.1% probability of false positive (i.e., p &amp;lt; 0.001) were validated in an independent validation cohort. MS patients with lesional activity have elevated IL-12p40, CHI3L1, TNFα, TNFβ, and IL-10, with the first two having the strongest effects and validated statistically-significant association with lesional activity in an independent validation cohort. Marker of axonal damage, neurofilament light (NfL), measured in CSF (cNfL) was also significantly elevated in MS patients with active lesions. NfL measured in serum (sNfL) did not differentiate the two MS subgroups with pre-determined significance, (p = 0.0690) even though cCSF and sNfL correlated (Rho = 0.66, p &amp;lt; 0.0001). Finally, the additive model of IL12p40 and CHI3L1 outperforms any biomarker discretely. IL12p40 and CHI3L1, released predominantly by immune cells of myeloid lineage are reproducibly the best CSF biomarkers of MS lesional activity. The residuals from the IL12p40/CHI3L1-cNfL correlations may identify MS patients with more destructive inflammation or contributing neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Sialometabolism in Brain Health and Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.648617</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sialic acids refer to a unique family of acidic sugars with a 9-carbon backbone that are mostly found as terminal residues in glycan structures of glycoconjugates including both glycoproteins and glycolipids. The highest levels of sialic acids are expressed in the brain where they regulate neuronal sprouting and plasticity, axon myelination and myelin stability, as well as remodeling of mature neuronal connections. Moreover, sialic acids are the sole ligands for microglial Siglecs (sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-type lectins), and sialic acid-Siglec interactions have been indicated to play a critical role in the regulation of microglial homeostasis in a healthy brain. The recent discovery of CD33, a microglial Siglec, as a novel genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD), highlights the potential role of sialic acids in the development of microglial dysfunction and neuroinflammation in AD. Apart from microglia, sialic acids have been found to be involved in several other major changes associated with AD. Elevated levels of serum sialic acids have been reported in AD patients. Alterations in ganglioside (major sialic acid carrier) metabolism have been demonstrated as an aggravating factor in the formation of amyloid pathology in AD. Polysialic acids are linear homopolymers of sialic acids and have been implicated to be an important regulator of neurogenesis that contributes to neuronal repair and recovery from neurodegeneration such as in AD. In summary, this article reviews current understanding of neural functions of sialic acids and alterations of sialometabolism in aging and AD brains. Furthermore, we discuss the possibility of looking at sialic acids as a promising novel therapeutic target for AD intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Learned Overweight Internal Model Can Be Activated to Maintain Equilibrium When Tactile Cues Are Uncertain: Evidence From Cortical and Behavioral Approaches</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.635611</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human adaptive behavior in sensorimotor control is aimed to increase the confidence in feedforward mechanisms when sensory afferents are uncertain. It is thought that these feedforward mechanisms rely on predictions from internal models. We investigate whether the brain uses an internal model of physical laws (gravitational and inertial forces) to help estimate body equilibrium when tactile inputs from the foot sole are depressed by carrying extra weight. As direct experimental evidence for such a model is limited, we used Judoka athletes thought to have built up internal models of external loads (i.e., opponent weight management) as compared with Non-Athlete participants and Dancers (highly skilled in balance control). Using electroencephalography, we first (experiment 1) tested the hypothesis that the influence of tactile inputs was amplified by descending cortical efferent signals. We compared the amplitude of P1N1 somatosensory cortical potential evoked by electrical stimulation of the foot sole in participants standing still with their eyes closed. We showed smaller P1N1 amplitudes in the Load compared to No Load conditions in both Non-Athletes and Dancers. This decrease neural response to tactile stimulation was associated with greater postural oscillations. By contrast in the Judoka’s group, the neural early response to tactile stimulation was unregulated in the Load condition. This suggests that the brain can selectively increase the functional gain of sensory inputs, during challenging equilibrium tasks when tactile inputs were mechanically depressed by wearing a weighted vest. In Judokas, the activation of regions such as the right posterior inferior parietal cortex (PPC) as early as the P1N1 is likely the source of the neural responses being maintained similar in both Load and No Load conditions. An overweight internal model stored in the right PPC known to be involved in maintaining a coherent representation of one’s body in space can optimize predictive mechanisms in situations with high balance constraints (Experiment 2). This hypothesis has been confirmed by showing that postural reaction evoked by a translation of the support surface on which participants were standing wearing extra-weight was improved in Judokas.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The protective effect of Cannabidiol on Parkinson’s disease (PD) has been found in recent study. However, the specific mechanism of the protective effect of Cannabidiol on PD nerve damage require further exploration. This study aims to investigate effect of Cannabidiol on MMP-induced Neural Cells (SH-SY5Y) mitochondrial dysfunction. MMP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cannabidiol were used to treat SH-SY5Y cells, the cells viability was measured by MTT assay. The expression of Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in cells was measured by western blotting and Immunofluorescence staining. The relationship among Cannabidiol, Silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog-1 (SIRT1) and NOTCH signaling, NF-κB signaling was examined by western blotting. The effect of Cannabidiol on MMP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced mitochondrial dysfunction of SH-SY5Y cells was measured by western blotting. Cannabidiol alleviated loss of TH expression and cytotoxicity in the MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced SH-SY5Y cells. Further mechanistic investigation showed that Cannabidiol induced SH-SY5Y cells autophagy to protects cells from mitochondrial dysfunction by upregulating SIRT1 to Inhibits NF-κB and NOTCH Pathways. Taken together, Cannabidiol acts as a protector in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Striking parallels between dorsoventral patterning in Drosophila and Gryllus reveal a complex evolutionary history behind a model gene regulatory network</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/68287</link>
	<content:encoded>Dorsoventral pattering relies on Toll and BMP signalling in all insects studied so far, with variations in the relative contributions of both pathways. &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; and the beetle &lt;i&gt;Tribolium&lt;/i&gt; share extensive dependence on Toll, while representatives of more distantly related lineages like the wasp &lt;i&gt;Nasonia&lt;/i&gt; and bug&lt;i&gt; Oncopeltus&lt;/i&gt; rely more strongly on BMP signalling. Here, we show that in the cricket &lt;i&gt;Gryllus bimaculatus&lt;/i&gt;, an evolutionarily distant outgroup, Toll has, like in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, a direct patterning role for the ventral half of the embryo. In addition, Toll polarizes BMP signalling, although this does not involve the conserved BMP inhibitor Sog/Chordin. Finally, Toll activation relies on ovarian patterning mechanisms with striking similarity to &lt;i&gt;Drosophila. &lt;/i&gt;Our data suggest two surprising hypotheses: 1) that Toll's patterning function in &lt;i&gt;Gryllus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; is the result of convergent evolution or 2) a &lt;i&gt;Drosophila-like &lt;/i&gt;system arose early in insect evolution, and was extensively altered in multiple independent lineages.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/68136</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;i&gt;Trypanosoma brucei&lt;/i&gt; is the causative agent of human sleeping sickness. The parasites' Variant Surface Glycoprotein (VSG) enables them to evade adaptive immunity via antigenic variation. VSG comprises 10% of total cell protein and the high stability of VSG mRNA is essential for trypanosome survival. To determine how VSG mRNA stability is maintained, we used mRNA affinity purification to identify all its associated proteins. CFB2, an unconventional RNA-binding protein with an F-box domain, was specifically enriched with VSG mRNA. We demonstrate that CFB2 is essential for VSG mRNA stability, describe cis acting elements within the VSG 3'-untranslated region that regulate the interaction, identify trans-acting factors that are present in the VSG messenger ribonucleoprotein particle and mechanistically explain how CFB2 stabilizes the mRNA of this key pathogenicity factor. Beyond &lt;i&gt;T. brucei&lt;/i&gt;, the mRNP purification approach has the potential to supply detailed biological insight into metabolism of relatively abundant mRNAs in any eukaryote.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Pre-complexation of talin and vinculin without tension is required for efficient nascent adhesion maturation</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66151</link>
	<content:encoded>Talin and vinculin are mechanosensitive proteins that are recruited early to integrin-based nascent adhesions (NAs). In two epithelial cell systems with well-delineated NA formation, we find these molecules concurrently recruited to the subclass of NAs maturing to focal adhesions. After the initial recruitment under minimal load, vinculin accumulates in maturing NAs at a ~ fivefold higher rate than in non-maturing NAs, and is accompanied by a faster traction force increase. We identify the R8 domain in talin, which exposes a vinculin-binding-site (VBS) in the absence of load, as required for NA maturation. Disruption of R8 domain function reduces load-free vinculin binding to talin, and reduces the rate of additional vinculin recruitment. Taken together, these data show that the concurrent recruitment of talin and vinculin prior to mechanical engagement with integrins is essential for the traction-mediated unfolding of talin, exposure of additional VBSs, further recruitment of vinculin, and ultimately, NA maturation.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: A common 1.6 mb Y-chromosomal inversion predisposes to subsequent deletions and severe spermatogenic failure in humans</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65420</link>
	<content:encoded>Male infertility is a prevalent condition, affecting 5–10% of men. So far, few genetic factors have been described as contributors to spermatogenic failure. Here, we report the first re-sequencing study of the Y-chromosomal &lt;i&gt;Azoospermia Factor c&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;AZFc&lt;/i&gt;) region, combined with gene dosage analysis of the multicopy &lt;i&gt;DAZ, BPY2&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;CDY&lt;/i&gt;genes and Y-haplogroup determination. In analysing 2324 Estonian men, we uncovered a novel structural variant as a high-penetrance risk factor for male infertility. The Y lineage R1a1-M458, reported at &amp;gt;20% frequency in several European populations, carries a fixed ~1.6 Mb &lt;i&gt;r2/r3&lt;/i&gt; inversion, destabilizing the &lt;i&gt;AZFc&lt;/i&gt; region and predisposing to large recurrent microdeletions. Such complex rearrangements were significantly enriched among severe oligozoospermia cases. The carrier vs non-carrier risk for spermatogenic failure was increased 8.6-fold (p=6.0×10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;). This finding contributes to improved molecular diagnostics and clinical management of infertility. Carrier identification at young age will facilitate timely counselling and reproductive decision-making.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Structural determinants of voltage-gating properties in calcium channels</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64087</link>
	<content:encoded>Voltage-gated calcium channels control key functions of excitable cells, like synaptic transmission in neurons and the contraction of heart and skeletal muscles. To accomplish such diverse functions, different calcium channels activate at different voltages and with distinct kinetics. To identify the molecular mechanisms governing specific voltage-sensing properties we combined structure modeling, mutagenesis, and electrophysiology to analyze the structures, free energy, and transition kinetics of the activated and resting states of two functionally distinct voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) of the eukaryotic calcium channel Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.1. Both VSDs displayed the typical features of the sliding helix model; however, they greatly differed in ion-pair formation of the outer gating charges. Specifically, stabilization of the activated state enhanced the voltage-dependence of activation, while stabilization of resting states slowed the kinetics. This mechanism provides a mechanistic model explaining how specific ion-pair formation in separate VSDs can realize the characteristic gating properties of voltage-gated cation channels.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Relative demographic susceptibility does not explain the extinction chronology of Sahul's megafauna</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63870</link>
	<content:encoded>The causes of Sahul's megafauna extinctions remain uncertain, although several interacting factors were likely responsible. To examine the relative support for hypotheses regarding plausible ecological mechanisms underlying these extinctions, we constructed the first stochastic, age-structured models for 13 extinct megafauna species from five functional/taxonomic groups, as well as eight extant species within these groups for comparison. Perturbing specific demographic rates individually, we tested which species were more demographically susceptible to extinction, and then compared these relative sensitivities to the fossil-derived extinction chronology. Our models show that the macropodiformes were the least demographically susceptible to extinction, followed by carnivores, monotremes, vombatiform herbivores, and large birds. Five of the eight extant species were as or more susceptible than the extinct species. There was no clear relationship between extinction susceptibility and the extinction chronology for any perturbation scenario, while body mass and generation length explained much of the variation in relative risk. Our results reveal that the actual mechanisms leading to the observed extinction chronology were unlikely related to variation in demographic susceptibility &lt;i&gt;per se&lt;/i&gt;, but were possibly driven instead by finer-scale variation in climate change and/or human prey choice and relative hunting success.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63697</link>
	<content:encoded>Phytochromes are photoreceptors regulating growth and development in plants. Using the model plant Arabidopsis, we identified a novel signalling pathway downstream of the far-red light-sensing phytochrome, phyA, that depends on the highly conserved CCR4-NOT complex. CCR4-NOT is integral to RNA metabolism in yeast and animals, but its function in plants is largely unknown. NOT9B, an Arabidopsis homologue of human CNOT9, is a component of the CCR4-NOT complex, and acts as negative regulator of phyA-specific light signalling when bound to NOT1, the scaffold protein of the complex. Light-activated phyA interacts with and displaces NOT9B from NOT1, suggesting a potential mechanism for light signalling through CCR4-NOT. ARGONAUTE 1 and proteins involved in splicing associate with NOT9B and we show that NOT9B is required for specific phyA-dependent alternative splicing events. Furthermore, association with nuclear localised ARGONAUTE 1 raises the possibility that NOT9B and CCR4-NOT are involved in phyA-modulated gene expression.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63518</link>
	<content:encoded>Although individual cancer cells are generally considered the Darwinian units of selection in malignant populations, they frequently act as members of groups where fitness of the group cannot be reduced to the average fitness of individual group members. A growing body of studies reveals limitations of reductionist approaches to explaining biological and clinical observations. For example, induction of angiogenesis, inhibition of the immune system, and niche engineering through environmental acidification and/or remodeling of extracellular matrix cannot be achieved by single tumor cells and require collective actions of groups of cells. Success or failure of such group activities depends on the phenotypic makeup of the individual group members. Conversely, these group activities affect the fitness of individual members of the group, ultimately affecting the composition of the group. This phenomenon, where phenotypic makeup of individual group members impacts the fitness of both members and groups, has been captured in the term ‘group phenotypic composition’ (GPC). We provide examples where considerations of GPC could help in understanding the evolution and clinical progression of cancers and argue that use of the GPC framework can facilitate new insights into cancer biology and assist with the development of new therapeutic strategies.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63026</link>
	<content:encoded>A defining feature of the brain is the ability of its synaptic contacts to adapt structurally and functionally in an experience-dependent manner. In the human cortex, however, direct experimental evidence for coordinated structural and functional synaptic adaptation is currently lacking. Here, we probed synaptic plasticity in human cortical slices using the vitamin A derivative all-trans retinoic acid (atRA), a putative treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease. Our experiments demonstrated that the excitatory synapses of superficial (layer 2/3) pyramidal neurons underwent coordinated structural and functional changes in the presence of atRA. These synaptic adaptations were accompanied by ultrastructural remodeling of the calcium-storing spine apparatus organelle and required mRNA translation. It was not observed in synaptopodin-deficient mice, which lack spine apparatus organelles. We conclude that atRA is a potent mediator of synaptic plasticity in the adult human cortex.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/62483</link>
	<content:encoded>Methionine restriction (MR) dramatically extends the healthspan of several organisms. Methionine-restricted rodents have less age-related pathology and increased longevity as compared with controls, and recent studies suggest that humans might benefit similarly. Mechanistically, it is likely that the decreased IGF-1 signaling that results from MR underlies the benefits of this regimen. Thus, we hypothesized that interventions that decrease IGF-1 signaling would also produce MR-like healthspan benefits. Selenium supplementation inhibits IGF-1 signaling in rats and has been studied for its putative healthspan benefits. Indeed, we show that feeding mice a diet supplemented with sodium selenite results in an MR-like phenotype, marked by protection against diet-induced obesity, as well as altered plasma levels of IGF-1, FGF-21, adiponectin, and leptin. Selenomethionine supplementation results in a similar, albeit less robust response, and also extends budding yeast lifespan. Our results indicate that selenium supplementation is sufficient to produce MR-like healthspan benefits for yeast and mammals.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61736</link>
	<content:encoded>Obesity is a growing societal scourge. Recent studies have uncovered that paternal excessive weight induced by an unbalanced diet affects the metabolic health of offspring. These reports mainly employed single-generation male exposure. However, the consequences of multigenerational unbalanced diet feeding on the metabolic health of progeny remain largely unknown. Here, we show that maintaining paternal western diet feeding for five consecutive generations in mice induces an enhancement in fat mass and related metabolic diseases over generations. Strikingly, chow-diet-fed progenies from these multigenerational western-diet-fed males develop a 'healthy' overweight phenotype characterized by normal glucose metabolism and without fatty liver that persists for 4 subsequent generations. Mechanistically, sperm RNA microinjection experiments into zygotes suggest that sperm RNAs are sufficient for establishment but not for long-term maintenance of epigenetic inheritance of metabolic pathologies. Progressive and permanent metabolic deregulation induced by successive paternal western-diet-fed generations may contribute to the worldwide epidemic of metabolic diseases.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Glucocorticoids are widely used as an ophthalmic medication. A common, sight-threatening adverse event of glucocorticoid usage is ocular hypertension, caused by dysfunction of the conventional outflow pathway. We report that netarsudil, a rho-kinase inhibitor, decreased glucocorticoid-induced ocular hypertension in patients whose intraocular pressures were poorly controlled by standard medications. Mechanistic studies in our established mouse model of glucocorticoid-induced ocular hypertension show that netarsudil both prevented and reduced intraocular pressure elevation. Further, netarsudil attenuated characteristic steroid-induced pathologies as assessed by quantification of outflow function and tissue stiffness, and morphological and immunohistochemical indicators of tissue fibrosis. Thus, rho-kinase inhibitors act directly on conventional outflow cells to prevent or attenuate fibrotic disease processes in glucocorticoid-induced ocular hypertension in an immune-privileged environment. Moreover, these data motivate the need for a randomized prospective clinical study to determine whether netarsudil is indeed superior to first-line anti-glaucoma drugs in lowering steroid-induced ocular hypertension.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Clinical observations indicate that COVID-19 is a systemic disease. An investigation of the viral distribution within the human body and its correlation with tissue damage can aid in understanding the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We present a detailed mapping of the viral RNA in 61 tissues and organs of 11 deceased patients with COVID-19. The autopsies were performed within the early postmortem interval (between 1.5 and 15 hr, mean: 5.6 hr) to minimize the bias due to viral RNA and tissue degradation. Very high viral loads (&amp;gt;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;copies/ml) were detected in most patients' lungs, and the presence of intact viral particles in the lung tissue could be verified by transmission electron microscopy. Interestingly, viral RNA was detected throughout various extrapulmonary tissues and organs without visible tissue damage. The dissemination of SARS-CoV-2-RNA throughout the body supports the hypothesis that there is a maladaptive host response with viremia and multiorgan dysfunction.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Despite recent improvements in microscope technologies, segmenting and tracking cells in three-dimensional time-lapse images (3D + T images) to extract their dynamic positions and activities remains a considerable bottleneck in the field. We developed a deep learning-based software pipeline, 3DeeCellTracker, by integrating multiple existing and new techniques including deep learning for tracking. With only one volume of training data, one initial correction, and a few parameter changes, 3DeeCellTracker successfully segmented and tracked ~100 cells in both semi-immobilized and ‘straightened’ freely moving worm's brain, in a naturally beating zebrafish heart, and ~1000 cells in a 3D cultured tumor spheroid. While these datasets were imaged with highly divergent optical systems, our method tracked 90–100% of the cells in most cases, which is comparable or superior to previous results. These results suggest that 3DeeCellTracker could pave the way for revealing dynamic cell activities in image datasets that have been difficult to analyze.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Johnston's organ is a highly sensitive mechanoreceptive organ in insect antennae. For the first time, we examined the 3D‐structure of the Johnston's organ in Cataglyphis desert ants together with its neuronal projections in the ant brain. The multisensory nature of the organ together with its targets in multimodal brain regions make the Johnston's organ an important component of the navigational toolkit in Cataglyphis ants.







Abstract
The Johnston's organ (JO) in the insect antenna is a multisensory organ involved in several navigational tasks including wind‐compass orientation, flight control, graviception, and, possibly, magnetoreception. Here we investigate the three dimensional anatomy of the JO and its neuronal projections into the brain of the desert ant Cataglyphis, a marvelous long‐distance navigator. The JO of C. nodus workers consists of 40 scolopidia comprising three sensory neurons each. The numbers of scolopidia slightly vary between different sexes (female/male) and castes (worker/queen). Individual scolopidia attach to the intersegmental membrane between pedicel and flagellum of the antenna and line up in a ring‐like organization. Three JO nerves project along the two antennal nerve branches into the brain. Anterograde double staining of the antennal afferents revealed that JO receptor neurons project to several distinct neuropils in the central brain. The T5 tract projects into the antennal mechanosensory and motor center (AMMC), while the T6 tract bypasses the AMMC via the saddle and forms collaterals terminating in the posterior slope (PS) (T6I), the ventral complex (T6II), and the ventrolateral protocerebrum (T6III). Double labeling of JO and ocellar afferents revealed that input from the JO and visual information from the ocelli converge in tight apposition in the PS. The general JO anatomy and its central projection patterns resemble situations in honeybees and Drosophila. The multisensory nature of the JO together with its projections to multisensory neuropils in the ant brain likely serves synchronization and calibration of different sensory modalities during the ontogeny of navigation in Cataglyphis.</content:encoded>

LJA5 neurons selectively target lamina I of the spinal cord, and other sensory nuclei including the lateral parabrachial and periaqueductal gray. Activation of LJA5 neurons reduces pain and itch.







Abstract
Sensory information is transmitted from peripheral nerves, through the spinal cord, and up to the brain (“bottom up” pathway). Some of this information may be modulated by “top‐down” projections from the brain to the spinal cord. Discovering endogenous mechanisms for reducing pain and itch holds enormous potential for developing new treatments. However, neurons mediating the top‐down inhibition of pain are not well understood, nor has any such pathway been identified for itch sensation. Here, we identify a novel population of GABAergic neurons in the ventral brainstem, distinguished by prodynorphin expression, which we named LJA5. LJA5 neurons provide the only known inhibitory projection specifically to lamina I of the spinal cord, which contains sensory neurons that transmit pain and itch information up to the brain. Chemogenetically activating LJA5 neurons in male mice reduces capsaicin‐induced pain and histamine‐induced itch. Identifying this new pathway opens new treatment opportunities for chronic, refractory pain, and pruritis.</content:encoded>

Abstract
Over 40 distinct types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) generate parallel processing pathways in the visual system. In mice, two subdivisions of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), the core and the shell, organize distinct parallel channels to transmit visual information from the retina to the primary visual cortex (V1). To investigate how the dLGN core and shell differentially integrate visual information and other modalities, we mapped synaptic input sources to each dLGN subdivision at the cell‐type level with G‐deleted rabies viral vectors. The monosynaptic circuit tracing revealed that dLGN core neurons received inputs from alpha‐RGCs, Layer 6 neurons of the V1, the superficial and intermediate layers of the superior colliculus (SC), the internal ventral LGN, the lower layer of the external ventral LGN (vLGNe), the intergeniculate leaf, the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), and the pretectal nucleus (PT). Conversely, shell neurons received inputs from alpha‐RGCs and direction‐selective ganglion cells of the retina, Layer 6 neurons of the V1, the superficial layer of the SC, the superficial and lower layers of the vLGNe, the TRN, the PT, and the parabigeminal nucleus. The present study provides anatomical evidence of the cell type‐ and layer‐specific convergence in dLGN core and shell neurons. These findings suggest that dLGN core neurons integrate and process more multimodal information along with visual information than shell neurons and that LGN core and shell neurons integrate different types of information, send their own convergent information to discrete populations of the V1, and differentially contribute to visual perception and behavior.</content:encoded>

Abstract
The amygdaloid complex (AC) is involved in very relevant cognitive and emotional pathways and exhibits changes in aging and in some neurological and psychiatric disorders. The quantitative estimators of AC could be useful to understand the impact of amygdaloid pathology in these processes, both globally and for each nucleus in particular, and their neurons. The present study analyzes morphometric and stereological estimators in the whole AC and its three main nuclei (lateral [La], basal [Ba], and accessory basal [AB]) in six Macaca fascicularis monkeys. All the brains were fixed and sectioned in the coronal plane; Nissl‐stained sections were used for estimation of size and form parameters in both, the AC, and the La, Ba, and AB nuclei separately. The study includes stereological estimates of the volume and surface area of the AC; also, volume of the neurons in the amygdaloid nuclei was estimated using the point‐sampled intercepts method. Our results show that the AB nucleus is smaller than both the La and Ba nuclei in both morphometric and stereological estimators. Brain hemispheric side had not significant influence on any of quantitative estimates. The neuron volume was higher in the AB nucleus relative to LA and Ba of the nuclei. These data describe some quantitative parameters of the amygdaloid complex and their main nuclei that could help us to detect small changes in neurodegenerative and other pathological processes.</content:encoded>

The pig rostrum is packed with microvibrissae (~470 per hemi‐rostrum) and innervated by a prominent infraorbital nerve, containing about 80,000 axons. The pig's rostrum has three major skin‐folds. The nostrils have a rectangular medial wall and a funnel‐like lateral opening, nasal channels run obliquely from lateral (surface) to medial (inside). The rostrum gyrus mimics rostrum geometry in great detail. The putative representation of skin folds coincides with blood sinus and folds of the rostrum gyrus. The putative nostril representation is an oblique sulcus running from lateral (surface) to medial (inside). As observed in rodents, Layer 4 is thin in the nostril sulcus. The side of the nostril sulcus representing the medial wall of the nostril is rectangular, whereas the side of the nostril sulcus representing the lateral wall is funnel‐like. Proportions and geometry of the rostrum and the rostrum gyrus are similar, albeit with a collapsed nostril and a larger interindividual variability in the gyrus. The pig's cortical rostrum gyrus receives dense thalamic innervation, has a thin Layer 1 and contains roughly 8 million neurons. With all that, the rostrum gyrus looks like a model of the pig rostrum at a scale of ~1:2. Our findings are reminiscent of the raccoon cortex with its forepaw‐like somatosensory forepaw‐representation. Representing highly relevant afferents in three‐dimensional body‐part‐models might facilitate isomorphic cortical computations in large‐brained tactile specialists.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25072?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>The laminar distribution of corticothalamic (CT) neurons projecting to the pulvinar thalamic nucleus was assessed in two species: cats and mice. Following injections of the retrograde tracer fragment B of cholera toxin (CTb) in the pulvinar, the morphology, and distribution of labeled neurons in the infragranular layers of the visual cortex was compared between the two species. In cats, CT neurons were mostly distributed in Layer 6 in all extrastriate areas. The exception was Area 17 that labeled neurons where almost exclusively located in Layer 5. In mice, CT neurons were mostly located in Layer 6 across all areas, including V1. Our findings show a distinct pattern of CT projections in mice in comparison to the one in cats suggesting that the pulvinar nucleus plays distinct roles in the transthalamic transmission of visual information in these species.







Abstract
The cortical processing of visual information is thought to follow a hierarchical framework. This framework of connections between visual areas is based on the laminar patterns of direct feedforward and feedback cortico‐cortical projections. However, this view ignores the cortico‐thalamo‐cortical projections to the pulvinar nucleus in the thalamus, which provides an alternative transthalamic information transfer between cortical areas. It was proposed that corticothalamic (CT) pathways follow a similar hierarchical pattern as cortico‐cortical connections. Two main types of CT projections have been recognized: drivers and modulators. Drivers originate mainly in Layer 5 whereas modulators are from Layer 6. Little is known about the laminar distribution of these projections to the pulvinar across visual cortical areas. Here, we analyzed the distribution of CT neurons projecting to the lateral posterior (LP) thalamus in two species: cats and mice. Injections of the retrograde tracer fragment B of cholera toxin (CTb) were performed in the LP. The morphology and cortical laminar distribution of CTb‐labeled neurons was assessed. In cats, neurons were mostly found in Layer 6 except in Area 17, where they were mostly in Layer 5. In contrast, CT neurons in mice were mostly located in Layer 6 across all areas. Thus, our results demonstrate that CT projections in mice do not follow the same organization as cats suggesting that the transthalamic pathways play distinct roles in these species.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Serotonin neurons (dots) depicted in sagittal section (left) and coronal section (right), color‐coded by Fgf8‐lineage captured at different time‐points in development. The arrows indicate the approximate level of the coronal section. Serotonin neurons arising from progenitors expressing Fgf8 at later ages in development progressively populate more rostral and dorsal locations in the dorsal raphe, with serotonin neurons arising from the latest Fgf8 expressers also located in the lateral wings.







Abstract
Fgf8 is expressed transiently during embryogenesis at the midbrain–hindbrain border, an area that gives rise to a variety of neuronal populations including the dorsal raphe (DR) nucleus. Using an inducible Fgf8‐cre allele, we identified the populations of neurons defined by Fgf8 lineage at different stages of development. When Fgf8‐cre expression is induced at embryonic day 7.5 (T‐E7.5), in the adult the entire DR and part of the median raphe (MnR) have Fgf8 lineage. When induced at later timepoints, Fgf8 lineage progressively ebbs from the caudal and ventral aspect of this domain, particularly on the midline. Successively excluded from Fgf8‐ lineage at T‐E9.5 are serotonin neurons in the MnR and caudal‐intrafascicular DR, followed at T‐E11.5 by ventral‐middle and caudal‐dorsal DR. The last to show Fgf8 lineage are those serotonin neurons in the lateral wings and those at the rostral‐dorsal pole of DR nucleus. Thus, the temporal succession of Fgf8 lineage correlates with organizational features of serotonin neurons in these nuclei.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Morphological identification of thoracolumbar spinal afferent nerve endings in mouse uterus</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25070?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Here, we provide the first detailed description of spinal afferent nerve endings in the uterus of a vertebrate. This was achieved using an in vivo anterograde tracing technique from thoracolumbar (T13‐L3) dorsal root ganglia in female mice. Our key findings revealed that at least three distinct morphological types of spinal afferent nerve ending can be readily identified throughout multiple layers of the uterine wall; the vast majority of which are peptidergic (immunoreactive to calcitonin gene‐related peptide).







Abstract
Major sensory innervation to the uterus is provided by spinal afferent nerves, whose cell bodies lie predominantly in thoracolumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRG). While the origin of the cell bodies of uterine spinal afferents is clear, the identity of their sensory endings has remained unknown. Hence, our major aim was to identify the location, morphology, and calcitonin gene‐related peptide (CGRP)‐immunoreactivity of uterine spinal afferent endings supplied by thoracolumbar DRG. We also sought to determine the degree of uterine afferent innervation provided by the vagus nerve. Using an anterograde tracing technique, nulliparous female C57BL/6 mice were injected unilaterally with biotinylated dextran into thoracolumbar DRG (T13‐L3). After 7–9 days, uterine horns were stained to visualize traced nerve axons and endings immunoreactive to CGRP. Whole uteri from a separate cohort of animals were injected with retrograde neuronal tracer (DiI) and dye uptake in nodose ganglia was examined. Anterogradely labeled axons innervated each uterine horn, these projected rostrally or caudally from their site of entry, branching to form varicose endings in the myometrium and/or vascular plexus. Most spinal afferent endings were CGRP‐immunoreactive and morphologically classified as “simple‐type.” Rarely, uterine nerve cell bodies were labeled in nodose ganglia. Here, we provide the first detailed description of spinal afferent nerve endings in the uterus of a vertebrate. Distinct morphological types of spinal afferent nerve endings were identified throughout multiple anatomical layers of the uterine wall. Compared to other visceral organs, uterine spinal afferent endings displayed noticeably less morphological diversity. Few neurons in nodose ganglia innervate the uterus.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>P2X3‐immunoreactive subserosal afferent nerve endings in the rat antral lesser curvature were revealed by immunohistochemistry of whole‐mount preparations with confocal scanning laser microscopy. The immunoreactive nerve endings consisted of web‐like complex terminal structures and peripheral variform axon terminals.

Abstract
The present study investigated the morphological characteristics of subserosal afferent nerve endings with immunoreactivity for the P2X3 purinoceptor (P2X3) in the rat stomach by immunohistochemistry of whole‐mount preparations using confocal scanning laser microscopy. P2X3 immunoreactivity was observed in subserosal nerve endings proximal and lateral to the gastric sling muscles in the distal antrum of the lesser curvature. Parent axons ramified into several lamellar processes to form net‐like complex structures that extended two‐dimensionally in every direction on the surface of the longitudinal smooth muscle layer. The axon terminals in the periphery of P2X3‐immunoreactive net‐like structures were flat and looped or leaf‐like in shape. Some net‐like lamellar structures and their axon terminals with P2X3 immunoreactivity were also immunoreactive for P2X2. P2X3‐immunoreactive nerve fibers forming net‐like terminal structures were closely surrounded by S100B‐immunoreactive terminal Schwann cells, whereas axon terminals twined around these cells and extended club‐, knob‐, or thread‐like protrusions in the surrounding tissues. Furthermore, a retrograde tracing method using fast blue dye indicated that most of these nerve endings originated from the nodose ganglia of the vagus nerve. These results suggest that P2X3‐immunoreactive subserosal nerve endings have morphological characteristics of mechanoreceptors and contribute to sensation of a mechanical deformation of the distal antral wall associated with antral peristalsis.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Comprehensive map of visual projection neurons for processing ultraviolet information in the Drosophila brain</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25068?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Insects use UV light as navigation signals to locate the position of the sun. In this study, we construct a comprehensive map of the downstream circuitry of UV‐sensing R7 neurons by analyzing large‐scale 3D neural data at the single‐neuron resolution in Drosophila. We find six families of visual projection neurons that connect the optic lobe to the central brain. Our imaging study reveals the morphological diversity of these visual projection neurons of the medulla layer 6 (M6) downstream circuitry suggests the multi‐dimensional processing of UV information via hierarchical, multiple‐layer, parallel, and bilateral circuits in the brain. Furthermore, we describe a detailed neuroanatomical description of the lateral anterior optic tubercle (L‐AOTU) and the bulb (BU).







Abstract
The brain perceives visual information and controls behavior depending on its underlying neural circuits. How UV information is represented and processed in the brain remains poorly understood. In Drosophila melanogaster, UV light is detected by the R7 photoreceptor that projects exclusively into the medulla layer 6 (M6). Herein, we imaged 28,768 single neurons and identified 238 visual projection neurons linking M6 to the central brain. Based on morphology and connectivity, these visual projection neurons were systematically classified into 94 cell types belonging to 12 families. Three tracts connected M6 in each optic lobe to the central brain: One dorsal tract linking to the ipsilateral lateral anterior optic tubercle (L‐AOTU) and two medial tracts linking to the ipsilateral ventral medial protocerebrum (VMP) and the contralateral VMP. The M6 information was primarily represented in the L‐AOTU. Each L‐AOTU consisted of four columns that each contained three glomeruli. Each L‐AOTU glomerulus received inputs from M6 subdomains and gave outputs to a glomerulus within the ellipsoid body dendritic region, suggesting specific processing of spatial information through the dorsal pathway. Furthermore, the middle columns of the L‐AOTUs of both hemispheres were connected via the intertubercle tract, suggesting information integration between the two eyes. In contrast, an ascending neuron linked each VMP to all glomeruli in the bulb and the L‐AOTU, bilaterally, suggesting general processing of information through the ventral pathway. Altogether, these diverse morphologies of the visual projection neurons suggested multi‐dimensional processing of UV information through parallel and bilateral circuits in the Drosophila brain.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Characterization of mWake expression in the murine brain</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25066?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>WIDE AWAKE (WAKE) was first identified in Drosophila as a clock‐output molecule that regulates the timing of sleep and arousal. There is a single homolog of WAKE (mWAKE/ANKFN1/NMF9) in mice, which has previously shown to be enriched in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the master circadian pacemaker. This present work surveys the brain expression pattern of mWAKE using multiple approaches. First, mWake mRNA expression is examined using RNAscope in situ hybridization. Second, mWAKE protein expression is investigated using two different transgenic animal models: an mWakeV5 mouse where a V5 tag is fused directly to the end of the protein and an mWaketdTomato‐2A‐Cre mouse where tdTomato is inserted in‐frame within the gene. Third, we analyze scRNA‐Seq data to characterize the molecular identity of mWake neurons in the hypothalamus. These data reveal that mWAKE labels a distributed subset of GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons across the brainstem, subcortical regions, and cortex, with significant expression in the hypothalamus. This study may provide a potential roadmap for future studies of the circadian regulation of distinct circuits and behaviors.







Abstract
Structure–function analyses of the mammalian brain have historically relied on anatomically‐based approaches. In these investigations, physical, chemical, or electrolytic lesions of anatomical structures are applied, and the resulting behavioral or physiological responses assayed. An alternative approach is to focus on the expression pattern of a molecule whose function has been characterized and then use genetic intersectional methods to optogenetically or chemogenetically manipulate distinct circuits. We previously identified WIDE AWAKE (WAKE) in Drosophila, a clock output molecule that mediates the temporal regulation of sleep onset and sleep maintenance. More recently, we have studied the mouse homolog, mWAKE/ANKFN1, and our data suggest that its basic role in the circadian regulation of arousal is conserved. Here, we perform a systematic analysis of the expression pattern of mWake mRNA, protein, and cells throughout the adult mouse brain. We find that mWAKE labels neurons in a restricted, but distributed manner, in multiple regions of the hypothalamus (including the suprachiasmatic nucleus, dorsomedial hypothalamus, and tuberomammillary nucleus region), the limbic system, sensory processing nuclei, and additional specific brainstem, subcortical, and cortical areas. Interestingly, mWAKE is also observed in non‐neuronal ependymal cells. In addition, to describe the molecular identities and clustering of mWake+ cells, we provide detailed analyses of single cell RNA sequencing data from the hypothalamus, a region with particularly significant mWAKE expression. These findings lay the groundwork for future studies into the potential role of mWAKE+ cells in the rhythmic control of diverse behaviors and physiological processes.</content:encoded>

Abstract
Members of the POU4F/Brn3 transcription factor family have an established role in the development of retinal ganglion cell (RGCs) types, the main transducers of visual information from the mammalian eye to the brain. Our previous work using sparse random recombination of a conditional knock‐in reporter allele expressing alkaline phosphatase (AP) and intersectional genetics had identified three types of Brn3c positive (Brn3c+) RGCs. Here, we describe a novel Brn3cCre mouse allele generated by serial Dre to Cre recombination and use it to explore the expression overlap of Brn3c with Brn3a and Brn3b and the dendritic arbor morphologies and visual stimulus response properties of Brn3c+ RGC types. Furthermore, we explore brain nuclei that express Brn3c or receive input from Brn3c+ neurons. Our analysis reveals a much larger number of Brn3c+ RGCs and more diverse set of RGC types than previously reported. Most RGCs expressing Brn3c during development are still Brn3c positive in the adult, and all express Brn3a while only about half express Brn3b. Genetic Brn3c‐Brn3b intersection reveals an area of increased RGC density, extending from dorsotemporal to ventrolateral across the retina and overlapping with the mouse binocular field of view. In addition, we report a Brn3c+ RGC projection to the thalamic reticular nucleus, a visual nucleus that was not previously shown to receive retinal input. Furthermore, Brn3c+ neurons highlight a previously unknown subdivision of the deep mesencephalic nucleus. Thus, our newly generated allele provides novel biological insights into RGC type classification, brain connectivity, and cytoarchitectonic.</content:encoded>

Abstract
The neural retina is organized along central‐peripheral, dorsal‐ventral, and laminar planes. Cellular density and distributions vary along the central‐peripheral and dorsal‐ventral axis in species including primates, mice, fish, and birds. Differential distribution of cell types within the retina is associated with sensitivity to different types of damage that underpin major retinal diseases, including macular degeneration and glaucoma. Normal variation in retinal distribution remains unreported for multiple cell types in widely used research models, including mouse. Here we map the distribution of all known OFF bipolar cell (BC) populations and horizontal cells. We report significant variation in the distribution of OFF BC populations and horizontal cells along the dorsal‐ventral and central‐peripheral axes of the retina. Distribution patterns are much more pronounced for some populations of OFF BC cells than others and may correspond to the cell type's specialized functions.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>In the present study, we physiologically mapped the representation of lower jaw (chin vibrissae, chin microvibrissae, and lower lip) in rat primary somatosensory cortex (SI) and correlated the physiological map to the underlying morphological barrel field map in the lower jaw barrel subfield in SI. We report that the lower jaw barrel subfield is somatopically organized in a single map of the contralateral lower jaw skin surface.







Abstract
Barrel subfields in rodent primary somatosensory cortex (SI) are important model systems for studying cortical organization and reorganization. During cortical reorganization that follows limb deafferentation, neurons in deafferented forelimb SI become responsive to previously unexpressed inputs from the lower jaw. Although the lower jaw barrel subfield (LJBSF) is a likely source of the input, this subfield has received little attention. Our aim was to describe the structural and functional organization of the normal LJBSF. To investigate LJBSF organization, a nomenclature for lower jaw skin surface was developed, cytochrome oxidase (CO) was used to label flattened‐cut LJBSF sections, microelectrodes were used to map the lower jaw skin surface representation in SI, and electrolytic lesions, recovered from electrode penetrations, were used to align the physiological map to the underlying barrel map. LJBSF is a tear‐shaped subfield containing approximately 24 barrels, arranged in eight mediolateral rows and a barrel‐free zone capping the anterior border. The representation of the lower jaw skin consisting of chin vibrissae and microvibrissae embedded in common fur is somatotopically organized in a single map in the contralateral SI. This physiological map shows that the activity from the vibrissae aligns with the CO‐staining of the underlying LJBSF. LJBSF barrels receive topographically ordered barrel‐specific input from individual vibrissa and microvibrissae in the lower jaw but not from trident whiskers. The barrel‐free zone receives topographically ordered input from the lower lip. These data demonstrating that the LJBSF is a highly organized subfield are essential for understanding its possible role in cortical reorganization.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25062?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>The central complex plays a key role in goal directed orientation of insects. Immunocytochemistry shows that the neuropeptide orcokinin is present in the central complex of the desert locust in neurons of all stages of signal processing and likely serves as cotransmitter with GABA and Dip‐allatostatin in certain cell types.







Abstract
The central complex is a group of highly interconnected neuropils in the insect brain. It is involved in the control of spatial orientation, based on external compass cues and various internal needs. The functional and neurochemical organization of the central complex has been studied in detail in the desert locust Schistocerca gregaria. In addition to classical neurotransmitters, immunocytochemistry has provided evidence for a major contribution of neuropeptides to neural signaling within the central complex. To complement these data, we have identified all orcokinin‐immunoreactive neurons in the locust central complex and associated brain areas. About 50 bilateral pairs of neurons innervating all substructures of the central complex exhibit orcokinin immunoreactivity. Among these were about 20 columnar neurons, 33 bilateral pairs of tangential neurons of the central body, and seven pairs of tangential neurons of the protocerebral bridge. In silico transcript analysis suggests the presence of eight different orcokinin‐A type peptides in the desert locust. Double label experiments showed that all orcokinin‐immunostained tangential neurons of the lateral accessory lobe cluster were also immunoreactive for GABA and the GABA‐synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase. Two types of tangential neurons of the upper division of the central body were, furthermore, also labeled with an antiserum against Dip‐allatostatin I. No colocalization was found with serotonin immunostaining. The data provide additional insights into the neurochemical organization of the locust central complex and suggest that orcokinin‐peptides of the orcokinin‐A gene act as neuroactive substances at all stages of signal processing in this brain area.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>A dual recombinase fluorescent reporter strategy reveals that many retinorecipient brain regions associated with nonimage forming vision are innervated by retinal projections from both image and non‐image forming retinal ganglion cells.







Abstract
Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the output neurons of the retina, allow us to perceive our visual environment. RGCs respond to rod/cone input through the retinal circuitry, however, a small population of RGCs are in addition intrinsically photosensitive (ipRGCs) and project to unique targets in the brain to modulate a broad range of subconscious visual behaviors such as pupil constriction and circadian photoentrainment. Despite the discovery of ipRGCs nearly two decades ago, there is still little information about how or if conventional RGCs (non‐ipRGCs) target ipRGC‐recipient nuclei to influence subconscious visual behavior. Using a dual recombinase fluorescent reporter strategy, we showed that conventional RGCs innervate many subconscious ipRGC‐recipient nuclei, apart from the suprachiasmatic nucleus. We revealed previously unrecognized stratification patterns of retinal innervation from ipRGCs and conventional RGCs in the ventral portion of the lateral geniculate nucleus. Further, we found that the percent innervation of ipRGCs and conventional RGCs across ipsi‐ and contralateral nuclei differ. Our data provide a blueprint to understand how conventional RGCs and ipRGCs innervate different brain regions to influence subconscious visual behaviors.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is susceptible to continuous fibrillar beta amyloid plaque deposition in aged amyloid precursor protein/PS1 mice. In contrast, after 12 months of age, fibrillar plaque load plateaus in the primary motor cortex (M1) and somatosensory cortex (SS2). Midlife (6–12 months of age) environmental enrichment (EE) decreases the accumulation of fibrillar plaque in M1 and SS2, but not in the PFC region.







Abstract
Environmentally enriched housing conditions can increase performance on cognitive tasks in APP/PS1 mice; however, the potential effects of environmental enrichment (EE) on disease modification in terms of pathological change are inconclusive. We hypothesized that previous contrasting findings may be attributable to regional differences in susceptibility to amyloid beta (Aβ) plaque deposition in cortical regions that are functionally associated with EE. We characterized fibrillar plaque deposition in 6, 12, and 18–22 months old APP/PS1 mice in the prefrontal (PFC), somatosensory (SS2), and primary motor cortex (M1). We found a significant increase in plaque load between 6 and 12 months in all regions. In animals over 12 months, only the PFC region continued to significantly accumulate plaques. Additionally, 12 months old animals subjected to 6 months of EE showed improved spatial navigation and had significantly fewer plaques in M1 and SS2, but not in the PFC. These findings suggest that the PFC region is selectively susceptible to Aβ deposition and less responsive to the attenuating effects of EE. In contrast, M1 and SS2 regions plateau with respect to Aβ deposition by 12 months of age and are susceptible to amyloid pathology modification by midlife EE.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Vision adaptation in the laughing dove (Streptopelia senegalensis, Linnaeus, 1766) inferred from structural, ultrastructural, and genetic characterization</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25059?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>We characterized the under‐explored retina of the laughing dove, Streptopelia senegalensis. In addition to light and electron microscopy, we sequenced the short wavelength sensitive opsin SWS1. Using phylogeny and multiple sequence alignment, we found that the SWS1 is a violet sensitive opsin. Our results showed the presence of retinal pigmented epithelium that has plentiful melanosomes. There were various oil droplets, cones, horizontal, amacrine, bipolar, and Müller cells. Oligodendrocytes myelinated the nerve fiber layer. Overall, our data suggest a link between the structural variation and the photic adaptation.







Abstract
Neuroanatomy of the retina reflects adaptation and acclimation for dark and light conditions. Retinal cells and genes must be functionally adjusted to various environmental luminosities. Opsins are brilliant molecules to assess the adaptations at the genetic and phenotypic levels. Photic adaptations may reveal new mechanisms that enhance vision abilities. Through the investigation of histological, ultrastructural constituents of the whole retinal layers, and the sequencing of shortwave length sensitive opsin 1 (SWS1) of the laughing dove (Streptopelia senegalensis), the current study confirms the plasticity of the retina in response to the natural photic conditions. Retinal pigmented epithelium has plentiful melanosomes, signifying a highly adapted eye for maximum light perception and protection. Variously colored oil droplets signify high color vision ability. Stratified outer nuclear layer with many Müller cells suggests high sensitivity to dim conditions and high retinal regeneration. The penetration of outer limiting membrane by photoreceptor nuclei and Müller cell microvilli could minimize the light reflection. Oligodendrocytes establish thick myelination demanded for a keen visual acuity. A functional violet sensitive SWS1 with crucial Ser90 is presumed. Molecular phylogeny showed a secondary loss as color vision was shifted back from ultraviolet (UV) sensitivity to the ancestral avian violet sensitivity, thus improving visual resolution. However, SWS1 has some UV sensitive residues. These findings implicate not only spectral adaptations with high color vision ability and acuity but also photoinduced structural reorganizations. Further studies are needed to assess the secrets between photons and the structural genes.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25058?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Being widespread across different brain systems, the neuromodulatory action of acetylcholine plays a critical role in a vast range of neural processes such as learning and memory, attention, motor control, and sensory processing. In this study, we describe the spatial distribution of cholinergic neurons throughout the brain of the weakly electric fish, Apteronotus leptorhynchus, using in situ hybridization of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) mRNA. The presence of ChAT in brain nuclei harboring feedback projections directed to primary centers of the electrosensory pathway supports and extends our previous findings on a neuromodulatory effect of acetylcholine on the early stages of electrosensory processing.







Abstract
Acetylcholine acts as a neurotransmitter/neuromodulator of many central nervous system processes such as learning and memory, attention, motor control, and sensory processing. The present study describes the spatial distribution of cholinergic neurons throughout the brain of the weakly electric fish, Apteronotus leptorhynchus, using in situ hybridization of choline acetyltransferase mRNA. Distinct groups of cholinergic cells were observed in the telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon, and hindbrain. These included cholinergic cell groups typically identified in other vertebrate brains, for example, motor neurons. Using both in vitro and ex vivo neuronal tracing methods, we identified two new cholinergic connections leading to novel hypotheses on their functional significance. Projections to the nucleus praeeminentialis (nP) arise from isthmic nuclei, possibly including the nucleus lateralis valvulae (nLV) and the isthmic nucleus (nI). The nP is a central component of all electrosensory feedback pathways to the electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL). We have previously shown that some neurons in nP, TS, and tectum express muscarinic receptors. We hypothesize that, based on nLV/nI cell responses in other teleosts and isthmic connectivity in A. leptorhynchus, the isthmic connections to nP, TS, and tectum modulate responses to electrosensory and/or visual motion and, in particular, to looming/receding stimuli. In addition, we found that the octavolateral efferent (OE) nucleus is the likely source of cholinergic fibers innervating the ELL. In other teleosts, OE inhibits octavolateral hair cells during locomotion. In gymnotiform fish, OE may also act on the first central processing stage and, we hypothesize, implement corollary discharge modulation of electrosensory processing during locomotion.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Morphological diversity of acoustic and electric communication systems of mochokid catfish</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25057?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>This study provides an anatomical characterization of motor and premotor neurons associated with the muscle producing swim bladder sounds and/or electric discharges in five mochokid catfish. Even though the same muscle and neuronal populations are associated with these behaviors across all species, our results suggest that behavioral differences are associated with quantitative differences, mainly in the size of the protractor muscle and associated skeletal elements, and the number, size and location of motoneurons.







Abstract
Mochokid catfish offer a distinct opportunity to study a communication system transitioning to a new signaling channel because some produce sounds and others electric discharges. Both signals are generated using an elastic spring system (ESS), which includes a protractor muscle innervated by motoneurons within the protractor nucleus that also has a motoneuron afferent population. Synodontis grandiops and S. nigriventris produce sounds and electric discharges, respectively, and their ESSs show several morphological and physiological differences. The extent to which these differences explain different signal types remains unclear. Here, we compare ESS morphologies and behavioral phenotypes among five mochokids. S. grandiops and S. nigriventris were compared with Synodontis eupterus that is known to produce both signal types, and representative members of two sister genera, Microsynodontis cf. batesii and Mochokiella paynei, for which no data were available. We provide support for the hypothesis that peripheral and central components of the ESS are conserved among mochokids. We also show that the two nonsynodontids are only sonic, consistent with sound production being an ancestral character for mochokids. Even though the three sound producing‐only species differ in some ESS characters, several are similar and likely associated with only sound production. We propose that the ability of S. eupterus to generate both electric discharges and sounds may depend on a protractor muscle intermediate in morphology between sound producing‐only and electric discharge‐only species, and two separate populations of protractor motoneurons. Our results further suggest that an electrogenic ESS in synodontids is an exaptation of a sound producing ESS.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Development and evolution influence the size and branching of visually targeted Mauthner cell dendrites.







Abstract
Mauthner cells are the largest neurons in the hindbrain of teleost fish and most amphibians. Each cell has two major dendrites thought to receive segregated streams of sensory input: the lateral dendrite receives mechanosensory input while the ventral dendrite receives visual input. These inputs, which mediate escape responses to sudden stimuli, may be modulated by the availability of sensory information to the animal. To understand the impact of the absence of visual information on the morphologies of Mauthner cells during developmental and evolutionary time scales, we examined the teleost Astyanax mexicanus. This species of tetra is found in two morphs: a seeing surface fish and a blind cavefish. We compared the structure of Mauthner cells in surface fish raised under daily light conditions, in surface fish raised in constant darkness, and in two independent lineages of cave populations. The length of ventral dendrites of Mauthner cells in dark‐raised surface fish larvae were longer and more branched, while in both cave morphs the ventral dendrites were smaller or absent. The absence of visual input in surface fish with normal eye development leads to a homeostatic increase in dendrite size, whereas over evolution, the absence of light led to the loss of eyes and a reduction in dendrite size.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Dynamics of perineuronal nets over amphibian metamorphosis</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25055?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>We demonstrate a dramatic, brain‐wide reorganization of perineuronal nets (PNNs) during metamorphosis in an anuran amphibian. A sharp reduction of PNNs precedes the overhaul of amphibian morphology and neural circuitry that transitions the animal from an aquatic to terrestrial lifestyle. In mammals, PNNs regulate neuronal plasticity and maturation. Results suggest PNN temporal dynamics are important to understanding their role in neural development, learning, and memory.







Abstract
Extracellular matrix materials known as perineuronal nets (PNNs) have been shown to have remarkable consequences for the maturation of neural circuits and stabilization of behavior. It has been proposed that, due to the possibly long‐lived biochemical nature of their components, PNNs may be an important substrate by which long‐term memories are stored in the central nervous system. However, little empirical evidence exists that shows that PNNs are themselves stable once established. Thus, the question of their temporal dynamics remains unresolved. We leverage the dramatic morphological and behavioral transformations that occur during amphibian metamorphosis to show that PNNs can be highly dynamic in nature. We used established lectin histochemistry to show that PNNs undergo drastic reconstruction during the metamorphic transition. Pre‐metamorphic tadpoles have abundant lectin‐labeled pericellular material, which we interpret to be PNNs, surrounding neurons throughout the central nervous system. During the metamorphic transition, these structures degrade, and begin to reform in the months following metamorphosis. We show that PNN sizes and staining intensity further change over metamorphosis, suggesting compositional rearrangement. We found PNNs in brain regions with putative homology to regions in mammals with known PNN function, and in other shared regions where PNN function is unknown. Our results suggest that PNNs are susceptible to remodeling by endogenous mechanisms during development. Interpreting the roles of PNNs in circuit maturation and stability requires understanding their temporal relationship with the neurons and synapses they surround. Our work provides further impetus to investigate this relationship in tandem with developmental and behavioral studies.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Retinal horizontal cells of goldfish (Carassius auratus) display subtype‐specific differences in spontaneous action potentials in situ</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25054?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>We measured [Ca2+]i using fura‐2 imaging in all subtypes (H1–H4) of goldfish retinal horizontal cells in isolated cell and tissue slice preparations, and report spontaneous Ca2+‐based action potentials (APs) in every subtype. In both preparations, APs differed by subtype: APs were longer and less frequent in H3/4.







Abstract
Horizontal cells (HCs) are neurons of the outer retina, which provide inhibitory feedback onto photoreceptors and contribute to image processing. HCs in teleosts are classified into four subtypes (H1–H4), each having different roles: H1–H3 feed back onto different sets of cones, H4 feed back onto rods, and only H1 store and release the inhibitory neurotransmitter, γ‐aminobutyric acid (GABA). Dissociated HCs exhibit spontaneous Ca2+‐based action potentials (APs), yet it is unclear if APs occur in situ, or if all subtypes exhibit APs. We measured intracellular Ca2+ and report APs in slice preparations of the goldfish retina. In HCs furthest from photoreceptors (i.e., H3/H4), APs were less frequent, with greater duration and area under the curve (a measure of Ca2+ flux). Next, we classified acutely dissociated HCs into subtypes by integrating the ratio of dendritic field size vs. soma size (rd/s). H1 and H2 subtypes had low rd/s values (&amp;lt;8); H3/H4 had high rd/s (&amp;gt;12). To verify this model, H1s were identified by immunoreactivity for GABA and 95% of these cells had an rd/s &amp;lt; 4. In Ca2+ imaging experiments, as rd/s increased, AP duration and area under the curve increased, while frequency decreased. Our results demonstrate the presence of Ca2+‐based APs in the goldfish retina in situ and show that HC subtypes H1 through H4 exhibit progressively longer and less frequent spontaneous APs. These results suggest that APs may play an important role in inhibitory feedback, and may have implications for understanding the relative contributions of HC subtypes in the outer retina.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The inferior colliculus (IC) is the primary auditory nucleus of the midbrain. We used multichannel fluorescent in situ hybridization to detect expression of α1A,B,D, α2A, and β2 encoding mRNA in the mouse IC. We found expression of mRNA encoding these adrenergic receptors in the three subnuclei of the IC in juveniles and adults.







Abstract
Adrenergic receptors are mediators of adrenergic and noradrenergic modulation throughout the brain. Previous studies have provided evidence for the expression of adrenergic receptors in the midbrain auditory nucleus, the inferior colliculus (IC), but have not examined the cellular patterns of expression in detail. Here, we utilize multichannel fluorescent in situ hybridization to detect the expression of adrenergic receptor‐encoding mRNA in the inferior colliculus of male and female mice. We found expression of α1, α2A, and β2 receptor‐encoding mRNA throughout all areas of the IC. While we observed similar levels of expression of α1 receptor‐encoding mRNA across the subregions of the IC, α2A and β2 receptor‐encoding mRNA was expressed differentially. To account for developmental changes in noradrenergic receptor expression, we measured expression levels in mice aged P15, P20, and P60. We observed little change in levels of expression across these ages. To ascertain the modulatory potential of multiple adrenergic receptor subtypes in a single IC cell, we measured co‐expression of α1, α2A, and β2 receptor‐encoding mRNA. We found greater proportions of cells in the IC that expressed no adrenergic receptor‐encoding mRNA, α1 and α2A adrenergic receptor‐encoding mRNA, and α1, α2A, and β2 receptor‐encoding mRNA than would be predicted by independent expression of each receptor subtype. These data suggest a coordinated pattern of adrenergic receptor expression in the IC and provide the first evidence for adrenergic receptor expression and co‐expression in the subregions of the mouse auditory midbrain.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Sex‐specific role of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in cocaine effects on adult neurogenesis has been studied. Results indicate that: (a) cocaine hyperactivity decreases neurogenesis (males) or neuronal maturity (females), and correlates with brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF); (b) cocaine does not increase hyperactivity in D1ko females, but increases neuronal maturity and BDNF; (c) cocaine increases hypoactivity in D2ko males, and increases neurogenesis and BDNF in D2ko females; (d) SCH23390 reduces cocaine hyperactivity, and correlates with BDNF; and (e) Raclopride increases cocaine hyperactivity in females, and neurogenesis and BDNF in both sexes. Sex‐specific D1 and D2 signaling on proliferation and neuronal maturity is differentially perturbed by cocaine, and BDNF may contribute to D2 neuroplasticity in cocaine addiction.







Abstract
Adult neurogenesis in rodents is modulated by dopaminergic signaling and inhibited by cocaine. However, the sex‐specific role of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors (D1R, D2R) in the deleterious effect of cocaine on adult neurogenesis has not been described yet. Here, we explored sex differences in (a) cell proliferation (5′‐bromo‐2′‐deoxyuridine [BrdU]), (b) neural precursor (nestin), (c) neuronal phenotype (BrdU/β3‐tubulin), and (d) neuronal maturity (NeuN) in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles and striatum of mice with genetic deletion (D1−/−, D2−/−) or pharmacological blockage (SCH23390: 0.1 mg/kg/day/5 days; Raclopride: 0.3 mg/kg/day/5 days) of D1R and D2R, and treated (10 mg/kg/day/5 days) and then challenged (5 mg/kg, 48 hr later) with cocaine. Results indicated that hyperactivity responses to cocaine were absent in D1−/− mice and reduced in SCH23390‐treated mice. Activity responses to cocaine were reduced in D2−/− males, but absent in D2−/− females and increased in Raclopride‐treated females. D1R deletion blocked the deleterious effect of cocaine on SVZ cell proliferation in males. Cocaine‐exposed D1−/− males also had reduced neuronal phenotype of SVZ newborn cells and increased striatal neuronal maturity. D2−/− mice had lower proliferative and neural precursor responses. Cocaine in D2−/− females or coadministered with Raclopride in wild‐type females improved SVZ cell proliferation, an effect that positively correlated with plasma brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) concentrations. In conclusion, the sex‐specific D1R and D2R signaling on SVZ cell proliferation, neural progenitor and neuronal maturity is differentially perturbed by cocaine, and BDNF may be required to link D2R to neuroplasticity in cocaine addiction in females.</content:encoded>

The SARS-CoV-2 pathogen is currently spreading worldwide and its propensity for presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission makes it difficult to control. The control measures adopted in several countries aim at isolating individuals once diagnosed, limiting their social interactions and consequently their transmission probability. These interventions, which have a strong impact on the disease dynamics, can affect the inference of the epidemiological quantities. We first present a theoretical explanation of the effect caused by non-pharmaceutical intervention measures on the mean serial and generation intervals. Then, in a simulation study, we vary the assumed efficacy of control measures and quantify the effect on the mean and variance of realized generation and serial intervals. The simulation results show that the realized serial and generation intervals both depend on control measures and their values contract according to the efficacy of the intervention strategies. Interestingly, the mean serial interval differs from the mean generation time. The deviation between these two values depends on two factors. First, the number of undiagnosed infectious individuals. Second, the relationship between infectiousness, symptom onset and timing of isolation. Similarly, the standard deviations of realized serial and generation intervals do not coincide, with the former shorter than the latter on average. The findings of this study are directly relevant to estimates performed for the current COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the effective reproduction number is often inferred using both daily incidence data and the generation interval. Failing to account for either contraction or mis-specification by using the serial interval could lead to biased estimates of the effective reproduction number. Consequently, this might affect the choices made by decision makers when deciding which control measures to apply based on the value of the quantity thereof.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1MA2iyNTB8Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

High-throughput B-cell sequencing has opened up new avenues for investigating complex mechanisms underlying our adaptive immune response. These technological advances drive data generation and the need to mine and analyze the information contained in these large datasets, in particular the identification of therapeutic antibodies (Abs) or those associated with disease exposure and protection. Here, we describe our efforts to use artificial intelligence (AI)-based image-analyses for prospective classification of Abs based solely on sequence information. We hypothesized that Abs recognizing the same part of an antigen share a limited set of features at the binding interface, and that the binding site regions of these Abs share share common structure and physicochemical property patterns that can serve as a “fingerprint” to recognize uncharacterized Abs. We combined large-scale sequence-based protein-structure predictions to generate ensembles of 3-D Ab models, reduced the Ab binding interface to a 2-D image (fingerprint), used pre-trained convolutional neural networks to extract features, and trained deep neural networks (DNNs) to classify Abs. We evaluated this approach using Ab sequences derived from human HIV and Ebola viral infections to differentiate between two Abs, Abs belonging to specific B-cell family lineages, and Abs with different epitope preferences. In addition, we explored a different type of DNN method to detect one class of Abs from a larger pool of Abs. Testing on Ab sets that had been kept aside during model training, we achieved average prediction accuracies ranging from 71–96% depending on the complexity of the classification task. The high level of accuracies reached during these classification tests suggests that the DNN models were able to learn a series of structural patterns shared by Abs belonging to the same class. The developed methodology provides a means to apply AI-based image recognition techniques to analyze high-throughput B-cell sequencing datasets (repertoires) for Ab classification.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RlXkBCs5lf4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

To better combat the expansion of antibiotic resistance in pathogens, new compounds, particularly those with novel mechanisms-of-action [MOA], represent a major research priority in biomedical science. However, rediscovery of known antibiotics demonstrates a need for approaches that accurately identify potential novelty with higher throughput and reduced labor. Here we describe an explainable artificial intelligence classification methodology that emphasizes prediction performance and human interpretability by using a Hierarchical Ensemble of Classifiers model optimized with a novel feature selection algorithm called &lt;i&gt;Clairvoyance&lt;/i&gt;; collectively referred to as a CoHEC model. We evaluated our methods using whole transcriptome responses from &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; challenged with 41 FDA-approved antibiotics and 9 crude extracts while depositing 306 transcriptomes. Our CoHEC model can properly predict the primary MOA of previously unobserved compounds in both purified forms and crude extracts at an accuracy above 99%, while also correctly identifying darobactin, a newly discovered antibiotic, as having a novel MOA. In addition, we deploy our methods on a recent &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; transcriptomics dataset in a different strain and a &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium smegmatis&lt;/i&gt; metabolomics timeseries dataset and showcase exceptionally high performance; improving upon the performance metrics of the original publications. We not only provide insight into the biological interpretation of our model but also that the concept of MOA is a non-discrete heuristic with diverse effects for different compounds within the same MOA, suggesting substantial antibiotic diversity awaiting discovery within existing MOA.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/48cjWGzTslc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The Sec complex catalyzes the translocation of proteins of the secretory pathway into the endoplasmic reticulum and the integration of membrane proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Some substrate peptides require the presence and involvement of accessory proteins such as Sec63. Recently, a structure of the Sec complex from &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, consisting of the Sec61 channel and the Sec62, Sec63, Sec71 and Sec72 proteins was determined by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Here, we show by co-precipitation that the accessory membrane protein Sec62 is not required for formation of stable Sec63-Sec61 contacts. Molecular dynamics simulations started from the cryo-EM conformation of Sec61 bound to Sec63 and of unbound Sec61 revealed how Sec63 affects the conformation of Sec61 lateral gate, plug, pore region and pore ring diameter via three intermolecular contact regions. Molecular docking of SRP-dependent vs. SRP-independent peptide chains into the Sec61 channel showed that the pore regions affected by presence/absence of Sec63 play a crucial role in positioning the signal anchors of SRP-dependent substrates nearby the lateral gate.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RNONmvfGW8Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Predictions of COVID-19 case growth and mortality are critical to the decisions of political leaders, businesses, and individuals grappling with the pandemic. This predictive task is challenging due to the novelty of the virus, limited data, and dynamic political and societal responses. We embed a Bayesian time series model and a random forest algorithm within an epidemiological compartmental model for empirically grounded COVID-19 predictions. The Bayesian case model fits a location-specific curve to the velocity (first derivative) of the log transformed cumulative case count, borrowing strength across geographic locations and incorporating prior information to obtain a posterior distribution for case trajectories. The compartmental model uses this distribution and predicts deaths using a random forest algorithm trained on COVID-19 data and population-level characteristics, yielding daily projections and interval estimates for cases and deaths in U.S. states. We evaluated the model by training it on progressively longer periods of the pandemic and computing its predictive accuracy over 21-day forecasts. The substantial variation in predicted trajectories and associated uncertainty between states is illustrated by comparing three unique locations: New York, Colorado, and West Virginia. The sophistication and accuracy of this COVID-19 model offer reliable predictions and uncertainty estimates for the current trajectory of the pandemic in the U.S. and provide a platform for future predictions as shifting political and societal responses alter its course.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Y4cIPVNUqpE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Tuned inhibition in perceptual decision-making circuits can explain seemingly suboptimal confidence behavior</title>

Current dominant views hold that perceptual confidence reflects the probability that a decision is correct. Although these views have enjoyed some empirical support, recent behavioral results indicate that confidence and the probability of being correct can be dissociated. An alternative hypothesis suggests that confidence instead reflects the magnitude of evidence in favor of a decision while being relatively insensitive to the evidence opposing the decision. We considered how this alternative hypothesis might be biologically instantiated by developing a simple neural network model incorporating a known property of sensory neurons: tuned inhibition. The key idea of the model is that the level of inhibition that each accumulator unit receives from units with the opposite tuning preference, i.e. its inhibition ‘tuning’, dictates its contribution to perceptual decisions versus confidence judgments, such that units with higher tuned inhibition (computing relative evidence for different perceptual interpretations) determine perceptual discrimination decisions, and units with lower tuned inhibition (computing absolute evidence) determine confidence. We demonstrate that this biologically plausible model can account for several counterintuitive findings reported in the literature where confidence and decision accuracy dissociate. By comparing model fits, we further demonstrate that a full complement of behavioral data across several previously published experimental results—including accuracy, reaction time, mean confidence, and metacognitive sensitivity—is best accounted for when confidence is computed from units without, rather than units with, tuned inhibition. Finally, we discuss predictions of our results and model for future neurobiological studies. These findings suggest that the brain has developed and implements this alternative, heuristic theory of perceptual confidence computation by relying on the diversity of neural resources available.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/eTjhk481G6g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Vocalization with semi-occluded airways is favorable for optimizing sound production</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/EJ3DUY2VfZQ/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Ingo R. Titze, Anil Palaparthi, Karin Cox, Amanda Stark, Lynn Maxfield, Brian Manternach&lt;/p&gt;

Vocalization in mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians occurs with airways that have wide openings to free-space for efficient sound radiations, but sound is also produced with occluded or semi-occluded airways that have small openings to free-space. It is hypothesized that pressures produced inside the airway with semi-occluded vocalizations have an overall widening effect on the airway. This overall widening then provides more opportunity to produce wide-narrow contrasts along the airway for variation in sound quality and loudness. For human vocalization described here, special emphasis is placed on the epilaryngeal airway, which can be adjusted for optimal aerodynamic power transfer and for optimal acoustic source-airway interaction. The methodology is three-fold, (1) geometric measurement of airway dimensions from CT scans, (2) aerodynamic and acoustic impedance calculation of the airways, and (3) simulation of acoustic signals with a self-oscillating computational model of the sound source and wave propagation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EJ3DUY2VfZQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) combines laser ablation and mass spectrometry to quantitate metal-conjugated primary antibodies incubated in intact tumor tissue slides. This strategy allows spatially-resolved multiplexing of dozens of simultaneous protein targets with 1&lt;i&gt;μm&lt;/i&gt; resolution. Each slide is a spatial assay consisting of high-dimensional multivariate observations (&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-dimensional feature space) collected at different spatial positions and capturing data from a single biological sample or even representative spots from multiple samples when using tissue microarrays. Often, each of these spatial assays could be characterized by several regions of interest (ROIs). To extract meaningful information from the multi-dimensional observations recorded at different ROIs across different assays, we propose to analyze such datasets using a two-step graph-based approach. We first construct for each ROI a graph representing the interactions between the &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt; covariates and compute an &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt; dimensional vector characterizing the steady state distribution among features. We then use all these &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-dimensional vectors to construct a graph between the ROIs from all assays. This second graph is subjected to a nonlinear dimension reduction analysis, retrieving the intrinsic geometric representation of the ROIs. Such a representation provides the foundation for efficient and accurate organization of the different ROIs that correlates with their phenotypes. Theoretically, we show that when the ROIs have a particular bi-modal distribution, the new representation gives rise to a better distinction between the two modalities compared to the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator. We applied our method to predict the sensitivity to PD-1 axis blockers treatment of lung cancer subjects based on IMC data, achieving 97.3% average accuracy on two IMC datasets. This serves as empirical evidence that the graph of graphs approach enables us to integrate multiple ROIs and the intra-relationships between the features at each ROI, giving rise to an informative representation that is strongly associated with the phenotypic state of the entire image.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GEczoeuouO0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;i&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/i&gt;, an opportunistic fungal pathogen, is a significant cause of human infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. Phenotypic plasticity between two morphological phenotypes, yeast and hyphae, is a key mechanism by which &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albicans&lt;/i&gt; can thrive in many microenvironments and cause disease in the host. Understanding the decision points and key driver genes controlling this important transition and how these genes respond to different environmental signals is critical to understanding how &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albicans&lt;/i&gt; causes infections in the host. Here we build and analyze a Boolean dynamical model of the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albicans&lt;/i&gt; yeast to hyphal transition, integrating multiple environmental factors and regulatory mechanisms. We validate the model by a systematic comparison to prior experiments, which led to agreement in 17 out of 22 cases. The discrepancies motivate alternative hypotheses that are testable by follow-up experiments. Analysis of this model revealed two time-constrained windows of opportunity that must be met for the complete transition from the yeast to hyphal phenotype, as well as control strategies that can robustly prevent this transition. We experimentally validate two of these control predictions in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albicans&lt;/i&gt; strains lacking the transcription factor &lt;i&gt;UME6&lt;/i&gt; and the histone deacetylase &lt;i&gt;HDA1&lt;/i&gt;, respectively.

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Perturbations both trigger and delay seizures due to generic properties of slow-fast relaxation oscillators</title>

The mechanisms underlying the emergence of seizures are one of the most important unresolved issues in epilepsy research. In this paper, we study how perturbations, exogenous or endogenous, may promote or delay seizure emergence. To this aim, due to the increasingly adopted view of epileptic dynamics in terms of slow-fast systems, we perform a theoretical analysis of the phase response of a generic relaxation oscillator. As relaxation oscillators are effectively bistable systems at the fast time scale, it is intuitive that perturbations of the non-seizing state with a suitable direction and amplitude may cause an immediate transition to seizure. By contrast, and perhaps less intuitively, smaller amplitude perturbations have been found to delay the spontaneous seizure initiation. By studying the isochrons of relaxation oscillators, we show that this is a generic phenomenon, with the size of such delay depending on the slow flow component. Therefore, depending on perturbation amplitudes, frequency and timing, a train of perturbations causes an occurrence increase, decrease or complete suppression of seizures. This dependence lends itself to analysis and mechanistic understanding through methods outlined in this paper. We illustrate this methodology by computing the isochrons, phase response curves and the response to perturbations in several epileptic models possessing different slow vector fields. While our theoretical results are applicable to any planar relaxation oscillator, in the motivating context of epilepsy they elucidate mechanisms of triggering and abating seizures, thus suggesting stimulation strategies with effects ranging from mere delaying to full suppression of seizures.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dsLINHVmm_Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Atherosclerotic plaque rupture is responsible for a majority of acute vascular syndromes and this study aims to develop a prediction tool for plaque progression and rupture. Based on the follow-up coronary intravascular ultrasound imaging data, we performed patient-specific multi-physical modeling study on four patients to obtain the evolutional processes of the microenvironment during plaque progression. Four main pathophysiological processes, i.e., lipid deposition, inflammatory response, migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and neovascularization were coupled based on the interactions demonstrated by experimental and clinical observations. A scoring table integrating the dynamic microenvironmental indicators with the classical risk index was proposed to differentiate their progression to stable and unstable plaques. The heterogeneity of plaque microenvironment for each patient was demonstrated by the growth curves of the main microenvironmental factors. The possible plaque developments were predicted by incorporating the systematic index with microenvironmental indicators. Five microenvironmental factors (LDL, ox-LDL, MCP-1, SMC, and foam cell) showed significant differences between stable and unstable group (p &amp;lt; 0.01). The inflammatory microenvironments (monocyte and macrophage) had negative correlations with the necrotic core (NC) expansion in the stable group, while very strong positive correlations in unstable group. The inflammatory microenvironment is strongly correlated to the NC expansion in unstable plaques, suggesting that the inflammatory factors may play an important role in the formation of a vulnerable plaque. This prediction tool will improve our understanding of the mechanism of plaque progression and provide a new strategy for early detection and prediction of high-risk plaques.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6r1IXk0x9MU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Since its emergence in December 2019, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread globally and become a major public health burden. Despite its close phylogenetic relationship to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 exhibits increased human-to-human transmission dynamics, likely due to efficient early replication in the upper respiratory epithelium of infected individuals. Since different temperatures encountered in the human upper and lower respiratory tract (37°C and 33°C, respectively) have been shown to affect the replication kinetics of several respiratory viruses, as well as host immune response dynamics, we investigated the impact of temperatures during SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection using the primary human airway epithelial cell culture model. SARS-CoV-2, in contrast to SARS-CoV, replicated to higher titers when infections were performed at 33°C rather than 37°C. Although both viruses were highly sensitive to type I and type III interferon pretreatment, a detailed time-resolved transcriptome analysis revealed temperature-dependent interferon and pro-inflammatory responses specifically induced by SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2, which amplitude was inversely proportional to their replication efficiencies at 33°C or 37°C. These data provide crucial insight on pivotal virus–host interaction dynamics and are in line with characteristic clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, as well as their respective transmission efficiencies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/MyiORulRnw4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Disrupted eye and head development in rainbow trout with reduced ultraviolet (sws1) opsin expression</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25144?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Retinal photoreceptors express visual opsins that capture light to begin the process of phototransduction. The consequences of opsin disruption on retinal development are poorly understood. Here, the ultraviolet (short wavelength sensitive 1, sws1) opsin of rainbow trout was partially knocked out using the CRISPR/Cas9 editing system. Knockouts showed a disrupted outer retina consisting of diminished opsin expression, absent or stunted outer segments, photoreceptor degeneration and loss of mosaic regularity. These findings indicate developmental roles of visual opsins beyond phototransduction.






Abstract
Visual opsins are proteins expressed by retinal photoreceptors that capture light to begin the process of phototransduction. In vertebrates, the two types of photoreceptors (rods and cones) express one or multiple opsins and are distributed in variable patterns across the retina. Some cones form opsin retinal gradients, as in the mouse, whereas others form more demarcated opsin domains, as in the lattice‐like mosaic retinas of teleost fishes. Reduced rod opsin (rh1) expression in mouse, zebrafish and African clawed frog results in lack of photoreceptor outer segments (i.e., the cilium that houses the opsins) and, in the case of the mouse, to retinal degeneration. The effects of diminished cone opsin expression have only been studied in the mouse where knockout of the short wavelength sensitive 1 (sws1) opsin leads to ventral retinal cones lacking outer segments, but no retinal degeneration. Here we show that, following CRISPR/Cas9 injections that targeted knockout of the sws1 opsin in rainbow trout, fish with diminished sws1 opsin expression exhibited a variety of developmental defects including head and eye malformations, underdeveloped outer retina, mislocalized opsin expression, cone degeneration, and mosaic irregularity. All photoreceptor types were affected even though sws1 is only expressed in the single cones of wild fish. Our results reveal unprecedented developmental defects associated with diminished cone opsin expression and suggest that visual opsin genes are involved in regulatory processes that precede photoreceptor differentiation.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We propose a vision-based architecture search algorithm for robot
manipulation learning, which discovers interactions between low dimension
action inputs and high dimensional visual inputs. Our approach automatically
designs architectures while training on the task - discovering novel ways of
combining and attending image feature representations with actions as well as
features from previous layers. The obtained new architectures demonstrate
better task success rates, in some cases with a large margin, compared to a
recent high performing baseline. Our real robot experiments also confirm that
it improves grasping performance by 6%. This is the first approach to
demonstrate a successful neural architecture search and attention connectivity
search for a real-robot task.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Randomization-based Machine Learning in Renewable Energy Prediction Problems: Critical Literature Review, New Results and Perspectives. (arXiv:2103.14624v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14624</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Randomization-based Machine Learning methods for prediction are currently a
hot topic in Artificial Intelligence, due to their excellent performance in
many prediction problems, with a bounded computation time. The application of
randomization-based approaches to renewable energy prediction problems has been
massive in the last few years, including many different types of
randomization-based approaches, their hybridization with other techniques and
also the description of new versions of classical randomization-based
algorithms, including deep and ensemble approaches. In this paper we review the
most important characteristics of randomization-based machine learning
approaches and their application to renewable energy prediction problems. We
describe the most important methods and algorithms of this family of modeling
methods, and perform a critical literature review, examining prediction
problems related to solar, wind, marine/ocean and hydro-power renewable
sources. We support our critical analysis with an extensive experimental study,
comprising real-world problems related to solar, wind and hydro-power energy,
where randomization-based algorithms are found to achieve superior results at a
significantly lower computational cost than other modeling counterparts. We end
our survey with a prospect of the most important challenges and research
directions that remain open this field, along with an outlook motivating
further research efforts in this exciting research field.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: RCT: Resource Constrained Training for Edge AI. (arXiv:2103.14493v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14493</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural networks training on edge terminals is essential for edge AI
computing, which needs to be adaptive to evolving environment. Quantised models
can efficiently run on edge devices, but existing training methods for these
compact models are designed to run on powerful servers with abundant memory and
energy budget. For example, quantisation-aware training (QAT) method involves
two copies of model parameters, which is usually beyond the capacity of on-chip
memory in edge devices. Data movement between off-chip and on-chip memory is
energy demanding as well. The resource requirements are trivial for powerful
servers, but critical for edge devices. To mitigate these issues, We propose
Resource Constrained Training (RCT). RCT only keeps a quantised model
throughout the training, so that the memory requirements for model parameters
in training is reduced. It adjusts per-layer bitwidth dynamically in order to
save energy when a model can learn effectively with lower precision. We carry
out experiments with representative models and tasks in image application and
natural language processing. Experiments show that RCT saves more than 86\%
energy for General Matrix Multiply (GEMM) and saves more than 46\% memory for
model parameters, with limited accuracy loss. Comparing with QAT-based method,
RCT saves about half of energy on moving model parameters.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;What fits the human brain does not necessarily mean whatever is invented is
meant for human brain. This is exactly what is implied by the definition of
algorithm: \textit{Reducing and Simplifying}. Our cognitive apparatus, although
endowed with certain parameters, ceases to comprehend chains of mathematical
and logical steps used for algorithmic or mathematical purposes. Such a
cognitive limit allows us to pay attention to the symbolic regularities which
are meaningful. The more meaningless these symbols become, the fuzzier is our
mental representation for it. Needless to say, that we actually tend to
interact with activities that are meaningful, and discard those that are
meaningless. By activities we mean steps, steps that form an algorithm. Could
it be just an assumption? Are we really aversing from algorithms in modern day
life?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ziel dieser Arbeit war eine kritische Auseinandersetzung mit dem
biokybernetischen Denkansatz anhand des Sensitivit\&quot;atsmodells von Frederic
Vester, das in die sozioinformatische Analyse eines sozio-technischen Systems
integriert und hinsichtlich der Fragestellung gepr\&quot;uft wurde, inwieweit sich
dieses Konzept zur Beurteilung von Planungsvorhaben bei sozio-technischen
Systemen eignet. Dazu wurden F. Vesters Biokybernetischenn Grundregeln zur
Feststellung der \&quot;Uberlebensf\&quot;ahigkeit eines Systems, auf ihre Anwendbarkeit
in Bezug auf sozio-technische Systeme untersucht. Die Funktionalit\&quot;at der
Analysemethode wurde auf das nach der Definition von Andrea Kienle und Gabriele
Kunau als sozio-technisches System charakterisierte Unternehmen Uber
angewendet. Im Gegensatz zu unsystemischen Analysen besteht der Vorteil des
Sensitivit\&quot;atsmodells in der Vermittlung von Erkenntnissen \&quot;uber innere
Systemzusammenh\&quot;ange. Abschlie{\ss}end wurde der vorgestellte Analyseansatz
als transdisziplin\&quot;are Weiterentwicklung des Sensitivit\&quot;atsmodells
charakterisiert.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Comparison of Pattern Discrimination Mechanisms of Hebbian and Spatiotemporal Learning Rules in Self-Organization</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.624353</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The spatiotemporal learning rule (STLR) proposed based on hippocampal neurophysiological experiments is essentially different from the Hebbian learning rule (HEBLR) in terms of the self-organization mechanism. The difference is the self-organization of information from the external world by firing (HEBLR) or not firing (STLR) output neurons. Here, we describe the differences of the self-organization mechanism between the two learning rules by simulating neural network models trained on relatively similar spatiotemporal context information. Comparing the weight distributions after training, the HEBLR shows a unimodal distribution near the training vector, whereas the STLR shows a multimodal distribution. We analyzed the shape of the weight distribution in response to temporal changes in contextual information and found that the HEBLR does not change the shape of the weight distribution for time-varying spatiotemporal contextual information, whereas the STLR is sensitive to slight differences in spatiotemporal contexts and produces a multimodal distribution. These results suggest a critical difference in the dynamic change of synaptic weight distributions between the HEBLR and STLR in contextual learning. They also capture the characteristics of the pattern completion in the HEBLR and the pattern discrimination in the STLR, which adequately explain the self-organization mechanism of contextual information learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Severe Spinal Cord Injury in Rats Induces Chronic Changes in the Spinal Cord and Cerebral Cortex Metabolism, Adjusted by Thiamine That Improves Locomotor Performance</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.620593</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Our study aims at developing knowledge-based strategies minimizing chronic changes in the brain after severe spinal cord injury (SCI). The SCI-induced long-term metabolic alterations and their reactivity to treatments shortly after the injury are characterized in rats. Eight weeks after severe SCI, significant mitochondrial lesions outside the injured area are demonstrated in the spinal cord and cerebral cortex. Among the six tested enzymes essential for the TCA cycle and amino acid metabolism, mitochondrial 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDHC) is the most affected one. SCI downregulates this complex by 90% in the spinal cord and 30% in the cerebral cortex. This is associated with the tissue-specific changes in other enzymes of the OGDHC network. Single administrations of a pro-activator (thiamine, or vitamin B1, 1.2 mmol/kg) or a synthetic pro-inhibitor (triethyl glutaryl phosphonate, TEGP, 0.02 mmol/kg) of OGDHC within 15–20 h after SCI are tested as protective strategies. The biochemical and physiological assessments 8 weeks after SCI reveal that thiamine, but not TEGP, alleviates the SCI-induced perturbations in the rat brain metabolism, accompanied by the decreased expression of (acetyl)p53, increased expression of sirtuin 5 and an 18% improvement in the locomotor recovery. Treatment of the non-operated rats with the OGDHC pro-inhibitor TEGP increases the p53 acetylation in the brain, approaching the brain metabolic profiles to those after SCI. Our data testify to an important contribution of the OGDHC regulation to the chronic consequences of SCI and their control by p53 and sirtuin 5.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Aim&lt;p&gt;GtACR2, a light-activated chloride channel, is an attractive tool for neural inhibition as it can shunt membrane depolarizations. In this study, we assessed the effect of activating GtACR2 on in vivo hippocampal CA1 activity evoked by Schaffer collateral (SC) stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Adult male Wistar rats were unilaterally injected with 0.5 μL of adeno associated viral vector for induction of GtACR2-mCherry (n = 10, GtACR2 group) or mCherry (n = 4, Sham group) expression in CA1 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus. Three weeks later, evoked potentials (EPs) were recorded from the CA1 subfield placing an optrode (bipolar recording electrode attached to an optic fiber) at the injection site and a stimulation electrode targeting SCs. Effects of illumination parameters required to activate GtACR2 such as light power densities (LPDs), illumination delays, and light-pulse durations were tested on CA1 EP parameters [population spike (PS) amplitude and field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) slope].&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;In the GtACR2 group, delivery of a 10 ms light-pulse induced a negative deflection in the local field potential which increased with increasing LPD. When combined with electrical stimulation of the SCs, light-induced activation of GtACR2 had potent inhibitory effects on CA1 EPs. An LPD of 160 mW/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; was sufficient to obtain maximal inhibition CA1 EPs. To quantify the duration of the inhibitory effect, a 10 ms light-pulse of 160 mW/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; was delivered at increasing delays before the CA1 EPs. Inhibition of EPs was found to last up to 9 ms after the cessation of the light-pulse. Increasing light-pulse durations beyond 10 ms did not result in larger inhibitory effects.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Precisely timed activation of GtACR2 potently blocks evoked activity of CA1 neurons. The strength of inhibition depends on LPD, lasts up to 9 ms after a light-pulse of 10 ms, and is independent of the duration of the light-pulse given.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The high prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) among the elderly population and its lack of effective treatments make this disease a critical threat to human health. Recent epidemiological and genetics studies have revealed the polygenic nature of the disease, which is possibly explainable by a polygenic score model that considers multiple genetic risks. Here, we systemically review the rationale and methods used to construct polygenic score models for studying AD. We also discuss the associations of polygenic risk scores (PRSs) with clinical outcomes, brain imaging findings, and biochemical biomarkers from both the brain and peripheral system. Finally, we discuss the possibility of incorporating polygenic score models into research and clinical practice along with potential challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Advancements in the Protocol for Rate of Force Development/Relaxation Scaling Factor Evaluation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.654443</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brief submaximal actions are important for wide range of functional movements. Until now, rate of force development and relaxation scaling factor (RFD-SF and RFR-SF) have been used for neuromuscular assessment using 100–120 isometric pulses which requires a high level of attention from the participant and may be influenced by physiological and/or psychological fatigue. All previous studies have been conducted on a smaller number of participants which calls into question the eligibility of some of the outcome measures reported to date. Our aims were: (1) to find the smallest number of rapid isometric force pulses at different force amplitudes is still valid and reliable for RFD-SF slope (k&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;–SF&lt;/sub&gt;) and RFR-SF slope (k&lt;sub&gt;RFR–SF&lt;/sub&gt;) calculation, (2) to introduce a new outcome measure – theoretical peak of rate of force development/relaxation (TP&lt;sub&gt;RFD&lt;/sub&gt; and TP&lt;sub&gt;RFR&lt;/sub&gt;) and (3) to investigate differences and associations between k&lt;sub&gt;RFD–SF&lt;/sub&gt; and k&lt;sub&gt;RFR–SF&lt;/sub&gt;. A cross-sectional study was conducted on a group of young healthy participants; 40 in the reliability study and 336 in the comparison/association study. We investigated the smallest number of rapid isometric pulses for knee extensors that still provides excellent reliability of the calculated k&lt;sub&gt;RFD–SF&lt;/sub&gt; and k&lt;sub&gt;RFR–SF&lt;/sub&gt; (ICC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ 0.95, CV &amp;lt; 5%). Our results showed excellent reliability of the reduced protocol when 36 pulses (nine for each of the four intensity ranges) were used for the calculations of k&lt;sub&gt;RFD–SF&lt;/sub&gt; and k&lt;sub&gt;RFR–SF&lt;/sub&gt;. We confirmed the negligibility of the y-intercepts and confirmed the reliability of the newly introduced TP&lt;sub&gt;RFD&lt;/sub&gt; and TP&lt;sub&gt;RFR&lt;/sub&gt;. Large negative associations were found between k&lt;sub&gt;RFD–SF&lt;/sub&gt; and k&lt;sub&gt;RFR–SF&lt;/sub&gt; (r = 0.502, p &amp;lt; 0.001), while comparison of the absolute values showed a significantly higher k&lt;sub&gt;RFD–SF&lt;/sub&gt; (8.86 ± 1.0/s) compared to k&lt;sub&gt;RFR–SF&lt;/sub&gt; (8.03 ± 1.3/s) (p &amp;lt; 0.001). The advantage of the reduced protocol (4 intensities × 9 pulses = 36 pulses) is the shorter assessment time and the reduction of possible influence of fatigue. In addition, the introduction of TP&lt;sub&gt;RFD&lt;/sub&gt; and TP&lt;sub&gt;RFR&lt;/sub&gt; as an outcome measure provides valuable information about the participant’s maximal theoretical RFD/RFR capacity. This can be useful for the assessment of maximal capacity in people with various impairments or pain problems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Progression of Visual Pathway Degeneration in Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma: A Longitudinal Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.630898</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) patients exhibit widespread white matter (WM) degeneration throughout their visual pathways. Whether this degeneration starts at the pre- or post-geniculate pathways remains unclear. In this longitudinal study, we assess the progression of WM degeneration exhibited by the pre-geniculate optic tracts (OTs) and the post-geniculate optic radiations (ORs) of POAG patients over time, aiming to determine the source and pattern of spread of this degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Diffusion-weighted MRI scans were acquired for 12 POAG patients and 14 controls at two time-points 5.4 ± 2.1 years apart. Fiber density (FD), an estimate of WM axonal density, was computed for the OTs and ORs of all participants in an unbiased longitudinal population template space. First, FD was compared between POAG patients and the controls at time-point 1 (TP1) and time-point 2 (TP2) independently. Secondly, repeated measures analysis was performed for FD change in POAG patients between the two time-points. Finally, we compared the rate of FD change over time between the two groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Compared to the controls, POAG patients exhibited significantly lower FD in the left OT at TP1 and in both OTs and the left OR at TP2. POAG patients showed a significant loss of FD between the time-points in the right OT and both ORs, while the left OR showed a significantly higher rate of FD loss in POAG patients compared to the controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: We find longitudinal progression of neurodegenerative WM changes in both the pre- and post-geniculate visual pathways of POAG patients. The pattern of changes suggests that glaucomatous WM degeneration starts at the pre-geniculate pathways and then spreads to the post-geniculate pathways. Furthermore, we find evidence that the trans-synaptic spread of glaucomatous degeneration to the post-geniculate pathways is a prolonged process which continues in the absence of detectable pre-geniculate degenerative progression. This suggests the presence of a time window for salvaging intact post-geniculate pathways, which could prove to be a viable therapeutic target in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The diversified methodology and expertise of interdisciplinary research teams provide the opportunity to overcome the limited perspectives of individual disciplines. This is particularly true at the interface of Robotics, Neuroscience, and Psychology as the three fields have quite different perspectives and approaches to offer. Nonetheless, aligning backgrounds and interdisciplinary expectations can present challenges due to varied research cultures and practices. Overcoming these challenges stands at the beginning of each productive collaboration and thus is a mandatory step in cognitive neurorobotics. In this article, we share eight lessons that we learned from our ongoing interdisciplinary project on human-robot and robot-robot interaction in social settings. These lessons provide practical advice for scientists initiating interdisciplinary research endeavors. Our advice can help to avoid early problems and deal with differences between research fields, prepare for and anticipate challenges, align project expectations, and speed up research progress, thus promoting effective interdisciplinary research across Robotics, Neuroscience, and Psychology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Regional Neurodegeneration in vitro: The Protective Role of Neural Activity</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.580107</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury is a devastating public health problem, the eighth leading cause of death across the world. To improve our understanding of how injury at the cellular scale affects neural circuit function, we developed a protocol to precisely injure individual neurons within an in vitro neural network. We used high speed calcium imaging to estimate alterations in neural activity and connectivity that occur followed targeted microtrauma. Our studies show that mechanically injured neurons inactivate following microtrauma and eventually re-integrate into the network. Single neuron re-integration is dependent on its activity prior to injury and initial connections in the network: more active and integrated neurons are more resistant to microtrauma and more likely to re-integrate into the network. Micromechanical injury leads to neuronal death 6 h post-injury in a subset of both injured and uninjured neurons. Interestingly, neural activity and network participation after injury were associated with survival in linear discriminate analysis (77.3% correct prediction, Wilks' Lambda = 0.838). Based on this observation, we modulated neuronal activity to rescue neurons after microtrauma. Inhibition of neuronal activity provided much greater survivability than did activation of neurons (ANOVA, p &amp;lt; 0.01 with post-hoc Tukey HSD, p &amp;lt; 0.01). Rescue of neurons by blocking activity in the post-acute period is partially mediated by mitochondrial energetics, as we observed silencing neurons after micromechanical injury led to a significant reduction in mitochondrial calcium accumulation. Overall, the present study provides deeper insight into the propagation of injury within networks, demonstrating that together the initial activity, network structure, and post-injury activity levels contribute to the progressive changes in a neural circuit after mechanical trauma.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Transcription Factor Reprogramming in the Inner Ear: Turning on Cell Fate Switches to Regenerate Sensory Hair Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.660748</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Non-mammalian vertebrates can restore their auditory and vestibular hair cells naturally by triggering the regeneration of adjacent supporting cells. The transcription factor ATOH1 is a key regulator of hair cell development and regeneration in the inner ear. Following the death of hair cells, supporting cells upregulate ATOH1 and give rise to new hair cells. However, in the mature mammalian cochlea, such natural regeneration of hair cells is largely absent. Transcription factor reprogramming has been used in many tissues to convert one cell type into another, with the long-term hope of achieving tissue regeneration. Reprogramming transcription factors work by altering the transcriptomic and epigenetic landscapes in a target cell, resulting in a fate change to the desired cell type. Several studies have shown that ATOH1 is capable of reprogramming cochlear non-sensory tissue into cells resembling hair cells in young animals. However, the reprogramming ability of ATOH1 is lost with age, implying that the potency of individual hair cell-specific transcription factors may be reduced or lost over time by mechanisms that are still not clear. To circumvent this, combinations of key hair cell transcription factors have been used to promote hair cell regeneration in older animals. In this review, we summarize recent findings that have identified and studied these reprogramming factor combinations for hair cell regeneration. Finally, we discuss the important questions that emerge from these findings, particularly the feasibility of therapeutic strategies using reprogramming factors to restore human hearing in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Integrated 18F-T807 Tau PET, Structural MRI, and Plasma Tau in Tauopathy Neurodegenerative Disorders</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.646440</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background and Objective: Tau-specific positron emission topography (PET) imaging enables in vivo assessment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We aimed to investigate its performance in combination with plasma tau levels in patients with non-AD tauopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A total of 47 participants were enrolled, including 10 healthy controls, 16 with tauopathy parkinsonism syndromes (9 with corticobasal syndrome [CBS], 7 with progressive supranuclear palsy [PSP]), 9 with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), 4 with AD, and 8 with Parkinson's disease (PD). All participants underwent clinical assessments, &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-T807 tau PET, brain MRI, and plasma tau assay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The global cortical standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) of &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-T807 PET was comparable between PD and control (p = 0.088). The cortical SUVR was significantly higher in AD group (p = 0.002) but was modestly increased in PSP group compared to the PD group (p = 0.044), especially in parietal and pallidal regions. Asymmetric &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-T807 uptake at the pallidum was noted in patients with CBS and FTD. Cortical tau tracer uptake was associated with increased plasma total tau level (p = 0.016), especially in frontal and parietal regions. Regional tracer uptake was correlated with cortical thinning in patients with CBS and PSP (CBS: r = −0.092, p = 0.025; PSP: r = −0.114, p = 0.015).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-T807 tau tracer uptake was only modestly increased in patients with PSP. Although the cortical tau tracer uptake correlated with regional cortical atrophy and plasma tau levels, a four-repeated tau-specific tracer is needed for future classifying tauopathy parkinsonism syndromes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66173</link>
	<content:encoded>Feeding is critical for survival and disruption in the mechanisms that govern food intake underlie disorders such as obesity and anorexia nervosa. It is important to understand both food intake and food motivation to reveal mechanisms underlying feeding disorders. Operant behavioral testing can be used to measure the motivational component to feeding, but most food intake monitoring systems do not measure operant behavior. Here, we present a new solution for monitoring both food intake and motivation in rodent home-cages: The Feeding Experimentation Device version 3 (FED3). FED3 measures food intake and operant behavior in rodent home-cages, enabling longitudinal studies of feeding behavior with minimal experimenter intervention. It has a programmable output for synchronizing behavior with optogenetic stimulation or neural recordings. Finally, FED3 design files are open-source and freely available, allowing researchers to modify FED3 to suit their needs.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65113</link>
	<content:encoded>Here, we develop a simple molecular test for SARS-CoV-2 in saliva based on reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP). The test has two steps: 1) heat saliva with a stabilization solution, and 2) detect virus by incubating with a primer/enzyme mix. After incubation, saliva samples containing the SARS-CoV-2 genome turn bright yellow. Because this test is pH dependent, it can react falsely to some naturally acidic saliva samples. We report unique saliva stabilization protocols that rendered 295 healthy saliva samples compatible with the test, producing zero false positives. We also evaluated the test on 278 saliva samples from individuals who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 but had no symptoms at the time of saliva collection, and from 54 matched pairs of saliva and anterior nasal samples from infected individuals. The Saliva TwoStep test described herein identified infections with 94% sensitivity and &amp;gt;99% specificity in individuals with sub-clinical (asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic) infections.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: The olfactory critical period is determined by activity-dependent Sema7A/PlxnC1 signaling within glomeruli</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65078</link>
	<content:encoded>In mice, early exposure to environmental odors affects social behaviors later in life. A signaling molecule, Semaphorin 7A (Sema7A), is induced in the odor-responding olfactory sensory neurons. Plexin C1 (PlxnC1), a receptor for Sema7A, is expressed in mitral/tufted cells, whose dendrite-localization is restricted to the first week after birth. Sema7A/PlxnC1 signaling promotes post-synaptic events and dendrite selection in mitral/tufted cells, resulting in glomerular enlargement that causes an increase in sensitivity to the experienced odor. Neonatal odor experience also induces positive responses to the imprinted odor. Knockout and rescue experiments indicate that oxytocin in neonates is responsible for imposing positive quality on imprinted memory. In the oxytocin knockout mice, the sensitivity to the imprinted odor increases, but positive responses cannot be promoted, indicating that Sema7A/PlxnC1 signaling and oxytocin separately function. These results give new insights into our understanding of olfactory imprinting during the neonatal critical period.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Global epistasis emerges from a generic model of a complex trait</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64740</link>
	<content:encoded>Epistasis between mutations makes adaptation contingent on evolutionary history. Yet despite widespread 'microscopic' epistasis between the mutations involved, microbial evolution experiments show consistent patterns of fitness increase between replicate lines. Recent work shows that this consistency is driven in part by global patterns of diminishing-returns and increasing-costs epistasis, which make mutations systematically less beneficial (or more deleterious) on fitter genetic backgrounds. However, the origin of this 'global' epistasis remains unknown. Here we show that diminishing-returns and increasing-costs epistasis emerge generically as a consequence of pervasive microscopic epistasis. Our model predicts a specific quantitative relationship between the magnitude of global epistasis and the stochastic effects of microscopic epistasis, which we confirm by re-analyzing existing data. We further show that the distribution of fitness effects has a universal form when epistasis is widespread, and introduce a novel fitness landscape model to show how phenotypic evolution can be repeatable despite sequence-level stochasticity.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Disparate bone anabolic cues activate bone formation by regulating the rapid lysosomal degradation of sclerostin protein</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64393</link>
	<content:encoded>The down regulation of sclerostin in osteocytes mediates bone formation in response to mechanical cues and parathyroid hormone (PTH). To date, the regulation of sclerostin has been attributed exclusively to the transcriptional downregulation of the &lt;i&gt;Sost&lt;/i&gt; gene hours after stimulation. Using mouse models and rodent cell lines, we describe the rapid, minutes-scale post-translational degradation of sclerostin protein by the lysosome following mechanical load and PTH. We present a model, integrating both new and established mechanically- and hormonally-activated effectors into the regulated degradation of sclerostin by lysosomes. Using a mouse forelimb mechanical loading model, we find transient inhibition of lysosomal degradation or the upstream mechano-signaling pathway controlling sclerostin abundance impairs subsequent load-induced bone formation by preventing sclerostin degradation&lt;i&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;We also link dysfunctional lysosomes to aberrant sclerostin regulation using human Gaucher disease iPSCs. These results reveal how bone anabolic cues post-translationally regulate sclerostin abundance in osteocytes to regulate bone formation.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61885</link>
	<content:encoded>A high-throughput systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment assay was applied to 371 putative TFs in &lt;i&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt;, which resulted in the robust enrichment of 199 sequence motifs describing the binding specificities of 182 TFs. By scanning the genome, we predicted in total 33,709 significant interactions between TFs and their target loci, which were more than 11-fold enriched in the intergenic regions but depleted in the gene body regions. To further explore and delineate the physiological and pathogenic roles of TFs in &lt;i&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt;, we constructed regulatory networks for nine major virulence-associated pathways, and found that 51 TFs were potentially significantly associated with these virulence pathways, 32 of which had not been characterized before, and some were even involved in multiple pathways. These results will significantly facilitate future studies on transcriptional regulation in &lt;i&gt;P. aeruginosa &lt;/i&gt;and other relevant pathogens, and accelerate to discover effective treatment and prevention strategies for the associated infectious diseases.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Generic injuries are sufficient to induce ectopic Wnt organizers in Hydra</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60562</link>
	<content:encoded>During whole-body regeneration, a bisection injury can trigger two different types of regeneration. To understand the transcriptional regulation underlying this adaptive response we characterized transcript abundance and chromatin accessibility during oral and aboral regeneration in the cnidarian &lt;i&gt;Hydra vulgaris&lt;/i&gt;. We found that the initial response to amputation at both wound sites is identical and includes widespread apoptosis and the activation of the oral-specifying Wnt signaling pathway. By 8 hours post-amputation, Wnt signaling became restricted to oral regeneration. Wnt pathway genes were also upregulated in puncture wounds and these wounds induced the formation of ectopic oral structures if pre-existing organizers were simultaneously amputated. Our work suggests that oral patterning is activated as part of a generic injury response in &lt;i&gt;Hydra&lt;/i&gt;, and that alternative injury outcomes are dependent on signals from the surrounding tissue. Furthermore, Wnt signaling is likely part of a conserved wound response predating the split of cnidarians and bilaterians.</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Amylin analog pramlintide induces migraine‐like attacks in patients</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26072?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Migraine is a prevalent and disabling neurological disease. Its genesis is poorly understood and there remains unmet clinical need. We aimed to identify mechanisms and thus novel therapeutic targets for migraine using human models of migraine and translational models in animals, with emphasis on amylin, a close relative of calcitonin gene‐related peptide (CGRP).


Methods
Thirty‐six migraine without aura patients were enrolled in a randomized, double‐blinded, two‐way, cross‐over, positive‐controlled clinical trial study to receive infusion of an amylin analogue pramlintide or human αCGRP on two different experimental days. Furthermore, translational studies in cells and mouse models, and rat and human tissue samples were conducted.


Results
Thirty patients (88%) developed headache after pramlintide infusion, compared to thirty‐three (97%) after CGRP (p = 0.375). Fourteen patients (41%) developed migraine‐like attacks after pramlintide infusion, compared to nineteen patients (56%) after CGRP (p = 0.180). The pramlintide induced migraine‐like attacks had similar clinical characteristics to those induced by CGRP. There were differences between treatments in vascular parameters. Human receptor pharmacology studies showed that an amylin receptor likely mediates these pramlintide‐provoked effects, rather than the canonical CGRP receptor. Supporting this, preclinical experiments investigating symptoms associated with migraine showed that amylin treatment, like CGRP, caused cutaneous hypersensitivity and light aversion in mice.


Interpretation
Our findings propose amylin receptor agonism as a novel contributor to migraine pathogenesis. Greater therapeutic gains could therefore be made for migraine patients through dual amylin and CGRP receptor antagonism, rather than selectively targeting the canonical CGRP receptor.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Foslevodopa/foscarbidopa: a new subcutaneous treatment for Parkinson's disease</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26073?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
To demonstrate that continuous subcutaneous infusion of a soluble levodopa (LD)/carbidopa (CD) phosphate prodrug combination effectively delivers stable LD exposure via a minimally invasive and convenient mode and has the potential to treat Parkinson's disease (PD) patients who are not well controlled on oral medication.


Methods
Foslevodopa/foscarbidopa are prepared and equilibrium solubility and chemical stability are examined in aqueous media of different pHs. Solutions of foslevodopa/foscarbidopa (4:1 to 20:1 ratios) were prepared by dissolving pH‐adjusted lyophilized materials in water and infused subcutaneously in healthy volunteers for up to 72 hours. Frequent blood samples were collected to measure LD and CD exposure and safety was monitored throughout the study.


Results
Foslevodopa/foscarbidopa (ABBV‐951), demonstrates high water solubility and excellent chemical stability near physiological pH enabling continuous subcutaneous infusion therapy. Following subcutaneous infusion, a stable LD pharmacokinetic (PK) profile was maintained for up to 72 hours and the infusion was well tolerated.


Interpretation
Preparation of foslevodopa and foscarbidopa enables preclinical and clinical PK, safety, and tolerability studies in support of their advancement for the treatment of PD. In Phase 1 clinical trials, foslevodopa/foscarbidopa demonstrates consistent and stable LD plasma exposure supporting further studies of this treatment as a potentially transformational option for those suffering from PD.

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26071?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Background
To operationalize the National Institute on Aging–Alzheimer's Association Research Framework for Alzheimer's Disease six‐stage continuum of clinical progression for persons with abnormal amyloid.


Methods
The Mayo Clinic Study of Aging is a population‐based longitudinal study of aging and cognitive impairment in Olmsted County, Minnesota. We evaluated persons without dementia having three consecutive clinical visits. Measures for cross‐sectional categories included objective cognitive impairment (OBJ) and function (FXN). Measures for change included subjective cognitive impairment (SCD), objective cognitive change (ΔOBJ), and new onset of neurobehavioral symptoms (ΔNBS). We calculated frequencies of the stages and assessed stability of the stages over 15 months.


Results
Among 243 abnormal amyloid participants, the frequencies of the stages varied with age: 66–90% were classified as Stage 1 at age 50 but at age 80, 24–36% were Stage 1, 32–47% Stage 2, 18–27% Stage 3, 1–3% Stage 4–6, and 3–9% indeterminate. Most Stage 2 participants were classified as Stage 2 because of abnormal ΔOBJ only (44–59%), while 11–21% had SCD only, and 9–13% had ΔNBS only. Short‐term stability varied by stage and OBJ cut points but the most notable changes were seen in Stage 2 with 38–63% remaining stable, 4–13% worsening, and 24–41% improving (moving to Stage 1).


Interpretation
The frequency of the stages varied by age and the precise membership fluctuated by the parameters used to define the stages. The staging framework may require revisions before it can be adopted for clinical trials.

	<content:encoded>Electrical stimulation after traumatic brain injury increases population of anti‐inflammatory microglia, neural stem cells, and Nestin+ astrocytes.

Abstract
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) by an external physical impact results in compromised brain function via undesired neuronal death. Following the injury, resident and peripheral immune cells, astrocytes, and neural stem cells (NSCs) cooperatively contribute to the recovery of the neuronal function after TBI. However, excessive pro‐inflammatory responses of immune cells, and the disappearance of endogenous NSCs at the injury site during the acute phase of TBI, can exacerbate TBI progression leading to incomplete healing. Therefore, positive outcomes may depend on early interventions to control the injury‐associated cellular milieu in the early phase of injury. Here, we explore electrical stimulation (ES) of the injury site in a rodent model (male Sprague–Dawley rats) to investigate its overall effect on the constituent brain cell phenotype and composition during the acute phase of TBI. Our data showed that a brief ES for 1 hr on day 2 of TBI promoted anti‐inflammatory phenotypes of microglia as assessed by CD206 expression and increased the population of NSCs and Nestin+ astrocytes at 7 days post‐TBI. Also, ES effectively increased the number of viable neurons when compared to the unstimulated control group. Given the salience of microglia and neural stem cells for healing after TBI, our results strongly support the potential benefit of the therapeutic use of ES during the acute phase of TBI to regulate neuroinflammation and to enhance neuroregeneration.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Deducing high-accuracy protein contact-maps from a triplet of coevolutionary matrices through deep residual convolutional networks</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/-atZB48ddiA/article</link>

The topology of protein folds can be specified by the inter-residue contact-maps and accurate contact-map prediction can help &lt;i&gt;ab initio&lt;/i&gt; structure folding. We developed TripletRes to deduce protein contact-maps from discretized distance profiles by end-to-end training of deep residual neural-networks. Compared to previous approaches, the major advantage of TripletRes is in its ability to learn and directly fuse a triplet of coevolutionary matrices extracted from the whole-genome and metagenome databases and therefore minimize the information loss during the course of contact model training. TripletRes was tested on a large set of 245 non-homologous proteins from CASP 11&amp;amp;12 and CAMEO experiments and outperformed other top methods from CASP12 by at least 58.4% for the CASP 11&amp;amp;12 targets and 44.4% for the CAMEO targets in the top-&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt; long-range contact precision. On the 31 FM targets from the latest CASP13 challenge, TripletRes achieved the highest precision (71.6%) for the top-&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;/5 long-range contact predictions. It was also shown that a simple re-training of the TripletRes model with more proteins can lead to further improvement with precisions comparable to state-of-the-art methods developed after CASP13. These results demonstrate a novel efficient approach to extend the power of deep convolutional networks for high-accuracy medium- and long-range protein contact-map predictions starting from primary sequences, which are critical for constructing 3D structure of proteins that lack homologous templates in the PDB library.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-atZB48ddiA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Simple choices (e.g., eating an apple vs. an orange) are made by integrating noisy evidence that is sampled over time and influenced by visual attention; as a result, fluctuations in visual attention can affect choices. But what determines what is fixated and when? To address this question, we model the decision process for simple choice as an information sampling problem, and approximate the optimal sampling policy. We find that it is optimal to sample from options whose value estimates are both high and uncertain. Furthermore, the optimal policy provides a reasonable account of fixations and choices in binary and trinary simple choice, as well as the differences between the two cases. Overall, the results show that the fixation process during simple choice is influenced dynamically by the value estimates computed during the decision process, in a manner consistent with optimal information sampling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/BVvh9Bu2Wfo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Full-length ribosome density prediction by a multi-input and multi-output model</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/W3wnbNjA264/article</link>

Translation elongation is regulated by a series of complicated mechanisms in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Although recent advance in ribosome profiling techniques has enabled one to capture the genome-wide ribosome footprints along transcripts at codon resolution, the regulatory codes of elongation dynamics are still not fully understood. Most of the existing computational approaches for modeling translation elongation from ribosome profiling data mainly focus on local contextual patterns, while ignoring the continuity of the elongation process and relations between ribosome densities of remote codons. Modeling the translation elongation process in full-length coding sequence (CDS) level has not been studied to the best of our knowledge. In this paper, we developed a deep learning based approach with a multi-input and multi-output framework, named RiboMIMO, for modeling the ribosome density distributions of full-length mRNA CDS regions. Through considering the underlying correlations in translation efficiency among neighboring and remote codons and extracting hidden features from the input full-length coding sequence, RiboMIMO can greatly outperform the state-of-the-art baseline approaches and accurately predict the ribosome density distributions along the whole mRNA CDS regions. In addition, RiboMIMO explores the contributions of individual input codons to the predictions of output ribosome densities, which thus can help reveal important biological factors influencing the translation elongation process. The analyses, based on our interpretable metric named codon impact score, not only identified several patterns consistent with the previously-published literatures, but also for the first time (to the best of our knowledge) revealed that the codons located at a long distance from the ribosomal A site may also have an association on the translation elongation rate. This finding of long-range impact on translation elongation velocity may shed new light on the regulatory mechanisms of protein synthesis. Overall, these results indicated that RiboMIMO can provide a useful tool for studying the regulation of translation elongation in the range of full-length CDS.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/W3wnbNjA264&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Understanding CRISPR-Cas systems—the adaptive defence mechanism that about half of bacterial species and most of archaea use to neutralise viral attacks—is important for explaining the biodiversity observed in the microbial world as well as for editing animal and plant genomes effectively. The CRISPR-Cas system learns from previous viral infections and integrates small pieces from phage genomes called spacers into the microbial genome. The resulting library of spacers collected in CRISPR arrays is then compared with the DNA of potential invaders. One of the most intriguing and least well understood questions about CRISPR-Cas systems is the distribution of spacers across the microbial population. Here, using empirical data, we show that the global distribution of spacer numbers in CRISPR arrays across multiple biomes worldwide typically exhibits scale-invariant power law behaviour, and the standard deviation is greater than the sample mean. We develop a mathematical model of spacer loss and acquisition dynamics which fits observed data from almost four thousand metagenomes well. In analogy to the classical ‘rich-get-richer’ mechanism of power law emergence, the rate of spacer acquisition is proportional to the CRISPR array size, which allows a small proportion of CRISPRs within the population to possess a significant number of spacers. Our study provides an alternative explanation for the rarity of all-resistant super microbes in nature and why proliferation of phages can be highly successful despite the effectiveness of CRISPR-Cas systems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0CkgBj4Sffc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Decades of reductionist approaches in biology have achieved spectacular progress, but the proliferation of subdisciplines, each with its own technical and social practices regarding data, impedes the growth of the multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches now needed to address pressing societal challenges. Data integration is key to a reintegrated biology able to address global issues such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and sustainable ecosystem management. We identify major challenges to data integration and present a vision for a “Data as a Service”-oriented architecture to promote reuse of data for discovery. The proposed architecture includes standards development, new tools and services, and strategies for career-development and sustainability.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/EWdKg4g1kPc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Dynamics of the cell fate specifications during female gametophyte development in &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;</title>

The female gametophytes of angiosperms contain cells with distinct functions, such as those that enable reproduction via pollen tube attraction and fertilization. Although the female gametophyte undergoes unique developmental processes, such as several rounds of nuclear division without cell plate formation and final cellularization, it remains unknown when and how the cell fate is determined during development. Here, we visualized the living dynamics of female gametophyte development and performed transcriptome analysis of individual cell types to assess the cell fate specifications in &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt;. We recorded time lapses of the nuclear dynamics and cell plate formation from the 1-nucleate stage to the 7-cell stage after cellularization using an in vitro ovule culture system. The movies showed that the nuclear division occurred along the micropylar–chalazal (distal–proximal) axis. During cellularization, the polar nuclei migrated while associating with the forming edge of the cell plate, and then, migrated toward each other to fuse linearly. We also tracked the gene expression dynamics and identified that the expression of &lt;i&gt;MYB98pro&lt;/i&gt;::&lt;i&gt;GFP–MYB98&lt;/i&gt;, a synergid-specific marker, was initiated just after cellularization in the synergid, egg, and central cells and was then restricted to the synergid cells. This indicated that cell fates are determined immediately after cellularization. Transcriptome analysis of the female gametophyte cells of the wild-type and &lt;i&gt;myb98&lt;/i&gt; mutant revealed that the &lt;i&gt;myb98&lt;/i&gt; synergid cells had egg cell–like gene expression profiles. Although in &lt;i&gt;myb98&lt;/i&gt;, egg cell–specific gene expression was properly initiated in the egg cells only after cellularization, but subsequently expressed ectopically in one of the 2 synergid cells. These results, together with the various initiation timings of the egg cell–specific genes, suggest complex regulation of the individual gametophyte cells, such as cellularization-triggered fate initiation, MYB98-dependent fate maintenance, cell morphogenesis, and organelle positioning. Our system of live-cell imaging and cell type–specific gene expression analysis provides insights into the dynamics and mechanisms of cell fate specifications in the development of female gametophytes in plants.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/wRlsggodHug&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Inhibition response function in patients with Parkinson's disease was improved by a training of time estimation, not distance estimation.

Abstract
Parkinson's disease (PD) impairs various cognitive functions, including time perception. Dysfunctional time perception in PD is poorly understood, and no study has investigated the rehabilitation of time perception in patients with PD. We aimed to induce the recovery of time perception in PD patients and investigated the potential relationship between recovery and cognitive functions/domains other than time perception. Sixty patients with PD (27 females) and 20 healthy controls (10 females) were recruited. The participants underwent a feedback training protocol for 4 weeks to improve the accuracy of subjective spatial distance or time duration using a ruler or stopwatch, respectively. They participated in three tests at weekly intervals, each comprising 10 types of cognitive tasks and assessments. After duration feedback training for 1 month, performance on the Go/No‐go task, Stroop task, and impulsivity assessment improved in patients with PD, while no effect was observed after distance feedback training. Additionally, the effect of training on duration production correlated with extended reaction time and improved accuracy in the Go/No‐go and Stroop tasks. These findings suggest that time perception is functionally linked to inhibitory systems. If the feedback training protocol can modulate and maintain time perception, it may improve various cognitive/psychiatric functions in patients with PD. It may also be useful in the treatment of diseases other than PD that cause dysfunctions in temporal processing.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: The beneficial role of the synthetic microneurotrophin BNN20 in a focal demyelination model</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24809?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>This study provides data showing the beneficial role of BNN20 during demyelination. Our results showed that BNN20 increases the number of mature OLs in the lesion site of the LPC‐induced demyelination mouse model, while it reduces astrocytic accumulation, leading to a faster remyelination process. It does not significantly alter OPC recruitment or microglia/macrophages accumulation. Furthermore, our in vitro studies showed that BNN20 acts directly on OLs by enhancing their maturation. In addition, BNN20 treatment increased the number of LPC‐treated mature OLs and this beneficial effect was TrkA‐dependent. Moreover, BNN20 reduces microglial activation and their transition to the pro‐inflammatory state upon LPS stimulation in vitro. In conclusion, our results indicate that BNN20 is a multifaceted agent against demyelinating conditions by being able to affect all glial populations.

Abstract
BNN20, a C17‐spiroepoxy derivative of the neurosteroid dehydroepiandrosterone, has been shown to exhibit strong neuroprotective properties but its role in glial populations has not been assessed. Our aim was to investigate the effect of BNN20 on glial populations by using in vitro and in vivo approaches, taking advantage of the well‐established lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)‐induced focal demyelination mouse model. Our in vivo studies, performed in male mice, showed that BNN20 treatment leads to an increased number of mature oligodendrocytes (OLs) in this model. It diminishes astrocytic accumulation during the demyelination phase leading to a faster remyelination process, while it does not affect oligodendrocyte precursor cell recruitment or microglia/macrophage accumulation. Additionally, our in vitro studies showed that BNN20 acts directly to OLs and enhances their maturation even after they were treated with LPC. This beneficial effect of BNN20 is mediated, primarily, through the neurotrophin receptor TrkA. In addition, BNN20 reduces microglial activation and their transition to their pro‐inflammatory state upon lipopolysaccharides stimulation in vitro. Taken together our results suggest that BNN20 could serve as an important molecule to develop blood–brain barrier‐permeable synthetic agonists of neurotrophin receptors that could reduce inflammation, protect and increase the number of functional OLs by promoting their differentiation/maturation.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
Astrocytes are closely associated with the regulation of synapse formation and function. In addition, astrocytes have been shown to block certain brain impairments, including synaptic damage from stroke and other diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Although astrocytes do not completely prevent synaptic damage, they appear to be protective and to restore synaptic function following damage. The purpose of this study is to discuss the role of astrocytes in synaptogenesis and synaptic damage in ischemic stroke. I detail the mechanism of action of the multiple factors secreted by astrocytes that are involved in synapse formation. In particular, I describe the characteristics and role in synapse formation of each secreted molecule related to synaptic structure and function. Furthermore, I discuss the effect of astrocytes on synaptogenesis and repair in ischemic stroke and in other CNS diseases. Astrocytes release molecules such as thrombospondin, hevin, secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine, etc., due to activation by ischemia to induce synaptic structure and function, an effect associated with protection of the brain from synaptic damage in ischemic stroke. In conclusion, I show that astrocytes may regulate synaptic transmission while having the potential to block and repair synaptic dysfunction in stroke‐associated brain damage.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24805?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Neurodegenerative disease (ND) may lead to aberrant changes in glycoenzymes, including glycosyltransferases and glycosidases, which further regulate the key ND‐related molecules, such as amyloid precursor protein, nicastrin, β‐site APP‐cleaving enzyme 1β‐site APP‐cleaving enzyme 1, a disintegrin and metallopeptidase domain 10 (ADAM10), neprilysin, etc.

Abstract
Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are incurable and can develop progressively debilitating disorders, including dementia and ataxias. Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease are the most common NDs that mainly affect the elderly people. There is an urgent need to develop new diagnostic tools so that patients can be accurately stratified at an early stage. As a common post‐translational modification, protein glycosylation plays a key role in physiological and pathological processes. The abnormal changes in glycosylation are associated with the altered biological pathways in NDs. The pathogenesis‐related proteins, like amyloid‐β and microtubule‐associated protein tau, have altered glycosylation. Importantly, specific glycosylation changes in cerebrospinal fluid, blood and urine are valuable for revealing neurodegeneration in the early stages. This review describes the emerging biomarkers based on glycoproteomics in NDs, highlighting the potential applications of glycoprotein biomarkers in the early detection of diseases, monitoring of the disease progression, and measurement of the therapeutic responses. The mass spectrometry‐based strategies for characterizing glycoprotein biomarkers are also introduced.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Exogenous lactate increases astrocyte morphological complexity and neurotrophic factor gene expression

Lactate alone did not cause synaptogenesis in cortex or striatum

Exogenous lactate did not improve motor learning on the accelerating rotarod



Abstract
l‐Lactate is an energetic and signaling molecule that may be produced through astrocyte‐specific aerobic glycolysis and is elevated in striatal muscle during intensive exercise. l‐Lactate has been shown to promote neurotrophic gene expression through astrocytes within the hippocampus, however, its role in neuroplasticity within the striatum remains unknown. This study sought to investigate the role of peripheral sources of l‐lactate in promoting astrocyte‐specific gene expression and morphology as well as its role in neuroplasticity within the striatum of healthy animals. Using in vitro primary astrocyte cell culture, administration of l‐lactate increased the expression of the neurotrophic factors Bdnf, Gdnf, Cntf, and the immediate early gene cFos. l‐Lactate's promotion of neurotrophic factor expression was mediated through the lactate receptor HCAR1 since application of the HCAR1 agonist 3,5‐DHBA also increased expression of Bdnf in primary astrocytes. Similar to our previous report demonstrating exercise‐induced changes in astrocytic structure within the striatum, l‐lactate administration to healthy mice led to increased astrocyte morphological complexity as well as astrocyte‐specific neurotrophic expression within the striatum. Our study failed to demonstrate an effect of peripheral l‐lactate on synaptogenesis or motor behavior. Insufficient levels and/or inadequate delivery of l‐lactate through regional cerebral blood flow within the striatum may account for the lack of these benefits. Taken together, these novel findings suggest a potential framework that links peripheral l‐lactate production within muscle and intensive exercise with neuroplasticity of specific brain regions through astrocytic function.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Inferences of glia‐mediated control in Caenorhabditis elegans</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24803?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>In this study we show that the invertebrate cephalic glia (CEPglia) are important regulators of complex behaviors. Caenorhabditis elegans CEPglia are similar to astrocytes and assist in temporally regulating bidirectional communication with neurons and non‐neuronal cells. Thus, CEPglia mediated signaling facilitates the fluent transition between independent behaviors in a complex motor program.

Abstract
Astrocytes modulate synaptic transmission; yet, it remains unclear how glia influence complex behaviors. Here, we explore the effects of Caenorhabditis elegans astrocyte‐like cephalic glia (CEPglia) and the glia‐specific bHLH transcription factor HLH‐17 on mating behavior and the defecation motor program (DMP). In C. elegans, male mating has been explicitly described through the male tail circuit and is characterized by coordination of multiple independent behaviors to ensure that copulation is achieved. Furthermore, the sex‐specific male mating circuitry shares similar components with the DMP, which is complex and rhythmic, and requires a fixed sequence of behaviors to be activated periodically. We found that loss of CEPglia reduced persistence in executing mating behaviors and hindered copulation, while males that lacked HLH‐17 demonstrated repetitive prodding behavior that increased the time spent in mating but did not hinder copulation. During the DMP, we found that posterior body wall contractions (pBocs) and enteric muscle contractions (EMCs) were differentially affected by loss of HLH‐17 or CEPglia in males and hermaphrodites. pBocs and EMCs required HLH‐17 activity in both sexes, whereas loss of CEPglia alone did not affect DMP in males. Our data suggest that CEPglia mediate complex behaviors by signaling to the GABAergic DVB neuron, and that HLH‐17 activity influences those discrete steps within those behaviors. Collectively, these data provide evidence of glia as a link in cooperative regulation of complex and rhythmic behavior that, in C. elegans links circuitry in the head and the tail.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24799?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Visuoperceptive deficits are frequently reported in severe alcohol use disorder (SAUD) and are considered as pervasive and persistent in time. While this topic of investigation has previously driven researchers' interest, far fewer studies have focused on visuoperception in SAUD since the ‘90s, leaving open central questions regarding the origin and implications of these deficits. To renew research in the field and provide a solid background to work upon, this paper reviews the neural correlates of visuoperception in SAUD, based on data from neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies. Results reveal structural and functional changes within the visual system but also in the connections between occipital and frontal areas. We highlight the lack of integration of these findings in the dominant models of vision which stress the dynamic nature of the visual system and consider the presence of both bottom‐up and top‐down cerebral mechanisms. Visuoperceptive changes are also discussed in the framework of long‐lasting debates regarding the influence of demographic and alcohol‐related factors, together stressing the presence of inter‐individual differences. Capitalizing on this review, we provide guidelines to inform future research, and ultimately improve clinical care.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>We show how mindfulness training changes functional connectivity in the right putamen, cerebellum, and insula, as well as effective connectivity in the anterior cingulate cortex, right cerebellum, and bilateral putamen. Results suggest a rearrangement of dorsal striatum functional and effective connectivity, with changes in cortico‐subcortical‐cerebellar modulatory dynamics.

Abstract
Mindfulness is a meditation practice frequently associated with changes in subjective evaluation of cognitive and sensorial experience, as well as with modifications of brain activity and morphometry. Aside from the anatomical localization of functional changes induced by mindfulness practice, little is known about changes in functional and effective functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) connectivity. Here we performed a connectivity fMRI analysis in a group of healthy individuals participating in an 8‐week mindfulness‐based stress reduction (MBSR) training program. Data from both a “mind‐wandering” and a “meditation” state were acquired before and after the MBSR course. Results highlighted decreased local connectivity after training in the right anterior putamen and insula during spontaneous mind‐wandering and the right cerebellum during the meditative state. A further effective connectivity analysis revealed (a) decreased modulation by the anterior cingulate cortex over the anterior portion of the putamen, and (b) a change in left and right posterior putamen excitatory input and inhibitory output with the cerebellum, respectively. Results suggest a rearrangement of dorsal striatum functional and effective connectivity in response to mindfulness practice, with changes in cortico‐subcortical‐cerebellar modulatory dynamics. Findings might be relevant for the understanding of widely documented mindfulness behavioral effects, especially those related to pain perception.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24795?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>We followed a group of older adults longitudinally (mean interval time of 53 months) and characterized changes in white matter structural brain networks. We found decreases in intra‐hemispheric connections alongside with increases in inter‐hemispheric connections (a) and decrease in connector‐hub inter‐modular connectivity and increase of detected provincial hubs (b).

Abstract
Normal aging is characterized by structural and functional changes in the brain contributing to cognitive decline. Structural connectivity (SC) describes the anatomical backbone linking distinct functional subunits of the brain and disruption of this communication is thought to be one of the potential contributors for the age‐related deterioration observed in cognition. Several studies already explored brain network's reorganization during aging, but most focused on average connectivity of the whole‐brain or in specific networks, such as the resting‐state networks. Here, we aimed to characterize longitudinal changes of white matter (WM) structural brain networks, through the identification of sub‐networks with significantly altered connectivity along time. Then, we tested associations between longitudinal changes in network connectivity and cognition. We also assessed longitudinal changes in topological properties of the networks. For this, older adults were evaluated at two timepoints, with a mean interval time of 52.8 months (SD = 7.24). WM structural networks were derived from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging, and cognitive status from neurocognitive testing. Our results show age‐related changes in brain SC, characterized by both decreases and increases in connectivity weight. Interestingly, decreases occur in intra‐hemispheric connections formed mainly by association fibers, while increases occur mostly in inter‐hemispheric connections and involve association, commissural, and projection fibers, supporting the last‐in‐first‐out hypothesis. Regarding topology, two hubs were lost, alongside with a decrease in connector‐hub inter‐modular connectivity, reflecting reduced integration. Simultaneously, there was an increase in the number of provincial hubs, suggesting increased segregation. Overall, these results confirm that aging triggers a reorganization of the brain structural network.</content:encoded>

This review summarizes how these systems are now being used to study disease processes from synaptic transmission to BBB breakdown, opening up new possibilities to model neurological diseases using human cells.

Abstract
Neurological disorders are the leading cause of disability and the second largest cause of death worldwide. Despite significant research efforts, neurology remains one of the most failure‐prone areas of drug development. The complexity of the human brain, boundaries to examining the brain directly in vivo, and the significant evolutionary gap between animal models and humans, all serve to hamper translational success. Recent advances in microfluidic in vitro models have provided new opportunities to study human cells with enhanced physiological relevance. The ability to precisely micro‐engineer cell‐scale architecture, tailoring form and function, has allowed for detailed dissection of cell biology using microphysiological systems (MPS) of varying complexities from single cell systems to “Organ‐on‐chip” models. Simplified neuronal networks have allowed for unique insights into neuronal transport and neurogenesis, while more complex 3D heterotypic cellular models such as neurovascular unit mimetics and “Organ‐on‐chip” systems have enabled new understanding of metabolic coupling and blood–brain barrier transport. These systems are now being developed beyond MPS toward disease specific micro‐pathophysiological systems, moving from “Organ‐on‐chip” to “Disease‐on‐chip.” This review gives an outline of current state of the art in microfluidic technologies for neurological disease research, discussing the challenges and limitations while highlighting the benefits and potential of integrating technologies. We provide examples of where such toolsets have enabled novel insights and how these technologies may empower future investigation into neurological diseases.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Activation response and functional connectivity change in rat cortex after bilateral transcranial direct current stimulation—An exploratory study</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24793?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Our study demonstrates that simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in rats is feasible with an MRI‐compatible electrode montage. We found that bilateral tDCS can locally modulate neural activity and functional connectivity in rat brain, while cortical functional connectivity is differentially affected under the tDCS cathode and anode.

Abstract
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique implicated as a promising adjunct therapy to improve motor function through the neuromodulation of brain networks. Particularly bilateral tDCS, which affects both hemispheres, may yield stronger effects on motor learning than unilateral stimulation. Therefore, the aim of this exploratory study was to develop an experimental model for simultaneous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and bilateral tDCS in rats, to measure instant and resultant effects of tDCS on network activity and connectivity. Naïve, male Sprague‐Dawley rats were divided into a tDCS (n = 7) and sham stimulation group (n = 6). Functional MRI data were collected during concurrent bilateral tDCS over the sensorimotor cortex, while resting‐state functional MRI and perfusion MRI were acquired directly before and after stimulation. Bilateral tDCS induced a hemodynamic activation response, reflected by a bilateral increase in blood oxygenation level‐dependent signal in different cortical areas, including the sensorimotor regions. Resting‐state functional connectivity within the cortical sensorimotor network decreased after a first stimulation session but increased after a second session, suggesting an interaction between multiple tDCS sessions. Perfusion MRI revealed no significant changes in cerebral blood flow after tDCS. Our exploratory study demonstrates successful application of an MRI‐compatible bilateral tDCS setup in an animal model. Our results indicate that bilateral tDCS can locally modulate neuronal activity and connectivity, which may underlie its therapeutic potential.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24792?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Our results show that high‐frequency repetitive magnetic stimulation (HF‐rMS) is a potential therapeutic approach to prevent the ischemic‐induced neuron loss, neurite degeneration and synaptic loss. Moreover, we show that the observed neuroprotective effects of HF‐rMS were dependent on astrocytes.

Abstract
After decades of effort, there are no effective clinical treatments to induce the recovery of ischemia‐injured tissues, and among the several strategies that have been explored, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has proven to be one of the most promising, with beneficial effects in limb motor function, aphasia, hemispatial neglect, or dysphagia. Despite the clinical evidences, little is known about the mechanisms underlying those effects. The present study aimed to explore the cellular and molecular effects of high‐frequency repetitive magnetic stimulation (HF‐rMS) on an in vitro model of ischemia. Using primary cortical cultures exposed to oxygen and glucose deprivation followed by reperfusion, we observed that HF‐rMS treatment prevents the ischemia‐induced neuronal death by 21.2%, and the neurite degeneration triggered by ischemia. Our results also demonstrate that with this treatment there is an increase of 89.2% on the number cells expressing ERK1/2, of 20.1% on the number of cells expressing c‐Fos, and a synaptogenic effect, through an increase of 62.9% in the number of synaptic puncta as well as of 49.4% in their intensity. Interestingly, our results indicate that astrocytes are crucial to the beneficial effects triggered by HF‐rMS after ischemia, thus suggesting a direct effect of HF‐rMS on these cells. The modulation of astrocytes with this non‐invasive brain stimulation technique is a promising approach to promote the recovery of ischemia‐induced injured tissues; however, it is essential to understand how these effects can be modulated in order to optimize the protocols and enhance the beneficial outcomes.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24791?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>This study provides data on how sensory inputs from the perineal region interact with sensorimotor circuits that generate locomotor‐like activity and reflexes from the foot in spinal cats. We observed that inputs from the perineal region facilitate spinal locomotor activity and modulate cutaneous reflexes.

Abstract
It is well known that mechanically stimulating the perineal region potently facilitates hindlimb locomotion and weight support in mammals with a spinal transection (spinal mammals). However, how perineal stimulation mediates this excitatory effect is poorly understood. We evaluated the effect of mechanically stimulating (vibration or pinch) the perineal region on ipsilateral (9–14 ms onset) and contralateral (14–18 ms onset) short‐latency cutaneous reflex responses evoked by electrically stimulating the superficial peroneal or distal tibial nerve in seven adult spinal cats where hindlimb movement was restrained. Cutaneous reflexes were evoked before, during, and after mechanical stimulation of the perineal region. We found that vibration or pinch of the perineal region effectively triggered rhythmic activity, ipsilateral and contralateral to nerve stimulation. When electrically stimulating nerves, adding perineal stimulation modulated rhythmic activity by decreasing cycle and burst durations and by increasing the amplitude of flexors and extensors. Perineal stimulation also disrupted the timing of the ipsilateral rhythm, which had been entrained by nerve stimulation. Mechanically stimulating the perineal region decreased ipsilateral and contralateral short‐latency reflex responses evoked by cutaneous inputs, a phenomenon we observed in muscles crossing different joints and located in different limbs. The results suggest that the excitatory effect of perineal stimulation on locomotion and weight support is mediated by increasing the excitability of central pattern‐generating circuitry and not by increasing excitatory inputs from cutaneous afferents of the foot. Our results are consistent with a state‐dependent modulation of reflexes by spinal interneuronal circuits.</content:encoded>

Additionally, relationships between resilience and pain‐related brain structure were indicated in the right amygdala, bilateral thalamus, and postcentral gyrus which differed by sex and ethnicity/race.

Abstract
Chronic musculoskeletal (MSK) pain is disabling to individuals and burdensome to society. A relationship between telomere length and resilience was reported in individuals with consideration for chronic pain intensity. While chronic pain associates with brain changes, little is known regarding the neurobiological interface of resilience. In a group of individuals with chronic MSK pain, we examined the relationships between a previously investigated resilience index, clinical pain and functioning measures, and pain‐related brain structures, with consideration for sex and ethnicity/race. A cross‐sectional analysis of 166 non‐Hispanic Black and non‐Hispanic White adults, 45–85 years of age with pain ≥ 1 body site (s) over the past 3 months was completed. Measures of clinical pain and functioning, biobehavioral and psychosocial resilience, and structural MRI were completed. Our findings indicate higher levels of resilience associate with lower levels of clinical pain and functional limitations. Significant associations between resilience, ethnicity/race, and/or sex, and pain‐related brain gray matter structure were demonstrated in the right amygdaloid complex, bilateral thalamus, and postcentral gyrus. Our findings provide compelling evidence that in order to decipher the neurobiological code of chronic pain and related protective factors, it will be important to improve how chronic pain is phenotyped; to include an equal representation of females in studies including analyses stratifying by sex, and to consider other sociodemographic factors.</content:encoded>

Nitric oxide (NO) is an important signaling molecule with many functions in the nervous system. Derived from the enzymatic conversion of arginine by several nitric oxide synthases (NOS), NO plays significant roles in neuronal developmental events such as the establishment of dendritic branching or arbors. A brief summary of the discovery, molecular biology, and chemistry of NO, and a description of important NO‐mediated signal transduction pathways with emphasis on the role for NO in the development of dendritic branching during neurodevelopment are presented. Important sex differences in neuronal nitric oxide synthase expression during neuronal development are considered. Finally, a survey of endogenous and exogenous substances that disrupt dendritic patterning is presented with particular emphasis on how these molecules may drive NO‐mediated sex differences in dendritic branching.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a severe neuropsychiatric complication of live cirrhosis. We identified the typical patterns of increased regional activity in the fronto‐striato‐cerebellar network and decreased activity in the visuo‐sensorimotor network and cingulate gyrus in HE patient.

Abstract
Neuropsychiatric deficits are common in patients with liver cirrhosis (LC), especially in those with hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Previous studies reveal abnormalities in brain activity underlying the neuropsychiatric deficits in LC patients; however, the results are inconsistent. We conducted a meta‐analysis of resting‐state functional magnetic resonance imaging studies using anisotropic effect‐size signed differential mapping software on LC patients to characterize the most consistent regional activity alterations, and to evaluate the potential effect of liver transplantation (LT) on brain function. Meta‐regression analyses were performed to explore the relationship between brain alterations and clinical variables. Compared with healthy controls, the typical patterns of increased regional activity in the fronto‐striato‐cerebellar network and decreased activity in the visuo‐sensorimotor network and cingulate gyrus were identified in LC patients, which remained significant in the subgroup meta‐analyses of minimal HE (MHE) and overt HE (OHE) patients. Functional deficits in the default mode network (DMN) were found in OHE patients compared with MHE patients. Ammonia level positively correlated with brain activity in the right middle temporal gyrus, and the completion time of number connection test A negatively correlated with brain activity in the left anterior cingulate gyrus. In addition, patients showed increased activity in the visuo‐sensorimotor network and precuneus after LT. Our study suggests that alterations in the fronto‐striato‐cerebellar and visuo‐sensorimotor networks may be the potential pathophysiological mechanisms underlying HE, and deficits in the DMN may indicate the progression of HE. LT may improve brain function in the visuo‐sensorimotor network. This study has registered in the PROSPERO (CRD42020212758).</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Deletion of BDNF in Pax2 Lineage-Derived Interneuron Precursors in the Hindbrain Hampers the Proportion of Excitation/Inhibition, Learning, and Behavior</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.642679</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Numerous studies indicate that deficits in the proper integration or migration of specific GABAergic precursor cells from the subpallium to the cortex can lead to severe cognitive dysfunctions and neurodevelopmental pathogenesis linked to intellectual disabilities. A different set of GABAergic precursors cells that express Pax2 migrate to hindbrain regions, targeting, for example auditory or somatosensory brainstem regions. We demonstrate that the absence of BDNF in Pax2-lineage descendants of Bdnf&lt;sup&gt;Pax2&lt;/sup&gt;KOs causes severe cognitive disabilities. In Bdnf&lt;sup&gt;Pax2&lt;/sup&gt;KOs, a normal number of parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PV-INs) was found in the auditory cortex (AC) and hippocampal regions, which went hand in hand with reduced PV-labeling in neuropil domains and elevated activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc/Arg3.1; here: Arc) levels in pyramidal neurons in these same regions. This immaturity in the inhibitory/excitatory balance of the AC and hippocampus was accompanied by elevated LTP, reduced (sound-induced) LTP/LTD adjustment, impaired learning, elevated anxiety, and deficits in social behavior, overall representing an autistic-like phenotype. Reduced tonic inhibitory strength and elevated spontaneous firing rates in dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) brainstem neurons in otherwise nearly normal hearing Bdnf&lt;sup&gt;Pax2&lt;/sup&gt;KOs suggests that diminished fine-grained auditory-specific brainstem activity has hampered activity-driven integration of inhibitory networks of the AC in functional (hippocampal) circuits. This leads to an inability to scale hippocampal post-synapses during LTP/LTD plasticity. BDNF in Pax2-lineage descendants in lower brain regions should thus be considered as a novel candidate for contributing to the development of brain disorders, including autism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: miR-214 Alleviates Ischemic Stroke-Induced Neuronal Death by Targeting DAPK1 in Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.649982</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke induces neuronal cell death and causes brain dysfunction. Preventing neuronal cell death after stroke is key to protecting the brain from stroke damage. Nevertheless, preventative measures and treatment strategies for stroke damage are scarce. Emerging evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in the pathogenesis of central nervous system (CNS) disorders and may serve as potential therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A photochemically induced thrombosis (PIT) mouse model was used as an ischemic stroke model. qRT-PCR was employed to assess changes in miRNAs in ischemic lesions of PIT-stroke mice and primary cultured neurons subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining was performed to evaluate brain infarction tissues in vivo. TUNEL staining was employed to assess neuronal death in vitro. Neurological scores and motor coordination were investigated to evaluate stroke damage, including neurological deficits and motor function.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;In vivo and in vitro results demonstrated that levels of miR-124 were significantly decreased following stroke, whereas changes in death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) levels exhibited the converse pattern. DAPK1 was identified as a direct target of miR-124. N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and OGD-induced neuronal death was rescued by miR-124 overexpression. Upregulation of miR-124 levels significantly improved PIT-stroke damage, including the overall neurological function in mice.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate the involvement of the miR-124/DAPK1 pathway in ischemic neuronal death. Our results highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting this pathway for ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Inflammatory Foreign Body Response Induced by Neuro-Implants in Rat Cortices Depleted of Resident Microglia by a CSF1R Inhibitor and Its Implications</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.646914</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Inflammatory encapsulation of implanted cortical-neuro-probes [the foreign body response (FBR)] severely limits their use in basic brain research and in clinical applications. A better understanding of the inflammatory FBR is needed to effectively mitigate these critical limitations. Combining the use of the brain permeant colony stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibitor PLX5622 and a perforated polyimide-based multielectrode array platform (PPMP) that can be sectioned along with the surrounding tissue, we examined the contribution of microglia to the formation of inflammatory FBR. To that end, we imaged the inflammatory processes induced by PPMP implantations after eliminating 89–94% of the cortical microglia by PLX5622 treatment. The observations showed that: (I) inflammatory encapsulation of implanted PPMPs proceeds by astrocytes in microglia-free cortices. The activated astrocytes adhered to the PPMP’s surfaces. This suggests that the roles of microglia in the FBR might be redundant. (II) PPMP implantation into control or continuously PLX5622-treated rats triggered a localized surge of microglia mitosis. The daughter cells that formed a “cloud” of short-lived (T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;/&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ 14 days) microglia around and in contact with the implant surfaces were PLX5622 insensitive. (III) Neuron degeneration by PPMP implantation and the ensuing recovery in time, space, and density progressed in a similar manner in the cortices following 89–94% depletion of microglia. This implies that microglia do not serve a protective role with respect to the neurons. (IV) Although the overall cell composition and dimensions of the encapsulating scar in PLX5622-treated rats differed from the controls, the recorded field potential (FP) qualities and yield were undistinguishable. This is accounted for by assuming that the FP amplitudes in the control and PLX5622-treated rats were related to the seal resistance formed at the interface between the adhering microglia and/or astrocytes and the PPMP platform rather than across the scar tissue. These observations suggest that the prevention of both astrocytes and microglia adhesion to the electrodes is required to improve FP recording quality and yield.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.645936</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;The efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in depression is nonuniform across patients. This study aims to determine whether baseline neuroimaging characters can provide a pretreatment predictive effect for rTMS.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Twenty-seven treatment-naive patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) were enrolled and scanned with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging. Clinical symptoms were assessed pre- and post-rTMS. Functional and structural connectivity between the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and bilateral insula were measured, and the connectivity strength in each modality was then correlated to the clinical efficacy of rTMS.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;When the coordinates of left DLPFC were located as a node in the central executive network, the clinical efficacy of rTMS was significantly correlated with the functional connectivity strength between left DLPFC and bilateral insula (left insula: r = 0.66; right insula: r = 0.65). The structural connectivity strength between the left DLPFC and left insular cortex also had a significantly positive correlation with symptom improvement (r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.458).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This study provides implications that rTMS might act more effectively when the pretreatment functional and structural connectivity between the insula and left DLPFC is stronger.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.629323</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Brain disorders are gradually becoming the leading cause of death worldwide. However, the lack of knowledge of brain disease’s underlying mechanisms and ineffective neuropharmacological therapy have led to further exploration of optimal treatments and brain monitoring techniques.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;This study aims to review the current state of brain disorders, which utilize transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) and daily usable noninvasive neuroimaging techniques. Furthermore, the second goal of this study is to highlight available gaps and provide a comprehensive guideline for further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;Method&lt;p&gt;A systematic search was conducted of the PubMed and Web of Science databases from January 2000 to October 2020 using relevant keywords. Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy were selected as noninvasive neuroimaging modalities. Nine brain disorders were investigated in this study, including Alzheimer’s disease, depression, autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, stroke, schizophrenia, and traumatic brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Sixty-seven studies (1,385 participants) were included for quantitative analysis. Most of the articles (82.6%) employed transcranial direct current stimulation as an intervention method with modulation parameters of 1 mA intensity (47.2%) for 16–20 min (69.0%) duration of stimulation in a single session (36.8%). The frontal cortex (46.4%) and the cerebral cortex (47.8%) were used as a neuroimaging modality, with the power spectrum (45.7%) commonly extracted as a quantitative EEG feature.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;An appropriate stimulation protocol applying tES as a therapy could be an effective treatment for cognitive and neurological brain disorders. However, the optimal tES criteria have not been defined; they vary across persons and disease types. Therefore, future work needs to investigate a closed-loop tES with monitoring by neuroimaging techniques to achieve personalized therapy for brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Manipulation of EGFR-Induced Signaling for the Recruitment of Quiescent Neural Stem Cells in the Adult Mouse Forebrain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.621076</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) is the principal neurogenic niche in the adult mammalian forebrain. Neural stem/progenitor cell (NSPC) activity within the V-SVZ is controlled by numerous of extrinsic factors, whose downstream effects on NSPC proliferation, survival and differentiation are transduced via a limited number of intracellular signaling pathways. Here, we investigated the relationship between age-related changes in NSPC output and activity of signaling pathways downstream of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a major regulator of NSPC activity. Biochemical experiments indicated that age-related decline of NSPC activity in vivo is accompanied by selective deficits amongst various EGFR-induced signal pathways within the V-SVZ niche. Pharmacological loss-of-function signaling experiments with cultured NSPCs revealed both overlap and selectivity in the biological functions modulated by the EGFR-induced PI3K/AKT, MEK/ERK and mTOR signaling modules. Specifically, while all three modules promoted EGFR-mediated NSPC proliferation, only mTOR contributed to NSPC survival and only MEK/ERK repressed NSPC differentiation. Using a gain-of-function in vivo genetic approach, we electroporated a constitutively active EGFR construct into a subpopulation of quiescent, EGFR-negative neural stem cells (qNSCs); this ectopic activation of EGFR signaling enabled qNSCs to divide in 3-month-old early adult mice, but not in mice at middle-age or carrying familial Alzheimer disease mutations. Thus, (i) individual EGFR-induced signaling pathways have dissociable effects on NSPC proliferation, survival, and differentiation, (ii) activation of EGFR signaling is sufficient to stimulate qNSC cell cycle entry during early adulthood, and (iii) the proliferative effects of EGFR-induced signaling are dominantly overridden by anti-proliferative signals associated with aging and Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Comparative Effects of Event Detection Methods on the Analysis and Interpretation of Ca2+ Imaging Data</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.620869</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Calcium imaging has gained substantial popularity as a tool to profile the activity of multiple simultaneously active cells at high spatiotemporal resolution. Among the diverse approaches to processing of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging data is an often subjective decision of how to quantify baseline fluorescence or F&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. We examine the effect of popular F&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; determination methods on the interpretation of neuronal and astrocyte activity in a single dataset of rats trained to self-administer intravenous infusions of cocaine and compare them with an F&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-independent wavelet ridgewalking event detection approach. We find that the choice of the processing method has a profound impact on the interpretation of widefield imaging results. All of the dF/F&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; thresholding methods tended to introduce spurious events and fragment individual transients, leading to smaller calculated event durations and larger event frequencies. Analysis of simulated datasets confirmed these observations and indicated substantial intermethod variability as to the events classified as significant. Additionally, most dF/F&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; methods on their own were unable to adequately account for bleaching of fluorescence, although the F&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; smooth approach and the wavelet ridgewalking algorithm both did so. In general, the choice of the processing method led to dramatically different quantitative and sometimes opposing qualitative interpretations of the effects of cocaine self-administration both at the level of individual cells and at the level of cell networks. Significantly different distributions of event duration, amplitude, frequency, and network measures were found across the majority of dF/F&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; approaches. The wavelet ridgewalking algorithm broadly outperformed dF/F&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-based methods for both neuron and astrocyte recordings. These results indicate the need for heightened awareness of the limitations and tendencies associated with decisions to use particular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; image processing pipelines. Both quantification and interpretation of the effects of experimental manipulations are strongly sensitive to such decisions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: PIRACY: An Optimized Pipeline for Functional Connectivity Analysis in the Rat Brain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.602170</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is a widespread and powerful tool for investigating functional connectivity (FC) and brain disorders. However, FC analysis can be seriously affected by random and structured noise from non-neural sources, such as physiology. Thus, it is essential to first reduce thermal noise and then correctly identify and remove non-neural artifacts from rs-fMRI signals through optimized data processing methods. However, existing tools that correct for these effects have been developed for human brain and are not readily transposable to rat data. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to establish a data processing pipeline that can robustly remove random and structured noise from rat rs-fMRI data. It includes a novel denoising approach based on the Marchenko-Pastur Principal Component Analysis (MP-PCA) method, FMRIB’s ICA-based Xnoiseifier (FIX) for automatic artifact classification and cleaning, and global signal regression (GSR). Our results show that: (I) MP-PCA denoising substantially improves the temporal signal-to-noise ratio, (II) the pre-trained FIX classifier achieves a high accuracy in artifact classification, and (III) both independent component analysis (ICA) cleaning and GSR are essential steps in correcting for possible artifacts and minimizing the within-group variability in control animals while maintaining typical connectivity patterns. Reduced within-group variability also facilitates the exploration of potential between-group FC changes, as illustrated here in a rat model of sporadic Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recently, some studies revealed that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) reduces dual-task interference. Since there are countless combinations of dual-tasks, it remains unclear whether stable effects by tDCS can be observed on dual-task interference. An aim of the present study was to investigate whether the effects of tDCS on dual-task interference change depend on the dual-task content. We adopted two combinations of dual-tasks, i.e., a word task while performing a tandem task (word-tandem dual-task) and a classic Stroop task while performing a tandem task (Stroop-tandem dual-task). We expected that the Stroop task would recruit the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and require involvement of executive function to greater extent than the word task. Subsequently, we hypothesized that anodal tDCS over the DLPFC would improve executive function and result in more effective reduction of dual-task interference in the Stroop-tandem dual-task than in the word-tandem dual-task. Anodal or cathodal tDCS was applied over the DLPFC or the supplementary motor area using a constant current of 2.0 mA for 20 min. According to our results, dual-task interference and the task performances of each task under the single-task condition were not changed after applying any settings of tDCS. However, anodal tDCS over the left DLPFC significantly improved the word task performance immediately after tDCS under the dual-task condition. Our findings suggested that the effect of anodal tDCS over the left DLPFC varies on the task performance under the dual-task condition was changed depending on the dual-task content.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Differential Effects of Physical and Social Enriched Environment on Angiogenesis in Male Rats After Cerebral Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.622911</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Different housing conditions, including housing space and the physiological and social environment, may affect rodent behavior. Here, we examined the effects of different housing conditions on post-stroke angiogenesis and functional recovery to clarify the ambiguity about environmental enrichment and its components. Male rats in the model groups underwent right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by reperfusion. The MCAO rats were divided into four groups: the physical enrichment (PE) group, the social enrichment (SE) group, the combined physical and social enrichment (PSE) group and the ischemia/reperfusion + standard conditioning (IS) group. The rats in the sham surgery (SS) group were housed under standard conditions. In a set of behavioral tests, including the modified Neurological Severity Score (mNSS), rotarod test, and adhesive removal test, we demonstrated that the animals in the enriched condition groups exhibited significantly improved neurological functions compared to those in the standard housing group. Smaller infarction volumes were observed in the animals of the PSE group by MRI detection. The enriched conditions increased the microvessel density (MVD) in the ischemic boundary zone, as revealed by CD31 immunofluorescent staining. The immunochemical and q-PCR results further showed that environmental enrichment increased the expression levels of angiogenic factors after ischemia/reperfusion injury. Our data suggest that all three enrichment conditions promoted enhanced angiogenesis and functional recovery after ischemia/reperfusion injury compared to the standard housing, while only exposure to the combination of both physical and social enrichment yielded optimal benefits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Phase–Amplitude Coupling, Mental Health and Cognition: Implications for Adolescence</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.622313</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Identifying biomarkers of developing mental disorder is crucial to improving early identification and treatment—a key strategy for reducing the burden of mental disorders. Cross-frequency coupling between two different frequencies of neural oscillations is one such promising measure, believed to reflect synchronization between local and global networks in the brain. Specifically, in adults phase–amplitude coupling (PAC) has been shown to be involved in a range of cognitive processes, including working and long-term memory, attention, language, and fluid intelligence. Evidence suggests that increased PAC mediates both temporary and lasting improvements in working memory elicited by transcranial direct-current stimulation and reductions in depressive symptoms after transcranial magnetic stimulation. Moreover, research has shown that abnormal patterns of PAC are associated with depression and schizophrenia in adults. PAC is believed to be closely related to cortico-cortico white matter (WM) microstructure, which is well established in the literature as a structural mechanism underlying mental health. Some cognitive findings have been replicated in adolescents and abnormal patterns of PAC have also been linked to ADHD in young people. However, currently most research has focused on cross-sectional adult samples. Whereas initial hypotheses suggested that PAC was a state-based measure due to an early focus on cognitive, task-based research, current evidence suggests that PAC has both state-based and stable components. Future longitudinal research focusing on PAC throughout adolescent development could further our understanding of the relationship between mental health and cognition and facilitate the development of new methods for the identification and treatment of youth mental health.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Effect of GLT-1 Upregulation on Extracellular Glutamate Dynamics</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.661412</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Pharmacological upregulation of glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1), commonly achieved using the beta-lactam antibiotic ceftriaxone, represents a promising therapeutic strategy to accelerate glutamate uptake and prevent excitotoxic damage in neurological conditions. While excitotoxicity is indeed implicated in numerous brain diseases, it is typically restricted to select vulnerable brain regions, particularly in early disease stages. In healthy brain tissue, the speed of glutamate uptake is not constant and rather varies in both an activity- and region-dependent manner. Despite the widespread use of ceftriaxone in disease models, very little is known about how such treatments impact functional measures of glutamate uptake in healthy tissue, and whether GLT-1 upregulation can mask the naturally occurring activity-dependent and regional heterogeneities in uptake. Here, we used two different compounds, ceftriaxone and LDN/OSU-0212320 (LDN), to upregulate GLT-1 in healthy wild-type mice. We then used real-time imaging of the glutamate biosensor iGluSnFR to investigate functional consequences of GLT-1 upregulation on activity- and regional-dependent variations in glutamate uptake capacity. We found that while both ceftriaxone and LDN increased GLT-1 expression in multiple brain regions, they did not prevent activity-dependent slowing of glutamate clearance nor did they speed basal clearance rates, even in areas characterized by slow uptake (e.g., striatum). Unexpectedly, ceftriaxone but not LDN decreased glutamate release in the cortex, suggesting that ceftriaxone may alter release properties independent of its effects on GLT-1 expression. In sum, our data demonstrate the complexities of glutamate uptake by showing that GLT-1 expression does not necessarily translate to accelerated uptake. Furthermore, these data suggest that the mechanisms underlying activity- and regional-dependent differences in glutamate dynamics are independent of GLT-1 expression levels.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Phosphoinositides: Roles in the Development of Microglial-Mediated Neuroinflammation and Neurodegeneration</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.652593</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microglia are increasingly recognized as vital players in the pathology of a variety of neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimer’s (AD) and Parkinson’s (PD) disease. While microglia have a protective role in the brain, their dysfunction can lead to neuroinflammation and contributes to disease progression. Also, a growing body of literature highlights the seven phosphoinositides, or PIPs, as key players in the regulation of microglial-mediated neuroinflammation. These small signaling lipids are phosphorylated derivates of phosphatidylinositol, are enriched in the brain, and have well-established roles in both homeostasis and disease.Disrupted PIP levels and signaling has been detected in a variety of dementias. Moreover, many known AD disease modifiers identified via genetic studies are expressed in microglia and are involved in phospholipid metabolism. One of these, the enzyme PLCγ2 that hydrolyzes the PIP species PI(4,5)P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, displays altered expression in AD and PD and is currently being investigated as a potential therapeutic target.Perhaps unsurprisingly, neurodegenerative conditions exhibiting PIP dyshomeostasis also tend to show alterations in aspects of microglial function regulated by these lipids. In particular, phosphoinositides regulate the activities of proteins and enzymes required for endocytosis, toll-like receptor signaling, purinergic signaling, chemotaxis, and migration, all of which are affected in a variety of neurodegenerative conditions. These functions are crucial to allow microglia to adequately survey the brain and respond appropriately to invading pathogens and other abnormalities, including misfolded proteins. AD and PD therapies are being developed to target many of the above pathways, and although not yet investigated, simultaneous PIP manipulation might enhance the beneficial effects observed. Currently, only limited therapeutics are available for dementia, and although these show some benefits for symptom severity and progression, they are far from curative. Given the importance of microglia and PIPs in dementia development, this review summarizes current research and asks whether we can exploit this information to design more targeted, or perhaps combined, dementia therapeutics. More work is needed to fully characterize the pathways discussed in this review, but given the strength of the current literature, insights in this area could be invaluable for the future of neurodegenerative disease research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Role of Inflammation and Infection in Age-Related Neurodegenerative Diseases: Lessons From Bacterial Meningitis Applied to Alzheimer Disease and Age-Related Macular Degeneration</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.635486</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Age-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer disease (AD) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD), are multifactorial and have diverse genetic and environmental risk factors. Despite the complex nature of the diseases, there is long-standing, and growing, evidence linking microbial infection to the development of AD dementia, which we summarize in this article. Also, we highlight emerging research findings that support a role for parainfection in the pathophysiology of AMD, a disease of the neurosensory retina that has been shown to share risk factors and pathological features with AD. Acute neurological infections, such as Bacterial Meningitis (BM), trigger inflammatory events that permanently change how the brain functions, leading to lasting cognitive impairment. Neuroinflammation likewise is a known pathological event that occurs in the early stages of chronic age-related neurodegenerative diseases AD and AMD and might be triggered as a parainfectious event. To date, at least 16 microbial pathogens have been linked to the development of AD; on the other hand, investigation of a microbe-AMD relationship is in its infancy. This mini-review article provides a synthesis of existing evidence indicating a contribution of parainfection in the aetiology of AD and of emerging findings that support a similar process in AMD. Subsequently, it describes the major immunopathological mechanisms that are common to BM and AD/AMD. Together, this evidence leads to our proposal that both AD and AMD may have an infectious aetiology that operates through a dysregulated inflammatory response, leading to deleterious outcomes. Last, it draws fresh insights from the existing literature about potential therapeutic options for BM that might alleviate neurological disruption associated with infections, and which could, by extension, be explored in the context of AD and AMD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Glial Cell-Based Vascular Mechanisms and Transplantation Therapies in Brain Vessel and Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.627682</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) with severe neurological/psychiatric symptoms, such as cerebrovascular pathology in AD, CAA, and chronic stroke, have brought greater attention with their incidence and prevalence having markedly increased over the past few years. Causes of the significant neuropathologies, especially those observed in neurological diseases in the CNS, are commonly believed to involve multiple factors such as an age, a total environment, genetics, and an immunity contributing to their progression, neuronal, and vascular injuries. We primarily focused on the studies of glial involvement/dysfunction in part with the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the neurovascular unit (NVU) changes, and the vascular mechanisms, which have been both suggested as critical roles in chronic stroke and many other NDDs. It has been noted that glial cells including astrocytes (which outnumber other cell types in the CNS) essentially contribute more to the BBB integrity, extracellular homeostasis, neurotransmitter release, regulation of neurogenic niches in response to neuroinflammatory stimulus, and synaptic plasticity. In a recent study for NDDs utilizing cellular and molecular biology and genetic and pharmacological tools, the role of reactive astrocytes (RACs) and gliosis was demonstrated, able to trigger pathophysiological/psychopathological detrimental changes during the disease progression. We speculate, in particular, the BBB, the NVU, and changes of the astrocytes (potentially different populations from the RACs) not only interfere with neuronal development and synaptogenesis, but also generate oxidative damages, contribute to beta-amyloid clearances and disrupted vasculature, as well as lead to neuroinflammatory disorders. During the past several decades, stem cell therapy has been investigated with a research focus to target related neuro-/vascular pathologies (cell replacement and repair) and neurological/psychiatric symptoms (paracrine protection and homeostasis). Evidence shows that transplantation of neurogenic or vasculogenic cells could be achieved to pursue differentiation and maturation within the diseased brains as expected. It would be hoped that, via regulating functions of astrocytes, astrocytic involvement, and modulation of the BBB, the NVU and astrocytes should be among major targets for therapeutics against NDDs pathogenesis by drug and cell-based therapies. The non-invasive strategies in combination with stem cell transplantation such as the well-tested intranasal deliveries for drug and stem cells by our and many other groups show great translational potentials in NDDs. Neuroimaging and clinically relevant analyzing tools need to be evaluated in various NDDs brains.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;There is a critical need to establish genetic markers that explain the complex phenotypes and pathogenicity of ALS. This study identified a polymorphism in the Stathmin-2 gene and investigated its association with sporadic ALS (sALS) disease risk, age-of onset and survival duration.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The candidate CA repeat was systematically analyzed using PCR, Sanger sequencing and high throughput capillary separation for genotyping. Stathmin-2 expression was investigated using RT-PCR in patient olfactory neurosphere-derived (ONS) cells and RNA sequencing in laser-captured spinal motor neurons.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;In a case-control analysis of a combined North American sALS cohort (n = 321) and population control group (n = 332), long/long CA genotypes were significantly associated with disease risk (p = 0.042), and most strongly when one allele was a 24 CA repeat (p = 0.0023). In addition, longer CA allele length was associated with earlier age-of-onset (p = 0.039), and shorter survival duration in bulbar-onset cases (p = 0.006). In an Australian longitudinal sALS cohort (n = 67), ALS functional rating scale scores were significantly lower in carriers of the long/long genotype (p = 0.034). Stathmin-2 mRNA expression was reduced in sporadic patient ONS cells. Additionally, sALS patients and controls exhibited variable expression of Stathmin-2 mRNA according to CA genotype in laser-captured spinal motor neurons.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusions&lt;p&gt;We report a novel non-coding CA repeat in Stathmin-2 which is associated with sALS disease risk and has disease modifying effects. The potential value of this variant as a disease marker and tool for cohort enrichment in clinical trials warrants further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Factors Associated With the Dilation of Perivascular Space in Healthy Elderly Subjects</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.624732</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: The dilation of perivascular space (PVS) has been widely used to reflect brain degeneration in clinical brain imaging studies. However, PVS characteristics exhibit large differences in healthy subjects. Such variations need to be better addressed before PVS can be used to reflect pathological changes. In the present study, we aim to investigate the potential influence of several related factors on PVS dilation in healthy elderly subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: One-hundred and three subjects (mean age = 59.5) were retrospectively included from a prospectively collected community cohort. Multi-modal high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging and cognitive assessments were performed on each subject. Machine-learning based segmentation methods were employed to quantify PVS volume and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume. Multiple regression analysis was performed to reveal the influence of demographic factors, vascular risk factors, intracranial volume (ICV), major brain artery diameters, and brain atrophy on PVS dilation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Multiple regression analysis showed that age was positively associated with the basal ganglia (BG) (standardized beta = 0.227, p = 0.027) and deep white matter (standardized beta = 0.220, p = 0.029) PVS volume. Hypertension was positively associated with deep white matter PVS volume (standardized beta = 0.234, p = 0.017). Furthermore, we found that ICV was strongly associated with the deep white matter PVS volume (standardized beta = 0.354, p &amp;lt; 0.001) while the intracranial artery diameter was negatively associated with the deep white matter PVS volume (standardized beta = −0.213, p = 0.032).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Intracranial volume has significant influence on deep white matter PVS volume. Future studies on PVS dilation should include ICV as an important covariate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Conversion of Reactive Astrocytes to Induced Neurons Enhances Neuronal Repair and Functional Recovery After Ischemic Stroke</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.612856</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The master neuronal transcription factor NeuroD1 can directly reprogram astrocytes into induced neurons (iNeurons) after stroke. Using viral vectors to drive ectopic ND1 expression in gliotic astrocytes after brain injury presents an autologous form of cell therapy for neurodegenerative disease. Cultured astrocytes transfected with ND1 exhibited reduced proliferation and adopted neuronal morphology within 2–3 weeks later, expressed neuronal/synaptic markers, and extended processes. Whole-cell recordings detected the firing of evoked action potentials in converted iNeurons. Focal ischemic stroke was induced in adult GFAP-Cre-Rosa-YFP mice that then received ND1 lentivirus injections into the peri-infarct region 7 days after stroke. Reprogrammed cells did not express stemness genes, while 2–6 weeks later converted cells were co-labeled with YFP (constitutively activated in astrocytes), mCherry (ND1 infection marker), and NeuN (mature neuronal marker). Approximately 66% of infected cells became NeuN-positive neurons. The majority (~80%) of converted cells expressed the vascular glutamate transporter (vGLUT) of glutamatergic neurons. ND1 treatment reduced astrogliosis, and some iNeurons located/survived inside of the savaged ischemic core. Western blotting detected higher levels of BDNF, FGF, and PSD-95 in ND1-treated mice. MultiElectrode Array (MEA) recordings in brain slices revealed that the ND1-induced reprogramming restored interrupted cortical circuits and synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, ND1 treatment significantly improved locomotor, sensorimotor, and psychological functions. Thus, conversion of endogenous astrocytes to neurons represents a plausible, on-site regenerative therapy for stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/o0EKUVEIM4M/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Amadeus Maes, Mauricio Barahona, Claudia Clopath&lt;/p&gt;

Sequential behaviour is often compositional and organised across multiple time scales: a set of individual elements developing on short time scales (motifs) are combined to form longer functional sequences (syntax). Such organisation leads to a natural hierarchy that can be used advantageously for learning, since the motifs and the syntax can be acquired independently. Despite mounting experimental evidence for hierarchical structures in neuroscience, models for temporal learning based on neuronal networks have mostly focused on serial methods. Here, we introduce a network model of spiking neurons with a hierarchical organisation aimed at sequence learning on multiple time scales. Using biophysically motivated neuron dynamics and local plasticity rules, the model can learn motifs and syntax independently. Furthermore, the model can relearn sequences efficiently and store multiple sequences. Compared to serial learning, the hierarchical model displays faster learning, more flexible relearning, increased capacity, and higher robustness to perturbations. The hierarchical model redistributes the variability: it achieves high motif fidelity at the cost of higher variability in the between-motif timings.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/o0EKUVEIM4M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/YoyRNaYW9uk/article</link>

Emergence of resistance to artemisinin and partner drugs in the Greater Mekong Subregion has made elimination of malaria from this region a global priority; it also complicates its achievement. Novel drug strategies such as triple artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) and chemoprophylaxis have been proposed to help limit resistance and accelerate elimination. The objective of this study was to better understand the potential impacts of triple ACTs and chemoprophylaxis, using a mathematical model parameterized using data from Cambodia. We used a simple compartmental model to predict trends in malaria incidence and resistance in Cambodia from 2020–2025 assuming no changes in transmission since 2018. We assessed three scenarios: a status quo scenario with artesunate-mefloquine (ASMQ) as treatment; a triple ACT scenario with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) plus mefloquine (MQ) as treatment; and a chemoprophylaxis scenario with ASMQ as treatment plus DP as chemoprophylaxis. We predicted MQ resistance to increase under the status quo scenario. Triple ACT treatment reversed the spread of MQ resistance, but had no impact on overall malaria incidence. Joint MQ-PPQ resistance declined under the status quo scenario for the baseline parameter set and most sensitivity analyses. Compared to the status quo, triple ACT treatment limited spread of MQ resistance but also slowed declines in PPQ resistance in some sensitivity analyses. The chemoprophylaxis scenario decreased malaria incidence, but increased the spread of strains resistant to both MQ and PPQ; both effects began to reverse after the intervention was removed. We conclude that triple ACTs may limit spread of MQ resistance in the Cambodia, but would have limited impact on malaria incidence and might slow declines in PPQ resistance. Chemoprophylaxis could have greater impact on incidence but also carries higher risks of resistance. Aggressive strategies to limit transmission the GMS are needed to achieve elimination goals, but any intervention should be accompanied by monitoring for drug resistance.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YoyRNaYW9uk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Analysis of spiking synchrony in visual cortex reveals distinct types of top-down modulation signals for spatial and object-based attention</title>

The activity of a border ownership selective (BOS) neuron indicates where a foreground object is located relative to its (classical) receptive field (RF). A population of BOS neurons thus provides an important component of perceptual grouping, the organization of the visual scene into objects. In previous theoretical work, it has been suggested that this grouping mechanism is implemented by a population of dedicated grouping (“&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;”) cells that integrate the activity of the distributed feature cells representing an object and, by feedback, modulate the same cells, thus making them border ownership selective. The feedback modulation by &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt; cells is thought to also provide the mechanism for object-based attention. A recent modeling study showed that modulatory common feedback, implemented by synapses with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptors, accounts for the experimentally observed synchrony in spike trains of BOS neurons and the shape of cross-correlations between them, including its dependence on the attentional state. However, that study was limited to pairs of BOS neurons with consistent border ownership preferences, defined as two neurons tuned to respond to the same visual object, in which attention decreases synchrony. But attention has also been shown to increase synchrony in neurons with inconsistent border ownership selectivity. Here we extend the computational model from the previous study to fully understand these effects of attention. We postulate the existence of a second type of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;-cell that represents spatial attention by modulating the activity of all BOS cells in a spatially defined area. Simulations of this model show that a combination of spatial and object-based mechanisms fully accounts for the observed pattern of synchrony between BOS neurons. Our results suggest that modulatory feedback from &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;-cells may underlie both spatial and object-based attention.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CgXngfJWR94&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Adaptive immune system uses T cell receptors (TCRs) to recognize pathogens and to consequently initiate immune responses. TCRs can be sequenced from individuals and methods analyzing the specificity of the TCRs can help us better understand individuals’ immune status in different disorders. For this task, we have developed TCRGP, a novel Gaussian process method that predicts if TCRs recognize specified epitopes. TCRGP can utilize the amino acid sequences of the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from TCR&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt; and TCR&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; chains and learn which CDRs are important in recognizing different epitopes. Our comprehensive evaluation with epitope-specific TCR sequencing data shows that TCRGP achieves on average higher prediction accuracy in terms of AUROC score than existing state-of-the-art methods in epitope-specificity predictions. We also propose a novel analysis approach for combined single-cell RNA and TCR&lt;i&gt;αβ&lt;/i&gt; (scRNA+TCR&lt;i&gt;αβ&lt;/i&gt;) sequencing data by quantifying epitope-specific TCRs with TCRGP and identify HBV-epitope specific T cells and their transcriptomic states in hepatocellular carcinoma patients.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8iIAurtMVdo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The sequences of antibodies from a given repertoire are highly diverse at few sites located on the surface of a genome-encoded larger scaffold. The scaffold is often considered to play a lesser role than highly diverse, non-genome-encoded sites in controlling binding affinity and specificity. To gauge the impact of the scaffold, we carried out quantitative phage display experiments where we compare the response to selection for binding to four different targets of three different antibody libraries based on distinct scaffolds but harboring the same diversity at randomized sites. We first show that the response to selection of an antibody library may be captured by two measurable parameters. Second, we provide evidence that one of these parameters is determined by the degree of affinity maturation of the scaffold, affinity maturation being the process by which antibodies accumulate somatic mutations to evolve towards higher affinities during the natural immune response. In all cases, we find that libraries of antibodies built around maturated scaffolds have a lower response to selection to other arbitrary targets than libraries built around germline-based scaffolds. We thus propose that germline-encoded scaffolds have a higher selective potential than maturated ones as a consequence of a selection for this potential over the long-term evolution of germline antibody genes. Our results are a first step towards quantifying the evolutionary potential of biomolecules.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v-hP1PT8o8s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: The mouth matters most: A functional magnetic resonance imaging study of how dogs perceive inanimate objects</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25142?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Prichard et al. examined dogs' perception of real‐world objects using awake, unrestrained fMRI. Using the same video stimuli and real‐world objects, they identified object‐selective regions of the dog brain. Object regions of the dog brain responded more to objects associated with a mouth action than objects associated with a paw action. Somatosensory cortex was active during dogs' anticipation of performing a mouth action on an object. This suggests that dogs' perception of objects depends on how dogs expect to interact with them.







Abstract
The perception and representation of objects in the world are foundational to all animals. The relative importance of objects' physical properties versus how the objects are interacted with continues to be debated. Neural evidence in humans and nonhuman primates suggests animate‐inanimate and face‐body dimensions of objects are represented in the temporal cortex. However, because primates have opposable thumbs and interact with objects in similar ways, the question remains as to whether this similarity represents the evolution of a common cognitive process or whether it reflects a similarity of physical interaction. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in dogs to test whether the type of interaction affects object processing in an animal that interacts primarily with its mouth. In Study 1, we identified object‐processing regions of cortex by having dogs passively view movies of faces and objects. In Study 2, dogs were trained to interact with two new objects with either the mouth or the paw. Then, we measured responsivity in the object regions to the presentation of these objects. Mouth‐objects elicited significantly greater activity in object regions than paw‐objects. Mouth‐objects were also associated with activity in somatosensory cortex, suggesting dogs were anticipating mouthing interactions. These findings suggest that object perception in dogs is affected by how dogs expect to interact with familiar objects.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Efferent projections of CGRP/Calca‐expressing parabrachial neurons in mice</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25136?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
The parabrachial nucleus (PB) is composed of glutamatergic neurons at the midbrain–hindbrain junction. These neurons form many subpopulations, one of which expresses Calca, which encodes the neuropeptide calcitonin gene‐related peptide (CGRP). This Calca‐expressing subpopulation has been implicated in a variety of homeostatic functions, but the overall distribution of Calca‐expressing neurons in this region remains unclear. Also, while previous studies in rats and mice have identified output projections from CGRP‐immunoreactive or Calca‐expressing neurons, we lack a comprehensive understanding of their efferent projections. We began by identifying neurons with Calca mRNA and CGRP immunoreactivity in and around the PB, including populations in the locus coeruleus and motor trigeminal nucleus. Calca‐expressing neurons in the PB prominently express the mu opioid receptor (Oprm1) and are distinct from neighboring neurons that express Foxp2 and Pdyn. Next, we used Cre‐dependent anterograde tracing with synaptophysin‐mCherry to map the efferent projections of these neurons. Calca‐expressing PB neurons heavily target subregions of the amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, basal forebrain, thalamic intralaminar and ventral posterior parvicellular nuclei, and hindbrain, in different patterns depending on the injection site location within the PB region. Retrograde axonal tracing revealed that the previously unreported hindbrain projections arise from a rostral‐ventral subset of CGRP/Calca neurons. Finally, we show that these efferent projections of Calca‐expressing neurons are distinct from those of neighboring PB neurons that express Pdyn. This information provides a detailed neuroanatomical framework for interpreting experimental work involving CGRP/Calca‐expressing neurons and opioid action in the PB region.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Distinct burst properties contribute to the functional diversity of thalamic nuclei</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25141?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>We used intracellular recordings from six thalamic nuclei and compartmental models to investigate the properties of rebound bursts in first‐order (FO) and higher‐order (HO) nuclei and the implications of burst properties for thalamocortical transmission and oscillatory bursting. We found that:







Bursts had distinct properties in FO neurons: dLGN had bursts with few spikes/burst (S; figure shows averages) and relatively long latencies to the first spike (L; in ms); bursts in vMGB and VP had shorter latencies, but bursts in VP had more spikes/burst. HO cells had consistent burst properties across sensory modalities; on average, HO neurons had more spikes per burst and longer latencies than FO.
The number of spikes/burst and latency determine different release probabilities and the effectiveness of transmission at thalamocortical synapses.
The latency to burst limits the oscillatory frequency of rebound bursting to about 15 Hz in most FO neurons and to 10 Hz or less in many HO cells.


Abstract
Thalamic neurons fire spikes in two modes, burst and tonic. The function of burst firing is unclear, but the evidence suggests that bursts are more effective at activating cortical cells, and that postinhibition rebound bursting contributes to thalamocortical oscillations during sleep. Bursts are considered stereotyped signals; however, there is limited evidence regarding how burst properties compare across thalamic nuclei of different functional or anatomical organization. Here, we used whole‐cell patch clamp recordings and compartmental modeling to investigate the properties of bursts in six sensory thalamic nuclei, to study the mechanisms that can lead to different burst properties, and to assess the implications of different burst properties for thalamocortical transmission and oscillatory functions. We found that bursts in higher‐order cells on average had higher number of spikes and longer latency to the first spike. Additionally, burst features in first‐order neurons were determined by sensory modality. Shifting the voltage‐dependence and density of the T‐channel conductance in a compartmental model replicates the burst properties from the intracellular recordings, pointing to molecular mechanisms that can generate burst diversity. Furthermore, the model predicts that bursts with higher number of spikes will drastically reduce the effectiveness of thalamocortical transmission. In addition, the latency to burst limited the rebound oscillatory frequency in modeled cells. These results demonstrate that burst properties vary according to the thalamocortical hierarchy and with sensory modality. The findings imply that, while in burst mode, thalamocortical transmission and firing frequency will be determined by the number of spikes and latency to burst.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: A Novel Brain MRI Image Segmentation Method Using an Improved Multi-View Fuzzy c-Means Clustering Algorithm</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.662674</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: The brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image segmentation method mainly refers to the division of brain tissue, which can be divided into tissue parts such as white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The segmentation results can provide a basis for medical image registration, 3D reconstruction, and visualization. Generally, MRI images have defects such as partial volume effects, uneven grayscale, and noise. Therefore, in practical applications, the segmentation of brain MRI images has difficulty obtaining high accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials and Methods: The fuzzy clustering algorithm establishes the expression of the uncertainty of the sample category and can describe the ambiguity brought by the partial volume effect to the brain MRI image, so it is very suitable for brain MRI image segmentation (B-MRI-IS). The classic fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm is extremely sensitive to noise and offset fields. If the algorithm is used directly to segment the brain MRI image, the ideal segmentation result cannot be obtained. Accordingly, considering the defects of MRI medical images, this study uses an improved multiview FCM clustering algorithm (IMV-FCM) to improve the algorithm’s segmentation accuracy of brain images. IMV-FCM uses a view weight adaptive learning mechanism so that each view obtains the optimal weight according to its cluster contribution. The final division result is obtained through the view ensemble method. Under the view weight adaptive learning mechanism, the coordination between various views is more flexible, and each view can be adaptively learned to achieve better clustering effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The segmentation results of a large number of brain MRI images show that IMV-FCM has better segmentation performance and can accurately segment brain tissue. Compared with several related clustering algorithms, the IMV-FCM algorithm has better adaptability and better clustering performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain computer interaction (BCI) based on EEG can help patients with limb dyskinesia to carry out daily life and rehabilitation training. However, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio and large individual differences, EEG feature extraction and classification have the problems of low accuracy and efficiency. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a recognition method of motor imagery EEG signal based on deep convolution network. This method firstly aims at the problem of low quality of EEG signal characteristic data, and uses short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and continuous Morlet wavelet transform (CMWT) to preprocess the collected experimental data sets based on time series characteristics. So as to obtain EEG signals that are distinct and have time-frequency characteristics. And based on the improved CNN network model to efficiently recognize EEG signals, to achieve high-quality EEG feature extraction and classification. Further improve the quality of EEG signal feature acquisition, and ensure the high accuracy and precision of EEG signal recognition. Finally, the proposed method is validated based on the BCI competiton dataset and laboratory measured data. Experimental results show that the accuracy of this method for EEG signal recognition is 0.9324, the precision is 0.9653, and the AUC is 0.9464. It shows good practicality and applicability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

In this review we highlight these hurdles, broadly classified by concerns relating to clinical validity and analytical validity. After setting out an aspirational roadmap as to how many of these issues can be overcome, we conclude by sharing our vision of the current and future role of sNfL assays in MS clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.639646</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;To investigate whether different forms of α-synuclein (α-syn) proteins can induce inflammation and activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, we stimulated with monomeric or aggregated α-syn peripheral blood mononuclear cells of Parkinson disease (PD) patients and age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC). ASC-speck formation, i.e., the intracellular generation of functionally active inflammasome complexes, as well as the production of inflammasome-related [caspase-1, interleukin 1β (IL-18), and IL-1β], and pro–IL-6, or anti–IL-10 inflammatory cytokines were evaluated. Gastrointestinal permeability, suggested to be altered in PD, was also investigated by measuring plasma concentration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and I-FABP (fatty acid–binding protein). ASC-speck expression, as well as IL-18 and caspase-1 production and LPS and I-FABP plasma concentration, was comparable in PD and HC, indicating that α-syn does not stimulate the NLRP3 inflammasome and that PD does not associate with alterations of intestinal permeability. Interestingly, though, IL-1β and IL-6 production was increased, whereas that of IL-10 was reduced in α-syn–stimulated cells of PD compared to HC, suggesting that PD-associated neuroinflammation is not the consequence of the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome but rather of an imbalance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In a Mental Imagery Brain-Computer Interface the user has to perform a specific mental task that generates electroencephalography (EEG) components, which can be translated in commands to control a BCI system. The development of a high-performance MI-BCI requires a long training, lasting several weeks or months, in order to improve the ability of the user to manage his/her mental tasks. This works aims to present the design of a MI-BCI combining mental imaginary and cognitive tasks for a severely motor impaired user, involved in the BCI race of the Cybathlon event, a competition of people with severe motor disability. In the BCI-race, the user becomes a pilot in a virtual race game against up to three other pilots, in which each pilot has to control his/her virtual car by his/her mental tasks. We present all the procedures followed to realize an effective MI-BCI, from the user's first contact with a BCI technology to actually controlling a video-game through her EEG. We defined a multi-stage user-centered training protocol in order to successfully control a BCI, even in a stressful situation, such as that of a competition.

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.644892</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The global signal (GS), which was once regarded as a nuisance of functional magnetic resonance imaging, has been proven to convey valuable neural information. This raised the following question: what is a GS represented in local brain regions? In order to answer this question, the GS topography was developed to measure the correlation between global and local signals. It was observed that the GS topography has an intrinsic structure characterized by higher GS correlation in sensory cortices and lower GS correlation in higher-order cortices. The GS topography could be modulated by individual factors, attention-demanding tasks, and conscious states. Furthermore, abnormal GS topography has been uncovered in patients with schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and epilepsy. These findings provide a novel insight into understanding how the GS and local brain signals coactivate to organize information in the human brain under various brain states. Future directions were further discussed, including the local-global confusion embedded in the GS correlation, the integration of spatial information conveyed by the GS, and temporal information recruited by the connection analysis. Overall, a unified psychopathological framework is needed for understanding the GS topography.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Absence of Nonlinear Coupling Between Electric Vestibular Stimulation and Evoked Forces During Standing Balance</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.631782</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The vestibular system encodes motion and orientation of the head in space and is essential for negotiating in and interacting with the world. Recently, random waveform electric vestibular stimulation has become an increasingly common means of probing the vestibular system. However, many of the methods used to analyze the behavioral response to this type of stimulation assume a linear relationship between frequencies in the stimulus and its associated response. Here we examine this stimulus-response frequency linearity to determine the validity of this assumption. Forty-five university-aged subjects stood on a force-plate for 4 min while receiving vestibular stimulation. To determine the linearity of the stimulus-response relationship we calculated the cross-frequency power coupling between a 0 and 25 Hz bandwidth limited white noise stimulus and induced postural responses, as measured using the horizontal forces acting at the feet. Ultimately, we found that, on average, the postural response to a random stimulus is linear across stimulation frequencies. This result supports the use of analysis methods that depend on the assumption of stimulus-response frequency linearity, such as coherence and gain, which are commonly used to analyze the body’s response to random waveform electric stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Temporal Binding in Multisensory and Motor-Sensory Contexts: Toward a Unified Model</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.629437</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Our senses receive a manifold of sensory signals at any given moment in our daily lives. For a coherent and unified representation of information and precise motor control, our brain needs to temporally bind the signals emanating from a common causal event and segregate others. Traditionally, different mechanisms were proposed for the temporal binding phenomenon in multisensory and motor-sensory contexts. This paper reviews the literature on the temporal binding phenomenon in both multisensory and motor-sensory contexts and suggests future research directions for advancing the field. Moreover, by critically evaluating the recent literature, this paper suggests that common computational principles are responsible for the temporal binding in multisensory and motor-sensory contexts. These computational principles are grounded in the Bayesian framework of uncertainty reduction rooted in the Helmholtzian idea of unconscious causal inference.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: IRE1α-XBP1 Affects the Mitochondrial Function of Aβ25–35-Treated SH-SY5Y Cells by Regulating Mitochondria-Associated Endoplasmic Reticulum Membranes</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.614556</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Neurotoxicity induced by the amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide is one of the most important pathological mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Activation of the adaptive IRE1α-XBP1 pathway contributes to the pathogenesis of AD, making it a potential target for AD therapeutics. However, the mechanism of IRE1α-XBP1 pathway involvement in AD is unclear. We, therefore, investigated the effect of the IRE1α-XBP1 axis in an in vitro AD model and explored its potential mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: The human neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y, was used. Cells were treated with Aβ25–35, with or without 4μ8c, an inhibitor of IRE1α. Cells were collected and analyzed by Western blotting, quantitative real-time PCR, electron microscopy, fluorescence microscopy, calcium imaging, and other biochemical assays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Aβ-exposed SH-SY5Y cells showed an increased expression of XBP1s and p-IRE1α. 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and calcium imaging analysis showed that the IRE1α inhibitor, 4μ8c, reduced Aβ-induced cytotoxicity. Increased levels of ATP, restoration of mitochondrial membrane potential, and decreased production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species after Aβ treatment in the presence of 4μ8c showed that inhibiting the IRE1α-XBP1 axis effectively mitigated Aβ-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, Aβ treatment increased the expression and interaction of IP3R, Grp75, and vdac1 and led to an increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–mitochondria association, malfunction of mitochondria-associated ER-membranes (MAMs), and mitochondrial dysfunction. These deficits were rescued by inhibiting the IRE1α-XBP1 axis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that Aβ peptide induces the activation of the IRE1α-XBP1 axis, which may aggravate cytotoxicity and mitochondrial impairment in SH-SY5Y cells by targeting MAMs. Inhibition of the IRE1α-XBP1 axis provides the protection against Aβ-induced injury in SH-SY5Y cells and may, therefore, be a new treatment strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Dual Role of Lysophosphatidic Acid Receptor 2 (LPA2) in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.600872</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a pleiotropic extracellular lipid mediator with many physiological functions that signal through six known G protein-coupled receptors (LPA&lt;sub&gt;1–6&lt;/sub&gt;). In the central nervous system (CNS), LPA mediates a wide range of effects including neural progenitor cell physiology, neuronal cell death, axonal retraction, and inflammation. Since inflammation is a hallmark of most neurological conditions, we hypothesized that LPA could be involved in the physiopathology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We found that LPA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; RNA was upregulated in post-mortem spinal cord samples of ALS patients and in the sciatic nerve and skeletal muscle of SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; mouse, the most widely used ALS mouse model. To assess the contribution of LPA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to ALS, we generated a SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; mouse that was deficient in Lpar2. This animal revealed that LPA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; signaling accelerates disease onset and neurological decline but, unexpectedly, extended the lifespan. To gain insights into the early harmful actions of LPA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in ALS, we studied the effects of this receptor in the spinal cord, peripheral nerve, and skeletal muscle of ALS mice. We found that LPA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gene deletion increased microglial activation but did not contribute to motoneuron death, astrogliosis, degeneration, and demyelination of motor axons. However, we observed that Lpar2 deficiency protected against muscle atrophy. Moreover, we also found the deletion of Lpar2 reduced the invasion of macrophages into the skeletal muscle of SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; mice, linking LPA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; signaling with muscle inflammation and atrophy in ALS. Overall, these results suggest for the first time that LPA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; contributes to ALS, and its genetic deletion results in protective actions at the early stages of the disease but shortens survival thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.648982</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy are types of adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders named synucleinopathies, which are characterized by prominent intracellular α-synuclein (αSyn) aggregates. We have previously found that αSyn aggregates and the vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons in the mouse brain are partly associated with the expression of fatty acid-binding protein 3 (FABP3, heart FABP). However, it remains to be elucidated whether FABP3 accumulation is associated with αSyn aggregates in human tissues. Here, we histologically studied FABP3 expression in human tissues obtained from patients with synucleinopathies, patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) and controls. We found that (1) a variety of neurons expressed the FABP3 protein in human brain tissues, (2) FABP3 was colocalized with αSyn aggregates in the brains of individuals with synucleinopathies but not with amyloid β or p-tau aggregates in the brains of individuals with AD, and (3) FABP3 was not present in p-αSyn deposits in biopsied skin tissues from individuals with PD. These findings suggest that FABP3 expression is associated with αSyn aggregation in synucleinopathies and provide new insights into the involvement of FABP3 in synucleinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Cholesterol, Atherosclerosis, and APOE in Vascular Contributions to Cognitive Impairment and Dementia (VCID): Potential Mechanisms and Therapy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.647990</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) are a common cause of cognitive decline, yet limited therapies exist. This cerebrovascular disease results in neurodegeneration via acute, chronic, local, and systemic mechanisms. The etiology of VCID is complex, with a significant impact from atherosclerosis. Risk factors including hypercholesterolemia and hypertension promote intracranial atherosclerotic disease and carotid artery stenosis (CAS), which disrupt cerebral blood flow and trigger ischemic strokes and VCID. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is a cholesterol and phospholipid carrier present in plasma and various tissues. APOE is implicated in dyslipidemia and Alzheimer disease (AD); however, its connection with VCID is less understood. Few experimental models for VCID exist, so much of the present information has been drawn from clinical studies. Here, we review the literature with a focus on the clinical aspects of atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease and build a working model for the pathogenesis of VCID. We describe potential intermediate steps in this model, linking cholesterol, atherosclerosis, and APOE with VCID. APOE4 is a minor isoform of APOE that promotes lipid dyshomeostasis in astrocytes and microglia, leading to chronic neuroinflammation. APOE4 disturbs lipid homeostasis in macrophages and smooth muscle cells, thus exacerbating systemic inflammation and promoting atherosclerotic plaque formation. Additionally, APOE4 may contribute to stromal activation of endothelial cells and pericytes that disturb the blood-brain barrier (BBB). These and other risk factors together lead to chronic inflammation, atherosclerosis, VCID, and neurodegeneration. Finally, we discuss potential cholesterol metabolism based approaches for future VCID treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Model of theta frequency perturbations and contextual fear memory</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23307?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Theta oscillations in the hippocampal local field potential (LFP) appear during translational movement and arousal, modulate the activity of principal cells, and are associated with spatial cognition and episodic memory function. All known anxiolytics slightly but consistently reduce hippocampal theta frequency. However, whether this electrophysiological effect is mechanistically related to the decreased behavioral expression of anxiety is currently unclear. Here, we propose that a reduction in theta frequency affects synaptic plasticity and mnemonic function and that this can explain the reduction in anxiety behavior. We test this hypothesis in a biophysical model of contextual fear conditioning. First, we confirm that our model reproduces previous empirical results regarding the dependence of synaptic plasticity on presynaptic firing rate. Next, we investigate how theta frequency during contextual conditioning impacts learning. These simulations demonstrate that learned associations between threat and context are attenuated when learning takes place under reduced theta frequency. Additionally, our simulations demonstrate that learned associations result in increased theta activity in the amygdala, consistent with empirical data. In summary, we propose a mechanism that can account for the behavioral effect of anxiolytics by impairing the integration of threat attributes of an environment into the cognitive map due to reduced synaptic potentiation.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Protein expression alteration in hippocampus upon genetic repression of AMPKα isoforms</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23305?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
The AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a molecular sensor to help maintain cellular energy homeostasis. AMPK is a heterotrimeric complex and its enzymatic catalytic subunit includes two isoforms: α1 and α2. Dysregulation of AMPK signaling is linked to neuronal diseases characterized with cognitive impairments. Emerging evidence also suggest isoform‐specific roles of AMPK in the brain. AMPK regulates protein synthesis, which is critical for memory formation and neuronal plasticity. However, the consequence of altering AMPK activity on the translation of specific proteins in the brain is unknown. Here, we use unbiased mass spectrometry‐based proteomics approach to analyze protein profile alterations in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of transgenic mice in which the genes for the two AMPKα isoforms are conditionally deleted. The study revealed identities of proteins whose expression is sensitive to suppression of AMPKα1 and/or α2 isoform. These data may serve as a basis for future in‐depth study. Elucidation of the functional relevance of the alteration of specific proteins could provide insights into identification of novel therapeutic targets for neuronal disorders characterized with AMPK signaling dysregulation and impaired cellular energy metabolism.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Early appearance of developmental alterations in the dendritic tree of the hippocampal granule cells in the Ts65Dn model of Down syndrome</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23303?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Down syndrome (DS), a genetic condition caused by triplication of chromosome 21, is characterized by alterations in various cognitive domains, including hippocampus‐dependent memory functions, starting from early life stages. The major causes of intellectual disability in DS are prenatal neurogenesis alterations followed by impairment of dendritic development in early infancy. While there is evidence that the Ts65Dn mouse, the most widely used model of DS, exhibits dendritic alterations in adulthood, no studies are available regarding the onset of dendritic pathology. The goal of the current study was to establish whether this model exhibits early dendritic alterations in the hippocampus, a region whose function is severely damaged in DS. To this purpose, in Golgi‐stained brains, we evaluated the dendritic arborization and dendritic spines of the granule cells of the hippocampal dentate gyrus in Ts65Dn mice aged 8 (P8) and 15 (P15) days. While P15 Ts65Dn mice exhibited a notably hypotrophic dendritic arbor and a reduced spine density, P8 mice exhibited a moderate reduction in the number of dendritic ramifications and no differences in spine density in comparison with their euploid counterparts. Both in P8 and P15 mice, spines were longer and had a longer neck, suggesting possible alterations in synaptic function. Moreover, P8 and P15 Ts65Dn mice had more thin spines and fewer stubby spines in comparison with euploid mice. Our study provides novel evidence on the onset of dendritic pathology, one of the causes of intellectual disability in DS, showing that it is already detectable in the dentate gyrus of Ts65Dn pups. This evidence strengthens the suitability of this model of DS as a tool to study dendritic pathology in DS and to test the efficacy of early therapeutic interventions aimed at ameliorating hippocampal development and, therefore, memory functions in children with DS.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Disruption of circadian timing increases synaptic inhibition and reduces cholinergic responsiveness in the dentate gyrus</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23301?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
We investigated synaptic mechanisms in the hippocampus that could explain how loss of circadian timing leads to impairments in spatial and recognition memory. Experiments were performed in hippocampal slices from Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus) because, unlike mice and rats, their circadian rhythms are easily eliminated without modifications to their genome and without surgical manipulations, thereby leaving neuronal circuits intact. Recordings of excitatory postsynaptic field potentials and population spikes in area CA1 and dentate gyrus granule cells revealed no effect of circadian arrhythmia on basic functions of synaptic circuitry, including long‐term potentiation. However, dentate granule cells from circadian‐arrhythmic animals maintained a more depolarized resting membrane potential than cells from circadian‐intact animals; a significantly greater proportion of these cells depolarized in response to the cholinergic agonist carbachol (10 μM), and did so by increasing their membrane potential three‐fold greater than cells from the control (entrained) group. Dentate granule cells from arrhythmic animals also exhibited higher levels of tonic inhibition, as measured by the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. Carbachol also decreased stimulus‐evoked synaptic excitation in dentate granule cells from both intact and arrhythmic animals as expected, but reduced stimulus‐evoked synaptic inhibition only in cells from control hamsters. These findings show that loss of circadian timing is accompanied by greater tonic inhibition, and increased synaptic inhibition in response to muscarinic receptor activation in dentate granule cells. Increased inhibition would likely attenuate excitation in dentate‐CA3 microcircuits, which in turn might explain the spatial memory deficits previously observed in circadian‐arrhythmic hamsters.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Pattern separation beyond the hippocampus: A high‐resolution whole‐brain investigation of mnemonic discrimination in healthy adults</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23299?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Episodic memory depends on the computational process of pattern separation in order to establish distinct memory representations of similar episodes. Studies of pattern separation in humans rely on mnemonic discrimination tasks, which have been shown to tax hippocampal‐dependent pattern separation. Although previous neuroimaging research has focused on hippocampal processing, little is known about how other brain regions, known to be involved in recognition memory performance, are involved in mnemonic discrimination tasks. Conversely, neuroimaging studies of pattern separation with whole‐brain coverage lack spatial resolution to localize activation to hippocampal subfields. In this study, 48 healthy young adult participants underwent whole‐brain high‐resolution functional MRI (fMRI) scanning while completing a mnemonic discrimination task. A priori region‐of‐interest analyses revealed activation patterns consistent with pattern separation in distinct hippocampal subregions, particularly in the subiculum. Connectivity analyses revealed a network of cortical regions consistent with the memory retrieval network where fMRI activation was correlated with hippocampal activation. An exploratory whole‐brain analysis revealed widespread activation differentially associated with performance of the mnemonic discrimination task. Taken together, these results suggest that a network of brain regions contribute to mnemonic discrimination performance, with the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex as a hub in the network displaying clear signals consistent with pattern separation and regions such as the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex particularly important for successful lure discrimination.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23297?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Long‐term potentiation (LTP) is a synaptic plasticity mechanism critical to long‐term memory. LTP induced in vivo is characterized by altered transcriptional activity, including a period of upregulation of gene expression which is followed by a later dominant downregulation. This temporal shift to downregulated gene expression is predicted to be partly mediated by epigenetic inhibitors of gene expression, such as histone deacetylases (HDACs). Further, pharmacological inhibitors of HDAC activity have previously been shown to enhance LTP persistence in vitro. To explore the contribution of HDACs to the persistence of LTP in vivo, we examined HDAC1 and HDAC2 activity over a 24 hr period following unilateral LTP induction in the dentate gyrus of freely moving rats. Surprisingly, we found significant changes in HDAC1 and HDAC2 activity in both the stimulated as well as the unstimulated hemispheres, with the largest increase in activity occurring bilaterally, 20 min after LTP stimulation. During this time point of heightened activity, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that both HDAC1 and HDAC2 were enriched at distinct sets of genes within each hemispheres. Further, the HDAC inhibitor Trichostatin A enhanced an intermediate phase of LTP lasting days, which has not previously been associated with altered transcription. The inhibitor had no effect on the persistence of LTP lasting weeks. Together, these data suggest that HDAC activity early after the induction of LTP may negatively regulate plasticity‐related gene expression that is involved in the initial stabilization of LTP, but not its long‐term maintenance.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Adult‐born granule cell mossy fibers preferentially target parvalbumin‐positive interneurons surrounded by perineuronal nets</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23296?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Adult‐born granule cells (abGCs) integrate into the hippocampus and form connections with dentate gyrus parvalbumin‐positive (PV+) interneurons, a circuit important for modulating plasticity. Many of these interneurons are surrounded by perineuronal nets (PNNs), extracellular matrix structures known to participate in plasticity. We compared abGC projections to PV+ interneurons with negative‐to‐low intensity PNNs to those with high intensity PNNs using retroviral and 3R‐Tau labeling in adult mice, and found that abGC mossy fibers and boutons are more frequently located near PV+ interneurons with high intensity PNNs. These results suggest that axons of new neurons preferentially stabilize near target cells with intense PNNs. Next, we asked whether the number of abGCs influences PNN formation around PV+ interneurons, and found that near complete ablation of abGCs produced a decrease in the intensity and number of PV+ neurons with PNNs, suggesting that new neuron innervation may enhance PNN formation. Experience‐driven changes in adult neurogenesis did not produce consistent effects, perhaps due to widespread effects on plasticity. Our study identifies abGC projections to PV+ interneurons with PNNs, with more presumed abGC mossy fiber boutons found near the cell body of PV+ interneurons with strong PNNs.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: The relationship between hippocampal subfield volumes and autobiographical memory persistence</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23293?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Structural integrity of the human hippocampus is widely acknowledged to be necessary for the successful encoding and retrieval of autobiographical memories. However, evidence for an association between hippocampal volume and the ability to recall such memories in healthy individuals is mixed. Here we examined this issue further by combining two approaches. First, we focused on the anatomically distinct subregions of the hippocampus where more nuanced associations may be expressed compared to considering the whole hippocampal volume. A manual segmentation protocol of hippocampal subregions allowed us to separately calculate the volumes of the dentate gyrus/CA4, CA3/2, CA1, subiculum, pre/parasubiculum and uncus. Second, a critical feature of autobiographical memories is that they can span long time periods, and so we sought to consider how memory details persist over time by conducting a longitudinal study whereby participants had to recall the same autobiographical memories on two visits spaced 8 months apart. Overall, we found that there was no difference in the total number of internal (episodic) details produced at Visits 1 and 2. However, further probing of detail subcategories revealed that specifically the amount of subjective thoughts and emotions included during recall had declined significantly by the second visit. We also observed a strong correlation between left pre/parasubiculum volume and the amount of autobiographical memory internal details produced over time. This positive relationship was evident for particular facets of the memories, with remembered events, perceptual observations and thoughts and emotions benefitting from greater volume of the left pre/parasubiculum. These preliminary findings expand upon existing functional neuroimaging evidence by highlighting a potential link between left pre/parasubiculum volume and autobiographical memory. A larger pre/parasubiculum appears not only to protect against memory decay, but may possibly enhance memory persistence, inviting further scrutiny of the role of this brain region in remote autobiographical memory retrieval.</content:encoded>

Wheat (&lt;i&gt;Triticum spp&lt;/i&gt;.) gluten consists mainly of intrinsincally disordered storage proteins (glutenins and gliadins) that can form megadalton-sized networks. These networks are responsible for the unique viscoelastic properties of wheat dough and affect the quality of bread. These properties have not yet been studied by molecular level simulations. Here, we use a newly developed &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-C-based coarse-grained model to study ∼ 4000-residue systems. The corresponding time-dependent properties are studied through shear and axial deformations. We measure the response force to the deformation, the number of entanglements and cavities, the mobility of residues, the number of the inter-chain bonds, etc. Glutenins are shown to influence the mechanics of gluten much more than gliadins. Our simulations are consistent with the existing ideas about gluten elasticity and emphasize the role of entanglements and hydrogen bonding. We also demonstrate that the storage proteins in maize and rice lead to weaker elasticity which points to the unique properties of wheat gluten.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2QU1j3aIz-Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

While vision evokes a dense network of feedforward and feedback neural processes in the brain, visual processes are primarily modeled with feedforward hierarchical neural networks, leaving the computational role of feedback processes poorly understood. Here, we developed a generative autoencoder neural network model and adversarially trained it on a categorically diverse data set of images. We hypothesized that the feedback processes in the ventral visual pathway can be represented by reconstruction of the visual information performed by the generative model. We compared representational similarity of the activity patterns in the proposed model with temporal (magnetoencephalography) and spatial (functional magnetic resonance imaging) visual brain responses. The proposed generative model identified two segregated neural dynamics in the visual brain. A temporal hierarchy of processes transforming low level visual information into high level semantics in the feedforward sweep, and a temporally later dynamics of inverse processes reconstructing low level visual information from a high level latent representation in the feedback sweep. Our results append to previous studies on neural feedback processes by presenting a new insight into the algorithmic function and the information carried by the feedback processes in the ventral visual pathway.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ttyKML2aYSk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Since entering the human population, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; the causative agent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 [COVID-19]) has spread worldwide, causing &amp;gt;100 million infections and &amp;gt;2 million deaths. While large-scale sequencing efforts have identified numerous genetic variants in SARS-CoV-2 during its circulation, it remains largely unclear whether many of these changes impact adaptation, replication, or transmission of the virus. Here, we characterized 14 different low-passage replication-competent human SARS-CoV-2 isolates representing all major European clades observed during the first pandemic wave in early 2020. By integrating viral sequencing data from patient material, virus stocks, and passaging experiments, together with kinetic virus replication data from nonhuman Vero-CCL81 cells and primary differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells (BEpCs), we observed several SARS-CoV-2 features that associate with distinct phenotypes. Notably, naturally occurring variants in Orf3a (Q57H) and nsp2 (T85I) were associated with poor replication in Vero-CCL81 cells but not in BEpCs, while SARS-CoV-2 isolates expressing the Spike D614G variant generally exhibited enhanced replication abilities in BEpCs. Strikingly, low-passage Vero-derived stock preparation of 3 SARS-CoV-2 isolates selected for substitutions at positions 5/6 of E and were highly attenuated in BEpCs, revealing a key cell-specific function to this region. Rare isolate-specific deletions were also observed in the Spike furin cleavage site during Vero-CCL81 passage, but these were rapidly selected against in BEpCs, underscoring the importance of this site for SARS-CoV-2 replication in primary human cells. Overall, our study uncovers sequence features in SARS-CoV-2 variants that determine cell-specific replication and highlights the need to monitor SARS-CoV-2 stocks carefully when phenotyping newly emerging variants or potential variants of concern.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/EslNuuOqSnQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Faithful replication of the entire genome requires replication forks to copy large contiguous tracts of DNA, and sites of persistent replication fork stalling present a major threat to genome stability. Understanding the distribution of sites at which replication forks stall, and the ensuing fork processing events, requires genome-wide methods that profile replication fork position and the formation of recombinogenic DNA ends. Here, we describe Transferase-Activated End Ligation sequencing (TrAEL-seq), a method that captures single-stranded DNA 3′ ends genome-wide and with base pair resolution. TrAEL-seq labels both DNA breaks and replication forks, providing genome-wide maps of replication fork progression and fork stalling sites in yeast and mammalian cells. Replication maps are similar to those obtained by Okazaki fragment sequencing; however, TrAEL-seq is performed on asynchronous populations of wild-type cells without incorporation of labels, cell sorting, or biochemical purification of replication intermediates, rendering TrAEL-seq far simpler and more widely applicable than existing replication fork direction profiling methods. The specificity of TrAEL-seq for DNA 3′ ends also allows accurate detection of double-strand break sites after the initiation of DNA end resection, which we demonstrate by genome-wide mapping of meiotic double-strand break hotspots in a &lt;i&gt;dmc1&lt;/i&gt;Δ mutant that is competent for end resection but not strand invasion. Overall, TrAEL-seq provides a flexible and robust methodology with high sensitivity and resolution for studying DNA replication and repair, which will be of significant use in determining mechanisms of genome instability.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Dpw5R798O7Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23324?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
A new theory is proposed of mechanisms of navigation in primates including humans in which spatial view cells found in the primate hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus are used to guide the individual from landmark to landmark. The navigation involves approach to each landmark in turn (taxis), using spatial view cells to identify the next landmark in the sequence, and does not require a topological map. Two other cell types found in primates, whole body motion cells, and head direction cells, can be utilized in the spatial view cell navigational mechanism, but are not essential. If the landmarks become obscured, then the spatial view representations can be updated by self‐motion (idiothetic) path integration using spatial coordinate transform mechanisms in the primate dorsal visual system to transform from egocentric to allocentric spatial view coordinates. A continuous attractor network or time cells or working memory is used in this approach to navigation to encode and recall the spatial view sequences involved. I also propose how navigation can be performed using a further type of neuron found in primates, allocentric‐bearing‐to‐a‐landmark neurons, in which changes of direction are made when a landmark reaches a particular allocentric bearing. This is useful if a landmark cannot be approached. The theories are made explicit in models of navigation, which are then illustrated by computer simulations. These types of navigation are contrasted with triangulation, which requires a topological map. It is proposed that the first strategy utilizing spatial view cells is used frequently in humans, and is relatively simple because primates have spatial view neurons that respond allocentrically to locations in spatial scenes. An advantage of this approach to navigation is that hippocampal spatial view neurons are also useful for episodic memory, and for imagery.</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Genetic Variation in WNT9B Increases Relapse Hazard in Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26061?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Many multiple sclerosis (MS) genetic susceptibility variants have been identified, but understanding disease heterogeneity remains a key challenge. Relapses are a core feature of MS and a common primary outcome of clinical trials, with prevention of relapses benefiting patients immediately and potentially limiting long‐term disability accrual. We aim to identify genetic variation associated with relapse hazard in MS by analyzing the largest study population to date.


Methods
We performed a genomewide association study (GWAS) in a discovery cohort and investigated the genomewide significant variants in a replication cohort. Combining both cohorts, we captured a total of 2,231 relapses occurring before the start of any immunomodulatory treatment in 991 patients. For assessing time to relapse, we applied a survival analysis utilizing Cox proportional hazards models. We also investigated the association between MS genetic risk scores and relapse hazard and performed a gene ontology pathway analysis.


Results
The low‐frequency genetic variant rs11871306 within WNT9B reached genomewide significance in predicting relapse hazard and replicated (meta‐analysis hazard ratio (HR) = 2.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.70–2.78, p = 2.07 × 10−10). A pathway analysis identified an association of the pathway “response to vitamin D” with relapse hazard (p = 4.33 × 10−6). The MS genetic risk scores, however, were not associated with relapse hazard.


Interpretation
Genetic factors underlying disease heterogeneity differ from variants associated with MS susceptibility. Our findings imply that genetic variation within the Wnt signaling and vitamin D pathways contributes to differences in relapse occurrence. The present study highlights these cross‐talking pathways as potential modulators of MS disease activity. ANN NEUROL 2021</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Electroencephalographic Abnormalities are Common in COVID‐19 and are Associated with Outcomes</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26060?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
The aim was to determine the prevalence and risk factors for electrographic seizures and other electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns in patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) undergoing clinically indicated continuous electroencephalogram (cEEG) monitoring and to assess whether EEG findings are associated with outcomes.


Methods
We identified 197 patients with COVID‐19 referred for cEEG at 9 participating centers. Medical records and EEG reports were reviewed retrospectively to determine the incidence of and clinical risk factors for seizures and other epileptiform patterns. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis assessed the relationship between EEG patterns and clinical outcomes.


Results
Electrographic seizures were detected in 19 (9.6%) patients, including nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) in 11 (5.6%). Epileptiform abnormalities (either ictal or interictal) were present in 96 (48.7%). Preceding clinical seizures during hospitalization were associated with both electrographic seizures (36.4% in those with vs 8.1% in those without prior clinical seizures, odds ratio [OR] 6.51, p = 0.01) and NCSE (27.3% vs 4.3%, OR 8.34, p = 0.01). A pre‐existing intracranial lesion on neuroimaging was associated with NCSE (14.3% vs 3.7%; OR 4.33, p = 0.02). In multivariate analysis of outcomes, electrographic seizures were an independent predictor of in‐hospital mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 4.07 [1.44–11.51], p &amp;lt; 0.01). In competing risks analysis, hospital length of stay increased in the presence of NCSE (30 day proportion discharged with vs without NCSE: HR 0.21 [0.03–0.33] vs 0.43 [0.36–0.49]).


Interpretation
This multicenter retrospective cohort study demonstrates that seizures and other epileptiform abnormalities are common in patients with COVID‐19 undergoing clinically indicated cEEG and are associated with adverse clinical outcomes. ANN NEUROL 2021</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Noninvasive Mapping of Ripple Onset Predicts Outcome in Epilepsy Surgery</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26066?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Intracranial electroencephalographic (icEEG) studies show that interictal ripples propagate across the brain of children with medically refractory epilepsy (MRE), and the onset of this propagation (ripple onset zone [ROZ]) estimates the epileptogenic zone. It is still unknown whether we can map this propagation noninvasively. The goal of this study is to map ripples (ripple zone [RZ]) and their propagation onset (ROZ) using high‐density EEG (HD‐EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), and to estimate their prognostic value in pediatric epilepsy surgery.


Methods
We retrospectively analyzed simultaneous HD‐EEG and MEG data from 28 children with MRE who underwent icEEG and epilepsy surgery. Using electric and magnetic source imaging, we estimated virtual sensors (VSs) at brain locations that matched the icEEG implantation. We detected ripples on VSs, defined the virtual RZ and virtual ROZ, and estimated their distance from icEEG. We assessed the predictive value of resecting virtual RZ and virtual ROZ for postsurgical outcome. Interictal spike localization on HD‐EEG and MEG was also performed and compared with ripples.


Results
We mapped ripple propagation in all patients with HD‐EEG and in 27 (96%) patients with MEG. The distance from icEEG did not differ between HD‐EEG and MEG when mapping the RZ (26–27mm, p = 0.6) or ROZ (22–24mm, p = 0.4). Resecting the virtual ROZ, but not virtual RZ or the sources of spikes, was associated with good outcome for HD‐EEG (p = 0.016) and MEG (p = 0.047).


Interpretation
HD‐EEG and MEG can map interictal ripples and their propagation onset (virtual ROZ). Noninvasively mapping the ripple onset may augment epilepsy surgery planning and improve surgical outcome of children with MRE. ANN NEUROL 2021</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: A Synaptic Framework for the Persistence of Memory Engrams</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2021.661476</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The ability to store and retrieve learned information over prolonged periods of time is an essential and intriguing property of the brain. Insight into the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie memory consolidation is of utmost importance for our understanding of memory persistence and how this is affected in memory disorders. Recent evidence indicates that a given memory is encoded by sparsely distributed neurons that become highly activated during learning, so-called engram cells. Research by us and others confirms the persistent nature of cortical engram cells by showing that these neurons are required for memory expression up to at least 1 month after they were activated during learning. Strengthened synaptic connectivity between engram cells is thought to ensure reactivation of the engram cell network during retrieval. However, given the continuous integration of new information into existing neuronal circuits and the relatively rapid turnover rate of synaptic proteins, it is unclear whether a lasting learning-induced increase in synaptic connectivity is mediated by stable synapses or by continuous dynamic turnover of synapses of the engram cell network. Here, we first discuss evidence for the persistence of engram cells and memory-relevant adaptations in synaptic plasticity, and then propose models of synaptic adaptations and molecular mechanisms that may support memory persistence through the maintenance of enhanced synaptic connectivity within an engram cell network.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.655037</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Despite the complexity of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), from their genotype to phenotype, in the last few decades substantial progress has been made in understanding their pathophysiology. Recent accumulating evidence shows the relevance of genetic variants in thousand and one (TAO) kinases as major contributors to several NDDs. Although it is well-known that TAO kinases are a highly conserved family of STE20 kinase and play important roles in multiple biological processes, the emerging roles of TAO kinases in neurodevelopment and NDDs have yet to be intensively discussed. In this review article, we summarize the potential roles of the TAO kinases based on structural and biochemical analyses, present the genetic data from clinical investigations, and assess the mechanistic link between the mutations of TAO kinases, neuropathology, and behavioral impairment in NDDs. We then offer potential perspectives from basic research to clinical therapies, which may contribute to fully understanding how TAO kinases are involved in NDDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Shift Toward Randomness in Brain Networks of Patients With Anorexia Nervosa: The Role of Malnutrition</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.645139</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;No study to date investigated structural white matter (WM) connectome characteristics in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN). Previous research in AN found evidence of imbalances in global and regional connectomic brain architecture and highlighted a role of malnutrition in determining structural brain changes. The aim of our study was to explore the characteristics of the WM network architecture in a sample of patients with AN. Thirty-six patients with AN and 36 healthy women underwent magnetic resonance imaging to obtain a high-resolution three-dimensional T1-weighted anatomical image and a diffusion tensor imaging scan. Probabilistic tractography data were extracted and analyzed in their network properties through graph theory tools. In comparison to healthy women, patients with AN showed lower global network segregation (normalized clustering: p = 0.029), an imbalance between global network integration and segregation (i.e., lower small-worldness: p = 0.031), and the loss of some of the most integrative and influential hubs. Both clustering and small-worldness correlated with the lowest lifetime body mass index. A significant relationship was found between the average regional loss of cortical volume and changes in network properties of brain nodes: the more the difference in the cortical volume of brain areas, the more the increase in the centrality of corresponding nodes in the whole brain, and the decrease in clustering and efficiency of the nodes of parietal cortex. Our findings showed an unbalanced connectome wiring in AN patients, which seems to be influenced by malnutrition and loss of cortical volume. The role of this rearrangement in the maintenance and prognosis of AN and its reversibility with clinical improvement needs to be established by future studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Simultaneous Measurement of the BOLD Effect and Metabolic Changes in Response to Visual Stimulation Using the MEGA-PRESS Sequence at 3 T</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.644079</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) effect that provides the contrast in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been demonstrated to affect the linewidth of spectral peaks as measured with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and through this, may be used as an indirect measure of cerebral blood flow related to neural activity. By acquiring MR-spectra interleaved with frames without water suppression, it may be possible to image the BOLD effect and associated metabolic changes simultaneously through changes in the linewidth of the unsuppressed water peak. The purpose of this study was to implement this approach with the MEGA-PRESS sequence, widely considered to be the standard sequence for quantitative measurement of GABA at field strengths of 3 T and lower, to observe how changes in both glutamate (measured as Glx) and GABA levels may relate to changes due to the BOLD effect. MR-spectra and fMRI were acquired from the occipital cortex (OCC) of 20 healthy participants whilst undergoing intrascanner visual stimulation in the form of a red and black radial checkerboard, alternating at 8 Hz, in 90 s blocks comprising 30 s of visual stimulation followed by 60 s of rest. Results show very strong agreement between the changes in the linewidth of the unsuppressed water signal and the canonical haemodynamic response function as well as a strong, negative, but not statistically significant, correlation with the Glx signal as measured from the OFF spectra in MEGA-PRESS pairs. Findings from this experiment suggest that the unsuppressed water signal provides a reliable measure of the BOLD effect and that correlations with associated changes in GABA and Glx levels may also be measured. However, discrepancies between metabolite levels as measured from the difference and OFF spectra raise questions regarding the reliability of the respective methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Extracting Phonetic Features From Natural Classes: A Mismatch Negativity Study of Mandarin Chinese Retroflex Consonants</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.609898</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;How speech sounds are represented in the brain is not fully understood. The mismatch negativity (MMN) has proven to be a powerful tool in this regard. The MMN event-related potential is elicited by a deviant stimulus embedded within a series of repeating standard stimuli. Listeners construct auditory memory representations of these standards despite acoustic variability. In most designs that test speech sounds, however, this variation is typically intra-category: All standards belong to the same phonetic category. In the current paper, inter-category variation is presented in the standards. These standards vary in manner of articulation but share a common phonetic feature. In the standard retroflex experimental block, Mandarin Chinese speaking participants are presented with a series of “standard” consonants that share the feature [retroflex], interrupted by infrequent non-retroflex deviants. In the non-retroflex standard experimental block, non-retroflex standards are interrupted by infrequent retroflex deviants. The within-block MMN was calculated, as was the identity MMN (iMMN) to account for intrinsic differences in responses to the stimuli. We only observed a within-block MMN to the non-retroflex deviant embedded in the standard retroflex block. This suggests that listeners extract [retroflex] despite significant inter-category variation. In the non-retroflex standard block, because there is little on which to base a coherent auditory memory representation, no within-block MMN was observed. The iMMN to the retroflex was observed in a late time-window at centro-parieto-occipital electrode sites instead of fronto-central electrodes, where the MMN is typically observed, potentially reflecting the increased difficulty posed by the added variation in the standards. In short, participants can construct auditory memory representations despite significant acoustic and inter-category phonological variation so long as a shared phonetic feature binds them together.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Frequency-Resolved Functional Connectivity: Role of Delay and the Strength of Connections</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.608655</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The brain functional network extracted from the BOLD signals reveals the correlated activity of the different brain regions, which is hypothesized to underlie the integration of the information across functionally specialized areas. Functional networks are not static and change over time and in different brain states, enabling the nervous system to engage and disengage different local areas in specific tasks on demand. Due to the low temporal resolution, however, BOLD signals do not allow the exploration of spectral properties of the brain dynamics over different frequency bands which are known to be important in cognitive processes. Recent studies using imaging tools with a high temporal resolution has made it possible to explore the correlation between the regions at multiple frequency bands. These studies introduce the frequency as a new dimension over which the functional networks change, enabling brain networks to transmit multiplex of information at any time. In this computational study, we explore the functional connectivity at different frequency ranges and highlight the role of the distance between the nodes in their correlation. We run the generalized Kuramoto model with delayed interactions on top of the brain's connectome and show that how the transmission delay and the strength of the connections, affect the correlation between the pair of nodes over different frequency bands.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is one of the leading causes of death and long-term disability worldwide. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapies have demonstrated improved outcomes for treating ICH-induced neuronal defects, and the neural network reconstruction and neurological function recovery were enhanced in rodent ICH models through the mechanisms of neurogenesis, angiogenesis, anti-inflammation, and anti-apoptosis. However, many key issues associated with the survival, differentiation, and safety of grafted MSCs after ICH remain to be resolved, which hinder the clinical translation of MSC therapy. Herein, we reviewed an overview of the research status of MSC transplantation after ICH in different species including rodents, swine, monkey, and human, and the challenges for MSC-mediated ICH recovery from pathological microenvironment have been summarized. Furthermore, some efficient strategies for the outcome improvement of MSC transplantation were proposed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Self-reference Network-Related Interactions During the Process of Cognitive Impairment in the Early Stages of Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.666437</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Normal establishment of cognition occurs after forming a sensation to stimuli from internal or external cues, in which self-reference processing may be partially involved. However, self-reference processing has been less studied in the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) field within the self-reference network (SRN) and has instead been investigated within the default-mode network (DMN). Differences between these networks have been proven in the last decade, while ultra-early diagnoses have increased. Therefore, investigation of the altered pattern of SRN is significantly important, especially in the early stages of AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A total of 65 individuals, including 43 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 22 cognitively normal individuals, participated in this study. The SRN, dorsal attention network (DAN), and salience network (SN) were constructed with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and voxel-based analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to explore significant regions of network interactions. Finally, the correlation between the network interactions and clinical characteristics was analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We discovered four interactions among the three networks, with the SRN showing different distributions in the left and right hemispheres from the DAN and SN and modulated interactions between them. Group differences in the interactions that were impaired in MCI patients indicated that the degree of damage was most severe in the SRN, least severe in the SN, and intermediate in the DAN. The two SRN-related interactions showed positive effects on the executive and memory performances of MCI patients with no overlap with the clinical assessments performed in this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: This study is the first and primary evidence of SRN interactions related to MCI patients’ functional performance. The influence of the SRN in the ultra-early stages of AD is nonnegligible. There are still many unknowns regarding the contribution of the SRN in AD progression, and we strongly recommend future research in this area.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25143?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Using neuronal tract tracing and immunohistochemical methods, we have identified a previously unreported group of auditory efferent neurons located in the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus that project unmyelinated axons to the inner hair cell region in mouse. These ‘dorsal efferents’ were then anatomically characterized using a combination of light, fluorescent and electron microscopy, and their possible functional significance within the context of the known olivocochlear efferents is discussed.






Abstract
Auditory efferents originate in the central auditory system and project to the cochlea. Although the specific anatomy of the olivocochlear (OC) efferents can vary between species, two types of auditory efferents have been identified based upon the general location of their cell bodies and their distinctly different axon terminations in the organ of Corti. In the mouse, the relatively small somata of the lateral (LOC) efferents reside in the lateral superior olive (LSO), have unmyelinated axons, and terminate around ipsilateral inner hair cells (IHCs), primarily against the afferent processes of type I auditory nerve fibers. In contrast, the larger somata of the medial (MOC) efferents are distributed in the ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body (VNTB), have myelinated axons, and terminate bilaterally against the base of multiple outer hair cells (OHCs). Using in vivo retrograde cell body marking, anterograde axon tracing, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy, we have identified a group of efferent neurons in mouse, whose cell bodies reside in the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (VNLL). By virtue of their location, we call them dorsal efferent (DE) neurons. Labelled DE cells were immuno‐negative for tyrosine hydroxylase, glycine, and GABA, but immuno‐positive for choline acetyltransferase. Morphologically, DEs resembled LOC efferents by their small somata, unmyelinated axons, and ipsilateral projection to IHCs. These three classes of efferent neurons all project axons directly to the cochlea and exhibit cholinergic staining characteristics. The challenge is to discover the contributions of this new population of neurons to auditory efferent function.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: A Re-evaluation of Whether Non-monosynaptic Homonymous H Reflex Facilitation Tests Propriospinal Circuits</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.641816</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The C3–C4 propriospinal system is an important pathway mediating movement in cats; it contributes to movements in primates (including humans), and may have a role in recovery after lesion. Validated clinical tests of this system would find many applications, therefore we sought to test whether non-monosynaptic homonymous facilitation of the forearm flexor H reflex is mediated solely via a C3–C4 propriospinal pathway. In one anesthetized macaque monkey, median nerve stimulation elicited an H reflex in the flexor carpi radialis (FCR). Median nerve conditioning stimuli at sub-threshold intensities facilitated the H reflex, for inter-stimulus intervals up to 30 ms. Successive spinal surgical hemisections were then made. C2 lesion left the homonymous facilitation intact, suggesting mediation by spinal, not supraspinal pathways. Facilitation also remained after a second lesion at C5, indicating a major role for segmental (C7–C8) rather than propriospinal (C3–C4) interneurons. In separate experiments in five healthy human subjects, a threshold tracking approach assessed changes in peripheral axon excitability after conditioning stimulation. This was found to be enhanced up to 20 ms after the conditioning stimulus, and could partly, although not completely, underlie the H reflex facilitation seen. We conclude that homonymous facilitation of the H reflex in FCR can be produced by segmental spinal mechanisms, as well as by a supranormal period of nerve excitability. Unfortunately, this straightforward test cannot therefore be used for selective assessment of propriospinal circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: RIM-Binding Proteins Are Required for Normal Sound-Encoding at Afferent Inner Hair Cell Synapses</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.651935</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The afferent synapses between inner hair cells (IHC) and spiral ganglion neurons are specialized to faithfully encode sound with sub-millisecond precision over prolonged periods of time. Here, we studied the role of Rab3 interacting molecule-binding proteins (RIM-BP) 1 and 2 – multidomain proteins of the active zone known to directly interact with RIMs, Bassoon and Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.3 – in IHC presynaptic function and hearing. Recordings of auditory brainstem responses and otoacoustic emissions revealed that genetic disruption of RIM-BPs 1 and 2 in mice (RIM-BP1/2&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;) causes a synaptopathic hearing impairment exceeding that found in mice lacking RIM-BP2 (RIM-BP2&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;). Patch-clamp recordings from RIM-BP1/2&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; IHCs indicated a subtle impairment of exocytosis from the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles that had not been observed in RIM-BP2&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; IHCs. In contrast, the reduction of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-influx and sustained exocytosis was similar to that in RIMBP2&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; IHCs. We conclude that both RIM-BPs are required for normal sound encoding at the IHC synapse, whereby RIM-BP2 seems to take the leading role.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Differential Spatiotemporal Expression of Type I and Type II Cadherins Associated With the Segmentation of the Central Nervous System and Formation of Brain Nuclei in the Developing Mouse</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.633719</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Type I and type II classical cadherins comprise a family of cell adhesion molecules that regulate cell sorting and tissue separation by forming specific homo and heterophilic bonds. Factors that affect cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion include cadherin binding affinity and expression level. This study examines the expression pattern of type I cadherins (Cdh1, Cdh2, Cdh3, and Cdh4), type II cadherins (Cdh6, Cdh7, Cdh8, Cdh9, Cdh10, Cdh11, Cdh12, Cdh18, Cdh20, and Cdh24), and the atypical cadherin 13 (Cdh13) during distinct morphogenetic events in the developing mouse central nervous system from embryonic day 11.5 to postnatal day 56. Cadherin mRNA expression levels obtained from in situ hybridization experiments carried out at the Allen Institute for Brain Science (https://alleninstitute.org/) were retrieved from the Allen Developing Mouse Brain Atlas. Cdh2 is the most abundantly expressed type I cadherin throughout development, while Cdh1, Cdh3, and Cdh4 are expressed at low levels. Type II cadherins show a dynamic pattern of expression that varies between neuroanatomical structures and developmental ages. Atypical Cdh13 expression pattern correlates with Cdh2 in abundancy and localization. Analyses of cadherin-mediated relative adhesion estimated from their expression level and binding affinity show substantial differences in adhesive properties between regions of the neural tube associated with the segmentation along the anterior–posterior axis. Differences in relative adhesion were also observed between brain nuclei in the developing subpallium (basal ganglia), suggesting that differential cell adhesion contributes to the segregation of neuronal pools. In the adult cerebral cortex, type II cadherins Cdh6, Cdh8, Cdh10, and Cdh12 are abundant in intermediate layers, while Cdh11 shows a gradated expression from the deeper layer 6 to the superficial layer 1, and Cdh9, Cdh18, and Cdh24 are more abundant in the deeper layers. Person’s correlation analyses of cadherins mRNA expression patterns between areas and layers of the cerebral cortex and the nuclei of the subpallium show significant correlations between certain cortical areas and the basal ganglia. The study shows that differential cadherin expression and cadherin-mediated adhesion are associated with a wide range of morphogenetic events in the developing central nervous system including the organization of neurons into layers, the segregation of neurons into nuclei, and the formation of neuronal circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Mir-184 Contributes to Brain Injury Through Targeting PPAP2B Following Ischemic Stroke in Male Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.613887</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Our previous study revealed that miR-184 expression is significantly altered in the brain following ischemic stroke in rats. However, it is unknown whether this alteration in miR-184 expression contributes to brain injury after ischemic stroke. Here, we aim to address the potential of miR-184 to impact nerve injury following ischemia and reperfusion. Rats received ICV injection of miR-184 adenovirus or empty vector and were subjected to right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) to establish an ischemic stroke model. We cultured SH-SY5Y cells under oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) and transfected them with miR-184 lentivirus to explore the primary mechanisms. To evaluate miR-184 expression, neurological function deficits, the cerebral infarct volume, cell viability, and apoptosis, qRT-PCR analysis of miR-184 expression, the modified neurological severity score (mNSS) system, TTC staining, the CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry, and dual-luciferase reporter assays were utilized. We found that miR-184 expression was downregulated and that the cerebral infarct volume and mNSSs were increased following ischemic stroke; however, increasing the level of miR-184 alleviated brain damage. Overexpression of miR-184 resulted in increased viability and reduced apoptosis of SH-SY5Y cells following OGD/R in vitro. We identified the phosphatidic acid phosphatase type 2B (PPAP2B) gene as a direct target gene of miR-184. In summary, our results reveal that attenuation of miR-184 levels in ischemic stroke contributes to ischemic injury through targeting PPAP2B mRNA-mediated apoptosis, which may be a promising therapeutic target for ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: New Insight of Circular RNAs' Roles in Central Nervous System Post-Traumatic Injury</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.644239</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The central nervous system (CNS) post-traumatic injury can cause severe nerve damage with devastating consequences. However, its pathophysiological mechanisms remain vague. There is still an urgent need for more effective treatments. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that can form covalently closed RNA circles. Through second-generation sequencing technology, microarray analysis, bioinformatics, and other technologies, recent studies have shown that a number of circRNAs are differentially expressed after traumatic brain injury (TBI) or spinal cord injury (SCI). These circRNAs play important roles in the proliferation, inflammation, and apoptosis in CNS post-traumatic injury. In this review, we summarize the expression and functions of circRNAs in CNS in recent studies, as well as the circRNA–miRNA–mRNA interaction networks. The potential clinical value of circRNAs as a therapeutic target is also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: The Contribution of Gut Microbiota–Brain Axis in the Development of Brain Disorders</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.616883</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Different bacterial families colonize most mucosal tissues in the human organism such as the skin, mouth, vagina, respiratory, and gastrointestinal districts. In particular, the mammalian intestine hosts a microbial community of between 1,000 and 1,500 bacterial species, collectively called “microbiota.” Co-metabolism between the microbiota and the host system is generated and the symbiotic relationship is mutually beneficial. The balance that is achieved between the microbiota and the host organism is fundamental to the organization of the immune system. Scientific studies have highlighted a direct correlation between the intestinal microbiota and the brain, establishing the existence of the gut microbiota–brain axis. Based on this theory, the microbiota acts on the development, physiology, and cognitive functions of the brain, although the mechanisms involved have not yet been fully interpreted. Similarly, a close relationship between alteration of the intestinal microbiota and the onset of several neurological pathologies has been highlighted. This review aims to point out current knowledge as can be found in literature regarding the connection between intestinal dysbiosis and the onset of particular neurological pathologies such as anxiety and depression, autism spectrum disorder, and multiple sclerosis. These disorders have always been considered to be a consequence of neuronal alteration, but in this review, we hypothesize that these alterations may be non-neuronal in origin, and consider the idea that the composition of the microbiota could be directly involved. In this direction, the following two key points will be highlighted: (1) the direct cross-talk that comes about between neurons and gut microbiota, and (2) the degree of impact of the microbiota on the brain. Could we consider the microbiota a valuable target for reducing or modulating the incidence of certain neurological diseases?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neuropsychiatric Symptoms of COVID-19 Explained by SARS-CoV-2 Proteins’ Mimicry of Human Protein Interactions</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.656313</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The first clinical symptoms focused on the presentation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been respiratory failure, however, accumulating evidence also points to its presentation with neuropsychiatric symptoms, the exact mechanisms of which are not well known. By using a computational methodology, we aimed to explain the molecular paths of COVID-19 associated neuropsychiatric symptoms, based on the mimicry of the human protein interactions with SARS-CoV-2 proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Available 11 of the 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins’ structures have been extracted from Protein Data Bank. HMI-PRED (Host-Microbe Interaction PREDiction), a recently developed web server for structural PREDiction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between host and any microbial species, was used to find the “interface mimicry” through which the microbial proteins hijack host binding surfaces. Classification of the found interactions was conducted using the PANTHER Classification System.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Predicted Human-SARS-CoV-2 protein interactions have been extensively compared with the literature. Based on the analysis of the molecular functions, cellular localizations and pathways related to human proteins, SARS-CoV-2 proteins are found to possibly interact with human proteins linked to synaptic vesicle trafficking, endocytosis, axonal transport, neurotransmission, growth factors, mitochondrial and blood-brain barrier elements, in addition to its peripheral interactions with proteins linked to thrombosis, inflammation and metabolic control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2-human protein interactions may lead to the development of delirium, psychosis, seizures, encephalitis, stroke, sensory impairments, peripheral nerve diseases, and autoimmune disorders. Our findings are also supported by the previous in vivo and in vitro studies from other viruses. Further in vivo and in vitro studies using the proteins that are pointed here, could pave new targets both for avoiding and reversing neuropsychiatric presentations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to investigate the morphometric alterations in the cortical and subcortical structures in multiple system atrophy (MSA) patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and to explore the association with cognitive deficits.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A total of 45 MSA patients (25 MSA-only, 20 MSA-MCI) and 29 healthy controls were recruited. FreeSurfer software was used to analyze cortical thickness, and voxel-based morphometry was used to analyze the gray matter volumes. Cortical thickness and gray matter volume changes were correlated with cognitive scores.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Compared to healthy controls, both MSA subgroups exhibited widespread morphology alterations of brain structures in the fronto-temporal regions. Direct comparison of MSA-MCI and MSA-only patients showed volume reduction in the left superior and middle temporal gyrus, while cortical thinning was found in the left middle and inferior temporal gyrus in MSA-MCI patients. Cortical thinning in the left middle temporal gyrus correlated with cognitive assessment and disease duration.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Structural changes in the brain occur in MSA-MCI patients. The alteration of brain structure in the left temporal regions might be a biomarker of cognitive decline in MSA-MCI patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Increase in Beta Power Reflects Attentional Top-Down Modulation After Psychosocial Stress Induction</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.630813</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Selective attention depends on goal-directed and stimulus-driven modulatory factors, each relayed by different brain rhythms. Under certain circumstances, stress-related states can change the balance between goal-directed and stimulus-driven factors. However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying these changes remain unclear. In this study, we explored how psychosocial stress can modulate brain rhythms during an attentional task and a task-free period. We recorded the EEG and ECG activity of 42 healthy participants subjected to either the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), a controlled procedure to induce stress, or a comparable control protocol (same physical and cognitive effort but without the stress component), flanked by an attentional task, a 90 s of task-free period and a state of anxiety questionnaire. We observed that psychosocial stress induced an increase in heart rate (HR), self-reported anxiety, and alpha power synchronization. Also, psychosocial stress evoked a relative beta power increase during correct trials of the attentional task, which correlates positively with anxiety and heart rate increase, and inversely with attentional accuracy. These results suggest that psychosocial stress affects performance by redirecting attentional resources toward internal threat-related thoughts. An increment of endogenous top-down modulation reflected an increased beta-band activity that may serve as a compensatory mechanism to redirect attentional resources toward the ongoing task. The data obtained here may contribute to designing new ways of clinical management of the human stress response in the future and could help to minimize the damaging effects of persistent stressful experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: International Consensus Based Review and Recommendations for Minimum Reporting Standards in Research on Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation (Version 2020)</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.568051</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Given its non-invasive nature, there is increasing interest in the use of transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) across basic, translational and clinical research. Contemporaneously, tVNS can be achieved by stimulating either the auricular branch or the cervical bundle of the vagus nerve, referred to as transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation(VNS) and transcutaneous cervical VNS, respectively. In order to advance the field in a systematic manner, studies using these technologies need to adequately report sufficient methodological detail to enable comparison of results between studies, replication of studies, as well as enhancing study participant safety. We systematically reviewed the existing tVNS literature to evaluate current reporting practices. Based on this review, and consensus among participating authors, we propose a set of minimal reporting items to guide future tVNS studies. The suggested items address specific technical aspects of the device and stimulation parameters. We also cover general recommendations including inclusion and exclusion criteria for participants, outcome parameters and the detailed reporting of side effects. Furthermore, we review strategies used to identify the optimal stimulation parameters for a given research setting and summarize ongoing developments in animal research with potential implications for the application of tVNS in humans. Finally, we discuss the potential of tVNS in future research as well as the associated challenges across several disciplines in research and clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
