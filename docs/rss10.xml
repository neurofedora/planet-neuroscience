	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: IGF-1 Alleviates Mitochondrial Apoptosis through the GSK3β/NF-κB/NLRP3 Signaling Pathway in LPS-Treated PC-12 Cells</title>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Inflammation contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal apoptosis. The aim of this study was to determine whether insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) alleviates mitochondrial apoptosis in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated PC-12 cells, and to further explore the mechanism involved. Prepared PC-12 cells were treated with IGF-1, Mdivi-1 (DRP1 blocker), LY294002 (PI3K blocker), betulinic acid (NF-κB activator) or their combinations. Mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP generation were then measured to assess mitochondrial function. The rate of apoptosis was determined using flow cytometry. The expression of several apoptosis proteins (i.e. Bax, cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved caspase-3) and signaling proteins (i.e. p-GSK3β, NF-κB and NLRP3) was measured using western blotting. Compared with the control cells, the LPS-treated cells showed evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction, increased apoptosis and upregulation of apoptosis proteins, which were significantly alleviated by Mdivi-1. These findings indicate that neuronal apoptosis was activated partly through the mitochondrial pathway. IGF-1 treatment inhibited mitochondrial apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in the LPS-treated cells. The reagent also increased the expression of p-GSK3β and decreased the expression of NF-κB and NLRP3. Both LY294002 and betulinic acid reversed the protective effect of IGF-1. In addition, LY294002 affected the expression of the three signaling proteins, while betulinic acid only affected the expression of NF-κB and NLRP3. These findings indicated a GSK3β/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway was existed and was involved in the protective mechanism of IGF-1. In conclusion, IGF-1 alleviated mitochondrial apoptosis through GSK3β/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway in LPS-treated PC-12 cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Chronic Neuroinflammation Induced by Lipopolysaccharide Injection into the Third Ventricle Induces Behavioral Changes</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-020-01758-7</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The existence of Gram-negative bacteria in the brain, regardless of underlying immune status has been demonstrated by recent studies. The colocalization of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with Aβ&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1-40/42&lt;/sub&gt; in amyloid plaques supports the hypothesis that brain microbes may be the cause, triggering chronic neuroinflammation, leading to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). To investigate the behavioral changes induced by infectious neuroinflammation, we chose the third ventricle as the site of a single LPS injection (20 μg or 80 μg) in male Wistar rats to avoid mechanical injury to forebrain structures while inducing widespread inflammation throughout the brain. Chronic neuroinflammation induced by LPS resulted in depressive-like behaviors and the impairment of spatial learning; however, there was no evidence of the development of pathological hallmarks (e.g., the phosphorylation of tau) for 10 months following LPS injection. The acceleration of cholesterol metabolism via CYP46A1 and the retardation of cholesterol synthesis via HMGCR were observed in the hippocampus of rats treated with either low-dose or high-dose LPS. The rate-limiting enzymes of cholesterol metabolism (CYP46A1) in SH-SY5Y cells and synthesis (HMGCR) in U251 cells were altered by inflammation stimulators, including LPS, IL-1β, and TNF-α, through the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway. The data suggest that chronic neuroinflammation provoked by the administration of LPS into the third ventricle may induce depressive-like symptoms and that the loss of cholesterol might be a biomarker of chronic neuroinflammation. The lack of pathological hallmarks of AD in our model indicates that Gram-negative bacteria infection might not be a single cause of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Association Study of Opioid Receptor Delta-Type 1 (OPRD1) Gene Variants with Nicotine Dependence in an Iranian Population</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-020-01757-8</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Twins studies indicate that many individual factors are associated with genetic polymorphisms in tobacco use, dependence vulnerability, and the ability to quit smoking. Opioid receptor delta-type 1 (OPRD1) is one of the most important genes in the opioid pathway. Therefore, the current study aimed to investigate the association of variants located in the intron 1 of the OPRD1 gene, including rs2236857, rs2236855, and rs760589, with susceptibility to nicotine dependence among northern Iranians. DNA of 426 individuals, including 224 smokers and 202 healthy people, were extracted with the salting-out standard technique, qualified with Agarose gel, then quantified with Nanodrop, and finally genotyped by Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS) PCR. All statistical analyses were performed by SNPAlyze version 8.1 and SPSS version 20. Results revealed no significant association of all three studied variants with the susceptibility to nicotine dependence in any models of inheritance. However, there were five haplotypes with an overall frequency higher than 0.05; no significant impact of any of them on nicotine dependence was observed. Altogether, rs2236857, rs2236855, and rs760589 were not associated with nicotine dependence among northern Iranians.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To study the effect of photobiomodulation (PBM) on axon regeneration and secretion change of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) under oxidative stress after spinal cord injury (SCI), and further explore the effect of changes in DRG secretion caused by PBM on the polarization of macrophages. The PBM-DRG model was constructed to perform PBM on neurons under oxidative stress simulated in vitro. And the irradiation conditions were as follows: wavelength, 810 nm; power density, 2 mW/cm&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; irradiation area, 4.5 cm&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; and irradiation time, 440 s. Then resulted in an energy of 4 J (2 mW/cm&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; × 4.5 cm&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; × 440 s). About 100 μM H&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was added to the culture medium to simulate oxidative stress after SCI. An ROS (reactive oxygen species) assay kit was used to measure ROS contend in the DRG. The survival level of the neurons was measured using the CCK-8 method, and the axon regeneration of neurons was observed by using immunofluorescence. The secretion level of CCL2 from DRG was determined by RT-qPCR and ELISA. Further culturing macrophages of DRG-conditioned medium culture, the expression level of iNOS and Arg-1 in macrophages was assessed using Western blot analysis. The expression level of TNF-α and IL-1β was determined by ELISA. After adding the neutralizing antibody of CCL2 to the DRG neuron-conditioned medium following PBM irradiation to culture macrophages to observe the effects on macrophage polarization and secretion. PBM could reduce ROS levels in neurons, increase neuronal survival under oxidative stress, and promote neuronal axon regeneration. In addition, PBM could also promote CCL2 secretion by DRG under oxidative stress. By constructing a DRG supernatant-M1 macrophage adoptive culture model, we found that the supernatant of DRG after PBM intervention could reduce the expression level of iNOS and the secretion of TNF-α and IL-1β in M1 macrophages; at the same time, it could also up-regulate the expression of Arg-1, one of the markers of M2 macrophages. Furthermore, these effects could be prevented by the addition of neutralizing antibodies of CCL2. PBM could promote survival and axonal regeneration of DRG under SCI oxidative stress, increase the secretion level of CCL2 by DRG, and this change can reduce the polarization of macrophages to M1, further indicating that PBM could promote spinal cord injury repair.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Behçet syndrome (BS) is a vasculitis characterized by several clinical manifestations including the rare neurological involvement (neuro-BS, NBS). The aim of our pivotal study was to investigate the mutational status of several inflammation-related genes in a cohort of Italian patients with and without the neurological involvement (20 NBS vs 40 no-NBS patients). The preliminary &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;in silico&lt;/em&gt; single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) selection and primer design were performed by NCBI Primer-Blast tool. Genomic DNA was isolated and amplified using PCR. PCR amplicons were sequenced and bioinformatically analysed. Twelve tagSNPs were selected and genotyped: &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ERAP1&lt;/em&gt; rs30187, rs17482078, and rs27044; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL10 rs1800872&lt;/em&gt; and rs1518111, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL12A&lt;/em&gt; rs17810546, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL23R&lt;/em&gt; rs17375018, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL23R&lt;/em&gt;-&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL12RB2&lt;/em&gt; rs924080, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;STAT4&lt;/em&gt; rs7572482, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CCR1&lt;/em&gt; rs7616215, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;KLRC4&lt;/em&gt; rs2617170, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;UBAC2&lt;/em&gt; rs3825427.&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt; ERAP1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL23R&lt;/em&gt; SNPs showed statistically significant higher frequencies in NBS group than no-NBS. &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ERAP1&lt;/em&gt; rs30187 AA was more common in no-NBS patients (20.0% NBS vs 47.5% no-NBS; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), while rs17482078 GA frequency was higher in NBS patients (55.0% NBS vs 22.5% no-NBS; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05, OR: 4.21). &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL23R&lt;/em&gt; rs17375018 GG was more frequent in NBS group (65.0% NBS vs 40.0% no-NBS; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), according to a previous finding. No other statistically significant differences were found. In conclusion, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ERAP1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL23R&lt;/em&gt; SNPs were found associated with neurological involvement of BS. Additional and larger analyses were required to verify our preliminary findings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Cypermethrin Induces the Activation of Rat Primary Microglia and Expression of Inflammatory Proteins</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-020-01753-y</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cypermethrin activates microglia, which is found to be decisive in neurodegeneration in the experimental rats. While the involvement of microglial activation in toxicant-induced neurodegeneration is reported, the effect of low concentration of cypermethrin on the expression of inflammatory proteins from the rat primary microglia is not yet properly understood. The study intended to delineate the effect of low concentration of cypermethrin on the expression and release of proteins from the microglia. Rat primary microglial cells were treated with cypermethrin to check the expression of inflammatory proteins. Cypermethrin-treated microglia conditioned media and cells were collected to measure the expression and release of inflammatory proteins. Cypermethrin augmented the protein kinase C-δ (PKC-δ), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 and p42/44, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3, and MMP-9 levels in the cell lysate and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels in the microglia conditioned media. Pre-treatment with minocycline, a microglial activation inhibitor or rottlerin, a PKC-δ inhibitor, notably reduced the release of TNF-α in the conditioned media and expression of iNOS protein in the microglia. Minocycline reduced the expression of PKC-δ, phosphorylated p38 and p42/44 MAPKs, MMP-3, and MMP-9 proteins in the microglia. While cypermethrin-treated conditioned media induced the toxicity in the rat primary neurons, minocycline or rottlerin reduced the cypermethrin treated microglia conditioned media-induced toxicity. The outcomes of the present study suggest that cypermethrin activates microglia and releases TNF-α and IL-1β as well as up-regulates the expression of PKC-δ, iNOS, phosphorylated p38 and p42/44 MAPKs, MMP-3, and MMP-9 proteins, which could contribute to neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Amyloid-β (Aβ) deposit in the parenchyma is a major characteristic in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and the impaired glymphatic clearance contributes to the Aβ accumulation. It was reported that L-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) showed the potential neuroprotective effect in the rodent models of AD. The effects of NBP on the glymphatic system were explored in this study. In the wild-type mice, both CSF tracer influx and perivascular drainage increased after NBP treatment compared with vehicle treatment. Moreover, NBP promoted the perivascular drainage of Aβ via increased cerebral pulsation, which could be inhibited by propranolol. Then, we studied the potential of 3-month NBP treatment on Aβ deposits in 8-month-old APP/PS1 transgenic mice. NBP daily treatments remarkably improved cognitive behavior in &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus internal-ref refid-sec7&quot;&gt;Morris water maze&lt;/span&gt;. Furthermore, NBP could reduce Aβ deposition and decrease parenchymal Aβ levels. In addition, NBP markedly improved the perivascular AQP4 localization. Our results indicated that NBP could enhance the glymphatic clearance and reduce parenchymal Aβ deposit in the APP/PS1 mice, suggesting that it may have potential in the treatment of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: LncRNA H19 Regulates Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-Induced Apoptosis and Inflammation of BV2 Microglia Cells Through Targeting miR-325-3p/NEUROD4 Axis</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating traumatic event worldwide. Work from the past decade has highlighted the key involvement of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in SCI. Nevertheless, the molecular action of lncRNA H19 in SCI is still not fully understood. The levels of H19, microRNA (miR)-325-3p, and neuronal differentiation 4 (NEUROD4) were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) or western blot. Flow cytometry was performed to assess cell apoptosis. The levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 1β (IL-1β), and IL-6 were detected using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Targeted relationships among H19, miR-325-3p, and NEUROD4 were confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), or RNA pull-down assays. Our data showed that H19 level was overexpressed in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated BV2 cells. H19 silencing alleviated LPS-evoked cell apoptosis and inflammation. Mechanistically, H19 in BV2 cells directly targeted miR-325-3p, and NEUROD4 was a direct target of miR-325-3p. Moreover, miR-325-3p was a functional target of H19 in regulating cell apoptosis and inflammation induced by LPS. Enforced expression of miR-325-3p relieved LPS-evoked cell apoptosis and inflammation through reducing NEUROD4. Furthermore, H19 in BV2 cells regulated NEUROD4 expression through targeting miR-325-3p. Our results identified that the silencing of H19 attenuated LPS-evoked microglia cell apoptosis and inflammation after SCI at least partially through targeting the miR-325-3p/NEUROD4 axis, highlighting a novel approach for SCI management.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Exosomal miR-146a Is Involved in Altered Expression of Alzheimer’s Risk Genes Via Suppression of TLR4 Signaling</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Repeated exposure to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) ligands, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), reduces responses of monocytes/macrophages to LPS (LPS/endotoxin tolerance). Microglial exposure to Aβ deposits, a TLR4 ligand, may cause “Aβ/LPS tolerance,” leading to decreased Aβ clearance. We demonstrated that microglial activation by LPS is diminished in Aβ deposit-bearing 12-month-old model mice of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), compared with non-AD mice and Aβ deposit-free 2-month-old AD mice. Because miR-146a plays a predominant role in inducing TLR tolerance in macrophages and because miR-146a in extracellular vesicles (EVs) shed by inflammatory macrophages increases in circulation, we investigated potential roles of miR-146a and inflammatory EVs in inducing TLR tolerance in microglia and in altering expression of inflammatory AD risk genes. We found that miR-146a upregulation induces TLR tolerance and alters expression of inflammatory AD risk genes in response to LPS treatment in BV2 microglia. LPS brain injection altered expression of the AD risk genes in 12-month-old AD mice but not in non-AD littermates. EVs from inflammatory macrophages polarize BV2 microglia to M1 phenotype and induce TLR tolerance. Microglia exposed to Aβ in the brain show reduced cytokine responses to systemic inflammation due to peripheral LPS injection, indicating TLR/Aβ tolerance in microglia. Our results suggest that increased miR-146a induces microglial Aβ/LPS tolerance and that circulating EVs shed by inflammatory macrophages contribute to microglial Aβ/LPS tolerance, leading to reduced Aβ clearance. Our study also suggests that altered expression of inflammatory AD risk genes may contribute to AD development via the same molecular mechanism underlying LPS tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Glioma is a prevalent primary brain tumor. Temozolomide (TMZ) has been used to treat glioma. However, the resistance of TMZ to glioma poses heavy burden to glioma treatment. In this study, the effects of glioma resistance to TMZ and underlying mechanism were revealed. The expression levels of circ-VPS18, microRNA-370 (miR-370) and runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The protein expression of RUNX1, multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1), and multi-drug resistance gene-1 (MDR1) was determined by western blot. The functional effects of circ-VPS18 knockdown on TMZ sensitivity and glioma progression were revealed by cell counting kit-8 proliferation (CCK-8), flow cytometry, and transwell assays. The impacts of circ-VPS18 deletion on TMZ sensitivity in vivo were illustrated by in vivo tumor formation assay. The binding relationship between miR-370 and circ-VPS18 or RUNX1 was predicted by starBase v2.0 online database and identified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Circ-VPS18 expression and the mRNA and protein levels of RUNX1 were dramatically upregulated, and miR-370 expression was significantly downregulated in glioma cells, TMZ-resistant glioma tissues, or tissue compared with control groups. Functionally, circ-VPS18 knockdown improved TMZ sensitivity, induced cell apoptosis, whereas repressed cell viability, migration and invasion in U251/TR and LN229/TR cells, which was reversed by miR-370 inhibitor. Additionally, RUNX1 overexpression hindered the effects of miR-370 on TMZ sensitivity and glioma progression. Circ-VPS18 knockdown enhanced TMZ sensitivity in vivo. Mechanistically, circ-VPS18 functioned as a sponge of miR-370 and miR-370 targeted RUNX1. Circ-VPS18 knockdown improved TMZ sensitivity and repressed glioma progression by sponging miR-370 to downregulate RUNX1 expression, which provided a new insight in further studying glioma resistance to TMZ.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) poses a significant threat to human life and health. The intraneuronal accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques in the brains of AD patients results in neuronal cell death, which is a key factor that triggers multiple changes in the pathogenesis of AD. The inhibition of Aβ-induced neuronal cell death may potentially help in the intervention and treatment of AD. Our previous study reported that tumor necrosis factor α-induced protein 1 (TNFAIP1) is induced by and promotes Aβ&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;25–35&lt;/sub&gt;-induced neurotoxicity in mouse neuronal cells, but the roles and regulatory mechanisms of TNFAIP1 are still largely unknown. In this study, our experimental results show that TNFAIP1 and p-TNFAIP1 (phosphorylation of TNFAIP1 at Ser280) are overexpressed in the neurons of the cortex and hippocampus in the brains of APP/PS1 mice, and the transcription factor NF-κB is involved in the Aβ-induced upregulation of TNFAIP1. Moreover, our results suggest that TNFAIP1 contributes to the Aβ-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (∆Ψm), and neuronal cell death in human SH-SY5Y cells. We further revealed that Aβ increases the binding of TNFAIP1 to RhoB, and knockdown of RhoB attenuates the TNFAIP1-induced apoptosis of human SH-SY5Y cells. These data suggest that TNFAIP1 is closely associated with AD pathogenesis, and overexpression of TNFAIP1 in the neurons of the brains of AD patients plays a role in apoptosis, at least in part, via RhoB signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Migraine is a prevalent disorder in humans and represents one of the top 10 causes of years lived with disability. Several genetic and environmental factors are involved in the pathobiology of migraine. A number of studies have underscored the role of dysregulated immune reactions. We compared the expression levels &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL-2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL-4&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CXCL8&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL-17&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IFN-γ&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TGF-β&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TNF-α&lt;/em&gt; cytokines in blood specimens of patients with migraine and those of healthy persons to identify any possible dysregulation in their expression and to propose mechanisms for this disorder. Expression of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;INF-γ&lt;/em&gt; was suggestively higher in migraine cases than in healthy individuals (posterior beta = 0.35, adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.017). In addition, expression of this cytokine was lower in female subjects than in male subjects (posterior beta = −0.712, adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.012). Expression of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL-4&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TGF-β&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TNF-α&lt;/em&gt; was also higher in cases compared with controls (posterior beta = 1.34, adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.04; posterior beta = 0.849, adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.036; posterior beta = 0.451, adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.042, respectively). On the other hand, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CXCL8&lt;/em&gt; expression was lower in migraine cases than in controls (posterior beta = −0.78, adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.039).

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Women with epilepsy are at increased risk of sexual dysfunction. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the effect of antiepileptic drugs on sexual function and satisfaction in women with epilepsy. In this cross-sectional study, 80 married women with epilepsy who were under treatment with antiepileptic drugs for at least 1 year were evaluated. Sexual function in patients was assessed using the Female Sexual Function Index. The mean age (± standard deviation [SD]) of women was 28.8 (± 5.9) years. The mean (± SD) duration of epilepsy was 8.6 (± 4.1) years. Thirteen women (16.2%) had focal epilepsy and 67 (83.7%) had generalized epilepsy. The mean (± SD) overall sexual performance of patients was 20.5 (± 4.7). Fifteen patients (21.3%) had decreased sexual function and 78.2% had unfavorable sexual performance. Generalized epilepsy, multi-drug regimen, disease duration of more than 10 years, and age &amp;gt; 30 years were associated with sexual dysfunction. Due to the high prevalence of sexual dysfunction in women with epilepsy, special attention should be given to appropriate management of these patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Two young female adults in their 20s were enrolled in this study. Clinical data, including symptoms, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning, and laboratory studies were collected. Sequence alignment and structural modeling were carried out to analyze the pathogenesis of the disease. Both patients were adult-onset and both had a mild clinical course, presented with spastic weakness. The MRI study showed demyelination confined to the corticospinal tracts and parieto-occipital white matter. The β-galactocerebrosidase (GALC) activity was obviously decreased in both patients. Gene test of GALC showed that both patients were compound heterozygotes; proband I was a carrier of p.L634S (c.1901 T &amp;gt; C) and p.I250T (c.749 T &amp;gt; C), while proband II was a carrier of p.L634S (c.1901 T &amp;gt; C) and a new variant of c.283_284del. Molecular analysis revealed the variants may influence the function of GALC. We provided two Chinese adult-onset KD, and the clinical and genetic characteristics of proband II was especially rare due to asymmetric symptoms, spinal cord involvement, and the identification of a new point mutation c.283_284del in the GALC gene. Variant c.749 T &amp;gt; C can present mild syndromes except for severe cases. c.283_284del is a new variant that may occur in adult-onset type.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Previous studies have shown that lncRNA NEAT1 and miR-29b are closely associated with repair of the injured spinal cord. However, the mechanism by which lncRNA NEAT1 promotes regeneration after spinal cord injury by regulating miR-29b has not been reported. To explore this mechanism, we established a rat model of spinal cord injury (SCI). The experimental rats were randomly assigned to one of six groups: the sham, model, si-NEAT1, miR-29b, si-NEAT1 + negative control and si-NEAT1 + si-miR-29b groups. The hind limb motor function of the rats was evaluated on days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21 after modelling using the BBB rating scale. Seven days after the operation, attenuation of pathological changes in injured spinal cord tissues was evaluated by HE staining. Anterior horn neurons and cavities in the injured area were counted by Nissl staining. In addition, the TUNEL assay was employed to study neuronal apoptosis in the anterior horn, and the expression of the apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bax was analysed by western blotting. Finally, the protein expression of GFAP, NCAM, GAP43, and SCG10 was measured by immunohistochemistry and western blotting. BBB scores revealed that decreasing the level of NEAT1 improved the hind limb motor function of the rats by increasing miR-29b expression. H&amp;amp;E and Nissl staining showed that silencing NEAT1 attenuated lesions in the spinal cord and decreased the number of cavities in the injured spinal cord by upregulating miR-29b. Immunohistochemistry and western blotting suggested that silencing NEAT1 significantly downregulated GFAP expression and upregulated GAP43, SCG10 and NCAM expression by inducing overexpression of miR-29b. The TUNEL assay and western blotting also showed that silencing NEAT1 attenuated neuronal apoptosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;It has been suggested that dysregulation of hormones is associated with schizophrenia (SCZ). This study aimed to measure the serum levels of progesterone and testosterone in 125 SCZ patients at different stages of treatment and 96 healthy control (HC) subjects. Our results showed that first-episode drug-free SCZ patients had significantly increased testosterone levels when compared with HC subjects, and chronic medication, but not short-term medication, further increased the serum testosterone levels in the patients. Further analysis suggested that the sex of the patients did not affect testosterone levels. In contrast, serum progesterone levels did not show significant differences between first-episode, drug-free SCZ patients and controls, and the antipsychotics increased progesterone levels in the male SCZ patients, but not female patients. Interestingly, our analyses demonstrated that the serum progesterone levels were negatively correlated with PANSS total score and PNASS positive score, suggesting a correlation between blood hormone levels and disease severity in SCZ patients. Taken together, our data showed differential changes in serum testosterone and progesterone levels in SCZ patients with or without antipsychotics, and our results suggest that increased sex hormone levels may be a defensive response to protect the human body under stress.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most lethal malignancies of the central nervous system characterized by high mortality rate. The complexity of GBM pathogenesis, progression, and prognosis is not fully understood yet. GBM-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) carry several oncogenic elements that facilitate GBM progression. The purpose of this study was to identify systems level molecular signatures from GBM-derived EVs using integrative analysis of publicly available transcriptomic data generated from plasma and serum samples. The dataset contained 19 samples in total, of which 15 samples were from plasma (11 GBM patients and 4 healthy samples) and 4 samples were from serum (2 GBM and 2 healthy samples). We carried out statistical analysis to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), functional enrichment analysis of the DEGs, protein–protein interaction networks, module analysis, transcription factors and target gene regulatory networks analysis, and identification of hub genes. The differential expression of the identified hub genes were validated with the independent TCGA-GBM dataset. We have identified a few crucial genes and pathways associated with GBM prognosis and therapy resistance. The DEGs identified from plasma were associated with inflammatory processes and viral infection. On the other hand, the hub genes identified from the serum samples were significantly associated with protein ubiquitinylation processes and cytokine signaling regulation. The findings indicate that GBM-derived plasma and serum DEGs may be associated with distinct cellular processes and pathways which facilitate GBM progression. The findings will provide better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of GBM pathogenesis and progression. These results can further be utilized for developing and validating minimally invasive diagnostic and therapeutic molecular biomarkers for GBM.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Non-nutritive sweeteners (NNSs) are commonly used to prevent weight gain and development of metabolic diseases associated with consumption of high-energy diets. Recent studies have demonstrated that these compounds may have unwanted detrimental effects under specific circumstances in vivo. In particular, an association between NNS consumption and changes in signaling pathways involved in the hunger-satiety system in the brain has been reported. Nonetheless, the extent of alterations in brain signaling pathways associated with consumption of these compounds has not been determined. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of frequent consumption of NNSs on the expression of proteins involved in signaling pathways related to appetite control in the brain in vivo. Eight-week-old BALB/c mice were supplemented with sucrose, sucralose, or steviol glycosides in their daily drinking water for 6 weeks. Subsequently, total brain protein extracts were used to analyze the expression of total and phosphorylated JAK2, STAT5, ERK 1/2, JNK, as well as SHP-2 and POMC, by western blot. Serum concentrations of leptin and α-MSH were quantified by ELISA. Results show that consumption of NNSs promotes significant changes in these signaling pathways, reducing the expression of pSTAT5/STAT5, pERK 1/2, SHP-2, and pJNK/JNK in male mice supplemented with steviol glycosides. Furthermore, consumption of steviol glycosides induced a decrease of α-MSH in male mice. In contrast, steviol glycosides induced overexpression of pSTAT5, pERK, and SHP-2 in females. These data suggest that chronic consumption of NNSs promotes sex-specific changes in signaling pathways related to the central hunger-satiety system in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;As an important endogenous growth factor, PDGF-BB can effectively promote neurogenesis, thus is considered as a potential agent for Parkinson’s disease (PD) therapy. However, the protective function of PDGF-BB on neuronal cells, especially the molecular mechanism, remains less clear, which is needed to explore before its clinical practice. In this study, we investigated the function and mechanism of PDGF-BB against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells, a widely used cellular tool for PD-related molecular study. Our results indicated that PDGF-BB exerts a prominent protective effect against neurotoxin MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-triggered ROS generation and cellular loss. We further dissected the molecular mechanism involved in this process by using specific pharmacological inhibitors and validated that the distinct signaling pathways PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β and MEK/ERK are involved in the process against MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; toxicity upon PDGF-BB treatment. We also detected that activation of upstream PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β and MER/ERK signaling pathways contribute to phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the downstream effector cyclic response element-binding protein (CREB), a known transcription factor to exhibit neuroprotective and growth-promoting effects. Using genetic approach, we further confirmed that the activation of CREB is involved in PDGF-BB-mediated protection in MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-exposed SH-SY5Y cells. Together, these data demonstrated the protective effect of PDGF-BB in MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-mediated toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells and verified the involved molecular mechanism in PDGF-BB-mediated neuroprotection.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recently, deep learning has been an area of intense researching. However, as
a kind of computing intensive task, deep learning highly relies on the the
scale of the GPU memory, which is usually expensive and scarce. Although there
are some extensive works have been proposed for dynamic GPU memory management,
they are hard to be applied to systems with multitasking dynamic workloads,
such as in-database machine learning system.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we demonstrated TENSILE, a method of managing GPU memory in
tensor granularity to reduce the GPU memory peak, with taking the multitasking
dynamic workloads into consideration. As far as we know, TENSILE is the first
method which is designed to manage multiple workloads' GPU memory using. We
implement TENSILE on our own deep learning framework, and evaluated its
performance. The experiment results shows that our method can achieve less time
overhead than prior works with more GPU memory saved.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Temporal Neural Networks (TNNs) are spiking neural networks that use time as
a resource to represent and process information, similar to the mammalian
neocortex. In contrast to compute-intensive Deep Neural Networks that employ
separate training and inference phases, TNNs are capable of extremely efficient
online incremental/continuous learning and are excellent candidates for
building edge-native sensory processing units. This work proposes a
microarchitecture framework for implementing TNNs using standard CMOS.
Gate-level implementations of three key building blocks are presented: 1)
multi-synapse neurons, 2) multi-neuron columns, and 3) unsupervised and
supervised online learning algorithms based on Spike Timing Dependent
Plasticity (STDP). The TNN microarchitecture is embodied in a set of
characteristic scaling equations for assessing the gate count, area, delay and
power consumption for any TNN design. Post-synthesis results (in 45nm CMOS) for
the proposed designs are presented, and their online incremental learning

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Implicit equilibrium models, i.e., deep neural networks (DNNs) defined by
implicit equations, have been becoming more and more attractive recently. In
this paper, we investigate one emerging question if model's equilibrium point
can be regarded as the solution of an optimization problem. Specifically, we
first decompose DNNs into a new class of unit layer that is differential of an
implicit convex function while keeping its output unchanged. Then, the
equilibrium model of the unit layer can be derived, named Optimization Induced
Equilibrium Networks (OptEq), which can be easily extended to deep layers. The
equilibrium point of OptEq can be theoretically connected to the solution of
its corresponding convex optimization problem with explicit objectives. Based
on this, we can flexibly introduce prior properties to the equilibrium points:
1) modifying the underlying convex problems explicitly so as to change the
architectures of OptEq; and 2) merging the information into the fixed point
iteration, which guarantees to choose the desired equilibrium when the fixed
point set is non-singleton. This work establishes an important first step
towards optimization guided design of deep models.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13108</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Swarm intelligence optimization algorithms can be adopted in swarm robotics
for target searching tasks in a 2-D or 3-D space by treating the target signal
strength as fitness values. Many current works in the literature have achieved
good performance in single-target search problems. However, when there are
multiple targets in an environment to be searched, many swarm
intelligence-based methods may converge to specific locations prematurely,
making it impossible to explore the environment further. The Brain Storm
Optimization (BSO) algorithm imitates a group of humans in solving problems
collectively. A series of guided searches can finally obtain a relatively
optimal solution for particular optimization problems. Furthermore, with a
suitable clustering operation, it has better multi-modal optimization
performance, i.e., it can find multiple optima in the objective space. By
matching the members in a robotic swarm to the individuals in the algorithm
under both environments and robots constraints, this paper proposes a BSO-based
collaborative searching framework for swarm robotics called Robotic BSO. The
simulation results show that the proposed method can simulate the BSO's guided
search characteristics and has an excellent prospect for multi-target searching
problems for swarm robotics.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Attention-oriented Brain Storm Optimization for Multimodal Optimization Problems. (arXiv:2105.13095v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13095</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Population-based methods are often used to solve multimodal optimization
problems. By combining niching or clustering strategy, the state-of-the-art
approaches generally divide the population into several subpopulations to find
multiple solutions for a problem at hand. However, these methods only guided by
the fitness value during iterations, which are suffering from determining the
number of subpopulations, i.e., the number of niche areas or clusters. To
compensate for this drawback, this paper presents an Attention-oriented Brain
Storm Optimization (ABSO) method that introduces the attention mechanism into a
relatively new swarm intelligence algorithm, i.e., Brain Storm Optimization
(BSO). By converting the objective space from the fitness space into
&quot;attention&quot; space, the individuals are clustered and updated iteratively
according to their salient values. Rather than converge to a single global
optimum, the proposed method can guide the search procedure to converge to
multiple &quot;salient&quot; solutions. The preliminary results show that the proposed
method can locate multiple global and local optimal solutions of several
multimodal benchmark functions. The proposed method needs less prior knowledge
of the problem and can automatically converge to multiple optimums guided by
the attention mechanism, which has excellent potential for further development.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spiking neural networks (SNNs) transmit information through discrete spikes,
which performs well in processing spatial-temporal information. Due to the
non-differentiable characteristic, there still exist difficulties in designing
well-performed SNNs. Recently, SNNs trained with backpropagation have shown
superior performance due to the proposal of the gradient approximation.
However, the performance on complex tasks is still far away from the deep
neural networks. Taking inspiration from the autapse in the brain which
connects the spiking neurons with a self-feedback connection, we apply an
adaptive time-delayed self-feedback on the membrane potential to regulate the
spike precisions. As well as, we apply the balanced excitatory and inhibitory
neurons mechanism to control the spiking neurons' output dynamically. With the
combination of the two mechanisms, we propose a deep spiking neural network
with adaptive self-feedback and balanced excitatory and inhibitory neurons
(BackEISNN). The experimental results on several standard datasets have shown
that the two modules not only accelerate the convergence of the network but
also improve the accuracy. For the MNIST, FashionMNIST, and N-MNIST datasets,
our model has achieved state-of-the-art performance. For the CIFAR10 dataset,
our BackEISNN also gets remarkable performance on a relatively light structure
that competes against state-of-the-art SNNs.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The Organization of Behavior&quot; (Hebb, 1949), Hebb suggested that the
propagation of activity between transiently grouped neurons plays an important
role in behavior. Since then, multiple studies have provided evidence
supporting Hebb's claim; however, most findings have been found locally in
confined brain regions during unimodal tasks. Here we report on brain-wide
behavioral-specific sequences in humans performing a multimodal task. To
investigate the structure of these sequences, we used MEG to record brain
activity in multiple brain regions simultaneously in participants performing a
sensory-motor synchronization task. We detected local transient events
corresponding to synchronously activating populations of pyramidal neurons and
searched for their global organization as spatio-temporal patterns of
activation sequences between distant neural populations. We focused our
analysis on two types of spatio-temporal patterns: the most frequently
repeating patterns and the most discriminative patterns, to concentrate on
patterns with high relevancy to behavior. The findings revealed that global
temporally precise sequences can be found and that these sequences have
partially stereotypical characteristics, both temporally and spatially, with
consistent properties across subjects. By implementing a simplistic
single-trial decoding approach, we found that brain-wide sequences have a
temporal precision of 17-31 milliseconds, which resembles the temporal
precision found locally in neural assemblies.

would be useful in many areas, such as video game level generation. Game levels
often consist of several segments, sometimes repeated directly or with
variation, organized into an engaging pattern. Such patterns can be produced
with Compositional Pattern Producing Networks (CPPNs). Specifically, a CPPN can
define latent vector GAN inputs as a function of geometry, which provides a way
to organize level segments output by a GAN into a complete level. However, a
collection of latent vectors can also be evolved directly, to produce more
chaotic levels. Here, we propose a new hybrid approach that evolves CPPNs
first, but allows the latent vectors to evolve later, and combines the benefits
of both approaches. These approaches are evaluated in Super Mario Bros. and The
Legend of Zelda. We previously demonstrated via divergent search (MAP-Elites)
that CPPNs better cover the space of possible levels than directly evolved
levels. Here, we show that the hybrid approach can cover areas that neither of
the other methods can and achieves comparable or superior QD scores.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12917</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The spiking neural network (SNN) computes and communicates information
through discrete binary events. It is considered more biologically plausible
and more energy-efficient than artificial neural networks (ANN) in emerging
neuromorphic hardware. However, due to the discontinuous and non-differentiable
characteristics, training SNN is a relatively challenging task. Recent work has
achieved essential progress on an excellent performance by converting ANN to
SNN. Due to the difference in information processing, the converted deep SNN
usually suffers serious performance loss and large time delay. In this paper,
we analyze the reasons for the performance loss and propose a novel bistable
spiking neural network (BSNN) that addresses the problem of spikes of
inactivated neurons (SIN) caused by the phase lead and phase lag. Also, when
ResNet structure-based ANNs are converted, the information of output neurons is
incomplete due to the rapid transmission of the shortcut path. We design
synchronous neurons (SN) to help efficiently improve performance. Experimental
results show that the proposed method only needs 1/4-1/10 of the time steps
compared to previous work to achieve nearly lossless conversion. We demonstrate
state-of-the-art ANN-SNN conversion for VGG16, ResNet20, and ResNet34 on
challenging datasets including CIFAR-10 (95.16% top-1), CIFAR-100 (78.12%
top-1), and ImageNet (72.64% top-1).

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12916</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Building machine learning models using EEG recorded outside of the laboratory
setting requires methods robust to noisy data and randomly missing channels.
This need is particularly great when working with sparse EEG montages (1-6
channels), often encountered in consumer-grade or mobile EEG devices. Neither
classical machine learning models nor deep neural networks trained end-to-end
on EEG are typically designed or tested for robustness to corruption, and
especially to randomly missing channels. While some studies have proposed
strategies for using data with missing channels, these approaches are not
practical when sparse montages are used and computing power is limited (e.g.,
wearables, cell phones). To tackle this problem, we propose dynamic spatial
filtering (DSF), a multi-head attention module that can be plugged in before
the first layer of a neural network to handle missing EEG channels by learning
to focus on good channels and to ignore bad ones. We tested DSF on public EEG
data encompassing ~4,000 recordings with simulated channel corruption and on a
private dataset of ~100 at-home recordings of mobile EEG with natural
corruption. Our proposed approach achieves the same performance as baseline
models when no noise is applied, but outperforms baselines by as much as 29.4%
accuracy when significant channel corruption is present. Moreover, DSF outputs
are interpretable, making it possible to monitor channel importance in
real-time. This approach has the potential to enable the analysis of EEG in
challenging settings where channel corruption hampers the reading of brain
signals.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12836</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuroevolutionary algorithms, automatic searches of neural network structures
by means of evolutionary techniques, are computationally costly procedures. In
spite of this, due to the great performance provided by the architectures which
are found, these methods are widely applied. The final outcome of
neuroevolutionary processes is the best structure found during the search, and
the rest of the procedure is commonly omitted in the literature. However, a
good amount of residual information consisting of valuable knowledge that can
be extracted is also produced during these searches. In this paper, we propose
an approach that extracts this information from neuroevolutionary runs, and use
it to build a metamodel that could positively impact future neural architecture
searches. More specifically, by inspecting the best structures found during
neuroevolutionary searches of generative adversarial networks with varying
characteristics (e.g., based on dense or convolutional layers), we propose a
Bayesian network-based model which can be used to either find strong neural
structures right away, conveniently initialize different structural searches
for different problems, or help future optimization of structures of any type
to keep finding increasingly better structures where uninformed methods get
stuck into local optima.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;With the rapidly growing use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in
real-world applications related to machine learning and Artificial Intelligence
(AI), several hardware accelerator designs for CNN inference and training have
been proposed recently. In this paper, we present ATRIA, a novel bit-pArallel
sTochastic aRithmetic based In-DRAM Accelerator for energy-efficient and
high-speed inference of CNNs. ATRIA employs light-weight modifications in DRAM
cell arrays to implement bit-parallel stochastic arithmetic based acceleration
of multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations inside DRAM. ATRIA significantly
improves the latency, throughput, and efficiency of processing CNN inferences
by performing 16 MAC operations in only five consecutive memory operation
cycles. We mapped the inference tasks of four benchmark CNNs on ATRIA to
compare its performance with five state-of-the-art in-DRAM CNN accelerators
from prior work. The results of our analysis show that ATRIA exhibits only 3.5%
drop in CNN inference accuracy and still achieves improvements of up to 3.2x in
frames-per-second (FPS) and up to 10x in efficiency (FPS/W/mm2), compared to
the best-performing in-DRAM accelerator from prior work.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12770</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the way human brain works, the emerging hyperdimensional
computing (HDC) is getting more and more attention. HDC is an emerging
computing scheme based on the working mechanism of brain that computes with
deep and abstract patterns of neural activity instead of actual numbers.
Compared with traditional ML algorithms such as DNN, HDC is more
memory-centric, granting it advantages such as relatively smaller model size,
less computation cost, and one-shot learning, making it a promising candidate
in low-cost computing platforms. However, the robustness of HDC models have not
been systematically studied. In this paper, we systematically expose the
unexpected or incorrect behaviors of HDC models by developing HDXplore, a
blackbox differential testing-based framework. We leverage multiple HDC models
with similar functionality as cross-referencing oracles to avoid manual
checking or labeling the original input. We also propose different perturbation
mechanisms in HDXplore. HDXplore automatically finds thousands of incorrect
corner case behaviors of the HDC model. We propose two retraining mechanisms
and using the corner cases generated by HDXplore to retrain the HDC model, we
can improve the model accuracy by up to 9%.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: The Role of Unimodal Feedback Pathways in Gender Perception During Activation of Voice and Face Areas</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.669256</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cross-modal effects provide a model framework for investigating hierarchical inter-areal processing, particularly, under conditions where unimodal cortical areas receive contextual feedback from other modalities. Here, using complementary behavioral and brain imaging techniques, we investigated the functional networks participating in face and voice processing during gender perception, a high-level feature of voice and face perception. Within the framework of a signal detection decision model, Maximum likelihood conjoint measurement (MLCM) was used to estimate the contributions of the face and voice to gender comparisons between pairs of audio-visual stimuli in which the face and voice were independently modulated. Top–down contributions were varied by instructing participants to make judgments based on the gender of either the face, the voice or both modalities (N = 12 for each task). Estimated face and voice contributions to the judgments of the stimulus pairs were not independent; both contributed to all tasks, but their respective weights varied over a 40-fold range due to top–down influences. Models that best described the modal contributions required the inclusion of two different top–down interactions: (i) an interaction that depended on gender congruence across modalities (i.e., difference between face and voice modalities for each stimulus); (ii) an interaction that depended on the within modalities’ gender magnitude. The significance of these interactions was task dependent. Specifically, gender congruence interaction was significant for the face and voice tasks while the gender magnitude interaction was significant for the face and stimulus tasks. Subsequently, we used the same stimuli and related tasks in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm (N = 12) to explore the neural correlates of these perceptual processes, analyzed with Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) and Bayesian Model Selection. Results revealed changes in effective connectivity between the unimodal Fusiform Face Area (FFA) and Temporal Voice Area (TVA) in a fashion that paralleled the face and voice behavioral interactions observed in the psychophysical data. These findings explore the role in perception of multiple unimodal parallel feedback pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.652662</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this work we propose a machine learning (ML) method to aid in the diagnosis of schizophrenia using electroencephalograms (EEGs) as input data. The computational algorithm not only yields a proposal of diagnostic but, even more importantly, it provides additional information that admits clinical interpretation. It is based on an ML model called random forest that operates on connectivity metrics extracted from the EEG signals. Specifically, we use measures of generalized partial directed coherence (GPDC) and direct directed transfer function (dDTF) to construct the input features to the ML model. The latter allows the identification of the most performance-wise relevant features which, in turn, provide some insights about EEG signals and frequency bands that are associated with schizophrenia. Our preliminary results on real data show that signals associated with the occipital region seem to play a significant role in the diagnosis of the disease. Moreover, although every frequency band might yield useful information for the diagnosis, the beta and theta (frequency) bands provide features that are ultimately more relevant for the ML classifier that we have implemented.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Targeting Endocannabinoid Signaling in the Lateral Habenula as an Intervention to Prevent Mental Illnesses Following Early Life Stress: A Perspective</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2021.689518</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Adverse events and childhood trauma increase the susceptibility towards developing psychiatric disorders (substance use disorder, anxiety, depression, etc.) in adulthood. Although there are treatment strategies that have utility in combating these psychiatric disorders, little attention is placed on how to therapeutically intervene in children exposed to early life stress (ELS) to prevent the development of later psychopathology. The lateral habenula (LHb) has been a topic of extensive investigation in mental health disorders due to its prominent role in emotion and mood regulation through modulation of brain reward and motivational neural circuits. Importantly, rodent models of ELS have been shown to promote LHb dysfunction. Moreover, one of the potential mechanisms contributing to LHb neuronal and synaptic dysfunction involves endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling, which has been observed to critically regulate emotion/mood and motivation. Many pre-clinical studies targeting eCB signaling suggest that this neuromodulatory system could be exploited as an intervention therapy to halt maladaptive processes that promote dysfunction in reward and motivational neural circuits involving the LHb. In this perspective article, we report what is currently known about the role of eCB signaling in LHb function and discuss our opinions on new research directions to determine whether the eCB system is a potentially attractive therapeutic intervention for the prevention and/or treatment of ELS-associated psychiatric illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As a significant public health issue, chronic pain, mainly neuropathic pain (NP) and inflammatory pain, has a severe impact. The underlying mechanisms of chronic pain are enigmatic at present. The roles of ubiquitin have been demonstrated in various physiological and pathological conditions and underscore its potential as therapeutic targets. The dysfunction of the component of the ubiquitin system that occurs during chronic pain is rapidly being discovered. These results provide insight into potential molecular mechanisms of chronic pain. Chronic pain is regulated by ubiquitination, SUMOylation, ubiquitin ligase, and deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB), etc. Insight into the mechanism of the ubiquitin system regulating chronic pain might contribute to relevant therapeutic targets and the development of novel analgesics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Cannabidiol Displays Proteomic Similarities to Antipsychotics in Cuprizone-Exposed Human Oligodendrocytic Cell Line MO3.13</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.673144</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cannabidiol, a compound of Cannabis sativa, has been proposed as an alternative treatment of schizophrenia. Preclinical and clinical data have suggested that cannabidiol shares more similarity with atypical antipsychotics than typical, both of which are customarily used to manage schizophrenia symptoms. While oligodendrocytes are known to be relevant targets of antipsychotics, the biochemical knowledge in this regard is still limited. Here we evaluated the molecular pathways modulated by cannabidiol compared to the antipsychotics clozapine (atypical) and haloperidol (typical), additionally evaluating the effects of benztropine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist that displays a protective effect in oligodendrocytes and myelination. For this purpose, we employed nano-chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry to investigate the proteomic response to these drugs both in healthy oligodendrocytic cells and in a cuprizone-based toxicity model, using the human oligodendrocyte precursor cell line MO3.13. Cannabidiol shares similarities of biochemical pathways with clozapine and benztropine, in agreement with other studies that indicated an atypical antipsychotic profile. All drugs tested affected metabolic and gene expression pathways and cannabidiol, benztropine, and clozapine modulated cell proliferation and apoptosis when administered after cuprizone-induced toxicity. These general pathways are associated with cuprizone-induced cytotoxicity in MO3.13 cells, indicating a possible proteomic approach when acting against the toxic effects of cuprizone. In conclusion, although modeling oligodendrocytic cytotoxicity with cuprizone does not represent the entirety of the pathophysiology of oligodendrocyte impairments, these results provide insight into the mechanisms associated with the effects of cannabidiol and antipsychotics against cuprizone toxicity, offering new directions of study for myelin-related processes and deficits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.657514</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes play a crucial role in the maintenance of the normal functions of the Central Nervous System (CNS). During the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, astrocytes undergo morphological and functional remodeling, a process called reactive astrogliosis, in response to the insults to the CNS. One of the key aspects of the reactive astrocytes is the change in the expression and function of connexins. Connexins are channel proteins that highly expressed in astrocytes, forming gap junction channels and hemichannels, allowing diffusional trafficking of small molecules. Alterations of astrocytic connexin expression and function found in neurodegenerative diseases have been shown to affect the disease progression by changing neuronal function and survival. In this review, we will summarize the role of astroglial connexins in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Also, we will discuss why targeting connexins can be a plausible therapeutic strategy to manage these neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Post-stroke Delivery of Valproic Acid Promotes Functional Recovery and Differentially Modifies Responses of Peri-Infarct Microglia</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.639145</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The specific role of peri-infarct microglia and the timing of its morphological changes following ischemic stroke are not well understood. Valproic acid (VPA) can protect against ischemic damage and promote recovery. In this study, we first determined whether a single dose of VPA after stroke could decrease infarction area or improve functional recovery. Next, we investigated the number and morphological characteristic of peri-infarct microglia at different time points and elucidated the mechanism of microglial response by VPA treatment. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAo) for 90 min, followed by reperfusion. Some received a single injection of VPA (200 mg/kg) 90 min after the induction of ischemia, while vehicle-treated animals underwent the same procedure with physiological saline. Infarction volume was calculated at 48 h after reperfusion, and neurological symptoms were evaluated. VPA didn’t significantly reduce infarct volume but did ameliorate neurological deficit at least partially compared with vehicle. Meanwhile, VPA reduced dMCAo-induced elevation of IL-6 at 24 h post-stroke and significantly decreased the number of CD11b-positive microglia within peri-infarct cortex at 7 days. Morphological analysis revealed that VPA therapy leads to higher fractal dimensions, smaller soma size and lower circularity index of CD11b-positive cells within peri-infarct cortex at both 2 and 7 days, suggesting that VPA has core effects on microglial morphology. The modulation of microglia morphology caused by VPA might involve HDAC inhibition-mediated suppression of galectin-3 production. Furthermore, qPCR analysis of CD11b-positive cells at 3 days post-stroke suggested that VPA could partially enhance M2 subset polarization of microglia in peri-infarct cortex. Analysis of VPA-induced changes to gene expressions at 3 days post-stroke implies that these alternations of the biomarkers and microglial responses are implicated in the upregulation of wound healing, collagen trimmer, and extracellular matrix genes within peri-infarct cortex. Our results are the first to show that a low dose of VPA promotes short-term functional recovery but does not alter infarct volume. The decreases in the expression of both IL-6 and galectin-3 might influence the morphological characteristics and transcriptional profiles of microglia and extracellular matrix remodeling, which could contribute to the improved recovery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Oral Administration of Brain Protein Combined With Probiotics Induces Immune Tolerance Through the Tryptophan Pathway</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.634631</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Excessive inflammation leads to secondary immune damage after traumatic brain injury (TBI). The intestinal mucosa is a key component of immune tolerance due to gut-brain axis regulation, but the curative effect is not optimal. Intestinal dysfunction impairs the establishment of immune tolerance in patients with TBI. Therefore, we orally administered brain protein (BP) combined with probiotics to induce immune tolerance and explored the mechanism by which the homeostasis of the microbiota contributes to the enhancement of curative effects by BPs. Herein, we demonstrated that patients with TBI and surgical brain injury (SBI) models of rats had obvious dysbiosis. Notably, the intestinal barrier, proinflammatory cytokines, and activation of microglia demonstrated that excessive inflammatory damage was better controlled in the combined group (oral administration of BP combined with probiotics) than in the BP group (oral administration of BP). Fundamentally, tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomics analysis revealed that BP and probiotics preferentially affect Try-related pathways. A series of experiments further confirmed that Indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO)/Kynurenine (Kyn)/Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) expression was high in the BP group, while Tryptophan hydroxylase 1(TpH1)/5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) only changed in the combined group. This study suggests that probiotics can enhance the efficacy of oral BP-induced immune tolerance through the Try pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: A Transfer Model Based on Supervised Multi-Layer Dictionary Learning for Brain Tumor MRI Image Recognition</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.687496</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) is an effective technology for automatic brain tumor MRI image recognition. The training of an AI model requires a large number of labeled data, but medical data needs to be labeled by professional clinicians, which makes data collection complex and expensive. Moreover, a traditional AI model requires that the training data and test data must follow the independent and identically distributed. To solve this problem, we propose a transfer model based on supervised multi-layer dictionary learning (TSMDL) for brain tumor MRI image recognition in this paper. With the help of the knowledge learned from related domains, the goal of this model is to solve the task of transfer learning where the target domain has only a small number of labeled samples. Based on the framework of multi-layer dictionary learning, the proposed model learns the common shared dictionary of source and target domains in each layer to explore the intrinsic connections and shared information between different domains. At the same time, by making full use of the label information of samples, the Laplacian regularization term is introduced to make the dictionary coding of similar samples as close as possible and the dictionary coding of different class samples as different as possible. The recognition experiments on brain MRI image datasets REMBRANDT and Figshare show that the model performs better than competitive state of-the-art methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.679847</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain tumor image classification is an important part of medical image processing. It assists doctors to make accurate diagnosis and treatment plans. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is one of the main imaging tools to study brain tissue. In this article, we propose a brain tumor MR image classification method using convolutional dictionary learning with local constraint (CDLLC). Our method integrates the multi-layer dictionary learning into a convolutional neural network (CNN) structure to explore the discriminative information. Encoding a vector on a dictionary can be considered as multiple projections into new spaces, and the obtained coding vector is sparse. Meanwhile, in order to preserve the geometric structure of data and utilize the supervised information, we construct the local constraint of atoms through a supervised k-nearest neighbor graph, so that the discrimination of the obtained dictionary is strong. To solve the proposed problem, an efficient iterative optimization scheme is designed. In the experiment, two clinically relevant multi-class classification tasks on the Cheng and REMBRANDT datasets are designed. The evaluation results demonstrate that our method is effective for brain tumor MR image classification, and it could outperform other comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Explainable Deep Learning for Personalized Age Prediction With Brain Morphology</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.674055</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Predicting brain age has become one of the most attractive challenges in computational neuroscience due to the role of the predicted age as an effective biomarker for different brain diseases and conditions. A great variety of machine learning (ML) approaches and deep learning (DL) techniques have been proposed to predict age from brain magnetic resonance imaging scans. If on one hand, DL models could improve performance and reduce model bias compared to other less complex ML methods, on the other hand, they are typically black boxes as do not provide an in-depth understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods have been recently introduced to provide interpretable decisions of ML and DL algorithms both at local and global level. In this work, we present an explainable DL framework to predict the age of a healthy cohort of subjects from ABIDE I database by using the morphological features extracted from their MRI scans. We embed the two local XAI methods SHAP and LIME to explain the outcomes of the DL models, determine the contribution of each brain morphological descriptor to the final predicted age of each subject and investigate the reliability of the two methods. Our findings indicate that the SHAP method can provide more reliable explanations for the morphological aging mechanisms and be exploited to identify personalized age-related imaging biomarker.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Classification-Biased Apparent Brain Age for the Prediction of Alzheimer's Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.673120</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Machine Learning methods are often adopted to infer useful biomarkers for the early diagnosis of many neurodegenerative diseases and, in general, of neuroanatomical ageing. Some of these methods estimate the subject age from morphological brain data, which is then indicated as “brain age”. The difference between such a predicted brain age and the actual chronological age of a subject can be used as an indication of a pathological deviation from normal brain ageing. An important use of the brain age model as biomarker is the prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Many different machine learning approaches have been applied to this specific predictive task, some of which have achieved high accuracy at the expense of the descriptiveness of the model. This work investigates an appropriate combination of data science techniques and linear models to provide, at the same time, high accuracy and good descriptiveness. The proposed method is based on a data workflow that include typical data science methods, such as outliers detection, feature selection, linear regression, and logistic regression. In particular, a novel inductive bias is introduced in the regression model, which is aimed at improving the accuracy and the specificity of the classification task. The method is compared to other machine learning approaches for AD classification based on morphological brain data with and without the use of the brain age, including Support Vector Machines and Deep Neural Networks. This study adopts brain MRI scans of 1, 901 subjects which have been acquired from three repositories (ADNI, AIBL, and IXI). A predictive model based only on the proposed apparent brain age and the chronological age has an accuracy of 88% and 92%, respectively, for male and female subjects, in a repeated cross-validation analysis, thus achieving a comparable or superior performance than state of the art machine learning methods. The advantage of the proposed method is that it maintains the morphological semantics of the input space throughout the regression and classification tasks. The accurate predictive model is also highly descriptive and can be used to generate potentially useful insights on the predictions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Dynamics of Long-Range Temporal Correlations in Broadband EEG During Different Motor Execution and Imagery Tasks</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.660032</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain activity is composed of oscillatory and broadband arrhythmic components; however, there is more focus on oscillatory sensorimotor rhythms to study movement, but temporal dynamics of broadband arrhythmic electroencephalography (EEG) remain unexplored. We have previously demonstrated that broadband arrhythmic EEG contains both short- and long-range temporal correlations that change significantly during movement. In this study, we build upon our previous work to gain a deeper understanding of these changes in the long-range temporal correlation (LRTC) in broadband EEG and contrast them with the well-known LRTC in alpha oscillation amplitude typically found in the literature. We investigate and validate changes in LRTCs during five different types of movements and motor imagery tasks using two independent EEG datasets recorded with two different paradigms—our finger tapping dataset with single self-initiated asynchronous finger taps and publicly available EEG dataset containing cued continuous movement and motor imagery of fists and feet. We quantified instantaneous changes in broadband LRTCs by detrended fluctuation analysis on single trial 2 s EEG sliding windows. The broadband LRTC increased significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.05) during all motor tasks as compared to the resting state. In contrast, the alpha oscillation LRTC, which had to be computed on longer stitched EEG segments, decreased significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.05) consistently with the literature. This suggests the complementarity of underlying fast and slow neuronal scale-free dynamics during movement and motor imagery. The single trial broadband LRTC gave high average binary classification accuracy in the range of 70.54±10.03% to 76.07±6.40% for all motor execution and imagery tasks and hence can be used in brain–computer interface (BCI). Thus, we demonstrate generalizability, robustness, and reproducibility of novel motor neural correlate, the single trial broadband LRTC, during different motor execution and imagery tasks in single asynchronous and cued continuous motor-BCI paradigms and its contrasting behavior with LRTC in alpha oscillation amplitude.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurofeedback training (NFT) is a non-invasive, safe, and effective method of regulating the nerve state of the brain. Presently, NFT is widely used to prevent and rehabilitate brain diseases and improve an individual’s external performance. Among the various NFT methods, NFT to improve sport performance (SP-NFT) has become an important research and application focus worldwide. Several studies have shown that the method is effective in improving brain function and motor control performance. However, appropriate reviews and prospective directions for this technology are lacking. This paper proposes an SP-NFT classification method based on user experience, classifies and discusses various SP-NFT research schemes reported in the existing literature, and reviews the technical principles, application scenarios, and usage characteristics of different SP-NFT schemes. Several key issues in SP-NFT development, including the factors involved in neural mechanisms, scheme selection, learning basis, and experimental implementation, are discussed. Finally, directions for the future development of SP-NFT, including SP-NFT based on other electroencephalograph characteristics, SP-NFT integrated with other technologies, and SP-NFT commercialization, are suggested. These discussions are expected to provide some valuable ideas to researchers in related fields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke is one of the main central nervous system diseases and is associated with high disability and mortality rates. Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) and mechanical thrombectomy are the optimal therapies available currently to restore blood flow in patients with stroke; however, their limitations are well recognized. Therefore, new treatments are urgently required to overcome these shortcomings. Recently, stem cell transplantation technology, involving the transplantation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), has drawn the interest of neuroscientists and is considered to be a promising alternative for ischemic stroke treatment. iPSCs are a class of cells produced by introducing specific transcription factors into somatic cells, and are similar to embryonic stem cells in biological function. Here, we have reviewed the current applications of stem cells with a focus on iPSC therapy in ischemic stroke, including the neuroprotective mechanisms, development constraints, major challenges to overcome, and clinical prospects. Based on the current state of research, we believe that stem cells, especially iPSCs, will pave the way for future stroke treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.610788</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Glaucoma, a neurodegenerative disease that leads to irreversible vision loss, is characterized by progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and optic axons. To date, elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) has been recognized as the main phenotypic factor associated with glaucoma. However, some patients with normal IOP also have glaucomatous visual impairment and RGC loss. Unfortunately, the underlying mechanisms behind such cases remain unclear. Recent studies have suggested that retinal glia play significant roles in the initiation and progression of glaucoma. Multiple types of glial cells are activated in glaucoma. Microglia, for example, act as critical mediators that orchestrate the progression of neuroinflammation through pro-inflammatory cytokines. In contrast, macroglia (astrocytes and Müller cells) participate in retinal inflammatory responses as modulators and contribute to neuroprotection through the secretion of neurotrophic factors. Notably, research results have indicated that intricate interactions between microglia and macroglia might provide potential therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of glaucoma. In this review, we examine the specific roles of microglia and macroglia in open-angle glaucoma, including glaucoma in animal models, and analyze the interaction between these two cell types. In addition, we discuss potential treatment options based on the relationship between glial cells and neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.663592</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Childhood medulloblastoma (MB) is a threatening malignant tumor affecting children all over the globe. It is believed to be the foremost common pediatric brain tumor causing death. Early and accurate classification of childhood MB and its classes are of great importance to help doctors choose the suitable treatment and observation plan, avoid tumor progression, and lower death rates. The current gold standard for diagnosing MB is the histopathology of biopsy samples. However, manual analysis of such images is complicated, costly, time-consuming, and highly dependent on the expertise and skills of pathologists, which might cause inaccurate results. This study aims to introduce a reliable computer-assisted pipeline called CoMB-Deep to automatically classify MB and its classes with high accuracy from histopathological images. This key challenge of the study is the lack of childhood MB datasets, especially its four categories (defined by the WHO) and the inadequate related studies. All relevant works were based on either deep learning (DL) or textural analysis feature extractions. Also, such studies employed distinct features to accomplish the classification procedure. Besides, most of them only extracted spatial features. Nevertheless, CoMB-Deep blends the advantages of textural analysis feature extraction techniques and DL approaches. The CoMB-Deep consists of a composite of DL techniques. Initially, it extracts deep spatial features from 10 convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It then performs a feature fusion step using discrete wavelet transform (DWT), a texture analysis method capable of reducing the dimension of fused features. Next, the CoMB-Deep explores the best combination of fused features, enhancing the performance of the classification process using two search strategies. Afterward, it employs two feature selection techniques on the fused feature sets selected in the previous step. A bi-directional long-short term memory (Bi-LSTM) network; a DL-based approach that is utilized for the classification phase. CoMB-Deep maintains two classification categories: binary category for distinguishing between the abnormal and normal cases and multi-class category to identify the subclasses of MB. The results of the CoMB-Deep for both classification categories prove that it is reliable. The results also indicate that the feature sets selected using both search strategies have enhanced the performance of Bi-LSTM compared to individual spatial deep features. CoMB-Deep is compared to related studies to verify its competitiveness, and this comparison confirmed its robustness and outperformance. Hence, CoMB-Deep can help pathologists perform accurate diagnoses, reduce misdiagnosis risks that could occur with manual diagnosis, accelerate the classification procedure, and decrease diagnosis costs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Neural Correlates of Effortful Cognitive Processing Deficits in Schizophrenia: An ERP Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.664008</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Individuals’ information processing includes automatic and effortful processes and the latter require sustained concentration or attention and larger amounts of cognitive “capacity.” Event-related potentials (ERPs) reflect all neural activities that are related to a certain stimulus. Investigating ERP characteristics of effortful cognitive processing in people with schizophrenia would be helpful in further understanding the neural mechanism of schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Both schizophrenia patients (SCZ, n = 33) and health controls (HC, n = 33) completed ERP measurements during the performance of the basic facial emotion identification test (BFEIT) and the face-vignette task (FVT). Data of ERP components (N100, P200, and N250), BFEIT and FVT performances were analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Schizophrenia patients’ accuracies of face emotion detection in the BFEIT and vignette emotion detection in the FVT were both significantly worse than the performance of the HC group. Repeated-measures ANOVAs performed on mean amplitudes and latencies revealed that the interaction effect for group × experiment × site (prefrontal, frontal, central, parietal, and occipital site) was significant for N250 amplitude. In FVT experiment, N250 amplitudes at prefrontal and frontal sites in schizophrenia group were larger than those of HC group; the maximum N250 amplitude was present at the prefrontal site in both the groups. For N250 latency, the interaction effect for group × experiment was significant; N250 latencies in the schizophrenia group were longer than those of the HC group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Schizophrenia patients present effortful cognitive processing dysfunctions which reflect in abnormal ERP components, especially N250 at prefrontal cortex and frontal cortex sites. These findings have important implications for further clarifying the neural mechanism of effortful cognitive processing deficits in schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Examining the Relationship Between Speech Perception, Production Distinctness, and Production Variability</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.660948</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Several studies have demonstrated that individuals’ ability to perceive a speech sound contrast is related to the production of that contrast in their native language. The theoretical account for this relationship is that speech perception and production have a shared multimodal representation in relevant sensory spaces (e.g., auditory and somatosensory domains). This gives rise to a prediction that individuals with more narrowly defined targets will produce greater separation between contrasting sounds, as well as lower variability in the production of each sound. However, empirical studies that tested this hypothesis, particularly with regard to variability, have reported mixed outcomes. The current study investigates the relationship between perceptual ability and production ability, focusing on the auditory domain. We examined whether individuals’ categorical labeling consistency for the American English /ε/–/æ/ contrast, measured using a perceptual identification task, is related to distance between the centroids of vowel categories in acoustic space (i.e., vowel contrast distance) and to two measures of production variability: the overall distribution of repeated tokens for the vowels (i.e., area of the ellipse) and the proportional within-trial decrease in variability as defined as the magnitude of self-correction to the initial acoustic variation of each token (i.e., centering ratio). No significant associations were found between categorical labeling consistency and vowel contrast distance, between categorical labeling consistency and area of the ellipse, or between categorical labeling consistency and centering ratio. These null results suggest that the perception-production relation may not be as robust as suggested by a widely adopted theoretical framing in terms of the size of auditory target regions. However, the present results may also be attributable to choices in implementation (e.g., the use of model talkers instead of continua derived from the participants’ own productions) that should be subject to further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: A Survey on Deep Learning-Based Short/Zero-Calibration Approaches for EEG-Based Brain–Computer Interfaces</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.643386</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) utilizing machine learning techniques are an emerging technology that enables a communication pathway between a user and an external system, such as a computer. Owing to its practicality, electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the most widely used measurements for BCI. However, EEG has complex patterns and EEG-based BCIs mostly involve a cost/time-consuming calibration phase; thus, acquiring sufficient EEG data is rarely possible. Recently, deep learning (DL) has had a theoretical/practical impact on BCI research because of its use in learning representations of complex patterns inherent in EEG. Moreover, algorithmic advances in DL facilitate short/zero-calibration in BCI, thereby suppressing the data acquisition phase. Those advancements include data augmentation (DA), increasing the number of training samples without acquiring additional data, and transfer learning (TL), taking advantage of representative knowledge obtained from one dataset to address the so-called data insufficiency problem in other datasets. In this study, we review DL-based short/zero-calibration methods for BCI. Further, we elaborate methodological/algorithmic trends, highlight intriguing approaches in the literature, and discuss directions for further research. In particular, we search for generative model-based and geometric manipulation-based DA methods. Additionally, we categorize TL techniques in DL-based BCIs into explicit and implicit methods. Our systematization reveals advances in the DA and TL methods. Among the studies reviewed herein, ~45% of DA studies used generative model-based techniques, whereas ~45% of TL studies used explicit knowledge transferring strategy. Moreover, based on our literature review, we recommend an appropriate DA strategy for DL-based BCIs and discuss trends of TLs used in DL-based BCIs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

In this paper, we discuss some of the problems encountered and present methodological approaches aimed at overcoming them. To illustrate the mechanisms of artifact induction and the proposed removal strategies, we use data obtained with the help of a schematic demonstrator setup as well as human-subject data.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Early Sensory Deprivation Leads to Differential Inhibitory Changes in the Striatum During Learning</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.670858</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The corticostriatal circuit has been identified as a vital pathway for associative learning. However, how learning is implemented when the sensory striatum is permanently impaired remains unclear. Using chemogenetic techniques to suppress layer five auditory cortex (AC) input to the auditory striatum, learning of a sound discrimination task was significantly impacted in freely moving Mongolian gerbils, in particular when this suppression occurs early on during learning. Whole-cell recordings sampled throughout learning revealed a transient reduction in postsynaptic (GABAA) inhibition in both striatal D1 and D2 cells in normal-hearing gerbils during task acquisition. In contrast, when the baseline striatal inhibitory strengths and firing rates were permanently reduced by a transient period of developmental sensory deprivation, learning was accompanied by augmented inhibition and increased firing rates. Direct manipulation of striatal inhibition in vivo and in vitro revealed a key role of the transient inhibitory changes in task acquisition. Together, these results reveal a flexible corticostriatal inhibitory synaptic plasticity mechanism that accompanies associative auditory learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Chemogenetic Activation of Feed-Forward Inhibitory Parvalbumin-Expressing Interneurons in the Cortico-Thalamocortical Network During Absence Seizures</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.688905</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons are a subset of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons that mediate feed-forward inhibition (FFI) within the cortico-thalamocortical (CTC) network of the brain. The CTC network is a reciprocal loop with connections between cortex and thalamus. FFI PV+ interneurons control the firing of principal excitatory neurons within the CTC network and prevent runaway excitation. Studies have shown that generalized spike-wave discharges (SWDs), the hallmark of absence seizures on electroencephalogram (EEG), originate within the CTC network. In the stargazer mouse model of absence epilepsy, reduced FFI is believed to contribute to absence seizure genesis as there is a specific loss of excitatory α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) at synaptic inputs to PV+ interneurons within the CTC network. However, the degree to which this deficit is directly related to seizure generation has not yet been established. Using chemogenetics and in vivo EEG recording, we recently demonstrated that functional silencing of PV+ interneurons in either the somatosensory cortex (SScortex) or the reticular thalamic nucleus (RTN) is sufficient to generate absence-SWDs. Here, we used the same approach to assess whether activating PV+ FFI interneurons within the CTC network during absence seizures would prevent or reduce seizures. To target these interneurons, mice expressing Cre recombinase in PV+ interneurons (PV-Cre) were bred with mice expressing excitatory Gq-DREADD (hM3Dq-flox) receptors. An intraperitoneal dose of pro-epileptic chemical pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) was used to induce absence seizure. The impact of activation of FFI PV+ interneurons during seizures was tested by focal injection of the “designer drug” clozapine N-oxide (CNO) into either the SScortex or the RTN thalamus. Seizures were assessed in PV&lt;sup&gt;Cre&lt;/sup&gt;/Gq-DREADD animals using EEG/video recordings. Overall, DREADD-mediated activation of PV+ interneurons provided anti-epileptic effects against PTZ-induced seizures. CNO activation of FFI either prevented PTZ-induced absence seizures or suppressed their severity. Furthermore, PTZ-induced tonic-clonic seizures were also reduced in severity by activation of FFI PV+ interneurons. In contrast, administration of CNO to non-DREADD wild-type control animals did not afford any protection against PTZ-induced seizures. These data demonstrate that FFI PV+ interneurons within CTC microcircuits could be a potential therapeutic target for anti-absence seizure treatment in some patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.621252</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Animal pose estimation tools based on deep learning have greatly improved animal behaviour quantification. These tools perform pose estimation on individual video frames, but do not account for variability of animal body shape in their prediction and evaluation. Here, we introduce a novel multi-frame animal pose estimation framework, referred to as OptiFlex. This framework integrates a flexible base model (i.e., FlexibleBaseline), which accounts for variability in animal body shape, with an OpticalFlow model that incorporates temporal context from nearby video frames. Pose estimation can be optimised using multi-view information to leverage all four dimensions (3D space and time). We evaluate FlexibleBaseline using datasets of four different lab animal species (mouse, fruit fly, zebrafish, and monkey) and introduce an intuitive evaluation metric—adjusted percentage of correct key points (aPCK). Our analyses show that OptiFlex provides prediction accuracy that outperforms current deep learning based tools, highlighting its potential for studying a wide range of behaviours across different animal species.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Maturation-Dependent Differences in the Re-innervation of the Denervated Dentate Gyrus by Sprouting Associational and Commissural Mossy Cell Axons in Organotypic Tissue Cultures of Entorhinal Cortex and Hippocampus</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.682383</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sprouting of surviving axons is one of the major reorganization mechanisms of the injured brain contributing to a partial restoration of function. Of note, sprouting is maturation as well as age-dependent and strong in juvenile brains, moderate in adult and weak in aged brains. We have established a model system of complex organotypic tissue cultures to study sprouting in the dentate gyrus following entorhinal denervation. Entorhinal denervation performed after 2 weeks postnatally resulted in a robust, rapid, and very extensive sprouting response of commissural/associational fibers, which could be visualized using calretinin as an axonal marker. In the present study, we analyzed the effect of maturation on this form of sprouting and compared cultures denervated at 2 weeks postnatally with cultures denervated at 4 weeks postnatally. Calretinin immunofluorescence labeling as well as time-lapse imaging of virally-labeled (AAV2-hSyn1-GFP) commissural axons was employed to study the sprouting response in aged cultures. Compared to the young cultures commissural/associational sprouting was attenuated and showed a pattern similar to the one following entorhinal denervation in adult animals in vivo. We conclude that a maturation-dependent attenuation of sprouting occurs also in vitro, which now offers the chance to study, understand and influence maturation-dependent differences in brain repair in these culture preparations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Expression of Urea Transporter B in Normal and Injured Brain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.591726</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Urea transporter B (UT-B) is a membrane channel protein widely distributed in mammals, and plays a significant physiological role by regulating urea and water transportation in different tissues. More and more studies have found that UT-B is related to neurological diseases, including myelinopathy and depression. When urea accumulates in the brains of UT-B knockout mice, the synaptic plasticity of neurons is reduced, and the morphology and function of glial cells are also changed. However, the distribution and expression change of UT-B remain unclear. The purpose of this study is to determine the expression characteristics of UT-B in the brain. Through single-cell RNA sequencing, UT-B was found to express universally and substantially throughout the various cells in the central nervous system except for endothelial and smooth muscle cells. UT-B was detected in the third cerebral ventricular wall, granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus, and other parts of the hippocampal, cerebral cortex, substantia nigra, habenular, and lateral hypothalamic nucleus by immunohistochemistry. Compared with the membrane expression of UT-B in glial cells, the subcellular localization of UT-B is in the Golgi apparatus of neurons. Further, the expression of UT-B was regulated by osmotic pressure in vitro. In the experimental traumatic brain injury model (TBI), the number of UT-B positive neurons near the ipsilateral cerebral cortex increased first and then decreased over time, peaking at the 24 h. We inferred that change in UT-B expression after the TBI was an adaptation to changed urea levels. The experimental data suggest that the UT-B may be a potential target for the treatment of TBI and white matter edema.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: This study aimed to evaluate the total cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) score in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) at different stages and related factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A 100 and seven patients with idiopathic PD and 62 normal controls (NCs) who underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were enrolled. PD patients were divided into two groups: early PD [(Hoehn and Yahr (H&amp;amp;Y) 1–1.5, n = 36)] and advanced PD (H&amp;amp;Y 2–4, n = 71) groups. We calculated the total CSVD score for each participant based on lacunes, high-grade white matter hyperintensities (WMH), enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS), and cerebral microbleeds (CMBs). Differences in total CSVD score between the PD and NCs and between the two subgroups were compared. In addition, a multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate the association between CSVD markers and clinical variables in PD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Lacunes were found in 9.3% of patients with PD, periventricular WMH (PVWMH) in 89.7%, deep WMH (DWMH) in 81.3%, EPVS in 85%, and CMBs in 2.8%. Compared with NCs, patients with PD showed higher PVWMH and DWMH scores. Advanced PD patients exhibited greater PVWMH (P = 0.041), DWMH (P = 0.046), and total CSVD score (P = 0.044) than the early PD group. After adjusting for multiple variables, higher H&amp;amp;Y stage was independently correlated with increased total CSVD score (OR = 2.667, 95% CI 1.154–2.266) and PVWMH score (OR = 2.237, 95% CI 1.084–1.696).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: CSVD may play a critical role in patients with PD. The total CSVD score is a potential neuroimaging marker for monitoring the progression of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Autoimmunomic Signatures of Aging and Age-Related Neurodegenerative Diseases Are Associated With Brain Function and Ribosomal Proteins</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.679688</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Biological aging is a complex process featured by declined function of cells and tissues, including those of the immune system. As a consequence, aging affects the expression and development of autoantibodies and autoreactive T cells, which can be seen in their sum as the autoimmunome of an individual. In this study we analyzed whether sets of autoimmune features are associated with specific phenotypes which form autoimmunomic signatures related to age and neurodegenerative diseases. The autoantibody profile data of healthy subjects and patients from the GEO database was used to explore autoimmunomic signatures of aging and three neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer disease (AD) and Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Our results demonstrate that the autoimmunomic signature of aging is featured by an undulated increase of IgG autoantibodies associated with learning and behavior and a consistent increase of IgG autoantibodies related to ribosome and translation, and the autoimmunomic signature of aging are also associated with age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Intriguingly, Differential Expression-Sliding Window Analysis (DE-SWAN) identified three waves of changes of autoantibodies during aging at an age of 30, 50, and 62 years, respectively. Furthermore, IgG autoantibodies, in particular those against ribosomal proteins, could be used as prediction markers for aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, this study for the first time uncovers comprehensive autoimmunomic signatures for aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.674318</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sex differences have been observed in the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and elucidating their genetic basis is an active research topic. Based on autosomal genotype data of 7,216 men and 10,680 women, including 8,136 AD cases and 9,760 controls, we explored sex-related genetic heterogeneity in AD by investigating SNP heritability, genetic correlation, as well as SNP- and gene-based genome-wide analyses. We found similar SNP heritability (men: 19.5%; women: 21.5%) and high genetic correlation (R&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.96) between the sexes. The heritability of APOE ε4-related risks for AD, after accounting for effects of all SNPs excluding chromosome 19, was nominally, but not significantly, higher in women (10.6%) than men (9.7%). In age-stratified analyses, ε3/ε4 was associated with a higher risk of AD among women than men aged 65–75 years, but not in the full sample. Apart from APOE, no new significant locus was identified in sex-stratified gene-based analyses. Our result of the high genetic correlation indicates overall similar genetic architecture of AD in both sexes at the genome-wide averaged level. Our study suggests that clinically observed sex differences may arise from sex-specific variants with small effects or more complicated mechanisms involving epigenetic alterations, sex chromosomes, or gene-environment interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.674288</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cognitive impairment in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with functional and structural abnormalities in the intrinsic brain network. The salience network (SN) is a neurocognitive network that maintains normal cognitive function, but it has received little attention in T2DM. We explored SN changes in patients with T2DM with normal cognitive function (DMCN) and in patients with T2DM with mild cognitive impairment (DMCI). Sixty-five T2DM patients and 31 healthy controls (HCs) underwent a neuropsychological assessment, independent component analysis (ICA), and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis. The ICA extracted the SN for VBM to compare SN functional connectivity (FC) and gray matter (GM) volume (GMV) between groups. A correlation analysis examined the relationship between abnormal FC and GMV and clinical/cognitive variables. Compared with HCs, DMCN patients demonstrated increased FC in the left frontoinsular cortex (FIC), right anterior insula, and putamen, while DMCI patients demonstrated decreased right middle/inferior frontal gyrus FC. Compared with DMCN patients, DMCI patients showed decreased right FIC FC. There was no significant difference in SN GMV in DMCN and DMCI patients compared with HCs. FIC GMV was decreased in the DMCI patients compared with DMCN patients. In addition, right FIC FC and SN GMV positively correlated with Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. These findings indicate that changes in SN FC, and GMV are complex non-linear processes accompanied by increased cognitive dysfunction in patients with T2DM. The right FIC may be a useful imaging biomarker for supplementary assessment of early cognitive dysfunction in patients with T2DM.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.673155</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The antidepressant drug amitriptyline is used in the treatment of clinical depression and a variety of neurological conditions such as anxiety, neuropathic pain disorders and migraine. Antidepressants are associated with both therapeutic and untoward effects, and their use in the elderly has tripled since the mid-1990s. Because of this widespread use, we are interested in testing the acute effects of amitriptyline on synaptic transmission at therapeutic concentrations well below those that block voltage-gated calcium channels. We found that 3 μM amitriptyline reduced the frequency of spontaneous GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) and reduced quantal content in mice at ages of 7–10 mo. and 23–25 mo., suggesting a presynaptic mechanism of action that does not diminish with age. We employed a reduced synaptic preparation of the basal forebrain (BF) and a new optogenetic aging model utilizing a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mouse line with stable expression of the channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) variant H134R specific for GABAergic neurons [VGAT-ChR2(H134R)-EYFP]. This model enables optogenetic light stimulation of specific GABAergic synaptic terminals across aging. Age-related impairment of circadian behavior was used to confirm predictable age-related changes associated with this model. Our results suggest that low concentrations of amitriptyline act presynaptically to reduce neurotransmitter release and that this action is maintained during aging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Role of Microglia in Perioperative Neuroinflammation and Neurocognitive Disorders</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.671499</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The aseptic trauma of peripheral surgery activates a systemic inflammatory response that results in neuro-inflammation; the microglia, the resident immunocompetent cells in the brain, are a key element of the neuroinflammatory response. In most settings microglia perform a surveillance role in the brain detecting and responding to “invaders” to maintain homeostasis. However, microglia have also been implicated in producing harm possibly by changing its phenotype from its beneficial, anti-inflammatory state (termed M2) into an injurious pro-inflammatory state (termed M1); it is likely that there are intermediates states between these polar phenotypes and some consider that a gradient exists with a number of intermediates, rather than a strict dichotomy between M1 and M2. In the pro-inflammatory phenotypes, microglia can disrupt synaptic plasticity such as long- term potentiation that can result in disorders of learning and memory of the type observed in Peri-operative Neurocognitive Disorders. Therefore, investigators have sought strategies to prevent microglia from provoking this adverse event in the perioperative period. In preclinical studies microglia can be depleted by removing trophic factors required for its maintenance; subsequent repopulation with a more beneficial microglial phenotype may result in memory enhancement, improved sensory motor function, as well as suppression of neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress pathways. Another approach consists of preventing microglial activation using the non-specific P38 MAP kinase blockers such as minocycline. Perhaps a more physiologic approach is the use of inhibitors of potassium (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) channels that are required to convert the microglia into an active state. In this context the specific K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels that are implicated are termed Kv1.3 and KCa3.1 and high selective inhibitors for each have been developed. Data are accumulating demonstrating the utility of these K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel blockers in preventing Perioperative Neurocognitive Disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Can Exergames Be Improved to Better Enhance Behavioral Adaptability in Older Adults? An Ecological Dynamics Perspective</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.670166</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Finding effective training solutions to attenuate the alterations of behavior and cognition in the growing number of older adults is an important challenge for Science and Society. By offering 3D computer-simulated environments to combine perceptual-motor and cognitive exercise, exergames are promising in this respect. However, a careful analysis of meta-analytic reviews suggests that they failed to be more effective than conventional motor-cognitive training. We analyzed the reasons for this situation, and we proposed new directions to design new, conceptually grounded, exergames. Consistent with the evolutionary neuroscience approach, we contend that new solutions should better combine high level of metabolic activity with (neuro)muscular, physical, perceptual-motor, and cognitive stimulations. According to the Ecological Dynamics rationale, we assume that new exergames should act at the agent–environment scale to allow individuals to explore, discover, and adapt to immersive and informationally rich environments that should include cognitively challenging tasks, while being representative of daily living situations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Better Identification of Cognitive Decline With Interleukin-2 Than With Amyloid and Tau Protein Biomarkers in Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.670115</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The rate of cognitive decline among patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) varies, and it is thus crucial to accurately predict the probability of cognitive deterioration in patients with MCI. We compared the potential of cytokines with amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau biomarkers for predicting cognitive decline in patients with aMCI or Alzheimer’s disease (AD). All participants (controls, aMCI, and AD patients) underwent plasma biomarker examinations for Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–40&lt;/sub&gt;, Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt;, total tau (t-tau), tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 [p-Tau181]), and 29 cytokines and baseline cognitive tests, including Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). The correlation between biomarker levels and annual MMSE change during the follow-up was examined. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to determine whether the statistically significant plasma biomarkers could identify cognitive decline. Higher baseline levels of IL-2, sCD40L, IL-8, and VEGF were associated with a lower annual cognitive decline in the aMCI group, and higher baseline levels of Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–40&lt;/sub&gt;, IFNγ, IL-5, IL-17A, IL-25, and FGF were associated with a rapid annual cognitive decline in the AD group. IL-2 had a high discriminatory capacity for identifying cognitive decline, with an area under curve (AUC) of 85.7% in the aMCI group, and the AUC was slightly increased when combining IL-2 with Aβ or tau biomarkers. However, none of the biomarkers had a satisfactory discriminatory capacity in the AD group. IL-2 may have a better discriminatory capacity for identifying cognitive decline than Aβ and tau biomarkers in patients with aMCI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Prediction of Hemorrhagic Transformation After Ischemic Stroke: Development and Validation Study of a Novel Multi-biomarker Model</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.667934</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objectives: We aimed to develop and validate a novel multi-biomarker model for predicting hemorrhagic transformation (HT) risk after acute ischemic stroke (AIS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We prospectively included patients with AIS admitted within 24 h of stroke from January 1st 2016 to January 31st 2019. A panel of 17 circulating biomarkers was measured and analyzed in this cohort. We assessed the ability of individual circulating biomarkers and the combination of multiple biomarkers to predict any HT, symptomatic HT (sHT) and parenchymal hematoma (PH) after AIS. The strategy of multiple biomarkers in combination was then externally validated in an independent cohort of 288 Chinese patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A total of 1207 patients with AIS (727 males; mean age, 67.2 ± 13.9 years) were included as a derivation cohort, of whom 179 patients (14.8%) developed HT. The final multi-biomarker model included three biomarkers [platelets, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios (NLR), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)] from different pathways, showing a good performance for predicting HT in both the derivation cohort (c statistic = 0·64, 95% CI 0·60–0·69), and validation cohort (c statistic = 0·70, 95% CI 0·58–0·82). Adding these three biomarkers simultaneously to the basic model with conventional risk factors improved the ability of HT reclassification [net reclassification improvement (NRI) 65.6%, P &amp;lt; 0.001], PH (NRI 64.7%, P &amp;lt; 0.001), and sHT (NRI 71.3%, P &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: This easily applied multi-biomarker model had a good performance for predicting HT in both the derivation and external validation cohorts. Incorporation of biomarkers into clinical decision making may help to identify patients at high risk of HT after AIS and warrants further consideration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Positive Effect of Cognitive Reserve on Episodic Memory, Executive and Attentional Functions Taking Into Account Amyloid-Beta, Tau, and Apolipoprotein E Status</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.666181</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Studies exploring the simultaneous influence of several physiological and environmental factors on domain-specific cognition in late middle-age remain scarce. Therefore, our objective was to determine the respective contribution of modifiable risk/protective factors (cognitive reserve and allostatic load) on specific cognitive domains (episodic memory, executive functions, and attention), taking into account non-modifiable factors [sex, age, and genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD)] and AD-related biomarker amount (amyloid-beta and tau/neuroinflammation) in a healthy late-middle-aged population. One hundred and one healthy participants (59.4 ± 5 years; 68 women) were evaluated for episodic memory, executive and attentional functioning via neuropsychological test battery. Cognitive reserve was determined by the National Adult Reading Test. The allostatic load consisted of measures of lipid metabolism and sympathetic nervous system functioning. The amyloid-beta level was assessed using positron emission tomography in all participants, whereas tau/neuroinflammation positron emission tomography scans and apolipoprotein E genotype were available for 58 participants. Higher cognitive reserve was the main correlate of better cognitive performance across all domains. Moreover, age was negatively associated with attentional functioning, whereas sex was a significant predictor for episodic memory, with women having better performance than men. Finally, our results did not show clear significant associations between performance over any cognitive domain and apolipoprotein E genotype and AD biomarkers. This suggests that domain-specific cognition in late healthy midlife is mainly determined by a combination of modifiable (cognitive reserve) and non-modifiable factors (sex and age) rather than by AD biomarkers and genetic risk for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Exosomes, which are small extracellular vesicles produced from various cell types, contain a variety of molecular constituents, such as proteins, lipids, and RNA. Recently, exosomal biomarkers have been investigated to probe the understanding and diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders. Previous reports have demonstrated increased exosomal α-synuclein (α-syn) in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) in comparison to healthy controls (HC). Interestingly, the cholinergic loss was revealed in the central and peripheral nervous systems in histopathology and molecular neuroimaging. Thereby, we simultaneously examined acetylcholinesterase (AChE) with α-syn as exosomal markers. Exosomes were isolated from the plasma of 34 FP-CIT PET proven patients with PD and 29 HC. Exosomal α-syn and AChE activity were quantified andthe relationship with clinical parameters was analyzed. Remarkably, exosomal AChE activity was significantly decreased in PD compared to HC (P = 0.002). Moreover, exosomal AChE activity in PD revealed a strong negative correlation with disease severity, including H&amp;amp;Y (P = 0.007) and UPDRS part III (P = 0.047) scores. By contrast, no significant difference in exosomal α-syn concentration was observed between groups. These results support the occurrence of cholinergic dysfunction in PD, and they could be implicated with disease progression, especially motor deficits. Exosomal AChE activity with advanced exosome isolation techniques may be a reliable biomarker for the early diagnosis and prognosis of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Role of Plasma Neurofilament Light Protein for Assessing Cognitive Impairment in Patients With End-Stage Renal Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.657794</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is defined as the irreversible loss of renal function, necessitating renal replacement therapy. Patients with ESRD tend to have more risk factors for cognitive impairment than the general population, including hypertension, accumulative uremic toxin, anemia, and old age. The association between these risk factors and the pathologic protein was lacking. Blood-based assays for detecting pathologic protein, such as amyloid beta (Aβ), total tau protein, and neurofilament light chain (NfL), have the advantages of being less invasive and more cost-effective for diagnosing patients with cognitive impairment. The aim of the study is to validate if the common neurologic biomarkers were different in ESRD patients and to differentiate if the specific biomarkers could correlate with specific correctable risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: In total, 67 participants aged &amp;gt;45 years were enrolled. The definition of ESRD was receiving maintenance hemodialysis for &amp;gt;3 months. Cognitive impairment was defined as a Mini-Mental State Examination score of &amp;lt;24. The participants were divided into groups for ESRD with and without cognitive impairment. The blood-based biomarkers (tau protein, Aβ1/40, Aβ1/42, and NfL) were analyzed through immunomagnetic reduction assay. Other biochemical and hematologic data were obtained simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summary of results: The study enrolled 43 patients with ESRD who did not have cognitive impairment and 24 patients with ESRD who had cognitive impairment [Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE): 27.60 ± 1.80 vs. 16.84 ± 6.40, p &amp;lt; 0.05]. Among the blood-based biomarkers, NfL was marginally higher in the ESRD with cognitive impairment group than in the ESRD without cognitive impairment group (10.41 ± 3.26 vs. 8.74 ± 2.81 pg/mL, p = 0.037). The concentrations of tau protein, amyloid β 1/42, and amyloid β 1/40 (p = 0.504, 0.393, and 0.952, respectively) were similar between the two groups. The area under the curve of NfL to distinguish cognitively impaired and unimpaired ESRD patients was 0.687 (95% confidence interval: 0.548–0.825, p = 0.034). There was no correlation between the concentration of NfL and MMSE among total population (r = −0.153, p = 0.277), patients with (r = 0.137, p = 0.583) or without cognitive impairment (r = 0.155, p = 0.333).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Patients with ESRD who had cognitive impairment had marginally higher plasma NfL concentrations. NfL concentration was not correlated with the biochemical parameters, total MMSE among total population or individual groups with or without cognitive impairment. The concentrations of Aβ1/40, Aβ1/42, and tau were similar between the groups.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Lack of Spinal Neuropeptide Y Is Involved in Mechanical Itch in Aged Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.654761</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuropeptide Y (NPY) signaling plays an essential role in gating the pruritic afferent information in the spinal cord. Recent studies revealed that the aging process down-regulated the expression of NPY in the central nervous system. We propose that the lack of spinal NPY may be involved in certain types of pruritus in the elderly population. This study was designed to investigate the role of NPY in aging-induced itch using the senile mouse model. The expression of NPY in the spinal dorsal horn was compared between young (2 months old) and aged (24 months old) mice. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry showed that the expression of NPY was significantly reduced in the spinal dorsal horn in aged mice. In addition, a neuronal maker of apoptosis, TUNEL, was detected in the NPY positive neurons only in the aged spinal cord. Behavioral assay indicated that light mechanical stimulus evoked significantly more scratching in the aged than in the young mice, whereas chemical-evoked itch and pain-related behaviors were not altered. Intrathecal injection of either NPY or LP-NPY, a NPY receptor 1 (NPY1R) agonist, significantly alleviated the mechanically evoked itch in aged mice without altering the responses to chemical pruritogens. Our study suggested that downregulation of spinal NPY in the aged mice might play a role in the higher incidence of the mechanically evoked itch than that in the young mice. Therapies targeting the NPY system might serve as a potential strategy for alleviating the pruritic symptoms among the elderly population.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Roles and Mechanisms of Gut Microbiota in Patients With Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.650047</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common age-related progressive neurodegenerative disease, characterized by a decline in cognitive function and neuronal loss, and is caused by several factors. Numerous clinical and experimental studies have suggested the involvement of gut microbiota dysbiosis in patients with AD. The altered gut microbiota can influence brain function and behavior through the microbiota–gut–brain axis via various pathways such as increased amyloid-β deposits and tau phosphorylation, neuroinflammation, metabolic dysfunctions, and chronic oxidative stress. With no current effective therapy to cure AD, gut microbiota modulation may be a promising therapeutic option to prevent or delay the onset of AD or counteract its progression. Our present review summarizes the alterations in the gut microbiota in patients with AD, the pathogenetic roles and mechanisms of gut microbiota in AD, and gut microbiota–targeted therapies for AD. Understanding the roles and mechanisms between gut microbiota and AD will help decipher the pathogenesis of AD from novel perspectives and shed light on novel therapeutic strategies for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Neutrophil responses against pathogens must be balanced between protection and immunopathology. Factors that determine these outcomes are not well-understood. In a mouse model of genital herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) infection, which results in severe genital inflammation, antibody-mediated neutrophil depletion reduced disease. Comparative single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of vaginal cells against a model of genital HSV-1 infection, which results in mild inflammation, demonstrated sustained expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) only after HSV-2 infection primarily within the neutrophil population. Both therapeutic blockade of IFNα/β receptor 1 (IFNAR1) and genetic deletion of IFNAR1 in neutrophils concomitantly decreased HSV-2 genital disease severity and vaginal IL-18 levels. Therapeutic neutralization of IL-18 also diminished genital inflammation, indicating an important role for this cytokine in promoting neutrophil-dependent immunopathology. Our study reveals that sustained type I interferon (IFN) signaling is a driver of pathogenic neutrophil responses and identifies IL-18 as a novel component of disease during genital HSV-2 infection.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: A reaction-diffusion network model predicts a dual role of Cactus/IκB to regulate Dorsal/NFκB nuclear translocation in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/ZAAH6OfbL4c/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Claudio D. T. Barros, Maira A. Cardoso, Paulo M. Bisch, Helena M. Araujo, Francisco J. P. Lopes&lt;/p&gt;

Dorsal-ventral patterning of the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; embryo depends on the NFκB superfamily transcription factor Dorsal (Dl). Toll receptor activation signals for degradation of the IκB inhibitor Cactus (Cact), leading to a ventral-to-dorsal nuclear Dl gradient. Cact is critical for Dl nuclear import, as it binds to and prevents Dl from entering the nuclei. Quantitative analysis of &lt;i&gt;cact&lt;/i&gt; mutants revealed an additional Cact function to promote Dl nuclear translocation in ventral regions of the embryo. To investigate this dual Cact role, we developed a predictive model based on a reaction-diffusion regulatory network. This network distinguishes non-uniform Toll-dependent Dl nuclear import and Cact degradation, from the Toll-independent processes of Cact degradation and reversible nuclear-cytoplasmic Dl flow. In addition, it incorporates translational control of Cact levels by Dl. Our model successfully reproduces wild-type data and emulates the Dl nuclear gradient in mutant &lt;i&gt;dl&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;cact&lt;/i&gt; allelic combinations. Our results indicate that the dual role of Cact depends on the dynamics of Dl-Cact trimers along the dorsal-ventral axis: In the absence of Toll activation, free Dl-Cact trimers retain Dl in the cytoplasm, limiting the flow of Dl into the nucleus; in ventral-lateral regions, Dl-Cact trimers are recruited by Toll activation into predominant signaling complexes and promote Dl nuclear translocation. Simulations suggest that the balance between Toll-dependent and Toll-independent processes are key to this dynamics and reproduce the full assortment of Cact effects. Considering the high evolutionary conservation of these pathways, our analysis should contribute to understanding NFκB/c-Rel activation in other contexts such as in the vertebrate immune system and disease.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZAAH6OfbL4c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Antibodies are widely used reagents to test for expression of proteins and other antigens. However, they might not always reliably produce results when they do not specifically bind to the target proteins that their providers designed them for, leading to unreliable research results. While many proposals have been developed to deal with the problem of antibody specificity, it is still challenging to cover the millions of antibodies that are available to researchers. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of automatically generating alerts to users of problematic antibodies by extracting statements about antibody specificity reported in the literature. The extracted alerts can be used to construct an “Antibody Watch” knowledge base containing supporting statements of problematic antibodies. We developed a deep neural network system and tested its performance with a corpus of more than two thousand articles that reported uses of antibodies. We divided the problem into two tasks. Given an input article, the first task is to identify snippets about antibody specificity and classify if the snippets report that any antibody exhibits non-specificity, and thus is problematic. The second task is to link each of these snippets to one or more antibodies mentioned in the snippet. The experimental evaluation shows that our system can accurately perform the classification task with 0.925 weighted F1-score, linking with 0.962 accuracy, and 0.914 weighted F1 when combined to complete the joint task. We leveraged Research Resource Identifiers (RRID) to precisely identify antibodies linked to the extracted specificity snippets. The result shows that it is feasible to construct a reliable knowledge base about problematic antibodies by text mining.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FGzQhsRalKM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Mass gathering events have been identified as high-risk environments for community transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Empirical estimates of their direct and spill-over effects however remain challenging to identify. In this study, we propose the use of a novel synthetic control framework to obtain causal estimates for direct and spill-over impacts of these events. The Sabah state elections in Malaysia were used as an example for our proposed methodology and we investigate the event’s spatial and temporal impacts on COVID-19 transmission. Results indicate an estimated (i) 70.0% of COVID-19 case counts within Sabah post-state election were attributable to the election’s direct effect; (ii) 64.4% of COVID-19 cases in the rest of Malaysia post-state election were attributable to the election’s spill-over effects. Sensitivity analysis was further conducted by examining epidemiological pre-trends, surveillance efforts, varying synthetic control matching characteristics and spill-over specifications. We demonstrate that our estimates are not due to pre-existing epidemiological trends, surveillance efforts, and/or preventive policies. These estimates highlight the potential of mass gatherings in one region to spill-over into an outbreak of national scale. Relaxations of mass gathering restrictions must therefore be carefully considered, even in the context of low community transmission and enforcement of safe distancing guidelines.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zoApTSJo7aA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

During normal neuronal activity, ionic concentration gradients across a neuron’s membrane are often assumed to be stable. Prolonged spiking activity, however, can reduce transmembrane gradients and affect voltage dynamics. Based on mathematical modeling, we investigated the impact of neuronal activity on ionic concentrations and, consequently, the dynamics of action potential generation. We find that intense spiking activity on the order of a second suffices to induce changes in ionic reversal potentials and to consistently induce a switch from a regular to an intermittent firing mode. This transition is caused by a qualitative alteration in the system’s voltage dynamics, mathematically corresponding to a co-dimension-two bifurcation from a saddle-node on invariant cycle (SNIC) to a homoclinic orbit bifurcation (HOM). Our electrophysiological recordings in mouse cortical pyramidal neurons confirm the changes in action potential dynamics predicted by the models: (i) activity-dependent increases in intracellular sodium concentration directly reduce action potential amplitudes, an effect typically attributed solely to sodium channel inactivation; (ii) extracellular potassium accumulation switches action potential generation from tonic firing to intermittently interrupted output. Thus, individual neurons may respond very differently to the same input stimuli, depending on their recent patterns of activity and/or the current brain-state.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/eHmLpATrpGY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Blood‐brain barrier breakdown in relationship to Alzheimer and vascular disease</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26134?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Blood‐brain barrier (BBB) breakdown has been suggested to be an early biomarker in human cognitive impairment. However, the relationship between BBB breakdown and brain pathology, most commonly Alzheimer’s and vascular diseases, is still poorly understood. The present study measured human BBB function in mild‐cognitive‐impairment (MCI) patients at two molecular scales, specifically BBB’s permeability to water and albumin molecules.


Methods
55 elderly participants were enrolled, including 33 MCI patients and 22 controls. BBB permeability to water was measured with a new MRI technique, water‐extraction‐with‐phase‐contrast‐arterial‐spin‐tagging (WEPCAST). BBB permeability to albumin was determined using CSF/serum albumin ratio. Cognitive performance was assessed by domain specific composite scores. AD pathology (including CSF Aβ and ptau) and vascular risk factors were examined.


Results
Compared to cognitively normal subjects, BBB in MCI patients manifested an increased permeability to small molecules such as water but was no more permeable to large molecules such as albumin. BBB permeability to water was found to be related to AD markers of CSF Aβ and ptau. On the other hand, BBB permeability to albumin was found to be related to vascular risk factors especially hypercholesterolemia, but was not related to AD pathology. BBB permeability to small molecules, but not to large molecules, was found to be predictive of cognitive function.


Interpretation
These findings provide early evidence that BBB breakdown is related to both AD and vascular risks, but their effects can be differentiated by spatial scales. BBB permeability to small molecules has a greater impact on cognitive performance.

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: FMRF‐NH2‐Related Neuropeptides in Biomphalaria spp., Intermediate Hosts for Schistosomiasis: Precursor Organization and Immunohistochemical Localization</title>

	<content:encoded>ABSTRACT
Freshwater snails of the genus Biomphalaria serve as intermediate hosts for the digenetic trematode Schistosoma mansoni, the etiological agent for the most widespread form of intestinal schistosomiasis. As neuropeptide signaling in host snails can be altered by trematode infection, a neural transcriptomics approach was undertaken to identify peptide precursors in Biomphalaria glabrata, the major intermediate host for S. mansoni in the Western Hemisphere. Three transcripts that encode peptides belonging to the FMRF‐NH2 related peptide (FaRP) family were identified in B. glabrata. One transcript encoded a precursor polypeptide (Bgl‐FaRP1; 292 amino acids) that included eight copies of the tetrapeptide FMRF‐NH2 and single copies of FIRF‐NH2, FLRF‐NH2, and pQFYRI‐NH2. The second transcript encoded a precursor (Bgl‐FaRP2; 347 amino acids) that comprised fourteen copies of the heptapeptide GDPFLRF‐NH2 and one copy of SKPYMRF‐NH2. The precursor encoded by the third transcript (Bgl‐FaRP3; 287 amino acids) recapitulated Bgl‐FaRP2 but lacked the full SKPYMRF‐NH2 peptide. The three precursors shared a common signal peptide, suggesting a genomic organization described previously in gastropods. Immunohistochemical studies were performed on the nervous systems of B. glabrata and B. alexandrina, a major intermediate host for S. mansoni in Egypt. FMRF‐NH2 ‐like immunoreactive (FMRF‐NH2‐li) neurons were located in regions of the central nervous system associated with reproduction, feeding, and cardio‐respiration. Antisera raised against non‐FMRF‐NH2 peptides present in the tetrapeptide and heptapeptide precursors labeled independent subsets of the FMRF‐NH2‐li neurons. This study supports the participation of FMRF‐NH2 related neuropeptides in the regulation of vital physiological and behavioral systems that are altered by parasitism in Biomphalaria.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Time Complexity Analysis of Randomized Search Heuristics for the Dynamic Graph Coloring Problem. (arXiv:2105.12525v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12525</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We contribute to the theoretical understanding of randomized search
heuristics for dynamic problems. We consider the classical vertex coloring
problem on graphs and investigate the dynamic setting where edges are added to
the current graph. We then analyze the expected time for randomized search
heuristics to recompute high quality solutions. The (1+1)~Evolutionary
Algorithm and RLS operate in a setting where the number of colors is bounded
and we are minimizing the number of conflicts. Iterated local search algorithms
use an unbounded color palette and aim to use the smallest colors and,
consequently, the smallest number of colors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identify classes of bipartite graphs where reoptimization is as hard as or
even harder than optimization from scratch, i.e., starting with a random
initialization. Even adding a single edge can lead to hard symmetry problems.
However, graph classes that are hard for one algorithm turn out to be easy for
others. In most cases our bounds show that reoptimization is faster than
optimizing from scratch. We further show that tailoring mutation operators to
parts of the graph where changes have occurred can significantly reduce the
expected reoptimization time. In most settings the expected reoptimization time
for such tailored algorithms is linear in the number of added edges. However,
tailored algorithms cannot prevent exponential times in settings where the
original algorithm is inefficient.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we study the performance of variants of well-known
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures on different audio tasks. We
show that tuning the Receptive Field (RF) of CNNs is crucial to their
generalization. An insufficient RF limits the CNN's ability to fit the training
data. In contrast, CNNs with an excessive RF tend to over-fit the training data
and fail to generalize to unseen testing data. As state-of-the-art CNN
architectures-in computer vision and other domains-tend to go deeper in terms
of number of layers, their RF size increases and therefore they degrade in
performance in several audio classification and tagging tasks. We study
well-known CNN architectures and how their building blocks affect their
receptive field. We propose several systematic approaches to control the RF of
CNNs and systematically test the resulting architectures on different audio
classification and tagging tasks and datasets. The experiments show that
regularizing the RF of CNNs using our proposed approaches can drastically
improve the generalization of models, out-performing complex architectures and
pre-trained models on larger datasets. The proposed CNNs achieve
state-of-the-art results in multiple tasks, from acoustic scene classification
to emotion and theme detection in music to instrument recognition, as
demonstrated by top ranks in several pertinent challenges (DCASE, MediaEval).

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Residual networks (ResNets) have displayed impressive results in pattern
recognition and, recently, have garnered considerable theoretical interest due
to a perceived link with neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs).
This link relies on the convergence of network weights to a smooth function as
the number of layers increases. We investigate the properties of weights
trained by stochastic gradient descent and their scaling with network depth
through detailed numerical experiments. We observe the existence of scaling
regimes markedly different from those assumed in neural ODE literature.
Depending on certain features of the network architecture, such as the
smoothness of the activation function, one may obtain an alternative ODE limit,
a stochastic differential equation or neither of these. These findings cast
doubts on the validity of the neural ODE model as an adequate asymptotic
description of deep ResNets and point to an alternative class of differential
equations as a better description of the deep network limit.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: The Nonlinearity Coefficient -- A Practical Guide to Neural Architecture Design. (arXiv:2105.12210v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12210</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In essence, a neural network is an arbitrary differentiable, parametrized
function. Choosing a neural network architecture for any task is as complex as
searching the space of those functions. For the last few years, 'neural
architecture design' has been largely synonymous with 'neural architecture
search' (NAS), i.e. brute-force, large-scale search. NAS has yielded
significant gains on practical tasks. However, NAS methods end up searching for
a local optimum in architecture space in a small neighborhood around
architectures that often go back decades, based on CNN or LSTM.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, we present a different and complementary approach to
architecture design, which we term 'zero-shot architecture design' (ZSAD). We
develop methods that can predict, without any training, whether an architecture
will achieve a relatively high test or training error on a task after training.
We then go on to explain the error in terms of the architecture definition
itself and develop tools for modifying the architecture based on this
explanation. This confers an unprecedented level of control on the deep
learning practitioner. They can make informed design decisions before the first
line of code is written, even for tasks for which no prior art exists.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first major contribution is to show that the 'degree of nonlinearity' of
a neural architecture is a key causal driver behind its performance, and a
primary aspect of the architecture's model complexity. We introduce the
'nonlinearity coefficient' (NLC), a scalar metric for measuring nonlinearity.
Via extensive empirical study, we show that the value of the NLC in the
architecture's randomly initialized state before training is a powerful
predictor of test error after training and that attaining a right-sized NLC is
essential for attaining an optimal test error. The NLC is also conceptually
simple, well-defined for any feedforward network, easy and cheap to compute,
has extensive theoretical, empirical and conceptual grounding, follows
instructively from the architecture definition, and can be easily controlled
via our 'nonlinearity normalization' algorithm. We argue that the NLC is the
most powerful scalar statistic for architecture design specifically and neural
network analysis in general. Our analysis is fueled by mean field theory, which
we use to uncover the 'meta-distribution' of layers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the NLC, we uncover and flesh out a range of metrics and properties
that have a significant explanatory influence on test and training error. We go
on to explain the majority of the error variation across a wide range of
randomly generated architectures with these metrics and properties. We compile
our insights into a practical guide for architecture designers, which we argue
can significantly shorten the trial-and-error phase of deep learning
deployment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results are grounded in an experimental protocol that exceeds that of the
vast majority of other deep learning studies in terms of carefulness and rigor.
We study the impact of e.g. dataset, learning rate, floating-point precision,
loss function, statistical estimation error and batch inter-dependency on
performance and other key properties. We promote research practices that we
believe can significantly accelerate progress in architecture design research.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12196</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Intelligent behaviour in the physical world exhibits structure at multiple
spatial and temporal scales. Although movements are ultimately executed at the
level of instantaneous muscle tensions or joint torques, they must be selected
to serve goals defined on much longer timescales, and in terms of relations
that extend far beyond the body itself, ultimately involving coordination with
other agents. Recent research in artificial intelligence has shown the promise
of learning-based approaches to the respective problems of complex movement,
longer-term planning and multi-agent coordination. However, there is limited
research aimed at their integration. We study this problem by training teams of
physically simulated humanoid avatars to play football in a realistic virtual
environment. We develop a method that combines imitation learning, single- and
multi-agent reinforcement learning and population-based training, and makes use
of transferable representations of behaviour for decision making at different
levels of abstraction. In a sequence of stages, players first learn to control
a fully articulated body to perform realistic, human-like movements such as
running and turning; they then acquire mid-level football skills such as
dribbling and shooting; finally, they develop awareness of others and play as a
team, bridging the gap between low-level motor control at a timescale of
milliseconds, and coordinated goal-directed behaviour as a team at the
timescale of tens of seconds. We investigate the emergence of behaviours at
different levels of abstraction, as well as the representations that underlie
these behaviours using several analysis techniques, including statistics from
real-world sports analytics. Our work constitutes a complete demonstration of
integrated decision-making at multiple scales in a physically embodied
multi-agent setting. See project video at https://youtu.be/KHMwq9pv7mg.

	<title>The Cerebellum: Characterization of the Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteome in Patients with Fragile X-Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-021-01262-7</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), first described in 2001, is a neurodegenerative and movement disorder, caused by a premutation in the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1)&lt;/em&gt; gene. To date, the biological mechanisms causing this condition are still not well understood, as not all premutation carriers develop FXTAS. To further understand this syndrome, we quantitatively compared the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome of FXTAS patients with age-matched controls using mass spectrometry. We identified 415 proteins of which 97 were altered in FXTAS patients. These proteins suggest changes in acute phase response signaling, liver X receptor/ retinoid X receptor (LXR/RXR) activation, and farnesoid X receptor (FXR)/RXR activation, which are the main pathways found to be affected. Additionally, we detected changes in many other proteins including amyloid-like protein 2, contactin-1, afamin, cell adhesion molecule 4, NPC intracellular cholesterol transporter 2, and cathepsin B, that had been previously noted to hold important roles in other movement disorders. Specific to RXR pathways, several apolipoproteins (APOA1, APOA2, APOA4, APOC2, and APOD) showed significant changes in the CSF of FXTAS patients. Lastly, CSF parameters were analyzed to investigate abnormalities in blood brain barrier function. Correlations were observed between patient albumin quotient values, a measure of permeability, and CGG repeat length as well as FXTAS rating scale scores.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neurology: Elucidating distinct clinico-radiologic signatures in the borderland between neuromyelitis optica and multiple sclerosis</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00415-021-10619-1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Separating antibody-negative neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) from multiple sclerosis (MS) in borderline cases is extremely challenging due to lack of biomarkers. Elucidating different pathologies within the likely heterogenous antibody-negative NMOSD/MS overlap syndrome is, therefore, a major unmet need which would help avoid disability from inappropriate treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In this study we aimed to identify distinct subgroups within the antibody-negative NMOSD/MS overlap syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Twenty-five relapsing antibody-negative patients with NMOSD features underwent a prospective brain and spinal cord MRI. Subgroups were identified by an unsupervised algorithm based on pre-selected NMOSD/MS discriminators.
      &lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Four subgroups were identified. Patients from Group 1 termed “MS-like” (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 6) often had central vein sign and cortical lesions (83% and 67%, respectively). All patients from Group 2 (“spinal MS-like”, 8) had short-segment myelitis and no MS-like brain lesions. Group 3 (“classic NMO-like”, 6) had high percentage of bilateral optic neuritis and longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM, 80% and 60%, respectively) and normal brain appearance (100%). Group 4 (“NMO-like with brain involvement”, 5) typically had a history of NMOSD-like brain lesions and LETM. When compared with other groups, Group 4 had significantly decreased fractional anisotropy in non-lesioned tracts (0.46 vs. 0.49, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.003) and decreased thalamus volume (0.84 vs. 0.98, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.04).
      &lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec5&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;NMOSD/MS cohort contains distinct subgroups likely corresponding to different pathologies and requiring tailored treatment. We propose that non-conventional MRI might help optimise diagnosis in these challenging patients.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Post-varicella arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) is considered an uncommon cause of pediatric stroke that is considered a self-limiting, monophasic disease. However, in a subset of patients, disease recurs; the prevalence of vasculopathy or AIS recurrence, severity of clinical outcomes, and standardized therapies have not been well characterized. Herein, we determined the clinical-neuroradiological features, long-term evolution, and relationship between acute phase treatment and vasculopathy recurrence in a pediatric population with post-varicella AIS.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Clinical, laboratory, and neuroradiological features of 22 children with post-varicella AIS between 2010 and 2019 (16 males, mean age at stroke 4 years, range 1.7–10) were reviewed. Statistical analyses were performed using χ&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and Fisher exact tests.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Of the 22 cases, mean time from varicella to stroke was 4.5 months with 3 cases presenting more than 12 months after rash; 21 (95%) were not vaccinated for varicella; 3 (13.6%) had posterior circulation involvement; and 5 (22.7%) had AIS or vasculopathy recurrence, of which 4 recurred 6.1 months to 2.8 years after initial clinical onset. Recurrence was associated with lack of antiviral treatment during the first episode (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.02).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Post-varicella AIS can occur months after rash making diagnosis challenging. Because recurrent vasculopathy was seen predominantly in cases not treated with antiviral therapy during initial presentation, it is important to rapidly diagnose post-varicella AIS through clinical criteria and/or virological testing then treat with antivirals to prevent recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Promising genetic therapies are being investigated in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). However, the current cost of illness is largely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study aimed at determining the socioeconomic burden of FSHD.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Adult patients with FSHD from the Dutch FSHD registry were invited to complete a questionnaire on medical consumption, work productivity and health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) using the EQ-5D-5L&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Associated costs were calculated from a societal perspective. A generalized linear model was fitted to the data to investigate whether level of mobility was related to annual costs of illness.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;172 patients with FSHD completed the questionnaire (response rate 65%)&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The per-patient annual direct medical costs of FSHD were estimated at €12,077, direct non-medical costs at €9179 and indirect costs at €5066, adding up to a total cost of illness of €26,322 per patient per year. The direct costs of illness were €21,256, approximately five times higher than the mean per-capita health expenditures in the Netherlands. Major cost-driving factors were formal home care and informal care. A decreased level of mobility was associated with higher direct costs of illness. HR-QoL was significantly reduced in patients with FSHD with a median health utility value of 0.63.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec5&quot;&gt;

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We show that FSHD is associated with substantial direct and indirect socioeconomic costs as well as a reduction in HR-QoL. These findings are important for health care decision makers and aids in allocation of research funds and evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of novel therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>eLife: VASP mediated actin dynamics activate and recruit a filopodia myosin</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/68082</link>
	<content:encoded>Filopodia are thin, actin-based structures that cells use to interact with their environments. Filopodia initiation requires a suite of conserved proteins but the mechanism remains poorly understood. The actin polymerase VASP and a MyTH-FERM (MF) myosin, DdMyo7 in amoeba, are essential for filopodia initiation. DdMyo7 is localized to dynamic regions of the actin-rich cortex. Analysis of VASP mutants and treatment of cells with anti-actin drugs shows that myosin recruitment and activation in &lt;i&gt;Dictyostelium&lt;/i&gt; requires localized VASP-dependent actin polymerization. Targeting of DdMyo7 to the cortex alone is not sufficient for filopodia initiation; VASP activity is also required. The actin regulator locally produces a cortical actin network that activates myosin and together they shape the actin network to promote extension of parallel bundles of actin during filopodia formation. This work reveals how filopodia initiation requires close collaboration between an actin binding protein, the state of the actin cytoskeleton and MF myosin activity.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: SIRT1 regulates sphingolipid metabolism and neural differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells through c-Myc- SMPDL3B</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/67452</link>
	<content:encoded>Sphingolipids are important structural components of cell membranes and prominent signaling molecules controlling cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. Sphingolipids are particularly abundant in the brain, and defects in sphingolipid degradation are associated with several human neurodegenerative diseases. However, molecular mechanisms governing sphingolipid metabolism remain unclear. Here we report that sphingolipid degradation is under transcriptional control of SIRT1, a highly conserved mammalian NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent protein deacetylase, in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Deletion of SIRT1 results in accumulation of sphingomyelin in mESCs, primarily due to reduction of SMPDL3B, a GPI-anchored plasma membrane bound sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase. Mechanistically, SIRT1 regulates transcription of &lt;i&gt;Smpdl3b&lt;/i&gt; through c-Myc. Functionally, SIRT1 deficiency-induced accumulation of sphingomyelin increases membrane fluidity and impairs neural differentiation &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Our findings discover a key regulatory mechanism for sphingolipid homeostasis and neural differentiation, further imply that pharmacological manipulation of SIRT1-mediated sphingomyelin degradation might be beneficial for treatment of human neurological diseases.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: RSC primes the quiescent genome for hypertranscription upon cell cycle re-entry</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/67033</link>
	<content:encoded>Quiescence is a reversible G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; state essential for differentiation, regeneration, stem cell renewal, and immune cell activation. Necessary for long-term survival, quiescent chromatin is compact, hypoacetylated, and transcriptionally inactive. How transcription activates upon cell-cycle re-entry is undefined. Here we report robust, widespread transcription within the first minutes of quiescence exit. During quiescence, the chromatin-remodeling enzyme RSC was already bound to the genes induced upon quiescence exit. RSC depletion caused severe quiescence exit defects: a global decrease in RNA polymerase II (Pol II) loading, Pol II accumulation at transcription start sites, initiation from ectopic upstream loci, and aberrant antisense transcription. These phenomena were due to a combination of highly robust Pol II transcription and severe chromatin defects in the promoter regions and gene bodies. Together, these results uncovered multiple mechanisms by which RSC facilitates initiation and maintenance of large-scale, rapid gene expression despite a globally repressive chromatin state.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: An excitatory lateral hypothalamic circuit orchestrating pain behaviors in mice</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66446</link>
	<content:encoded>Understanding how neuronal circuits control nociceptive processing will advance the search for novel analgesics. We use functional imaging to demonstrate that lateral hypothalamic parvalbumin-positive (LH&lt;sup&gt;PV&lt;/sup&gt;) glutamatergic neurons respond to acute thermal stimuli and a persistent inflammatory irritant. Moreover, their chemogenetic modulation alters both pain-related behavioral adaptations and the unpleasantness of a noxious stimulus. In two models of persistent pain, optogenetic activation of LH&lt;sup&gt;PV&lt;/sup&gt; neurons or their ventrolateral periaqueductal gray area (vlPAG) axonal projections attenuates nociception, and neuroanatomical tracing reveals that LH&lt;sup&gt;PV&lt;/sup&gt; neurons preferentially target glutamatergic over GABAergic neurons in the vlPAG. By contrast, LH&lt;sup&gt;PV&lt;/sup&gt; projections to the lateral habenula regulate aversion but not nociception. Finally, we find that LH&lt;sup&gt;PV&lt;/sup&gt; activation evokes additive to synergistic antinociceptive interactions with morphine and restores morphine antinociception following the development of morphine tolerance. Our findings identify LH&lt;sup&gt;PV&lt;/sup&gt; neurons as a lateral hypothalamic cell type involved in nociception and demonstrate their potential as a target for analgesia.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Spontaneous neural synchrony links intrinsic spinal sensory and motor networks during unconsciousness</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66308</link>
	<content:encoded>Non-random functional connectivity during unconsciousness is a defining feature of supraspinal networks. However, its generalizability to intrinsic spinal networks remains incompletely understood. Previously, Barry et al. (2014) used fMRI to reveal bilateral resting state functional connectivity within sensory-dominant and, separately, motor-dominant regions of the spinal cord. Here, we record spike trains from large populations of spinal interneurons &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; in rats and demonstrate that spontaneous functional connectivity also links sensory- and motor-dominant regions during unconsciousness. The spatiotemporal patterns of connectivity could not be explained by latent afferent activity or by populations of interconnected neurons spiking randomly. We also document connection latencies compatible with mono- and di-synaptic interactions and putative excitatory and inhibitory connections. The observed activity is consistent with the hypothesis that salient, experience-dependent patterns of neural transmission introduced during behavior or by injury/disease are reactivated during unconsciousness. Such a spinal replay mechanism could shape circuit-level connectivity and ultimately behavior.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Distinct threat and valence signals in rat nucleus accumbens core</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.27.446063v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Appropriate responding to threat and reward is essential to survival. The nucleus accumbens core (NAcc) is known to support and organize reward behavior. More recently our laboratory has shown the NAcc is necessary to discriminate cues for threat and safety. To directly reveal NAcc threat responding, we recorded single-unit activity from 7 female rats undergoing Pavlovian fear discrimination. Rats fully discriminated cues for danger, uncertainty, and safety. Demonstrating direct threat responding, most NAcc neurons showed greatest firing changes to danger and uncertainty. Heterogeneity in cue and reward firing led to the detection of multiple, functional populations. One NAcc population specifically decreased firing to threat (danger and uncertainty). A separate population bi-directionally signaled valence through firing decreases to negative valence events (danger and uncertainty) and opposing firing increases to positive valence events (reward and safety onset). The findings point to the NAcc as a neural source of threat information and a more general valence hub.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Additive Effects of Cognitive Load, Motor Demand, and Environmental Complexity on Attention: A Real-World EEG-study</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.27.445993v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The capacity to regulate ones attention in accordance with fluctuating task demands and environmental contexts is an essential feature of adaptive behavior. Although the electrophysiological correlates of attentional processing have been extensively studied in the laboratory, relatively little is known about the way they unfold under more variable, ecologically-valid conditions. Accordingly, this study employed a real-world EEG design to investigate how attentional processing varies under increasing levels of cognitive, motor, and environmental demand. Forty-four participants were exposed to an auditory oddball task while (1) sitting in a quiet room inside the lab, (2) walking around a sports field, and (3) wayfinding across a university campus. In each condition, participants were instructed to either attend to (i.e., count) or ignore oddball stimuli. While behavioral performance was similar across the lab and field conditions, oddball count accuracy was significantly reduced in the campus condition. Moreover, event-related potential components (mismatch negativity and P3) elicited in both real-world settings differed significantly from those obtained under laboratory conditions. These findings demonstrate the impact of environmental factors on attentional processing during simultaneously-performed motor and cognitive tasks, highlighting the value of incorporating dynamic and unpredictable contexts within naturalistic designs.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Separation of multiple motor memories through implicit and explicit processes</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.27.445962v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Acquisition of multiple motor skills without interference is a remarkable ability in sport and daily life. During adaptation to opposing perturbations, a common paradigm to study this ability, each perturbation can be successfully learned when a dynamical contextual cue, such as a follow-through movement, is associated with the direction of the perturbation. It is still unclear, however, to what extent this context-dependent learning engages the cognitive strategy-based explicit process and the implicit process that occurs without conscious awareness. Here, we designed four reaching experiments to untangle the individual contributions of the explicit and implicit components while participants learned opposing visuomotor perturbations, with a second unperturbed follow-through movement that served as a contextual cue. In Exp. 1 we replicated previous adaptation results and showed that follow-through movements also allow learning for opposing visuomotor rotations. For one group of participants in Exp. 2 we isolated strategic explicit learning by inducing a 2-sec time delay between movement and end-point feedback, while for another group we isolated the implicit component using the task-irrelevant error-clamp paradigm, in which participants were firmly instructed to aim their reaches directly to the target. Our data showed that opposing perturbations could be fully learned by explicit strategies; but when strategy was restricted, distinct implicit processes contributed to learning. In Exp.3, we examined whether the learned motor behaviors are influenced by the disparity between the follow-through contexts. We found that the location of follow-through targets had little effect on total learning, yet it led to more instances in which participants failed to learn the task. In Exp. 4, we explored the generalization capability to untrained novel targets. Participants showed near-flat generalization of the implicit and explicit processes to adjacent targets. Overall, our results indicate that follow-through contextual cues influence activity of both implicit and explicit processes during separation of motor memories. Furthermore, the follow-through context might activate, in part, top-down cognitive factors that influence not only the dynamics of the explicit learning but also the implicit process.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Distinct Neural Representations of Decision Uncertainty in Metacognition and Mentalizing</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.27.445947v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Metacognition and mentalizing are both associated with meta-level mental state representations. Specifically, metacognition refers to monitoring ones own cognitive processes, while mentalizing refers to monitoring others cognitive processes. However, this self-other dichotomy is insufficient to delineate the two high-level mental processes. We here used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to systematically investigate the neural representations of different levels of decision uncertainty in monitoring different targets (the current self, the past self, and others) performing a perceptual decision-making task. Our results reveal diverse formats of intrinsic mental state representations of decision uncertainty in mentalizing, separate from the associations with external information. External information was commonly represented in the right inferior parietal lobe (IPL) across the mentalizing tasks. However, the meta-level mental states of decision uncertainty attributed to others were uniquely represented in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), rather than the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) that also equivalently represented the object-level mental states of decision inaccuracy attributed to others. Further, the object-level and meta-level mental states of decision uncertainty, when attributed to the past self, were represented in the precuneus and the lateral frontopolar cortex (lFPC), respectively. In contrast, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) consistently represented both decision uncertainty in metacognition and estimate uncertainty during monitoring the different mentalizing processes, but not the inferred decision uncertainty in mentalizing. Hence, our findings identify neural signatures to clearly delineate metacognition and mentalizing and further imply distinct neural computations on the mental states of decision uncertainty during metacognition and mentalizing.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Cell type- and region-specific modulation of cocaine seeking by micro-RNA-1 in striatal projection neurons</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.27.445939v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The persistent and experience-dependent nature of drug addiction may result in part from epigenetic alterations, including non-coding micro-RNAs (miRNAs), which are both critical for neuronal function and modulated by cocaine in the striatum. Two major striatal cell populations, the striato-nigral and striato-pallidal projection neurons, express respectively the D1 (D1-SPNs) and D2 (D2-SPNs) dopamine receptor, and display distinct but complementary functions in drug-evoked responses. However, a cell-type-specific role for miRNAs action has yet to be clarified. Here, we evaluated the expression of a subset of miRNAs proposed to modulate cocaine effects in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and dorsal striatum (DS) upon sustained cocaine exposure in mice and showed that these selected miRNAs were preferentially up-regulated in the NAc. We then focused on miR-1 considering the important role of some of its predicted mRNA targets, such as fosb and npas4, in the effects of cocaine. We validated these targets in vitro and in vivo and further showed that overexpression of miR-1 in D1-SPNs of the DS reduced cocaine-induced CPP reinstatement, whereas it increased cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine-SA, without affecting other cocaine-mediated adaptive behavior. In addition, miR-1 overexpression in D2-SPNs of the DS reduced the motivation to self-administer cocaine but did not modify other measured behaviors. Together, our results highlight a precise cell-type- and region-specific control of relapse to cocaine-seeking behaviors by miR-1, and illustrate the importance of cell-specific investigations.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Distinct internal states interact to shape food choice by modulating sensorimotor processing at global and local scales</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.27.445920v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>When deciding what to eat, animals evaluate sensory information about food quality alongside multiple ongoing internal states. How internal states interact to alter sensorimotor processing and shape decisions such as food choice remains poorly understood. Here, we use pan-neuronal volumetric activity imaging in the Drosophila brain to investigate the neuronal basis of internal state dependent nutrient appetites. We created a functional atlas of the ventral fly brain and find that metabolic state shapes sensorimotor processing across large sections of the neuropil. Reproductive state, in contrast, acts locally to define how sensory information is translated into feeding motor output. Thereby, these two states synergistically modulate protein-specific food intake and thus food choice. Finally, using a novel computational strategy, we identify driver lines innervating state-modulated regions and show that the newly identified borboleta region is sufficient to direct food choice towards protein-rich food. We therefore identify a generalizable principle by which distinct internal states are integrated to shape decision-making and propose a strategy to uncover and functionally validate how internal states shape behavior.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.27.445881v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The recollection of environmental cues associated with threat or reward allows animals to select the most appropriate behavioral responses. Neurons in the prelimbic cortex (PL) respond to both threat- and reward-associated cues. However, it remains unknown whether PL regulates threat-avoidance vs. reward-approaching responses when an animal decision depends on previously associated memories. Using a conflict model in which rats retrieve memories of shock- and food-paired cues, we observed two distinct phenotypes during conflict: i) rats that continued to press a lever for food (Pressers); and ii) rats that exhibited a complete suppression in food seeking (Non-Pressers). Single-unit recordings revealed that increased risk-taking behavior in Pressers is associated with persistent food-cue responses in PL, and reduced spontaneous activity in PL glutamatergic (PLGLUT) neurons during conflict. Activating PLGLUT neurons in Pressers attenuated food-seeking responses in a neutral context, whereas inhibiting PLGLUT neurons in Non-Pressers reduced defensive responses and increased food approaching during conflict. Our results establish a causal role for PLGLUT neurons in mediating individual variability in memory-based risky decision making by regulating threat-avoidance vs. reward-approach behaviors.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Histone acetyltransferase activity of CREB-binding protein is essential for synaptic plasticity in 	Lymnaea</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.26.445902v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In eukaryotes, CREB-binding protein (CBP), a coactivator of CREB, functions both as a platform for recruiting other components of the transcriptional machinery and as a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) that alters chromatin structure. We previously showed that the transcriptional activity of cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) plays a crucial role in neuronal plasticity in the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis. However, there is no information on the role how CBP plays in CREB-initiated plastic changes in Lymnaea. In this study, we characterized the Lymnaea CBP (LymCBP) gene and investigated the roles it plays in synaptic plasticity involved in regulating feeding behaviors. Similar to CBPs of other species, LymCBP possesses functional domains, such as KIX domain, which is essential for interaction with CREB and was shown to regulate long-term memory (LTM). In situ hybridization showed that the staining patterns of LymCBP mRNA in the central nervous system were very similar to those of Lymnaea CREB1 (LymCREB1). A particularly strong LymCBP mRNA signal was observed in the Cerebral Giant Cell (CGC), an identified extrinsic modulatory interneuron of the feeding circuit, key to both appetitive and aversive LTM for taste. Biochemical experiments using the recombinant protein of LymCBP HAT domain showed that its enzymatic activity was blocked by classical HAT inhibitors; i.e. curcumin, anacardic acid and garcinol. Preincubation of Lymnaea CNSs with these HAT inhibitors blocked cAMP-induced long-term potentiation between the CGC and the follower B1 motoneuron. We therefore suggest that HAT activity of LymCBP in the CGCs is a key factor in synaptic plasticity contributing to LTM after classical conditioning.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>We developed an automated squint assay using both black C57BL/6J and white CD1 mice that measured the interpalpebral fissure area between the upper and lower eyelids as an objective quantification of pain. In C57BL/6J mice, we observed a squint response to increasing doses of a migraine trigger, the neuropeptide CGRP, including a significant response in female mice at a dose below detection by the manual grimace scale. Using the automated software, both C57BL/6J and CD1 mice lacked a detectable photic blink response. The CGRP-related peptide amylin induced squinting behavior in female mice, but not males. These data demonstrate that an automated squint assay can be used as an objective, real-time continuous-scale measure of pain that provides higher precision and real-time analysis compared to manual grimace assessments.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.26.445890v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The early environment is critical to brain development, but the relative contribution of physical vs. social stimulation is unclear. Here, we investigated in male and female rats the response to early physical and social environmental enrichment in relation to oxytocin (OT) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression. The findings show that males and females respond differently to prolonged sensorimotor stimulation from postnatal day 21-110 in terms of functional, structural and molecular changes in the hippocampus vs. medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Physical enrichment promoted motor and cognitive functions and hippocampal BDNF mRNA and protein expression in both sexes. Combined physical and social enrichment, however, promoted functional and structural gain predominantly in females. These changes were accompanied by elevated plasma oxytocin (OT) levels and BDNF mRNA expression in the mPFC while the hippocampus was not affected. Administration of an OT antagonist in females blocked the beneficial effects of enrichment and led to reduced cortical BDNF signaling. These findings suggest that an OT-based mechanism selectively stimulates a region-specific BDNF response which is dependent on the type of experience.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Anterior cingulate cortex mediates the flexible updating of an animal's choice responses upon rule changes in the environment. However, how anterior cingulate cortex entrains motor cortex to reorganize rule representations and generate required motor outputs remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that chemogenetic silencing of the projection terminals of cingulate cortical neurons in secondary motor cortex disrupted sequential choice performance in trials immediately following rule switches, suggesting that these inputs are necessary to update rule representations for choice decisions stored in the motor cortex. Indeed, the silencing of cingulate cortex decreased rule selectivity of secondary motor cortical neurons. Furthermore, optogenetic silencing of cingulate cortical neurons that was temporally targeted to error trials immediately after rule switches exacerbated errors in following trials. These results suggest that cingulate cortex monitors behavioral errors and update rule representations in motor cortex, revealing a critical role for cingulate-motor circuits in adaptive choice behaviors.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The latency of neural responses in the visual cortex changes systematically across the lifespan. Here we test the hypothesis that development of visual white matter pathways mediates maturational changes in conduction velocities of visual signals. Thirty-eight children participated in a cross-sectional study including diffusion MRI and MEG sessions. During the MEG acquisition, participants performed a lexical decision and a fixation task on words presented at varying levels of contrast and noise. For all stimuli and tasks, early evoked fields were observed around 100 ms after stimulus onset (M100), with slower and lower amplitude responses for low as compared to high contrast stimuli. The optic radiations and optic tracts were identified in each individual's brain based on diffusion MRI tractography. The diffusion properties of the optic radiations predicted M100 responses, especially for high contrast stimuli. Higher optic radiation fractional anisotropy (FA) values were associated with faster and larger M100 responses. Over this developmental window, the M100 responses to high contrast stimuli became faster with age and the optic radiation FA fully mediated this effect. These findings suggest that the maturation of the optic radiations over childhood accounts for individual variations observed in the developmental trajectory of visual cortex responses.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.26.445857v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Topographic sensory representations often do not scale proportionally to the size of their input regions, with some expanded and others contracted. In vision, the foveal representation is magnified cortically, as are the fingertips in touch. What principles drive this allocation, and how should receptor density, e.g. the high innervation of the fovea or the fingertips, and stimulus statistics, e.g. the higher contact frequencies on the fingertips, contribute? Building on work in efficient coding, we address this problem using linear second-order models that maximize information transmission through decorrelation. We introduce a sensory bottleneck to impose constraints on resource allocation and derive the optimal neural allocation. We find that bottleneck width is a crucial factor in resource allocation, inducing either expansion or contraction. Both receptor density and stimulus statistics affect allocation and jointly determine convergence for wider bottlenecks. Furthermore, we show a close match between the predicted and empirical cortical allocations in a well-studied model system, the star-nosed mole. Overall, our results suggest that the strength of cortical magnification depends on resource limits.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Ketamine Produces a Long-Lasting Enhancement of CA1 Neuron Excitability</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.26.445851v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Ketamine is a clinical anaesthetic and a fast-acting, long-lasting antidepressant. Ketamine is known for its antagonistic actions on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, but mechanisms leading to antidepression are not clear. The present study examined synaptic, neuronal and circuit-level loci, the duration of ketamine's actions, and the involvement of NMDA receptors in these actions. Methods: Extracellular evoked field potentials were recorded from the CA1 region of mouse hippocampal slices. Ketamine was tested at antidepressant (10 uM) and anaesthetic (350 uM) concentrations. Effects of NMDA receptor antagonists, DL-2-Amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV) and MK-801, gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor antagonist bicuculline, and a potassium channel blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA) were also studied. Results: Ketamine decreased population spike (PS) amplitudes during application, but a long-lasting increase in PS amplitudes was seen during washout of ketamine. While the acute effects of ketamine were reversed by bicuculline, the washout increase was not altered. This long-term increase was statistically significant (p&amp;lt;0.01, Wilcoxon Rank Test), sustained for &amp;gt;2 hours, and involved postsynaptic mechanisms. A similar, long-lasting effect was produced by MK-801 but was only partially evident with APV, demonstrating the importance of channel block downstream of NMDA receptors. Furthermore, TEA produced a lasting excitability increase, indicating possible involvement of potassium channel block in ketamine's long-term effects. Conclusions: This is this first report of a long-lasting increase in excitability following ketamine exposure. These results support a growing literature that increased GABA inhibition contributes to ketamine anaesthesia, while increased excitatory transmission contributes to its antidepressant effects.</content:encoded>

While previous research described crossmodal influences in a wide range of tasks, it remains unclear how such influences drive performance enhancements. In particular, the neural mechanisms underlying performance-relevant crossmodal influences, as well as the latency and spatial profile of such influences are not well understood. Here, we examined data from high-density electroencephalography (N = 30) and electrocorticography (N = 4) recordings to characterize the oscillatory signatures of crossmodal facilitation of response speed, as manifested in the speeding of visual responses by concurrent task-irrelevant auditory information. Using a data-driven analysis approach, we found that individual gains in response speed correlated with reduced beta power (13-25 Hz) in the audiovisual compared with the visual condition, starting within 80 ms after stimulus onset in multisensory association and secondary visual areas. In addition, the electrocorticography data revealed a beta power suppression in audiovisual compared with visual trials in the superior temporal gyrus (STG). Our data suggest that the crossmodal facilitation of response speed is associated with early beta power in multisensory association and secondary visual areas, presumably reflecting the enhancement of early sensory processing through selective attention. This finding furthers our understanding of the neural correlates underlying crossmodal response speed facilitation and highlights the critical role of beta oscillations in mediating behaviorally relevant audiovisual processing.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.26.445829v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Bodily rhythms appear as novel scaffolding mechanisms orchestrating the spatio-temporal organization of spontaneous brain activity. Here, we follow up on the discovery of the gastric resting-state network (Rebollo et al, 2018), composed of brain regions in which the fMRI signal is phase-synchronized to the slow (0.05 Hz) electrical rhythm of the stomach. Using a larger sample size (n=63 human participants), we further characterize the anatomy and effect sizes of gastric-brain coupling across resting-state networks, a fine grained cortical parcellation, as well as along the main gradients of cortical organization. Most (67%) of the gastric network is included in the somato-motor-auditory (38%) and visual (29%) resting state networks. Gastric brain coupling also occurs in the granular insula and, to a lesser extent, in the piriform cortex. Thus, all sensory and motor cortices corresponding to both exteroceptive and interoceptive modalities are coupled to the gastric rhythm during rest. Conversely, little gastric-brain coupling occurs in cognitive networks and transmodal regions. These results suggest not only that gastric rhythm and sensory-motor processes are likely to interact, but also that gastric-brain coupling might be a mechanism of sensory and motor integration that mostly bypasses cognition, complementing the classical hierarchical organization of the human brain.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.26.445807v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Behavior exhibited by humans and other organisms is generally inconsistent and biased, and thus is often labeled irrational. However, the origins of this seemingly suboptimal behavior remain elusive. We developed a behavioral task and normative framework to reveal how organisms should allocate their limited processing resources such that there is an advantage to being imprecise and biased for a given metabolic investment that guarantees maximal utility. We found that mice act as rational-inattentive agents by adaptively allocating their sensory resources in a way that maximizes reward consumption in novel stimulus-reward association environments. Surprisingly, perception to commonly occurring stimuli was relatively imprecise, however this apparent statistical fallacy implies &quot;awareness&quot; and efficient adaptation to their neurocognitive limitations. Interestingly, distributional reinforcement learning mechanisms efficiently regulate sensory precision via top-down normalization. These findings establish a neurobehavioral foundation for how organisms efficiently perceive and adapt to environmental states of the world within the constraints imposed by neurobiology.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Integration of multi-frequency sounds into a unified perceptual object is critical for recognizing syllables in speech. This &quot;feature binding&quot; relies on the precise synchrony of each component's onset timing, but little is known regarding its neural correlates. We find that multi-frequency sounds prevalent in vocalizations, specifically harmonics, preferentially activate the mouse secondary auditory cortex (A2), whose response deteriorates with shifts in component onset timings. The temporal window for harmonics integration in A2 was broadened by inactivation of somatostatin-expressing interneurons (SOM cells), but not parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PV cells). Importantly, A2 has functionally connected subnetworks of neurons encoding harmonic, but not inharmonic sounds. These subnetworks are stable across days and exist prior to experimental harmonics exposure, suggesting their formation during development. Furthermore, A2 inactivation impairs performance in a discrimination task for coincident harmonics. Together, we propose A2 as a locus for harmonic integration, which may form the circuit basis for vocal processing.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.26.445793v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Optically pumped magnetometer-based magnetoencephalography (OP-MEG) can be used to measure neuromagnetic fields while participants move in a magnetically shielded room. Head movements in previous OP-MEG studies have been up to 20 cm translation and ~30 degrees rotation in a sitting position. While this represents a step-change over static MEG systems, naturalistic head movement is likely to exceed these limits, particularly when participants are standing up. In this proof-of-concept study, we sought to push the movement limits of OP-MEG even further. Using a 90 channel (45-sensor) whole-head OP-MEG system and concurrent motion capture, we recorded auditory evoked fields while participants were: (i) sitting still, (ii) standing up and still, and (iii) standing up and making large natural head movements continuously throughout the recording - maximum translation 120 cm, maximum rotation 198 degrees. Following pre-processing, movement artefacts were substantially reduced but not eliminated. However, upon utilisation of a beamformer, the M100 event-related field localised to primary auditory regions. Furthermore, the event-related fields from auditory cortex were remarkably consistent across the three conditions. These results suggest that a wide range of movement is possible with current OP-MEG systems. This in turn underscores the exciting potential of OP-MEG for recording neural activity during naturalistic paradigms that involve movement (e.g. navigation), and for scanning populations who are difficult to study with static MEG (e.g. young children).</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.26.445778v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Recent theories and data suggest that adapted behavior involves economic computations during which multiple trade-offs between reward value, accuracy requirement, energy expenditure and elapsing time are solved so as to obtain rewards as soon as possible while spending the least possible amount of energy. However, the relative impact of movement energy and duration costs on perceptual decision-making and movement initiation is poorly understood. Here, we tested 31 healthy subjects on a perceptual decision-making task in which they executed reaching movements to report probabilistic choices. In three distinct blocks of trials, the reaching time and energy costs were independently varied while decision difficulty was maintained similar at the block level. Participants also performed a fully instructed delayed-reaching (DR) task in each motor condition. Results in that DR task show that time-consuming movements extended reaction times (RTs) in most subjects, whereas energy-consuming movements led to mixed effects on RTs. In the choice task, about half of the subjects decreased their decision durations (DDs) in the time consuming condition, while the impact of energy costs on DDs were again mixed across subjects. Decision accuracy was overall similar across motor conditions. These results indicate that movement duration and, to a lesser extent, energy expenditure, idiosyncratically affect perceptual decision-making and action initiation. We propose that subjects who shortened their decisions in the time consuming condition of the choice task did so to limit a drop of their rate of reward.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Fish use olfaction to gain a variety of information. To know what they receive and how they receive is important for understanding the species. However, studies on fish olfactory or pheromone receptors are still few and most of them are based on the neural response from a cultured cell. Here, we established a method to detect a biological-derived neural response from the olfactory epithelium of East African cichlid, the most diversified fish lineage, by c-fos in situ hybridization. We tested the response of microvillous neurons, which are expected to be dominated by V2R-expressing neurons, against several odorants. We showed microvillous neurons respond to amino acids the most whereas they do not respond to conjugated steroids. We next tested the response of V2R receptors. Although some subfamilies of V2R responded to amino acids, other did not respond which contrasts with the traditional hypothesis. Especially, one V2R subfamily responded to arginine. Not all the copies in this subfamily responded to arginine, which indicates the ligand differentiation in the cichlid-specifically expanded subfamily. Finally, we tested the response of putative pheromone receptor V1R to male urine. For this experiment, we established a new method to collect urine from cichlid. We showed two V1R receptors responded to male urine. Moreover, we showed that V1R2 receptor responded to 4-hydroxyphenyl acetate and lithocholic acid. This study is expected to provide a basis for the study on the olfaction of East African cichlids.</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Polygenic risk score for Alzheimer's Disease in Caribbean Hispanics</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26131?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) assess the individual genetic propensity to a condition by combining sparse information scattered across genetic loci, often displaying small effect sizes. Most PRSs are constructed in European‐ancestry populations, limiting their use in other ethnicities. Here we constructed and validated a PRS for late‐onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD) in Caribbean Hispanics (CH).


Methods
We employed a CH discovery (N=4,312) and independent validation sample (N=1,850) to construct an ancestry‐specific PRS (“CH‐PRS”) and evaluated its performance alone and with other predictors using the area under curve (AUC) and logistic regression (strength of association with LOAD and statistical significance). We tested if CH‐PRS predicted conversion to LOAD in a subsample with longitudinal data (N=1,239). We also tested the CH‐PRS in an independent replication CH cohort (N=200) and brain autopsy cohort (N=33). Finally, we tested the effect of ancestry on PRS by employing European and African American discovery cohorts to construct alternative PRSs (“EUR‐PRS”, “AA‐PRS”).


Results
The full model (LOAD ~ CH‐PRS + sex + age + APOE‐&amp;amp;ip.eop;4), achieved an AUC=74% (ORCH‐PRS=1.51 95%CI=1.36‐1.68), raising to &amp;gt;75% in APOE‐&amp;amp;ip.eop;4 non‐carriers. CH‐PRS alone achieved an AUC=72% in the autopsy cohort, raising to AUC=83% in full model. Higher CH‐PRS was significantly associated with clinical LOAD in the replication CH cohort (OR=1.61, 95%CI=1.19‐2.17) and significantly predicted conversion to LOAD (HR=1.93, CI=1.70‐2.20) in the longitudinal subsample. EUR‐PRS and AA‐PRS reached lower prediction accuracy (AUC=58% and 53%, respectively).


Interpretation
Enriching diversity in genetic studies is critical to provide an effective PRS in profiling LOAD risk across populations.

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26102?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Attentional deficits following degeneration of brain cholinergic systems contribute to gait–balance deficits in Parkinson disease (PD). As a step toward assessing whether α4β2* nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) stimulation improves gait–balance function, we assessed target engagement of the α4β2* nAChR partial agonist varenicline.


Methods
Nondemented PD participants with cholinergic deficits were identified with [18F]fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol positron emission tomography (PET). α4β2* nAChR occupancy after subacute oral varenicline treatment was measured with [18F]flubatine PET. With a dose selected from the nAChR occupancy experiment, varenicline effects on gait, balance, and cognition were assessed in a double‐masked placebo‐controlled crossover study. Primary endpoints were normal pace gait speed and a measure of postural stability.


Results
Varenicline doses (0.25mg per day, 0.25mg twice daily [b.i.d.], 0.5mg b.i.d., and 1.0mg b.i.d.) produced 60 to 70% receptor occupancy. We selected 0.5mg orally b.i.d for the crossover study. Thirty‐three participants completed the crossover study with excellent tolerability. Varenicline had no significant impact on the postural stability measure and caused slower normal pace gait speed. Varenicline narrowed the difference in normal pace gait speed between dual task and no dual task gait conditions, reduced dual task cost, and improved sustained attention test performance. We obtained identical conclusions in 28 participants with treatment compliance confirmed by plasma varenicline measurements.


Interpretation
Varenicline occupied α4β2* nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, was tolerated well, enhanced attention, and altered gait performance. These results are consistent with target engagement. α4β2* agonists may be worth further evaluation for mitigation of gait and balance disorders in PD. ANN NEUROL 2021</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: PRER: A patient representation with pairwise relative expression of proteins on biological networks</title>

Changes in protein and gene expression levels are often used as features in predictive modeling such as survival prediction. A common strategy to aggregate information contained in individual proteins is to integrate the expression levels with the biological networks. In this work, we propose a novel patient representation where we integrate proteins’ expression levels with the protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks: Patient representation with PRER (Pairwise Relative Expressions with Random walks) (PRER). PRER captures the dysregulation patterns of proteins based on the neighborhood of a protein in the PPI network. Specifically, PRER computes a feature vector for a patient by comparing the source protein’s expression level with other proteins’ levels that are within its neighborhood. The neighborhood of the source protein is derived by biased random-walk strategy on the network. We test PRER’s performance in survival prediction task in 10 different cancers using random forest survival models. PRER yields a statistically significant predictive performance in 9 out of 10 cancers when compared to the same model trained with features based on individual protein expressions. Furthermore, we identified the pairs of proteins that their interactions are predictive of patient survival but their individual expression levels are not. The set of identified relations provides a valuable collection of protein biomarkers with high prognostic value. PRER can be used for other complex diseases and prediction tasks that use molecular expression profiles as input.

Hyperactivation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway can cause malformation of cortical development (MCD) with associated epilepsy and intellectual disability (ID) through a yet unknown mechanism. Here, we made use of the recently identified dominant-active mutation in &lt;i&gt;Ras Homolog Enriched in Brain 1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;RHEB&lt;/i&gt;), RHEBp.P37L, to gain insight in the mechanism underlying the epilepsy caused by hyperactivation of the mTOR pathway. Focal expression of RHEBp.P37L in mouse somatosensory cortex (SScx) results in an MCD-like phenotype, with increased mTOR signaling, ectopic localization of neurons, and reliable generalized seizures. We show that in this model, the mTOR-dependent seizures are caused by enhanced axonal connectivity, causing hyperexcitability of distally connected neurons. Indeed, blocking axonal vesicle release from the RHEBp.P37L neurons alone completely stopped the seizures and normalized the hyperexcitability of the distally connected neurons. These results provide new evidence of the extent of anatomical and physiological abnormalities caused by mTOR hyperactivity, beyond local malformations, which can lead to generalized epilepsy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/V9fN7mJ3TKQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Chemokines act as phosphatidylserine-bound “find-me” signals in apoptotic cell clearance</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/YjUGdCwxqGM/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Sergio M. Pontejo, Philip M. Murphy&lt;/p&gt;

Removal of apoptotic cells is essential for maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Chemotactic cues termed “find-me” signals attract phagocytes toward apoptotic cells, which selectively expose the anionic phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS) and other “eat-me” signals to distinguish healthy from apoptotic cells for phagocytosis. Blebs released by apoptotic cells can deliver find-me signals; however, the mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that apoptotic blebs generated in vivo from mouse thymus attract phagocytes using endogenous chemokines bound to the bleb surface. We show that chemokine binding to apoptotic cells is mediated by PS and that high affinity binding of PS and other anionic phospholipids is a general property of many but not all chemokines. Chemokines are positively charged proteins that also bind to anionic glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) on cell surfaces for presentation to leukocyte G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs). We found that apoptotic cells down-regulate GAGs as they up-regulate PS on the cell surface and that PS-bound chemokines, unlike GAG-bound chemokines, are able to directly activate chemokine receptors. Thus, we conclude that PS-bound chemokines may serve as find-me signals on apoptotic vesicles acting at cognate chemokine receptors on leukocytes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/YjUGdCwxqGM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: EfgA is a conserved formaldehyde sensor that leads to bacterial growth arrest in response to elevated formaldehyde</title>

Normal cellular processes give rise to toxic metabolites that cells must mitigate. Formaldehyde is a universal stressor and potent metabolic toxin that is generated in organisms from bacteria to humans. Methylotrophic bacteria such as &lt;i&gt;Methylorubrum extorquens&lt;/i&gt; face an acute challenge due to their production of formaldehyde as an obligate central intermediate of single-carbon metabolism. Mechanisms to sense and respond to formaldehyde were speculated to exist in methylotrophs for decades but had never been discovered. Here, we identify a member of the DUF336 domain family, named &lt;i&gt;efgA&lt;/i&gt; for enhanced formaldehyde growth, that plays an important role in endogenous formaldehyde stress response in &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;extorquens&lt;/i&gt; PA1 and is found almost exclusively in methylotrophic taxa. Our experimental analyses reveal that EfgA is a formaldehyde sensor that rapidly arrests growth in response to elevated levels of formaldehyde. Heterologous expression of EfgA in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; increases formaldehyde resistance, indicating that its interaction partners are widespread and conserved. EfgA represents the first example of a formaldehyde stress response system that does not involve enzymatic detoxification. Thus, EfgA comprises a unique stress response mechanism in bacteria, whereby a single protein directly senses elevated levels of a toxic intracellular metabolite and safeguards cells from potential damage.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/RiUQLYU__lI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Evidence for a gradient within the medial temporal lobes for flexible retrieval under hierarchical task rules</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23365?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
A fundamental question in memory research is how the hippocampus processes contextual cues to retrieve distinct mnemonic associations. Prior research has emphasized the importance of hippocampal–prefrontal interactions for context‐dependent memory. Our fMRI study examined the human medial temporal lobes (MTL) and their prefrontal interactions when retrieving memories associated with hierarchically organized task contexts. Participants learned virtual object‐location associations governed by subordinate and superordinate task rules, which could be independently cued to change. On each fMRI trial, participants retrieved the correct object for convergent rule and location contextual information. Results demonstrated that hippocampal activity and hippocampal–prefrontal functional interconnectivity distinguished retrieval under different levels of hierarchically organized task rules. In explicit contrast to the hippocampal tail, anterior (body and head) regions were recruited specifically for superordinate changes in the contextual hierarchy. The hippocampal body also differed in its functional connectivity with the prefrontal cortex for superordinate versus subordinate changes. Our findings demonstrate a gradient in MTL for associative retrieval under changing task rules, and advance understanding of hippocampal–prefrontal interactions that support flexible contextual memory.</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Longitudinal CSF Iron Pathway Proteins in Post‐Hemorrhagic Hydrocephalus: Associations with Ventricle Size and Neurodevelopmental Outcomes</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26133?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Iron has been implicated in the pathogenesis of brain injury and hydrocephalus after preterm germinal matrix hemorrhage‐intraventricular hemorrhage, however it is unknown how external or endogenous intraventricular clearance of iron pathway proteins affect outcome in this group.


Methods
This prospective multi‐center cohort included patients with post‐hemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) who underwent temporary and permanent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion and Bayley Scales of Infant Development‐III testing around 2 years of age. CSF proteins in the iron handling pathway were analyzed longitudinally and compared to ventricle size and neurodevelopmental outcomes.


Results
Thirty‐seven patients met inclusion criteria with a median estimated gestational age at birth of 25 weeks; 65% were male. CSF hemoglobin, iron, total bilirubin, and ferritin decreased between temporary and permanent CSF diversion with no change in CSF ceruloplasmin, transferrin, haptoglobin and hepcidin; and an increase in CSF hemopexin. Larger ventricle size at permanent CSF diversion was associated with elevated CSF ferritin (p = 0.015) and decreased CSF hemopexin (p = 0.007). CSF levels of proteins at temporary CSF diversion were not associated with outcome, however higher CSF transferrin at permanent CSF diversion was associated with improved cognitive outcome (p = 0.015). Importantly, longitudinal change in CSF iron pathway proteins, ferritin (decrease) and transferrin (increase) were associated with improved cognitive (p = 0.04) and motor (p = 0.03) scores and improved cognitive (p = 0.04), language (p = 0.035) and motor (p = 0.008) scores, respectively.


Interpretation.
Longitudinal changes in CSF transferrin (increase) and ferritin (decrease) are associated with improved neurodevelopmental outcomes in neonatal PHH, with implications for understanding pathogenesis of poor outcomes in PHH.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Reversible Cellular Automata (RCA) are a particular kind of shift-invariant
transformations characterized by a dynamics composed only of disjoint cycles.
They have many applications in the simulation of physical systems, cryptography
and reversible computing. In this work, we formulate the search of a specific
class of RCA -- namely, those whose local update rules are defined by conserved
landscapes -- as an optimization problem to be tackled with Genetic Algorithms
(GA) and Genetic Programming (GP). In particular, our experimental
investigation revolves around three different research questions, which we
address through a single-objective, a multi-objective, and a lexicographic
approach. The results obtained from our experiments corroborate the previous
findings and shed new light on 1) the difficulty of the associated optimization
problem for GA and GP, 2) the relevance of conserved landscape CA in the domain
of cryptography and reversible computing, and 3) the relationship between the
reversibility property and the Hamming weight.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When we look at the world around us, we see complex physical systems and
emergent phenomena. Emergence occurs when a system is observed to have
properties that its parts do not have on their own. These properties or
behaviors emerge only when the parts interact in a wider whole. Examples of
emergence can vary from the synchronization of pendulum clocks hanging on the
same wall to the phenomenon of life as an emergent property of chemistry. One
of the most complex systems that exist in nature is the human brain. It
contains on average 100 to 200 billion neurons and about 100 trillion synapses
connecting them. From this vast neuronal dynamics, the ability to learn and
store memory emerges as well as the ability to have complex cognitive skills,
conscious experience and a sense of self. In this work, we investigated how
complex systems like the human brain and chaotic systems create emergent
properties. In order to do so, we used network theory (paper 1), chaos and
synchronization theory (paper 2 and 3).

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11989</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background The learning of genotype-phenotype associations and history of
human disease by doing detailed and precise analysis of phenotypic
abnormalities can be defined as deep phenotyping. To understand and detect this
interaction between phenotype and genotype is a fundamental step when
translating precision medicine to clinical practice. The recent advances in the
field of machine learning is efficient to predict these interactions between
abnormal human phenotypes and genes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methods In this study, we developed a framework to predict links between
human phenotype ontology (HPO) and genes. The annotation data from the
heterogeneous knowledge resources i.e., orphanet, is used to parse human
phenotype-gene associations. To generate the embeddings for the nodes (HPO &amp;amp;
genes), an algorithm called node2vec was used. It performs node sampling on
this graph based on random walks, then learns features over these sampled nodes
to generate embeddings. These embeddings were used to perform the downstream
task to predict the presence of the link between these nodes using 5 different
supervised machine learning algorithms.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results: The downstream link prediction task shows that the Gradient Boosting
Decision Tree based model (LightGBM) achieved an optimal AUROC 0.904 and AUCPR
0.784. In addition, LightGBM achieved an optimal weighted F1 score of 0.87.
Compared to the other 4 methods LightGBM is able to find more accurate
interaction/link between human phenotype &amp;amp; gene pairs.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: DTNN: Energy-efficient Inference with Dendrite Tree Inspired Neural Networks for Edge Vision Applications. (arXiv:2105.11848v1 [cs.CV])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11848</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep neural networks (DNN) have achieved remarkable success in computer
vision (CV). However, training and inference of DNN models are both memory and
computation intensive, incurring significant overhead in terms of energy
consumption and silicon area. In particular, inference is much more
cost-sensitive than training because training can be done offline with powerful
platforms, while inference may have to be done on battery powered devices with
constrained form factors, especially for mobile or edge vision applications. In
order to accelerate DNN inference, model quantization was proposed. However
previous works only focus on the quantization rate without considering the
efficiency of operations. In this paper, we propose Dendrite-Tree based Neural
Network (DTNN) for energy-efficient inference with table lookup operations
enabled by activation quantization. In DTNN both costly weight access and
arithmetic computations are eliminated for inference. We conducted experiments
on various kinds of DNN models such as LeNet-5, MobileNet, VGG, and ResNet with
different datasets, including MNIST, Cifar10/Cifar100, SVHN, and ImageNet. DTNN
achieved significant energy saving (19.4X and 64.9X improvement on ResNet-18
and VGG-11 with ImageNet, respectively) with negligible loss of accuracy. To
further validate the effectiveness of DTNN and compare with state-of-the-art
low energy implementation for edge vision, we design and implement DTNN based
MLP image classifiers using off-the-shelf FPGAs. The results show that DTNN on
the FPGA, with higher accuracy, could achieve orders of magnitude better energy
consumption and latency compared with the state-of-the-art low energy
approaches reported that use ASIC chips.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Optimal ANN-SNN Conversion for Fast and Accurate Inference in Deep Spiking Neural Networks. (arXiv:2105.11654v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11654</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), as bio-inspired energy-efficient neural
networks, have attracted great attentions from researchers and industry. The
most efficient way to train deep SNNs is through ANN-SNN conversion. However,
the conversion usually suffers from accuracy loss and long inference time,
which impede the practical application of SNN. In this paper, we theoretically
analyze ANN-SNN conversion and derive sufficient conditions of the optimal
conversion. To better correlate ANN-SNN and get greater accuracy, we propose
Rate Norm Layer to replace the ReLU activation function in source ANN training,
enabling direct conversion from a trained ANN to an SNN. Moreover, we propose
an optimal fit curve to quantify the fit between the activation value of source
ANN and the actual firing rate of target SNN. We show that the inference time
can be reduced by optimizing the upper bound of the fit curve in the revised
ANN to achieve fast inference. Our theory can explain the existing work on fast
reasoning and get better results. The experimental results show that the
proposed method achieves near loss less conversion with VGG-16,
PreActResNet-18, and deeper structures. Moreover, it can reach 8.6x faster
reasoning performance under 0.265x energy consumption of the typical method.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: HIN-RNN: A Graph Representation Learning Neural Network for Fraudster Group Detection With No Handcrafted Features. (arXiv:2105.11602v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11602</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Social reviews are indispensable resources for modern consumers' decision
making. For financial gain, companies pay fraudsters preferably in groups to
demote or promote products and services since consumers are more likely to be
misled by a large number of similar reviews from groups. Recent approaches on
fraudster group detection employed handcrafted features of group behaviors
without considering the semantic relation between reviews from the reviewers in
a group. In this paper, we propose the first neural approach, HIN-RNN, a
Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN) Compatible RNN for fraudster group
detection that requires no handcrafted features. HIN-RNN provides a unifying
architecture for representation learning of each reviewer, with the initial
vector as the sum of word embeddings of all review text written by the same
reviewer, concatenated by the ratio of negative reviews. Given a co-review
network representing reviewers who have reviewed the same items with the same
ratings and the reviewers' vector representation, a collaboration matrix is
acquired through HIN-RNN training. The proposed approach is confirmed to be
effective with marked improvement over state-of-the-art approaches on both the
Yelp (22% and 12% in terms of recall and F1-value, respectively) and Amazon (4%
and 2% in terms of recall and F1-value, respectively) datasets.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11586</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We propose an approach to saddle point optimization relying only on an oracle
that solves a minimization problem approximately. We analyze its convergence
property on a strongly convex--concave problem and show its linear convergence
toward the global min--max saddle point. Based on the convergence analysis, we
propose a heuristic approach to adapt the learning rate for the proposed saddle
point optimization approach. The implementation of the proposed approach using
the (1+1)-CMA-ES as the minimization oracle, namely Adversarial-CMA-ES, is
evaluated on test problems. Numerical evaluation reveals the tightness of the
theoretical convergence rate bound as well as the efficiency of the learning
rate adaptation mechanism. As an example of real-world applications, it is
applied to automatic berthing control problems under model uncertainties,
showing its usefulness in obtaining solutions robust under model uncertainties.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11521</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hybrid Analysis and Modeling (HAM) is an emerging modeling paradigm which
aims to combine physics-based modeling (PBM) and data-driven modeling (DDM) to
create generalizable, trustworthy, accurate, computationally efficient and
self-evolving models. Here, we introduce, justify and demonstrate a novel
approach to HAM -- the Corrective Source Term Approach (CoSTA) -- which
augments the governing equation of a PBM model with a corrective source term
generated by a deep neural network (DNN). In a series of numerical experiments
on one-dimensional heat diffusion, CoSTA is generally found to outperform
comparable DDM and PBM models in terms of accuracy -- often reducing predictive
errors by several orders of magnitude -- while also generalizing better than
pure DDM. Due to its flexible but solid theoretical foundation, CoSTA provides
a modular framework for leveraging novel developments within both PBM and DDM,
and due to the interpretability of the DNN-generated source term within the PBM
paradigm, CoSTA can be a potential door-opener for data-driven techniques to
enter high-stakes applications previously reserved for pure PBM.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: On the Genotype Compression and Expansion for Evolutionary Algorithms in the Continuous Domain. (arXiv:2105.11502v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11502</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This paper investigates the influence of genotype size on evolutionary
algorithms' performance. We consider genotype compression (where genotype is
smaller than phenotype) and expansion (genotype is larger than phenotype) and
define different strategies to reconstruct the original variables of the
phenotype from both the compressed and expanded genotypes. We test our approach
with several evolutionary algorithms over three sets of optimization problems:
COCO benchmark functions, modeling of Physical Unclonable Functions, and neural
network weight optimization. Our results show that genotype expansion works
significantly better than compression, and in many scenarios, outperforms the
original genotype encoding. This could be attributed to the change in the
genotype-phenotype mapping introduced with the expansion methods: this
modification beneficially transforms the domain landscape and alleviates the
search space traversal.

	<title>Journal of Neurology: Mutations in MT-ATP6 are a frequent cause of adult-onset spinocerebellar ataxia</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Adult-onset ataxias are a genetically and clinically heterogeneous group of movement disorders. In addition to nuclear gene mutations, sequence changes have also been described in the mitochondrial genome. Here, we present findings of mutation analysis of the mitochondrial gene &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;MT-ATP6&lt;/em&gt;. We analyzed 94 patients with adult-onset spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), including 34 sporadic cases. In all patients, common sequence changes found in SCAs such as repeat expansions and point mutations had been excluded previously. We found pathogenic &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;MT-ATP&lt;/em&gt; variants in five of these patients (5.32%), two of whom were sporadic. Four of the five mutations have not previously been described in ataxias. All but one of these mutations affect transmembrane helices of subunit-α of ATP synthase. Two mutations (p.G16S, and p.P18S) disrupt transmembrane helix 1 (TMH1), one mutation (p.G167D) affects TMH5, and another one (p.L217P) TMH6. The fifth mutation (p.T96A) describes an amino acid change in close proximity to transmembrane helix 3 (TMH3). The level of heteroplasmy was either complete or very high ranging from 87 to 99%. The high prevalence of pathogenic &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;MT-ATP6&lt;/em&gt; variants suggests that analysis of this gene should be included in the routine workup of both hereditary and sporadic ataxias.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Eriodictyol Attenuates MCAO-Induced Brain Injury and Neurological Deficits via Reversing the Autophagy Dysfunction</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.655125</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The present study was designed to investigate the protective effect of eriodictyol on MCAO-induced brain injury and its regulation of neural function and to explore the mechanism of its regulation of autophagy in rats. Brain injury was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in adult rats and pretreated with eriodictyol (low dose: 20 mg/kg; medium dose: 40 mg/kg; high dose: 80 mg/kg) or saline. Rats in the treatment group had a smaller volume of infarction and improved neurological outcome and reduced the latency to the platform, increased the time spent in the correct quadrant compared to MCAO rats pretreated with saline. ELISA kits results confirmed that eriodictyol reduced the inflammatory response induced by MCAO. The results of apoptosis and proliferation by Nissl staining and immunofluorescence detection indicated that eriodictyol could inhibit apoptosis and promote the proliferation in MCAO rats. The expressions of LC3, ATG5, p62, and Beclin1 were used to evaluate the autophagy, as well as the reversal of the autophagy activator (rapamycin) on the neuroprotective effect of eriodictyol, which suggested that the protective effect of eriodictyol on brain injury may be related to the inhibition of autophagy. In summary, we, therefore, suggested that eriodictyol could reduce the inflammation response of brain injury and inhibit neuroapoptosis, directly affecting autophagy to alleviate brain injury. It will provide theoretical support for eriodictyol in the treatment of ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Stochasticity Versus Determinacy in Neurobiology: From Ion Channels to the Question of the “Free Will”</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.629436</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;If one accepts that decisions are made by the brain and that neuronal mechanisms obey deterministic physical laws, it is hard to deny what some brain researchers postulate, such as “We do not do what we want, but we want what we do” and “We should stop talking about freedom. Our actions are determined by physical laws.” This point of view has been substantially supported by spectacular neurophysiological experiments demonstrating action-related brain activity (readiness potentials, blood oxygen level–dependent signals) occurring up to several seconds before an individual becomes aware of his/her decision to perform the action. This report aims to counter the deterministic argument for the absence of free will by using experimental data, supplemented by computer simulations, to demonstrate that biological systems, specifically brain functions, are built on principle randomness, which is introduced already at the lowest level of neuronal information processing, the opening and closing of ion channels. Switching between open and closed states follows physiological laws but also makes use of randomness, which is apparently introduced by Brownian motion – principally unavoidable under all life-compatible conditions. Ion-channel stochasticity, manifested as noise, function is not smoothed out toward higher functional levels but can even be amplified by appropriate adjustment of the system’s non-linearities. Examples shall be given to illustrate how stochasticity can propagate from ion channels to single neuron action potentials to neuronal network dynamics to the interactions between different brain nuclei up to the control of autonomic functions. It is proposed that this intrinsic stochasticity helps to keep the brain in a flexible state to explore diverse alternatives as a prerequisite of free decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: NPY Released From GABA Neurons of the Dentate Gyrus Specially Reduces Contextual Fear Without Affecting Cued or Trace Fear</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2021.635726</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Disproportionate, maladapted, and generalized fear are essential hallmarks of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which develops upon severe trauma in a subset of exposed individuals. Among the brain areas that are processing fear memories, the hippocampal formation exerts a central role linking emotional-affective with cognitive aspects. In the hippocampus, neuronal excitability is constrained by multiple GABAergic interneurons with highly specialized functions and an extensive repertoire of co-released neuromodulators. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is one of these co-transmitters that significantly affects hippocampal signaling, with ample evidence supporting its fundamental role in emotional, cognitive, and metabolic circuitries. Here we investigated the role of NPY in relation to GABA, both released from the same interneurons of the dorsal dentate gyrus (DG), in different aspects of fear conditioning. We demonstrated that activation of dentate GABA neurons specifically during fear recall reduced cue-related as well as trace-related freezing behavior, whereas inhibition of the same neurons had no significant effects. Interestingly, concomitant overexpression of NPY in these neurons did not further modify fear recall, neither under baseline conditions nor upon chemogenetic stimulation. However, potentially increased co-release of NPY substantially reduced contextual fear, promoted extinction learning, and long-term suppression of fear in a foreground context–conditioning paradigm. Importantly, NPY in the dorsal DG was not only expressed in somatostatin neurons, but also in parvalbumin-positive basket cells and axoaxonic cells, indicating intense feedback and feedforward modulation of hippocampal signaling and precise curtailing of neuronal engrams. Thus, these findings suggest that co-release of NPY from specific interneuron populations of the dorsal DG modifies dedicated aspects of hippocampal processing by sharpening the activation of neural engrams and the consecutive fear response. Since inappropriate and generalized fear is the major impediment in the treatment of PTSD patients, the dentate NPY system may be a suitable access point to ameliorate PTSD symptoms and improve the inherent disease course.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Case Report: Deep Brain Stimulation of the Nucleus Basalis of Meynert for Advanced Alzheimer's Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.645584</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Patients with advanced Alzheimer's disease (AD) experience cognitive impairment and physical disabilities in daily life. Currently, there are no treatments available to slow down the course of the disease, and limited treatments exist only to treat symptoms. However, deep brain stimulation of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM-DBS) has been reported to improve cognitive function in individuals with AD. Here, we report the effects of NBM-DBS on cognitive function in a subject with severe AD. An 80-year-old male with severe AD (Clinical Dementia Rating scale: 3.0 points) underwent surgery for bilateral NBM-DBS electrode placement. After 10 weeks of stimulation, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) assessment improved from a score of 5 to 9 points, and assessment using the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale–Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog) showed a marked reduction in total score from 43 to 33 points, suggesting cognitive benefits from NBM-DBS. The patient's postoperative course was complicated by a subdural effusion that occurred several days after surgery, with complete recovery. Interestingly, the subject also displayed abnormal thermoregulation with stimulation initiation and stimulation parameter modifications. NBM-DBS may serve as a potential therapy for severe AD patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration: ChiCTR1900022324.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Role of P2X7 Receptors in Immune Responses During Neurodegeneration</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.662935</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;P2X7 receptors are ion-gated channels activated by ATP. Under pathological conditions, the extensive release of ATP induces sustained P2X7 receptor activation, culminating in induction of proinflammatory pathways with inflammasome assembly and cytokine release. These inflammatory conditions, whether occurring peripherally or in the central nervous system (CNS), increase blood-brain-barrier (BBB) permeability. Besides its well-known involvement in neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation, the P2X7 receptor may induce BBB disruption and chemotaxis of peripheral immune cells to the CNS, resulting in brain parenchyma infiltration. For instance, despite common effects on cytokine release, P2X7 receptor signaling is also associated with metalloproteinase secretion and activation, as well as migration and differentiation of T lymphocytes, monocytes and dendritic cells. Here we highlight that peripheral immune cells mediate the pathogenesis of Multiple Sclerosis and Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease, mainly through T lymphocyte, neutrophil and monocyte infiltration. We propose that P2X7 receptor activation contributes to neurodegenerative disease progression beyond its known effects on the CNS. This review discusses how P2X7 receptor activation mediates responses of peripheral immune cells within the inflamed CNS, as occurring in the aforementioned diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Synaptic Remodeling in the Cone Pathway After Early Postnatal Horizontal Cell Ablation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.657594</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The first synapse of the visual pathway is formed by photoreceptors, horizontal cells and bipolar cells. While ON bipolar cells invaginate into the photoreceptor terminal and form synaptic triads together with invaginating horizontal cell processes, OFF bipolar cells make flat contacts at the base of the terminal. When horizontal cells are ablated during retina development, no invaginating synapses are formed in rod photoreceptors. However, how cone photoreceptors and their synaptic connections with bipolar cells react to this insult, is unclear so far. To answer this question, we specifically ablated horizontal cells from the developing mouse retina. Following ablation around postnatal day 4 (P4)/P5, cones initially exhibited a normal morphology and formed flat contacts with OFF bipolar cells, but only few invaginating contacts with ON bipolar cells. From P15 on, synaptic remodeling became obvious with clustering of cone terminals and mislocalized cone somata in the OPL. Adult cones (P56) finally displayed highly branched axons with numerous terminals which contained ribbons and vesicular glutamate transporters. Furthermore, type 3a, 3b, and 4 OFF bipolar cell dendrites sprouted into the outer nuclear layer and even expressed glutamate receptors at the base of newly formed cone terminals. These results indicate that cones may be able to form new synapses with OFF bipolar cells in adult mice. In contrast, cone terminals lost their invaginating contacts with ON bipolar cells, highlighting the importance of horizontal cells for synapse maintenance. Taken together, our data demonstrate that early postnatal horizontal cell ablation leads to differential remodeling in the cone pathway: whereas synapses between cones and ON bipolar cells were lost, new putative synapses were established between cones and OFF bipolar cells. These results suggest that synapse formation and maintenance are regulated very differently between flat and invaginating contacts at cone terminals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Homocysteine and Folic Acid: Risk Factors for Alzheimer's Disease—An Updated Meta-Analysis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.665114</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Recent studies have reported that homocysteine (Hcy) may play a vital role in the pathogenesis of vascular dementia (VaD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our study explored the relationship between the plasma Hcy and folate levels and the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We searched Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science for published literature, including case-control studies and prospective cohort studies, and performed a systematic analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The results of our meta-analysis, consisting of case-control studies, showed higher levels of Hcy and lower levels of folate in dementia, AD, and VaD patients than those in non-demented controls (for dementia: SMD = 0.812, 95% CI [0.689, 0.936], p = 0.000 for Hcy; SMD = −0.677, 95% CI [−0.828, −0.525], p = 0.000 for folate). AD patients showed significantly lower plasma Hcy levels compared to VaD patients (SMD = −0.278, 95% CI [−0.466, −0.09], p = 0.000). Subgroup analysis revealed that ethnicity, average age, and dementia type had no significant effect on this association. Furthermore, from the analysis of prospective cohort studies, we identified that elevated plasma Hcy levels were associated with an increased risk of dementia, AD, and VaD (RR&lt;sub&gt;dementia&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.22, 95% CI [1.08, 1.36]; RR&lt;sub&gt;AD&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.07, 95% CI [1.04, 1.11]; RR&lt;sub&gt;VaD&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.13, 95% CI [1.04, 1.23]). In addition, every 5 μmol/L increase in the plasma Hcy level was associated with a 9% increased risk of dementia and a 12% increased risk of AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Hcy and folic acid are potential predictors of the occurrence and development of AD. A better understanding of their function in dementia could provide evidence for clinicians to rationalize clinical intervention strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Artificial Intelligence Can Effectively Predict Early Hematoma Expansion of Intracerebral Hemorrhage Analyzing Noncontrast Computed Tomography Image</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.632138</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This study aims to develop and validate an artificial intelligence model based on deep learning to predict early hematoma enlargement (HE) in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage. A total of 1,899 noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) images of cerebral hemorrhage patients were retrospectively analyzed to establish a predicting model and 1,117 to validate the model. And a total of 118 patients with intracerebral hemorrhage were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria so as to validate the value of the model for clinical prediction. The baseline noncontrast computed tomography images within 6 h of intracerebral hemorrhage onset and the second noncontrast computed tomography performed at 24 ± 3 h from the onset were used to evaluate the prediction of intracerebral hemorrhage growth. In validation dataset 1, the AUC was 0.778 (95% CI, 0.768–0.786), the sensitivity was 0.818 (95% CI, 0.790–0.843), and the specificity was 0.601 (95% CI, 0.565–0.632). In validation dataset 2, the AUC was 0.780 (95% CI, 0.761–0.798), the sensitivity was 0.732 (95% CI, 0.682–0.788), and the specificity was 0.709 (95% CI, 0.658–0.759). The sensitivity of intracerebral hemorrhage hematoma expansion as predicted by an artificial intelligence imaging system was 89.3%, with a specificity of 77.8%, a positive predictive value of 55.6%, a negative predictive value of 95.9%, and a Yoden index of 0.671, which were much higher than those based on the manually labeled noncontrast computed tomography signs. Compared with the existing prediction methods through computed tomographic angiography (CTA) image features and noncontrast computed tomography image features analysis, the artificial intelligence model has higher specificity and sensitivity in the prediction of early hematoma enlargement in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/67624</link>
	<content:encoded>Dysfunction of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (mETC) is a major cause of human mitochondrial diseases. To identify determinants of mETC function, we screened a genome-wide human CRISPRi library under oxidative metabolic conditions with selective inhibition of mitochondrial Complex III and identified ovarian carcinoma immunoreactive antigen (OCIA) domain-containing protein 1 (OCIAD1) as a Complex III assembly factor. We find that OCIAD1 is an inner mitochondrial membrane protein that forms a complex with supramolecular prohibitin assemblies. Our data indicate that OCIAD1 is required for maintenance of normal steady-state levels of Complex III and the proteolytic processing of the catalytic subunit cytochrome &lt;i&gt;c&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; (CYC1). In OCIAD1 depleted mitochondria, unprocessed CYC1 is hemylated and incorporated into Complex III. We propose that OCIAD1 acts as an adaptor within prohibitin assemblies to stabilize and/or chaperone CYC1 and to facilitate its proteolytic processing by the IMMP2L protease.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64232</link>
	<content:encoded>In many bacteria and in eukaryotes, replication fork establishment requires the controlled loading of hexameric, ring-shaped helicases around DNA by AAA+ ATPases. How loading factors use ATP to control helicase deposition is poorly understood. Here, we dissect how specific ATPase elements of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; DnaC, an archetypal loader for the bacterial DnaB helicase, play distinct roles in helicase loading and the activation of DNA unwinding. We identify a new element, the arginine-coupler, which regulates the switch-like behavior of DnaC to prevent futile ATPase cycling and maintains loader responsiveness to replication restart systems. Our data help explain how the ATPase cycle of a AAA+-family helicase loader is channeled into productive action on its target; comparative studies indicate elements analogous to the Arg-coupler are present in related, switch-like AAA+ proteins that control replicative helicase loading in eukaryotes, as well as polymerase clamp loading and certain classes of DNA transposases.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63488</link>
	<content:encoded>Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is characterized by short stature, skeletal deformities, low bone mass, and motor deficits. A subset of OI patients also present with joint hypermobility; however, the role of tendon dysfunction in OI pathogenesis is largely unknown. Using the&lt;i&gt; Crtap&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mouse model of severe, recessive OI, we found that mutant Achilles and patellar tendons were thinner and weaker with increased collagen cross-links and reduced collagen fibril size at 1- and 4-months compared to wildtype. Patellar tendons from &lt;i&gt;Crtap&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice also had altered numbers of CD146&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD200&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD146&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;CD200&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; progenitor-like cells at skeletal maturity.

	<title>eLife: Phenotypic plasticity underlies local invasion and distant metastasis in colon cancer</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61461</link>
	<content:encoded>Phenotypic plasticity represents the most relevant hallmark of the carcinoma cell as it bestows it with the capacity of transiently altering its morphologic and functional features while &lt;i&gt;en route&lt;/i&gt; to the metastatic site. However, the study of phenotypic plasticity is hindered by the rarity of these events within primary lesions and by the lack of experimental models. Here, we identified a subpopulation of phenotypic plastic colon cancer cells: EpCAM&lt;sup&gt;lo&lt;/sup&gt; cells are motile, invasive, chemo-resistant, and highly metastatic. EpCAM&lt;sup&gt;lo&lt;/sup&gt; bulk and single-cell RNAseq analysis indicated 1. enhanced Wnt/b-catenin signaling, 2. a broad spectrum of degrees of EMT activation including hybrid E/M states (partial EMT) with highly plastic features, and 3. high correlation with the CMS4 subtype, accounting for colon cancer cases with poor prognosis and a pronounced stromal component. Of note, a signature of genes specifically expressed in EpCAM&lt;sup&gt;lo&lt;/sup&gt; cancer cells is highly predictive of overall survival in tumors other than CMS4, thus highlighting the relevance of quasi-mesenchymal tumor cells across the spectrum of colon cancers. Enhanced Wnt and the downstream EMT activation represent key events in eliciting phenotypic plasticity along the invasive front of primary colon carcinomas. Distinct sets of epithelial and mesenchymal genes define transcriptional trajectories through which state transitions arise. pEMT cells, often earmarked by the extracellular matrix glycoprotein SPARC together with nuclear ZEB1 and b-catenin along the invasive front of primary colon carcinomas, are predicted to represent the origin of these (de)differentiation routes through biologically-distinct cellular states, and to underlie the phenotypic plasticity of colon cancer cells.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: No relationship between frontal alpha asymmetry and depressive disorders in a multiverse analysis of five studies</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60595</link>
	<content:encoded>For decades, the frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) – a disproportion in EEG alpha oscillations power between right and left frontal channels – has been one of the most popular measures of depressive disorders (DD) in electrophysiology studies. Patients with DD often manifest a left-sided FAA: relatively higher alpha power in the left versus right frontal lobe. Recently, however, multiple studies failed to confirm this effect, questioning its reproducibility. Our purpose is to thoroughly test the validity of FAA in depression by conducting a multiverse analysis – running many related analyses and testing the sensitivity of the effect to changes in the analytical approach – on data from five independent studies. Only 13 of the 270 analyses revealed significant results. We conclude the paper by discussing theoretical assumptions underlying the FAA and suggest a list of guidelines for improving and expanding the EEG data analysis in future FAA studies.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: The pattern of Nodal morphogen signaling is shaped by co-receptor expression</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54894</link>
	<content:encoded>Embryos must communicate instructions to their constituent cells over long distances. These instructions are often encoded in the concentration of signals called morphogens. In the textbook view, morphogen molecules diffuse from a localized source to form a concentration gradient, and target cells adopt fates by measuring the local morphogen concentration. However, natural patterning systems often incorporate numerous co-factors and extensive signaling feedback, suggesting that embryos require additional mechanisms to generate signaling patterns. Here, we examine the mechanisms of signaling pattern formation for the mesendoderm inducer Nodal during zebrafish embryogenesis. We find that Nodal signaling activity spans a normal range in the absence of signaling feedback and relay, suggesting that diffusion is sufficient for Nodal gradient formation. We further show that the range of endogenous Nodal ligands is set by the EGF-CFC co-receptor Oep: in the absence of Oep, Nodal activity spreads to form a nearly uniform distribution throughout the embryo. In turn, increasing Oep levels sensitizes cells to Nodal ligands. We recapitulate these experimental results with a computational model in which Oep regulates the diffusive spread of Nodal ligands by setting the rate of capture by target cells. This model predicts, and we confirm &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, the surprising observation that a failure to replenish Oep transforms the Nodal signaling gradient into a travelling wave. These results reveal that patterns of Nodal morphogen signaling are shaped by co-receptor-mediated restriction of ligand spread and sensitization of responding cells.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.26.445765v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Increasing life expectancy is prompting the need to understand how the brain changes during healthy aging. Research utilizing Electroencephalography (EEG) has found that the power of alpha oscillations decrease from adulthood on. However, non-oscillatory (aperiodic) components in the data may confound results and thus require re-investigation of these findings. The present report aims at analyzing a pilot and two additional independent samples (total N = 533) of resting-state EEG from healthy young and elderly individuals. A newly developed algorithm will be utilized that allows the decomposition of the measured signal into aperiodic and aperiodic-adjusted signal components. By using multivariate sequential Bayesian updating of the age effect in each signal component, evidence across the datasets will be accumulated. It is hypothesized that previously reported age-related alpha power differences will disappear when absolute power is adjusted for the aperiodic signal component. Consequently, age-related differences in the intercept and slope of the aperiodic signal component are expected. Importantly, using a battery of neuropsychological tests, we will assess how the previously reported relationship between cognitive functions and alpha oscillations changes when taking the aperiodic signal into account; this will be done on data of the young and aged individuals separately. The aperiodic signal components and adjusted alpha parameters could potentially offer a promising biomarker for cognitive decline, thus finally the test-retest reliability of the aperiodic and aperiodic-adjusted signal components will be assessed.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Humans often act in the best interests of others. However, how we learn which actions result in good outcomes for other people and the neurochemical systems that support this &quot;prosocial learning&quot; remain poorly understood. Using computational models of reinforcement learning, functional magnetic resonance imaging and dynamic causal modelling, we examined how different doses of intranasal oxytocin, a neuropeptide linked to social cognition, impact how people learn to benefit others (prosocial learning) and whether this influence could be dissociated from how we learn to benefit ourselves (self-oriented learning). We show that a low dose of oxytocin prevented decreases in prosocial performance over time, despite no impact on self-oriented learning. Critically, oxytocin produced dose-dependent changes in the encoding of prediction errors (PE) in the midbrain-subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) pathway specifically during prosocial learning. Our findings reveal a new role of oxytocin in prosocial learning by modulating computations of PEs in the midbrain-sgACC pathway.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: APOE4 genotype increases neuronal calcium signals and decreases pial arteriole responsivity and vasomotion in visual cortex of awake mice</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.26.445731v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Vascular dysfunction is an early feature of late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), preceding classic AD pathology such as beta amyloid accumulation and formation of hyperphosphorylated tau. Such vascular dysfunction may promote classic AD pathology by decreasing blood flow, impairing brain oxygenation and clearance of molecules such as beta amyloid. The main genetic risk factor for AD is the {epsilon}4 allele of APOE, which has been found to increase blood brain barrier permeability and decrease vascular density, as well as decrease blood flow and functional hyperaemia in anaesthetised mice undergoing acute surgery. These results suggest that APOE4 may confer AD risk via its effects on the vasculature. However, the responses of neurons and individual vessels have not been studied, so neurovascular relationships are unknown, and no previous studies have looked at awake mice. We therefore measured neurovascular responses at rest and in response to visual stimulation using 2 photon imaging of awake APOE3 and APOE4 targeted-replacement (APOE TR) mice that expressed the calcium indicator GCaMP6f in excitatory neurons, while labelling the vascular lumen with Texas Red dextran. In parallel, we measured cerebral blood flow, blood oxygenation and cerebral blood volume using combined laser Doppler flowmetry and haemoglobin spectrometry. Measurements were performed in mice aged between 3-4 months to 12-13 months. We found a milder vascular deficit in awake mice than previous studies that used an acute surgical preparation: capillary responses to visual stimulation were the same in APOE3 and APOE4 TR mice, leading to unimpaired functional hyperaemia. However, neuronal calcium signals during visual stimulation were significantly enhanced in APOE4 mice, while there was a marked decrease in pial arteriole responsiveness and vasomotion. This pattern of results was unaffected by age, suggesting that APOE4 expression creates a stable, but mildly altered neurovascular state that does not itself cause degeneration. However, these changes likely make the system more sensitive to subsequent insults; for example, weaker vasomotion could impair clearance of beta amyloid as it starts to accumulate, and therefore may help explain how APOE4 expression increases risk of developing AD.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.26.445730v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>As routine and lower demand cognitive tasks are taken over by automated assistive systems, human operators are increasingly required to sustain cognitive demand over long periods of time. This has been reported to have long term adverse effects on cardiovascular and mental health. However, it remains unclear whether prolonged cognitive activity results in a monotonic decrease in the efficiency of the recruited brain processes, or whether the brain is able to sustain functions over time spans of one hour and more. Here, we show that during working sessions of one hour or more, contrary to the prediction of a monotonic decline, behavioral performance in both humans and non-human primates consistently fluctuates between periods of optimal and suboptimal performance at a very slow rhythm of circa 5 cycles per hour. These fluctuations are observed in both high attentional (in non-human primates) and low attentional (in humans) demand conditions. They coincide with fluctuations in pupil diameter, indicating underlying changes in arousal and information-processing load. Accordingly, we show that these rhythmic behavioral fluctuations correlate, at the neurophysiological level, with fluctuations in the informational attention orientation and perception processing capacity of prefrontal neuronal populations. We further identify specific markers of these fluctuations in LFP power, LFP coherence and spike-field coherence, pointing towards long-range rhythmic modulatory inputs to the prefrontal cortex rather than a local prefrontal origin. These results shed light on the resilience of brain mechanisms to sustained effort and have direct implications on how to optimize high cognitive demand working and learning environments.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Quadratic and adaptive computations yield an efficient representation of song in Drosophila auditory receptor neurons</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.26.445391v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Sensory neurons encode information using multiple nonlinear and dynamical transformations. For instance, auditory receptor neurons in Drosophila adapt to the mean and the intensity of the stimulus, change their frequency tuning with sound intensity, and employ a quadratic nonlinearity. While these computations are considered advantageous in isolation, their combination can lead to a highly ambiguous and complex code that is hard to decode. Combining electrophysiological recordings and computational modelling, we investigate how the different computations found in auditory receptor neurons in Drosophila combine to encode behaviorally-relevant acoustic signals like the courtship song. The computational model consists of a quadratic filter followed by a divisive normalization stage and reproduces population neural responses to artificial and natural sounds. For general classes of sounds, like band-limited noise, the representation resulting from these highly nonlinear computations is highly ambiguous and does not allow for a recovery of information about the frequency content and amplitude pattern. However, for courtship song, the code is simple and efficient: The quadratic filter improves the representation of the song envelope while preserving information about the song's fine structure across intensities. Divisive normalization renders the presentation of the song envelope robust to the relatively slow fluctuations in intensity that arise during social interactions, while preserving information about the species-specific fast fluctuations of the envelope. Overall, we demonstrate how a sensory system can benefit from adaptive and nonlinear computations while minimizing concomitant costs arising from ambiguity and complexity of readouts by adapting the code for behaviorally-relevant signals.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Neural coding of visual objects rapidly reconfigures to reflect sub-trial shifts in attentional focus</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.25.445712v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Every day, we respond to the dynamic world around us by flexibly choosing actions to meet our goals. This constant problem solving, in familiar settings and in novel tasks, is a defining feature of human behaviour. Flexible neural populations are thought to support this process by adapting to prioritise task-relevant information, driving coding in specialised brain regions toward stimuli and actions that are important for our goal. Accordingly, human fMRI shows that activity patterns in frontoparietal cortex contain more information about visual features when they are task-relevant. However, if this preferential coding drives momentary focus, for example to solve each part of a task, it must reconfigure more quickly than we can observe with fMRI. Here we used MVPA with MEG to test for rapid reconfiguration of stimulus information when a new feature becomes relevant within a trial. Participants saw two displays on each trial. They attended to the shape of a first target then the colour of a second, or vice versa, and reported the attended features at a choice display. We found evidence of preferential coding for the relevant features in both trial phases, even as participants shifted attention mid-trial, commensurate with fast sub-trial reconfiguration. However, we only found this pattern of results when the task was difficult, and the stimulus displays contained multiple objects, and not in a simpler task with the same structure. The data suggest that adaptive coding in humans can operate on a fast, sub-trial timescale, suitable for supporting periods of momentary focus when complex tasks are broken down into simpler ones, but may not always do so.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.25.445701v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The human brain is extremely flexible and capable of rapidly selecting relevant information in accordance with task goals. Regions of frontoparietal cortex flexibly represent relevant task information such as task rules and stimulus features when participants perform tasks successfully, but less is known about how information processing breaks down when participants make mistakes. This is important for understanding whether and when information coding recorded with neuroimaging is directly meaningful for behaviour. Here, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to assess the temporal dynamics of information processing, and linked neural responses with goal-directed behaviour by analysing how they changed on behavioural error. Participants performed a difficult stimulus-response task using two stimulus-response mapping rules. We used time-resolved multivariate pattern analysis to characterise the progression of information coding from perceptual information about the stimulus, cue and rule coding, and finally, motor response. Response-aligned analyses revealed a ramping up of perceptual information prior to a correct response, suggestive of internal evidence accumulation. Strikingly, when participants made a stimulus-related error, and not when they made other types of errors, patterns of activity initially reflected the stimulus presented, but later reversed, and accumulated towards a representation of the incorrect stimulus. This suggests that the patterns recorded at later timepoints reflect an internally generated stimulus representation that was used to make the (incorrect) decision. These results illustrate the orderly and overlapping temporal dynamics of information coding in perceptual decision-making and show a clear link between neural patterns in the late stages of processing and behaviour.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Prior work has shown that there is substantial interindividual variation in the spatial distribution of functional networks across the cerebral cortex, or functional topography. However, it remains unknown whether there are sex differences in the topography of individualized networks in youth. Here we leveraged an advanced machine learning method (sparsity-regularized non-negative matrix factorization) to define individualized functional networks in 693 youth (ages 8-23 years) who underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. Multivariate pattern analysis using support vector machines classified participant sex based on functional topography with 83% accuracy (p&amp;lt;0.0001). Brain regions most effective in classifying participant sex belonged to association networks, including the ventral attention and default mode networks. Mass-univariate analyses using generalized additive models with penalized splines provided convergent results. Comparative analysis using transcriptomic data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas revealed that sex differences in multivariate patterns of functional topography correlated with the expression of genes on the X-chromosome. These results identify normative developmental sex differences in the functional topography of association networks and highlight the role of sex as a biological variable in shaping brain development in youth.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Global disruption in excitation-inhibition balance can cause localized network dysfunction and Schizophrenia-like context-integration deficits</title>

Poor context integration, the process of incorporating both previous and current information in decision making, is a cognitive symptom of schizophrenia. The maintenance of the contextual information has been shown to be sensitive to changes in excitation-inhibition (EI) balance. Many regions of the brain are sensitive to EI imbalances, however, so it is unknown how systemic manipulations affect the specific regions that are important to context integration. We constructed a multi-structure, biophysically-realistic agent that could perform context-integration as is assessed by the dot pattern expectancy task. The agent included a perceptual network, a memory network, and a decision making system and was capable of successfully performing the dot pattern expectancy task. Systemic manipulation of the agent’s EI balance produced localized dysfunction of the memory structure, which resulted in schizophrenia-like deficits at context integration. When the agent’s pyramidal cells were less excitatory, the agent fixated upon the cue and initiated responding later than the default agent, which were like the deficits one would predict that individuals on the autistic spectrum would make. This modelling suggests that it may be possible to parse between different types of context integration deficits by adding distractors to context integration tasks and by closely examining a participant’s reaction times.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/f5D4eROQn-I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

We here conducted an image-based chemical screen to evaluate how medically approved drugs, as well as drugs that are currently under development, influence overall translation levels. None of the compounds up-regulated translation, which could be due to the screen being performed in cancer cells grown in full media where translation is already present at very high levels. Regarding translation down-regulators, and consistent with current knowledge, inhibitors of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway were the most represented class. In addition, we identified that inhibitors of sphingosine kinases (SPHKs) also reduce mRNA translation levels independently of mTOR. Mechanistically, this is explained by an effect of the compounds on the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which activates the integrated stress response (ISR) and contributes to the toxicity of SPHK inhibitors. Surprisingly, the toxicity and activation of the ISR triggered by 2 independent SPHK inhibitors, SKI-II and ABC294640, the latter in clinical trials, are also observed in cells lacking SPHK1 and SPHK2. In summary, our study provides a useful resource on the effects of medically used drugs on translation, identified compounds capable of reducing translation independently of mTOR and has revealed that the cytotoxic properties of SPHK inhibitors being developed as anticancer agents are independent of SPHKs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/8oWNzB01x50&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
The thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) is a critical structure influencing information transfer to the forebrain. In crocodilians, the TRN shares many features with its mammalian counterpart. One area that has not been explored is how individual neurons in the crocodilian TRN compare with those found in mammals. In mammals, TRN neurons are aligned parallel to the external border of the dorsal thalamus, have their dendrites oriented perpendicular to the fibers in the internal capsule, have fine, filamentous dendritic appendages, are either bipolar or multipolar, and are commonly considered to be a homogeneous morphological population of cells. To investigate the cellular morphology of the TRN complex, a Golgi analysis was undertaken in Alligator mississippiensis. This study examined features that have been used in mammals. In Alligator, the 4 TRN divisions are the dorsal peduncular nucleus, the perireticular nucleus, the interstitial nucleus, and the neurons in the medial forebrain bundle associated with the interstitial nucleus. In crocodilians, the dorsal peduncular nucleus is homologous to the TRN of mammals. From the 1787 drawn neuron profiles in the traditional 3 planes of section, the following were concluded. First, neurons in each part of the TRN complex in Alligator were similar in morphology. Second, each part of the TRN complex of Alligator contained a heterogenous population of cells. These variations between the cellular morphology of the dorsal peduncular nucleus of crocodilians and the TRN of mammals are speculated to partly result from differences in forebrain organization.

	<content:encoded>Abstract
Extensive alterations in gene regulatory networks are a typical characteristic of Huntington's disease (HD); these include alterations in protein‐coding genes and poorly understood non‐coding RNAs (ncRNAs), which are associated with pathology caused by mutant huntingtin. Long non‐coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are an important class of ncRNAs involved in a variety of biological functions, including transcriptional regulation and post‐transcriptional modification of many targets, and likely contributed to the pathogenesis of HD. While a number of changes in lncRNAs expression have been observed in HD, little is currently known about their functions. Here, we discuss their possible mechanisms and molecular functions, with a particular focus on their roles in transcriptional regulation. These findings give us a better insight into HD pathogenesis and may provide new targets for the treatment of this neurodegenerative disease.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11233</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep learning, a multi-layered neural network approach inspired by the brain,
has revolutionized machine learning. One of its key enablers has been
backpropagation, an algorithm that computes the gradient of a loss function
with respect to the weights in the neural network model, in combination with
its use in gradient descent. However, the implementation of deep learning in
digital computers is intrinsically wasteful, with energy consumption becoming
prohibitively high for many applications. This has stimulated the development
of specialized hardware, ranging from neuromorphic CMOS integrated circuits and
integrated photonic tensor cores to unconventional, material-based computing
systems. The learning process in these material systems, taking place, e.g., by
artificial evolution or surrogate neural network modelling, is still a
complicated and time-consuming process. Here, we demonstrate an efficient and
accurate homodyne gradient extraction method for performing gradient descent on
the loss function directly in the material system. We demonstrate the method in
our recently developed dopant network processing units, where we readily
realize all Boolean gates. This shows that gradient descent can in principle be
fully implemented in materio using simple electronics, opening up the way to
autonomously learning material systems.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11203</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Free Energy Principle (FEP) states that any dynamical system can be
interpreted as performing Bayesian inference upon its surrounding environment.
Although the FEP applies in theory to a wide variety of systems, there has been
almost no direct exploration of the principle in concrete systems. In this
paper, we examine in depth the assumptions required to derive the FEP in the
simplest possible set of systems - weakly-coupled non-equilibrium linear
stochastic systems. Specifically, we explore (i) how general are the
requirements imposed on the statistical structure of a system and (ii) how
informative the FEP is about the behaviour of such systems. We find that this
structure, known as a Markov blanket (i.e. a boundary precluding direct
coupling between internal and external states) and stringent restrictions on
its solenoidal flows, both required by the FEP, make it challenging to find
systems that fulfil the required assumptions. Suitable systems require an
absence of asymmetries in sensorimotor interactions that are highly unusual for
living systems. Moreover, we find that a core step in the argument relating the
behaviour of a system to variational inference relies on an implicit
equivalence between the dynamics of the average states with the average of the
dynamics. This equivalence does not hold in general even for linear systems as
it requires an effective decoupling from the system's history of interactions.
These observations are critical for evaluating the generality and applicability
of the FEP and point to potential issues in its current form. These issues make
the FEP, as it stands, not straightforwardly applicable to the simple linear
systems studied here and suggests more development is needed before it could be
applied to the kind of complex systems which describe living and cognitive
processes.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Fast Federated Learning by Balancing Communication Trade-Offs. (arXiv:2105.11028v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11028</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Federated Learning (FL) has recently received a lot of attention for
large-scale privacy-preserving machine learning. However, high communication
overheads due to frequent gradient transmissions decelerate FL. To mitigate the
communication overheads, two main techniques have been studied: (i) local
update of weights characterizing the trade-off between communication and
computation and (ii) gradient compression characterizing the trade-off between
communication and precision. To the best of our knowledge, studying and
balancing those two trade-offs jointly and dynamically while considering their
impacts on convergence has remained unresolved even though it promises
significantly faster FL. In this paper, we first formulate our problem to
minimize learning error with respect to two variables: local update
coefficients and sparsity budgets of gradient compression who characterize
trade-offs between communication and computation/precision, respectively. We
then derive an upper bound of the learning error in a given wall-clock time
considering the interdependency between the two variables. Based on this
theoretical analysis, we propose an enhanced FL scheme, namely Fast FL (FFL),
that jointly and dynamically adjusts the two variables to minimize the learning
error. We demonstrate that FFL consistently achieves higher accuracies faster
than similar schemes existing in the literature.

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: GPR68 Contributes to Persistent Acidosis-Induced Activation of AGC Kinases and Tyrosine Phosphorylation in Organotypic Hippocampal Slices</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.692217</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Persistent acidosis occurs in ischemia and multiple neurological diseases. In previous studies, acidic stimulation leads to rapid increase in intracellular calcium in neurons. However, it remains largely unclear how a prolonged acidosis alters neuronal signaling. In our previous study, we found that GPR68-mediated PKC activities are protective against acidosis-induced injury in cortical slices. Here, we first asked whether the same principle holds true in organotypic hippocampal slices. Our data showed that 1-h pH 6 induced PKC phosphorylation in a GPR68-dependent manner. Go6983, a PKC inhibitor worsened acidosis-induced neuronal injury in wild type (WT) but had no effect in GPR68&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; slices. Next, to gain greater insights into acid signaling in brain tissue, we treated organotypic hippocampal slices with pH 6 for 1-h and performed a kinome profiling analysis by Western blot. Acidosis had little effect on cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) or casein kinase 2 activity, two members of the CMGC family, or Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)/ATM and RAD3-related (ATR) activity, but reduced the phosphorylation of MAPK/CDK substrates. In contrast, acidosis induced the activation of CaMKIIα, PKA, and Akt. Besides these serine/threonine kinases, acidosis also induced tyrosine phosphorylation. Since GPR68 is widely expressed in brain neurons, we asked whether GPR68 contributes to acidosis-induced signaling. Deleting GPR68 had no effect on acidosis-induced CaMKII phosphorylation, attenuated that of phospho-Akt and phospho-PKA substrates, while abolishing acidosis-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. These data demonstrate that prolonged acidosis activates a network of signaling cascades, mediated by AGC kinases, CaMKII, and tyrosine kinases. GPR68 is the primary mediator for acidosis-induced activation of PKC and tyrosine phosphorylation, while both GPR68-dependent and -independent mechanisms contribute to the activation of PKA and Akt.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.662005</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep learning based medical image segmentation has shown great potential in becoming a key part of the clinical analysis pipeline. However, many of these models rely on the assumption that the train and test data come from the same distribution. This means that such methods cannot guarantee high quality predictions when the source and target domains are dissimilar due to different acquisition protocols, or biases in patient cohorts. Recently, unsupervised domain adaptation techniques have shown great potential in alleviating this problem by minimizing the shift between the source and target distributions, without requiring the use of labeled data in the target domain. In this work, we aim to predict tissue segmentation maps on T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data of an unseen preterm-born neonatal population, which has both different acquisition parameters and population bias when compared to our training data. We achieve this by investigating two unsupervised domain adaptation techniques with the objective of finding the best solution for our problem. We compare the two methods with a baseline fully-supervised segmentation network and report our results in terms of Dice scores obtained on our source test dataset. Moreover, we analyse tissue volumes and cortical thickness measures of the harmonized data on a subset of the population matched for gestational age at birth and postmenstrual age at scan. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of the harmonized cortical gray matter maps with an analysis comparing term and preterm-born neonates and a proof-of-principle investigation of the association between cortical thickness and a language outcome measure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.658202</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune, demyelinating, and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system. In recent years, it has been proven that the kynurenine system plays a significant role in the development of several nervous system disorders, including multiple sclerosis. Kynurenine pathway metabolites have both neurotoxic and neuroprotective effects. Moreover, the enzymes of the kynurenine pathway play an important role in immunomodulation processes, among others, as well as interacting with neuronal energy balance and various redox reactions. Dysregulation of many of the enzymatic steps in kynurenine pathway and upregulated levels of these metabolites locally in the central nervous system, contribute to the progression of multiple sclerosis pathology. This process can initiate a pathogenic cascade, including microglia activation, glutamate excitotoxicity, chronic oxidative stress or accumulated mitochondrial damage in the axons, that finally disrupt the homeostasis of neurons, leads to destabilization of neuronal cell cytoskeleton, contributes to neuro-axonal damage and neurodegeneration. Neurofilaments are good biomarkers of the neuro-axonal damage and their level reliably indicates the severity of multiple sclerosis and the treatment response. There is increasing evidence that connections exist between the molecules generated in the kynurenine metabolic pathway and the change in neurofilament concentrations. Thus the alterations in the kynurenine pathway may be an important biomarker of the course of multiple sclerosis. In our present review, we report the possible relationship and connection between neurofilaments and the kynurenine system in multiple sclerosis based on the available evidences.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Insight Into Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 31 (SCA31) From Drosophila Model</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.648133</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spinocerebellar ataxia type 31 (SCA31) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by degeneration of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. Its genetic cause is a 2.5- to 3.8-kb-long complex pentanucleotide repeat insertion containing (TGGAA)n, (TAGAA)n, (TAAAA)n, and (TAAAATAGAA)n located in an intron shared by two different genes: brain expressed associated with NEDD4-1 (BEAN1) and thymidine kinase 2 (TK2). Among these repeat sequences, (TGGAA)n repeat was the only sequence segregating with SCA31, which strongly suggests its pathogenicity. In SCA31 patient brains, the mutant BEAN1 transcript containing expanded UGGAA repeats (UGGAA&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt;) was found to form abnormal RNA structures called RNA foci in cerebellar Purkinje cell nuclei. In addition, the deposition of pentapeptide repeat (PPR) proteins, poly(Trp-Asn-Gly-Met-Glu), translated from UGGAA&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; RNA, was detected in the cytoplasm of Purkinje cells. To uncover the pathogenesis of UGGAA&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; in SCA31, we generated Drosophila models of SCA31 expressing UGGAA&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; RNA. The toxicity of UGGAA&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; depended on its length and expression level, which was accompanied by the accumulation of RNA foci and translation of repeat-associated PPR proteins in Drosophila, consistent with the observation in SCA31 patient brains. We also revealed that TDP-43, FUS, and hnRNPA2B1, motor neuron disease–linked RNA-binding proteins bound to UGGAA&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; RNA, act as RNA chaperones to regulate the formation of RNA foci and repeat-associated translation. Further research on the role of RNA-binding proteins as RNA chaperones may also provide a novel therapeutic strategy for other microsatellite repeat expansion diseases besides SCA31.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Differential Effects of the Six Human TAU Isoforms: Somatic Retention of 2N-TAU and Increased Microtubule Number Induced by 4R-TAU</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.643115</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the adult human brain, six isoforms of the microtubule-associated protein TAU are expressed, which result from alternative splicing of exons 2, 3, and 10 of the MAPT gene. These isoforms differ in the number of N-terminal inserts (0N, 1N, 2N) and C-terminal repeat domains (3R or 4R) and are differentially expressed depending on the brain region and developmental stage. Although all TAU isoforms can aggregate and form neurofibrillary tangles, some tauopathies, such as Pick’s disease and progressive supranuclear palsy, are characterized by the accumulation of specific TAU isoforms. The influence of the individual TAU isoforms in a cellular context, however, is understudied. In this report, we investigated the subcellular localization of the human-specific TAU isoforms in primary mouse neurons and analyzed TAU isoform-specific effects on cell area and microtubule dynamics in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Our results show that 2N-TAU isoforms are particularly retained from axonal sorting and that axonal enrichment is independent of the number of repeat domains, but that the additional repeat domain of 4R-TAU isoforms results in a general reduction of cell size and an increase of microtubule counts in cells expressing these specific isoforms. Our study points out that individual TAU isoforms may influence microtubule dynamics differentially both by different sorting patterns and by direct effects on microtubule dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Blocking Cross-Species Secondary Binding When Performing Double Immunostaining With Mouse and Rat Primary Antibodies</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.579859</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Immunostaining is a powerful technique and widely used to identify molecules in tissues and cells, although critical steps are necessary to block cross-reaction. Here we focused on an overlooked cross immunoreactivity issue where a secondary antibody (secondary) cross-reacts with a primary antibody (primary) from a different species. We first confirmed the previously reported cross-species binding of goat anti-mouse secondary to rat primary. This was accomplished by staining with a rat primary against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and visualizing with goat (or donkey) anti-mouse secondary. We then further revealed the converse cross-species binding by staining with a mouse primary against neuronal nuclear protein (NeuN) and visualizing with anti-rat secondaries. We speculate that mouse and rat primaries share antigenicity, enabling either secondary to recognize either primary. To block this cross-species binding in double staining experiments, we compared three protocols using mouse anti-NeuN and rat anti-GFAP, two primaries whose antigens have non-overlapping distributions in brain tissues. Simultaneous staining resulted in cross-species astrocytic staining (anti-mouse secondary to rat anti-GFAP primary) but no cross-species neuronal staining (anti-rat secondary to mouse anti-NeuN primary). Cross-species astrocytic staining was missing after sequential same-species staining with mouse anti-NeuN primary, followed by rat anti-GFAP. However, cross-species astrocytic staining could not be diminished after sequential same-species staining with rat anti-GFAP primary, followed by mouse anti-NeuN. We thus hypothesize that a competition exists between anti-mouse and anti-rat secondaries in their binding to both primaries. Single staining for NeuN or GFAP visualized with dual secondaries at different dilution ratio supported this hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Children ASD Evaluation Through Joint Analysis of EEG and Eye-Tracking Recordings With Graph Convolution Network</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.651349</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent advances in neuroscience indicate that analysis of bio-signals such as rest state electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye-tracking data can provide more reliable evaluation of children autism spectrum disorder (ASD) than traditional methods of behavior measurement relying on scales do. However, the effectiveness of the new approaches still lags behind the increasing requirement in clinical or educational practices as the “bio-marker” information carried by the bio-signal of a single-modality is likely insufficient or distorted. This study proposes an approach to joint analysis of EEG and eye-tracking for children ASD evaluation. The approach focuses on deep fusion of the features in two modalities as no explicit correlations between the original bio-signals are available, which also limits the performance of existing methods along this direction. First, the synchronization measures, information entropy, and time-frequency features of the multi-channel EEG are derived. Then a random forest applies to the eye-tracking recordings of the same subjects to single out the most significant features. A graph convolutional network (GCN) model then naturally fuses the two group of features to differentiate the children with ASD from the typically developed (TD) subjects. Experiments have been carried out on the two types of the bio-signals collected from 42 children (21 ASD and 21 TD subjects, 3–6 years old). The results indicate that (1) the proposed approach can achieve an accuracy of 95% in ASD detection, and (2) strong correlations exist between the two bio-signals collected even asynchronously, in particular the EEG synchronization against the face related/joint attentions in terms of covariance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Brain Networks Underlying Strategy Execution and Feedback Processing in an Efficient Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Neurofeedback Training Performed in a Parallel or a Serial Paradigm</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.645048</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurofeedback (NF) is a complex learning scenario, as the task consists of trying out mental strategies while processing a feedback signal that signifies activation in the brain area to be self-regulated and acts as a potential reward signal. In an attempt to dissect these subcomponents, we obtained whole-brain networks associated with efficient self-regulation in two paradigms: parallel, where the task was performed concurrently, combining feedback with strategy execution; and serial, where the task was performed consecutively, separating feedback processing from strategy execution. Twenty participants attempted to control their anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) NF in 18 sessions over 2 weeks, using cognitive and emotional mental strategies. We analyzed whole-brain fMRI activations in the NF training runs with the largest aMCC activation for the serial and parallel paradigms. The equal length of the strategy execution and the feedback processing periods in the serial paradigm allows a description of the two task subcomponents with equal power. The resulting activation maps were spatially correlated with functionally annotated intrinsic connectivity brain maps (BMs). Brain activation in the parallel condition correlates with the basal ganglia (BG) network, the cingulo-opercular network (CON), and the frontoparietal control network (FPCN); brain activation in the serial strategy execution condition with the default mode network (DMN), the FPCN, and the visual processing network; while brain activation in the serial feedback processing condition predominantly with the CON, the DMN, and the FPCN. Additional comparisons indicate that BG activation is characteristic to the parallel paradigm, while supramarginal gyrus (SMG) and superior temporal gyrus (STG) activations are characteristic to the serial paradigm. The multifaceted view of the subcomponents allows describing the cognitive processes associated with strategy execution and feedback processing independently in the serial feedback task and as combined processes in the multitasking scenario of the conventional parallel feedback task.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Cortical and Subcortical Circuits for Cross-Modal Plasticity Induced by Loss of Vision</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.665009</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cortical areas are highly interconnected both via cortical and subcortical pathways, and primary sensory cortices are not isolated from this general structure. In primary sensory cortical areas, these pre-existing functional connections serve to provide contextual information for sensory processing and can mediate adaptation when a sensory modality is lost. Cross-modal plasticity in broad terms refers to widespread plasticity across the brain in response to losing a sensory modality, and largely involves two distinct changes: cross-modal recruitment and compensatory plasticity. The former involves recruitment of the deprived sensory area, which includes the deprived primary sensory cortex, for processing the remaining senses. Compensatory plasticity refers to plasticity in the remaining sensory areas, including the spared primary sensory cortices, to enhance the processing of its own sensory inputs. Here, we will summarize potential cellular plasticity mechanisms involved in cross-modal recruitment and compensatory plasticity, and review cortical and subcortical circuits to the primary sensory cortices which can mediate cross-modal plasticity upon loss of vision.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Improving NKCC1 Function Increases the Excitability of DRG Neurons Exacerbating Pain Induced After TRPV1 Activation of Primary Sensory Neurons</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.665596</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background Our aim was to investigate the effects of the protein expression and the function of sodium, potassium, and chloride co-transporter (NKCC1) in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) after activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 receptor (TRPV1) in capsaicin-induced acute inflammatory pain and the possible mechanism of action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods Male Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly divided into control, capsaicin, and inhibitor groups. The expression and distribution of TRPV1 and NKCC1 in rat DRG were observed by immunofluorescence. Thermal radiation and acetone test were used to detect the pain threshold of heat and cold noxious stimulation in each group. The expressions of NKCC1 mRNA, NKCC1 protein, and p-NKCC1 in the DRG were detected by PCR and western blotting (WB). Patch clamp and chloride fluorescent probe were used to observe the changes of GABA activation current and intracellular chloride concentration. After intrathecal injection of protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor (GF109203X) or MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor (U0126), the behavioral changes and the expression of NKCC1 and p-ERK protein in L&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;–&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; DRG were observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Result: TRPV1 and NKCC1 were co-expressed in the DRG. Compared with the control group, the immunofluorescence intensity of NKCC1 and p-NKCC1 in the capsaicin group was significantly higher, and the expression of NKCC1 in the nuclear membrane was significantly higher than that in the control group. The expression of NKCC1 mRNA and protein of NKCC1 and p-NKCC1 in the capsaicin group were higher than those in the control group. After capsaicin injection, GF109203X inhibited the protein expression of NKCC1 and p-ERK, while U0126 inhibited the protein expression of NKCC1. In the capsaicin group, paw withdrawal thermal latency (WTL) was decreased, while cold withdrawal latency (CWL) was prolonged. Bumetanide, GF109203X, or U0126 could reverse the effect. GABA activation current significantly increased in the DRG cells of the capsaicin group, which could be reversed by bumetanide. The concentration of chloride in the DRG cells of the capsaicin group increased, but decreased after bumetanide, GF109203X, and U0126 were administered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion Activation of TRPV1 by exogenous agonists can increase the expression and function of NKCC1 protein in DRG, which is mediated by activation of PKC/p-ERK signaling pathway. These results suggest that DRG NKCC1 may participate in the inflammatory pain induced by TRPV1.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: MiR-30c-5p/ATG5 Axis Regulates the Progression of Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.644507</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Serum miR-30c-5p correlates with Parkinson’s disease (PD), yet its role has not been illustrated. This research analyzed the function of miR-30c-5p in PD. The behavioral evaluation was performed on MPTP-treated PD mice transfected with miR-30c-5p agomiR, antagomiR, siATG5, or 3-MA (an autophagy inhibitor). Oxidative stress-related factors, miR-30c-5p, and apoptosis- and autophagy-associated proteins in brain tissues or cells were determined by molecular experiments. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine metabolic markers were detected using immunofluorescence and Diode Array Detector (DAD), respectively. Effects of miR-30c-5p and its target gene Autophagy-related gene (ATG) 5 protein (ATG5) on MPP+-treated SH-SY5Y cells were determined through a series of molecular experiments. MiR-30c-5p was upregulated but ATG5 was downregulated in PD mice. MiR-30c-5p antagomiR attenuated the decrease of ATG5 in PD mice. MiR-30c-5p antagomiR partly alleviated the behavioral symptoms and inhibited the increases of malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT), and SOD in PD mice. The levels of Bcl-2, dopamine, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA), TH, and LC3 II were downregulated in PD mice, while Bax, cleaved caspase-3, P62, and LC3 I were upregulated. However, miR-30c-5p antagomiR partly reversed the levels of these factors in PD mice. 3-MA could block the effects of miR-30c-5p antagomiR on PD mice. MiR-30c-5p antagomiR attenuated apoptosis and induced autophagy in brain tissues of MPTP-treated mice by targeting ATG5. In vitro assay results also showed that silence of ATG5 reduced the protective effect of miR-30c-5p downregulation on the cells. MiR-30c-5p regulates the progression of Parkinson’s disease through attenuating ATG5-inhibited apoptosis and -induced autophagy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Overexpressed NaV1.7 Channels Confer Hyperexcitability to in vitro Trigeminal Sensory Neurons of CaV2.1 Mutant Hemiplegic Migraine Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.640709</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Trigeminal sensory neurons of transgenic knock-in (KI) mice expressing the R192Q missense mutation in the α1A subunit of neuronal voltage-gated Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels, which leads to familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 (FHM1) in patients, exhibit a hyperexcitability phenotype. Here, we show that the expression of Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 channels, linked to pain states, is upregulated in KI primary cultures of trigeminal ganglia (TG), as shown by increased expression of its α1 subunit. In the majority of TG neurons, Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 channels are co-expressed with ATP-gated P2X3 receptors (P2X3R), which are important nociceptive sensors. Reversing the trigeminal phenotype with selective Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 channel inhibitor ω-agatoxin IVA inhibited Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 overexpression. Functionally, KI neurons revealed a TTX-sensitive inward current of larger amplitude that was partially inhibited by selective Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 blocker Tp1a. Under current-clamp condition, Tp1a raised the spike threshold of both wild-type (WT) and KI neurons with decreased firing rate in KI cells. Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 activator OD1 accelerated firing in WT and KI neurons, a phenomenon blocked by Tp1a. Enhanced expression and function of Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 channels in KI TG neurons resulted in higher excitability and facilitated nociceptive signaling. Co-expression of Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 channels and P2X3Rs in TGs may explain how hypersensitivity to local stimuli can be relevant to migraine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Carotid Atherosclerotic Calcification Characteristics Relate to Post-stroke Cognitive Impairment</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.682908</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Together with cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD), large vessel atherosclerosis is considered to be an equally important risk factor in the progression of vascular cognitive impairment. This article aims to investigate whether carotid atherosclerotic calcification is associated with the increased risk of post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A total of 128 patients (mean age: 62.1 ± 12.2 years, 37 women) suffering from ischemic stroke underwent brain/neck computer tomography angiography examination. The presence and characteristic of carotid calcification (size, number and location) were analyzed on computer tomography angiography. White matter hyperintensity (WMH) was assessed using Fazekas scales. PSCI was diagnosed based on a battery of neuropsychological assessments implemented 6−12 months after stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Among 128 patients, 26 developed post-stroke dementia and 96 had carotid calcification. Logistic regression found carotid calcification (odds ratio [OR] = 7.15, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07–47.69) and carotid artery stenosis (OR = 6.42, 95% CI: 1.03–40.15) both significantly increased the risk for post-stroke dementia. Moreover, multiple, thick/mixed, and surface calcifications exhibited an increasing trend in PSCI (P&lt;sub&gt;trend&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.004, 0.016, 0.045, respectively). The prediction model for post-stroke dementia including carotid calcification (area under curve = 0.67), WMH (area under curve = 0.67) and other covariates yielded an area under curve (AUC) of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.82–0.99).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated that the quantity and location of carotid calcifications were independent indicators for PSCI. The significant role of large vessel atherosclerosis in PSCI should be concerned in future study.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Cornel Iridoid Glycoside Protects Against STAT1-Dependent Synapse and Memory Deficits by Increasing N-Methyl-D-aspartate Receptor Expression in a Tau Transgenic Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.671206</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;P301S transgenic mice are an animal model of tauopathy and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), exhibiting tau pathology and synaptic dysfunction. Cornel iridoid glycoside (CIG) is an active ingredient extracted from Cornus officinalis, a traditional Chinese herb. In the present study, the purpose was to investigate the effects and mechanisms of CIG on tau pathology and synaptic dysfunction using P301S transgenic mice. The results showed that intragastric administration of CIG for 3.5 months improved cognitive impairments and the survival rate of P301S mice. Electrophysiological recordings and transmission electron microscopy study showed that CIG improved synaptic plasticity and increased the ultrastructure and number of synapse. Moreover, CIG increased the expression levels of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) subunits GluN1, GluN2A, and GluN2B, and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptor (AMPAR) subunit GluA1. We inferred that the major mechanism of CIG involving in the regulation of synaptic dysfunctions was inhibiting the activation of Janus kinase-2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) signaling pathway and alleviating STAT1-induced suppression of NMDAR expressions. Based on our findings, we thought CIG might be a promising candidate for the therapy of tauopathy such as AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Odor Recognition Memory in Parkinson's Disease: A Systematic Review</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.625171</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Olfactory impairment is a central non-motor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD). Previous studies have demonstrated that olfactory dysfunction is associated with mental illness and impaired cognition. The frequently investigated olfactory functions are odor detection, discrimination, and identification. However, few studies have focused on odor recognition memory (ORM). ORM tasks involves episodic memory which therefore can facilitate the detection of dementia among patients with PD and consequently adjust their treatment. Thus, the aim of this systematic review is to summarize the existing research on ORM in PD. Databases and reference lists were used for data collection. Studies were included in the review if they met the eligibility criteria derived from the PICOS-framework. Quality evaluation of the studies was based on the STROBE-statement. Six studies with small samples were included in the analysis which demonstrated the scarce research on the subject. The studies targeting ORM were heterogenous and involved two main tasks: odor recognition and odor matching. The synthesis of the data demonstrated that PD patients performed significantly lower than controls on both tasks, especially on odor matching task. Only the odor recognition task exhibited a difference between patients with PD vs. Alzheimer's disease (AD). PD patients performed significantly better than AD patients. The findings based on the available limited data support the notion that odor recognition task can be of importance in identifying Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). To investigate this hypothesis, future research needs to include larger samples of PD, PDD and AD patients executing the same odor recognition task.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/68130</link>
	<content:encoded>Itch is an unpleasant sensation that elicits robust scratching and aversive experience. However, the identity of the cells and neural circuits that organize this information remains elusive. Here we show the necessity and sufficiency of chloroquine-activated neurons in the central amygdala (CeA) for both itch sensation and associated aversion. Further, we show that chloroquine-activated CeA neurons play important roles in itch-related comorbidities, including anxiety-like behaviors, but not in some aversive and appetitive behaviors previously ascribed to CeA neurons. RNA-sequencing of chloroquine-activated CeA neurons identified several differentially expressed genes as well as potential key signaling pathways in regulating pruritis. Finally, viral tracing experiments demonstrate that these neurons send projections to the ventral periaqueductal gray that are critical in modulation of itch. These findings reveal a cellular and circuit signature of CeA neurons orchestrating behavioral and affective responses to pruritus in mice.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: The discriminatory power of the T cell receptor</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/67092</link>
	<content:encoded>T cells use their T-cell receptors (TCRs) to discriminate between lower-affinity self and higher-affinity non-self pMHC antigens. Although the discriminatory power of the TCR is widely believed to be near-perfect, technical difficulties have hampered efforts to precisely quantify it. Here, we describe a method for measuring very low TCR/pMHC affinities, and use it to measure the discriminatory power of the TCR, and the factors affecting it. We find that TCR discrimination, although enhanced compared with conventional cell-surface receptors, is imperfect: primary human T cells can respond to pMHC with affinities as low as K&lt;sub&gt;D &lt;/sub&gt;~1 mM. The kinetic proofreading mechanism fit our data, providing the first estimates of both the time delay (2.8 s) and number of biochemical steps (2.67) that are consistent with the extraordinary sensitivity of antigen recognition. Our findings explain why self pMHC frequently induce autoimmune diseases and anti-tumour responses, and suggest ways to modify TCR discrimination.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Post-translational flavinylation is associated with diverse extracytosolic redox functionalities throughout bacterial life</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66878</link>
	<content:encoded>Disparate redox activities that take place beyond the bounds of the prokaryotic cell cytosol must connect to membrane or cytosolic electron pools. Proteins post-translationally flavinylated by the enzyme ApbE mediate electron transfer in several characterized extracytosolic redox systems but the breadth of functions of this modification remains unknown. Here we present a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of 31,910 prokaryotic genomes that provides evidence of extracytosolic ApbEs within ~50% of bacteria and the involvement of flavinylation in numerous uncharacterized biochemical processes. By mining flavinylation-associated gene clusters, we identify five protein classes responsible for transmembrane electron transfer and two domains of unknown function (DUF2271 and DUF3570) that are flavinylated by ApbE. We observe flavinylation/iron transporter gene colocalization patterns that implicate functions in iron reduction and assimilation. We find associations with characterized and uncharacterized respiratory oxidoreductases that highlight roles of flavinylation in respiratory electron transport chains. Finally, we identify interspecies gene cluster variability consistent with flavinylation/cytochrome functional redundancies and discover a class of 'multi-flavinylated proteins' that may resemble multiheme cytochromes in facilitating longer distance electron transfer. These findings provide key mechanistic insight into an important facet of bacterial physiology and establish flavinylation as a functionally diverse mediator of extracytosolic electron transfer.</content:encoded>

Leveraging a second data set we provide a first quantitative assessment of inter- versus intra-individual stereotypy. Comparing neurons across two brains (three hemispheres) reveals striking similarity in neuronal morphology across brains.

	<title>eLife: TRPM channels mediate learned pathogen avoidance following intestinal distention</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65935</link>
	<content:encoded>Upon exposure to harmful microorganisms, hosts engage in protective molecular and behavioral immune responses, both of which are ultimately regulated by the nervous system. Using the nematode &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;, we show that ingestion of &lt;i&gt;E. faecalis &lt;/i&gt;leads to a fast pathogen avoidance behavior that results in aversive learning. We have identified multiple sensory mechanisms involved in the regulation of avoidance of &lt;i&gt;E. faecalis. &lt;/i&gt;The G-protein coupled receptor NPR-1-dependent oxygen-sensing pathway opposes this avoidance behavior, while an ASE neuron-dependent pathway and an AWB and AWC neuron-dependent pathway are directly required for avoidance. Colonization of the anterior part of the intestine by &lt;i&gt;E. faecalis &lt;/i&gt;leads to AWB and AWC mediated olfactory aversive learning. Finally, two transient receptor potential melastatin (TRPM) channels, GON-2 and GTL-2, mediate this newly described rapid pathogen avoidance. These results suggest a mechanism by which TRPM channels may sense the intestinal distension caused by bacterial colonization to elicit pathogen avoidance and aversive learning by detecting changes in host physiology.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65390</link>
	<content:encoded>Morphogenesis is governed by the interplay of molecular signals and mechanical forces across multiple length scales. The last decade has seen tremendous advances in our understanding of the dynamics of protein localization and turnover at sub-cellular length scales, and at the other end of the spectrum, of mechanics at tissue-level length scales. Integrating the two remains a challenge, however, because we lack a detailed understanding of the subcellular patterns of mechanical properties of cells within tissues. Here, in the context of the elongating body axis of &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; embryos, we combine tools from cell biology and physics to demonstrate that individual cell-cell junctions display finely-patterned local mechanical heterogeneity along their length. We show that such local mechanical patterning is essential for the cell movements of convergent extension and is imparted by locally patterned clustering of a classical cadherin. Finally, the patterning of cadherins and thus local mechanics along cell-cell junctions are controlled by Planar Cell Polarity signaling, a key genetic module for CE that is mutated in diverse human birth defects.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Detecting adaptive introgression in human evolution using convolutional neural networks</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64669</link>
	<content:encoded>Studies in a variety of species have shown evidence for positively selected variants introduced into a population via introgression from another, distantly related population - a process known as adaptive introgression. However, there are few explicit frameworks for jointly modelling introgression and positive selection, in order to detect these variants using genomic sequence data. Here, we develop an approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CNNs do not require the specification of an analytical model of allele frequency dynamics, and have outperformed alternative methods for classification and parameter estimation tasks in various areas of population genetics. Thus, they are potentially well suited to the identification of adaptive introgression. Using simulations, we trained CNNs on genotype matrices derived from genomes sampled from the donor population, the recipient population and a related non-introgressed population, in order to distinguish regions of the genome evolving under adaptive introgression from those evolving neutrally or experiencing selective sweeps. Our CNN architecture exhibits 95% accuracy on simulated data, even when the genomes are unphased, and accuracy decreases only moderately in the presence of heterosis. As a proof of concept, we applied our trained CNNs to human genomic datasets - both phased and unphased - to detect candidates for adaptive introgression that shaped our evolutionary history.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63359</link>
	<content:encoded>All-optical methods for imaging and manipulating brain networks with high spatial resolution are fundamental to study how neuronal ensembles drive behavior. Stimulation of neuronal ensembles using holographic techniques requires high-sensitivity actuators to avoid photodamage and heating. Moreover, two-photon-excitable opsins should be insensitive to light at wavelengths used for imaging. To achieve this goal, we developed a novel soma-targeted variant of the large-conductance blue light-sensitive opsin CoChR (stCoChR). In the mouse cortex &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, we combined holographic two-photon stimulation of stCoChR with an amplified laser tuned at the opsin absorption peak and imaging of the red-shifted indicator jRCaMP1a. Compared to previously characterized blue light-sensitive soma-targeted opsins &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, stCoChR allowed neuronal stimulation with more than 10-fold lower average power and no spectral crosstalk. The combination of stCoChR, tuned amplified laser stimulation, and red-shifted functional indicators promises to be a powerful tool for large-scale interrogation of neural networks in the intact brain.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Starvation-induced regulation of carbohydrate transport at the blood–brain barrier is TGF-β-signaling dependent</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/62503</link>
	<content:encoded>During hunger or malnutrition, animals prioritize alimentation of the brain over other organs to ensure its function and, thus, their survival. This protection, also-called brain sparing, is described from &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; to humans. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms adapting carbohydrate transport. Here, we used &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; genetics to unravel the mechanisms operating at the blood–brain barrier (BBB) under nutrient restriction. During starvation, expression of the carbohydrate transporter Tret1-1 is increased to provide more efficient carbohydrate uptake. Two mechanisms are responsible for this increase. Similar to the regulation of mammalian GLUT4, Rab-dependent intracellular shuttling is needed for Tret1-1 integration into the plasma membrane; even though Tret1-1 regulation is independent of insulin signaling. In addition, starvation induces transcriptional upregulation that is controlled by TGF-β signaling. Considering TGF-β-dependent regulation of the glucose transporter GLUT1 in murine chondrocytes, our study reveals an evolutionarily conserved regulatory paradigm adapting the expression of sugar transporters at the BBB.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26129?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
To examine the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke with cancer.


Methods
We conducted a prospective cross‐sectional study from 2016‐2020 at two hospitals. We enrolled three groups of 50 adult participants each. The main group included patients with active solid tumor cancer and acute ischemic stroke. The control groups included patients with acute ischemic stroke only or active cancer only. The stroke‐only and cancer‐only patients were matched to the cancer‐plus‐stroke patients by age, sex, and cancer type, if applicable. The outcomes were prespecified hematological biomarkers and transcranial Doppler microemboli detection. Hematological biomarkers included markers of coagulation (D‐dimer, thrombin‐antithrombin), platelet function (P‐selectin), and endothelial integrity (thrombomodulin, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule‐1 [sICAM‐1], soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule‐1 [sVCAM‐1]). Hematological biomarkers were compared between groups using the Kruskal‐Wallis and Wilcoxon Rank‐Sum tests. In multivariable linear regression models, we adjusted for race, number of stroke risk factors, smoking, stroke severity, and antithrombotic use. Transcranial Doppler microemboli presence was compared between groups using Chi‐square tests.


Results
Levels of all study biomarkers were different between groups. In univariate between‐group comparisons, cancer‐plus‐stroke participants had higher levels of D‐dimer, sICAM‐1, sVCAM‐1, and thrombomodulin than both control groups; higher levels of thrombin‐antithrombin than cancer‐only participants; and higher levels of P‐selectin than stroke‐only participants. Findings were similar in multivariable analyses. Transcranial Doppler microemboli were detected in 32% of cancer‐plus‐stroke participants, 16% of stroke‐only participants, and 6% of cancer‐only participants (p=0.005).


Interpretation
Patients with cancer‐related stroke have higher markers of coagulation, platelet, and endothelial dysfunction, and more circulating microemboli, than matched controls.

Sequence-based residue contact prediction plays a crucial role in protein structure reconstruction. In recent years, the combination of evolutionary coupling analysis (ECA) and deep learning (DL) techniques has made tremendous progress for residue contact prediction, thus a comprehensive assessment of current methods based on a large-scale benchmark data set is very needed. In this study, we evaluate 18 contact predictors on 610 non-redundant proteins and 32 CASP13 targets according to a wide range of perspectives. The results show that different methods have different application scenarios: (1) DL methods based on multi-categories of inputs and large training sets are the best choices for low-contact-density proteins such as the intrinsically disordered ones and proteins with shallow multi-sequence alignments (MSAs). (2) With at least 5L (L is sequence length) effective sequences in the MSA, all the methods show the best performance, and methods that rely only on MSA as input can reach comparable achievements as methods that adopt multi-source inputs. (3) For top L/5 and L/2 predictions, DL methods can predict more hydrophobic interactions while ECA methods predict more salt bridges and disulfide bonds. (4) ECA methods can detect more secondary structure interactions, while DL methods can accurately excavate more contact patterns and prune isolated false positives. In general, multi-input DL methods with large training sets dominate current approaches with the best overall performance. Despite the great success of current DL methods must be stated the fact that there is still much room left for further improvement: (1) With shallow MSAs, the performance will be greatly affected. (2) Current methods show lower precisions for inter-domain compared with intra-domain contact predictions, as well as very high imbalances in precisions for intra-domains. (3) Strong prediction similarities between DL methods indicating more feature types and diversified models need to be developed. (4) The runtime of most methods can be further optimized.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/siLP2VRCLOM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Synaptic clustering on neuronal dendrites has been hypothesized to play an important role in implementing pattern recognition. Neighboring synapses on a dendritic branch can interact in a synergistic, cooperative manner via nonlinear voltage-dependent mechanisms, such as NMDA receptors. Inspired by the NMDA receptor, the single-branch clusteron learning algorithm takes advantage of location-dependent multiplicative nonlinearities to solve classification tasks by randomly shuffling the locations of “under-performing” synapses on a model dendrite during learning (“structural plasticity”), eventually resulting in synapses with correlated activity being placed next to each other on the dendrite. We propose an alternative model, the gradient clusteron, or G-clusteron, which uses an analytically-derived gradient descent rule where synapses are &quot;attracted to&quot; or &quot;repelled from&quot; each other in an input- and location-dependent manner. We demonstrate the classification ability of this algorithm by testing it on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset and show that, when using a softmax activation function, the accuracy of the G-clusteron on the all-versus-all MNIST task (~85%) approaches that of logistic regression (~93%). In addition to the location update rule, we also derive a learning rule for the synaptic weights of the G-clusteron (“functional plasticity”) and show that a G-clusteron that utilizes the weight update rule can achieve ~89% accuracy on the MNIST task. We also show that a G-clusteron with both the weight and location update rules can learn to solve the XOR problem from arbitrary initial conditions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KRXrTXsT_Mo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

An interesting problem for the human saccadic eye-movement system is how to deal with the degrees-of-freedom problem: the six extra-ocular muscles provide three rotational degrees of freedom, while only two are needed to point gaze at any direction. Measurements show that 3D eye orientations during head-fixed saccades in far-viewing conditions lie in Listing’s plane (LP), in which the eye’s cyclotorsion is zero (Listing’s law, LL). Moreover, while saccades are executed as single-axis rotations around a stable eye-angular velocity axis, they follow straight trajectories in LP. Another distinctive saccade property is their nonlinear main-sequence dynamics: the affine relationship between saccade size and movement duration, and the saturation of peak velocity with amplitude. To explain all these properties, we developed a computational model, based on a simplified and upscaled robotic prototype of an eye with 3 degrees of freedom, driven by three independent motor commands, coupled to three antagonistic elastic muscle pairs. As the robotic prototype was not intended to faithfully mimic the detailed biomechanics of the human eye, we did not impose specific prior mechanical constraints on the ocular plant that could, by themselves, generate Listing’s law and the main-sequence. Instead, our goal was to study how these properties can emerge from the application of optimal control principles to simplified eye models. We performed a numerical linearization of the nonlinear system dynamics around the origin using system identification techniques, and developed open-loop controllers for 3D saccade generation. Applying optimal control to the simulated model, could reproduce both Listing’s law and and the main-sequence. We verified the contribution of different terms in the cost optimization functional to realistic 3D saccade behavior, and identified four essential terms: total energy expenditure by the motors, movement duration, gaze accuracy, and the total static force exerted by the muscles during fixation. Our findings suggest that Listing’s law, as well as the saccade dynamics and their trajectories, may all emerge from the same common mechanism that aims to optimize speed-accuracy trade-off for saccades, while minimizing the total muscle force during eccentric fixation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7nEB9fufRJw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

We contrast two computational models of sequence learning. The associative learner posits that learning proceeds by strengthening existing association weights. Alternatively, recoding posits that learning creates new and more efficient representations of the learned sequences. Importantly, both models propose that humans act as optimal learners but capture different statistics of the stimuli in their internal model. Furthermore, these models make dissociable predictions as to how learning changes the neural representation of sequences. We tested these predictions by using fMRI to extract neural activity patters from the dorsal visual processing stream during a sequence recall task. We observed that only the recoding account can explain the similarity of neural activity patterns, suggesting that participants recode the learned sequences using chunks. We show that associative learning can theoretically store only very limited number of overlapping sequences, such as common in ecological working memory tasks, and hence an efficient learner should recode initial sequence representations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/s2L3TsNT71U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: On the effect of phylogenetic correlations in coevolution-based contact prediction in proteins</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/rZ6uKv1LSrQ/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Edwin Rodriguez Horta, Martin Weigt&lt;/p&gt;

Coevolution-based contact prediction, either directly by coevolutionary couplings resulting from global statistical sequence models or using structural supervision and deep learning, has found widespread application in protein-structure prediction from sequence. However, one of the basic assumptions in global statistical modeling is that sequences form an at least approximately independent sample of an unknown probability distribution, which is to be learned from data. In the case of protein families, this assumption is obviously violated by phylogenetic relations between protein sequences. It has turned out to be notoriously difficult to take phylogenetic correlations into account in coevolutionary model learning. Here, we propose a complementary approach: we develop strategies to randomize or resample sequence data, such that conservation patterns and phylogenetic relations are preserved, while intrinsic (i.e. structure- or function-based) coevolutionary couplings are removed. A comparison between the results of Direct Coupling Analysis applied to real and to resampled data shows that the largest coevolutionary couplings, i.e. those used for contact prediction, are only weakly influenced by phylogeny. However, the phylogeny-induced spurious couplings in the resampled data are compatible in size with the first false-positive contact predictions from real data. Dissecting functional from phylogeny-induced couplings might therefore extend accurate contact predictions to the range of intermediate-size couplings.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rZ6uKv1LSrQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Ian D. Estabrook, Hawa Racine Thiam, Matthieu Piel, Rhoda J. Hawkins&lt;/p&gt;

During cell migration in confinement, the nucleus has to deform for a cell to pass through small constrictions. Such nuclear deformations require significant forces. A direct experimental measure of the deformation force field is extremely challenging. However, experimental images of nuclear shape are relatively easy to obtain. Therefore, here we present a method to calculate predictions of the deformation force field based purely on analysis of experimental images of nuclei before and after deformation. Such an inverse calculation is technically non-trivial and relies on a mechanical model for the nucleus. Here we compare two simple continuum elastic models of a cell nucleus undergoing deformation. In the first, we treat the nucleus as a homogeneous elastic solid and, in the second, as an elastic shell. For each of these models we calculate the force field required to produce the deformation given by experimental images of nuclei in dendritic cells migrating in microchannels with constrictions of controlled dimensions. These microfabricated channels provide a simplified confined environment mimicking that experienced by cells in tissues. Our calculations predict the forces felt by a deforming nucleus as a migrating cell encounters a constriction. Since a direct experimental measure of the deformation force field is very challenging and has not yet been achieved, our numerical approaches can make important predictions motivating further experiments, even though all the parameters are not yet available. We demonstrate the power of our method by showing how it predicts lateral forces corresponding to actin polymerisation around the nucleus, providing evidence for actin generated forces squeezing the sides of the nucleus as it enters a constriction. In addition, the algorithm we have developed could be adapted to analyse experimental images of deformation in other situations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VFNS8Ql34z4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Genome-scale metabolic modelling when changes in environmental conditions affect biomass composition</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/a4MWgD3TmqE/article</link>

Genome-scale metabolic modeling is an important tool in the study of metabolism by enhancing the collation of knowledge, interpretation of data, and prediction of metabolic capabilities. A frequent assumption in the use of genome-scale models is that the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; organism is evolved for optimal growth, where growth is represented by flux through a biomass objective function (BOF). While the specific composition of the BOF is crucial, its formulation is often inherited from similar organisms due to the experimental challenges associated with its proper determination.
A cell’s macro-molecular composition is not fixed and it responds to changes in environmental conditions. As a consequence, initiatives for the high-fidelity determination of cellular biomass composition have been launched. Thus, there is a need for a mathematical and computational framework capable of using multiple measurements of cellular biomass composition in different environments. Here, we propose two different computational approaches for directly addressing this challenge: Biomass Trade-off Weighting (BTW) and Higher-dimensional-plane InterPolation (HIP).
In lieu of experimental data on biomass composition-variation in response to changing nutrient environment, we assess the properties of BTW and HIP using three hypothetical, yet biologically plausible, BOFs for the &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; genome-scale metabolic model &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;ML1515. We find that the BTW and HIP formulations have a significant impact on model performance and phenotypes. Furthermore, the BTW method generates larger growth rates in all environments when compared to HIP. Using acetate secretion and the respiratory quotient as proxies for phenotypic changes, we find marked differences between the methods as HIP generates BOFs more similar to a reference BOF than BTW. We conclude that the presented methods constitute a conceptual step in developing genome-scale metabolic modelling approaches capable of addressing the inherent dependence of cellular biomass composition on nutrient environments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/a4MWgD3TmqE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Investigation of Autosomal Genetic Sex Differences in Parkinson's Disease</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26090?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder. Men are on average ~ 1.5 times more likely to develop PD compared to women with European ancestry. Over the years, genomewide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous genetic risk factors for PD, however, it is unclear whether genetics contribute to disease etiology in a sex‐specific manner.


Methods
In an effort to study sex‐specific genetic factors associated with PD, we explored 2 large genetic datasets from the International Parkinson's Disease Genomics Consortium and the UK Biobank consisting of 13,020 male PD cases, 7,936 paternal proxy cases, 89,660 male controls, 7,947 female PD cases, 5,473 maternal proxy cases, and 90,662 female controls. We performed GWAS meta‐analyses to identify distinct patterns of genetic risk contributing to disease in male versus female PD cases.


Results
In total, 19 genomewide significant regions were identified and no sex‐specific effects were observed. A high genetic correlation between the male and female PD GWAS were identified (rg = 0.877) and heritability estimates were identical between male and female PD cases (~ 20%).


Interpretation
We did not detect any significant genetic differences between male or female PD cases. Our study does not support the notion that common genetic variation on the autosomes could explain the difference in prevalence of PD between males and females cases at least when considering the current sample size under study. Further studies are warranted to investigate the genetic architecture of PD explained by X and Y chromosomes and further evaluate environmental effects that could potentially contribute to PD etiology in male versus female patients.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Network Path Convergence Shapes Low-Level Processing in the Visual Cortex</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.645709</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hierarchical counterstream via feedforward and feedback interactions is a major organizing principle of the cerebral cortex. The counterstream, as a topological feature of the network of cortical areas, is captured by the convergence and divergence of paths through directed links. So defined, the convergence degree (CD) reveals the reciprocal nature of forward and backward connections, and also hierarchically relevant integrative properties of areas through their inward and outward connections. We asked if topology shapes large-scale cortical functioning by studying the role of CD in network resilience and Granger causal coupling in a model of hierarchical network dynamics. Our results indicate that topological synchronizability is highly vulnerable to attacking edges based on CD, while global network efficiency depends mostly on edge betweenness, a measure of the connectedness of a link. Furthermore, similar to anatomical hierarchy determined by the laminar distribution of connections, CD highly correlated with causal coupling in feedforward gamma, and feedback alpha-beta band synchronizations in a well-studied subnetwork, including low-level visual cortical areas. In contrast, causal coupling did not correlate with edge betweenness. Considering the entire network, the CD-based hierarchy correlated well with both the anatomical and functional hierarchy for low-level areas that are far apart in the hierarchy. Conversely, in a large part of the anatomical network where hierarchical distances are small between the areas, the correlations were not significant. These findings suggest that CD-based and functional hierarchies are interrelated in low-level processing in the visual cortex. Our results are consistent with the idea that the interplay of multiple hierarchical features forms the basis of flexible functional cortical interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Invaginating Structures in Synapses – Perspective</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2021.685052</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Invaginating structures are common in the synapses of most animals. However, the details of these invaginating structures remain understudied in part because they are not well resolved in light microscopy and were often misidentified in early electron microscope (EM) studies. Utilizing experimental techniques along with the latest advances in microscopy, such as focused ion beam-scanning EM (FIB-SEM), evidence is gradually building to suggest that the synaptic invaginating structures contribute to synapse development, maintenance, and plasticity. These invaginating structures are most elaborate in synapses mediating rapid integration of signals, such as muscle contraction, mechanoreception, and vision. Here we argue that the synaptic invaginations should be considered in future studies seeking to understand their role in sensory integration and coordination, learning, and memory. We review the various types of invaginating structures in the synapses and discuss their potential functions. We also present several new examples of invaginating structures from a variety of animals including Drosophila and mice, mainly using FIB-SEM, with which we trace the form and arrangement of these structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: GluN2D NMDA Receptors Gate Fear Extinction Learning and Interneuron Plasticity</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2021.681068</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The cerebellum is critically involved in the formation of associative fear memory and in subsequent extinction learning. Fear conditioning is associated with a long-term potentiation at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses onto Purkinje cells. We therefore tested whether fear conditioning unmasks novel forms of synaptic plasticity, which enable subsequent extinction learning to reset cerebellar circuitry. We found that fear learning enhanced GABA release from molecular layer interneurons and this was reversed after fear extinction learning. Importantly an extinction-like stimulation of parallel fibers after fear learning is sufficient to induce a lasting decrease in inhibitory transmission (I-LTD&lt;sub&gt;stim&lt;/sub&gt;) in the cerebellar cortex, a form of plasticity that is absent in naïve animals. While NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors are required for the formation and extinction of associative memory, the role of GluN2D, one of the four major NMDA receptor subunits, in learning and memory has not been determined. We found that fear conditioning elevates spontaneous GABA release in GluN2D KO as shown in WT mice. Deletion of GluN2D, however, abolished the I-LTD&lt;sub&gt;stim&lt;/sub&gt; induced by parallel fiber stimulation after learning. At the behavioral level, genetic deletion of GluN2D subunits did not affect associative learning and memory retention, but impaired subsequent fear extinction learning. D-cycloserine, a partial NMDA receptor (NMDAR) agonist, failed to rescue extinction learning in mutant mice. Our results identify GluN2D as a critical NMDAR subunit for extinction learning and reveal a form of GluN2D-dependent metaplasticity that is associated with extinction in the cerebellum.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Cochlin Deficiency Protects Against Noise-Induced Hearing Loss</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.670013</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cochlin is the most abundant protein in the inner ear. To study its function in response to noise trauma, we exposed adolescent wild-type (Coch&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt;) and cochlin knock-out (Coch&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;) mice to noise (8–16 kHz, 103 dB SPL, 2 h) that causes a permanent threshold shift and hair cell loss. Two weeks after noise exposure, Coch&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice had substantially less elevation in noise-induced auditory thresholds and hair cell loss than Coch&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;/&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; mice, consistent with cochlin deficiency providing protection from noise trauma. Comparison of pre-noise exposure thresholds of auditory brain stem responses (ABRs) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) in Coch&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice and Coch&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;/&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; littermates revealed a small and significant elevation in thresholds of Coch&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice, overall consistent with a small conductive hearing loss in Coch&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. We show quantitatively that the pro-inflammatory component of cochlin, LCCL, is upregulated after noise exposure in perilymph of wild-type mice compared to unexposed mice, as is the enzyme catalyzing LCCL release, aggrecanase1, encoded by Adamts4. We further show that upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in perilymph and cochlear soft-tissue after noise exposure is lower in cochlin knock-out than wild-type mice. Taken together, our data demonstrate for the first time that cochlin deficiency results in conductive hearing loss that protects against physiologic and molecular effects of noise trauma.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.687973</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease in the elderly and is the most common type of dementia. AD is mostly gradual onset, and involves slow, progressive mental decline, accompanied by personality changes; the incidence of AD gradually increases with age. The etiology of AD is unknown, although it is currently believed to be related to abnormal deposition of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) in the brain, hyperphosphorylation of microtubule-associated protein tau, and the release of various cytokines, complements, activators and chemokines by cells. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of highly conserved non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, and manipulate the functions of intracellular proteins and physiological processes. Emerging studies have shown that miRNA plays an important role in regulating AD-related genes. MiR-132 is known as “NeurimmiR” due to its involvement in numerous neurophysiological and pathological processes. Accumulating pre-clinical results suggest that miR-132 may be involved in the progression of Aβ and tau pathology. Moreover, clinical studies have indicated that decreased circulating miR-132 levels could be used a potential diagnostic biomarker in AD. Here, we review the pathogenic role of miR-132 activity in AD, and the potential of targeting miR-132 for developing future therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Loss of Rbfox1 Does Not Affect Survival of Retinal Ganglion Cells Injured by Optic Nerve Crush</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.687690</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Rbfox1 is a multifunctional RNA binding protein that regulates alternative splicing, transcription, mRNA stability and translation. Its roles in neurogenesis and neuronal functions are well established. Recent studies also implicate Rbfox1 in the regulation of gene networks that support cell survival during stress. We have earlier characterized the expression of Rbfox1 in amacrine and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and showed that deletion of Rbfox1 in adult animals results in depth perception deficiency. The current study investigates the effect of Rbfox1 downregulation on survival of RGCs injured by optic nerve crush (ONC). Seven days after ONC, animals sustained severe degeneration of RGC axons in the optic nerve and significant loss of RGC somas. Semi-quantitative grading of optic nerve damage in control + ONC, control + tamoxifen + ONC, and Rbfox1&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; + ONC groups ranged from 4.6 to 4.8 on a scale of 1 (normal; no degenerated axons were noted) to 5 (total degeneration; all axons showed degenerated organelles, axonal content, and myelin sheath), indicating a severe degeneration. Among these three ONC groups, no statistical significance was observed when any two groups were compared. The number of RGC somas were quantitatively analyzed in superior, inferior, nasal and temporal retinal quadrants at 0.5, 1, and 1.5 mm from the center of the optic disc. The average RGC densities (cells/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) were: control 6,438 ± 1,203; control + ONC 2,779 ± 573; control + tamoxifen 6,163 ± 861; control + tamoxifen + ONC 2,573 ± 555; Rbfox1&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; 6,437 ± 893; and Rbfox1&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; + ONC 2,537 ± 526. The RGC loss in control + ONC, control + tamoxifen + ONC and Rbfox1&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; + ONC was 57% (P = 1.44954E-42), 58% (P = 1.37543E-57) and 61% (P = 5.552E-59) compared to RGC numbers in the relevant uninjured groups, respectively. No statistically significant difference was observed between any two groups of uninjured animals or between any two ONC groups. Our data indicate that Rbfox1-mediated pathways have no effect on survival of RGCs injured by ONC.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.672954</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The identification of neurological diseases in their presymptomatic phase will be a fundamental aim in the coming years. This step is necessary both to optimize early diagnostics and to verify the effectiveness of experimental disease modifying drugs in the early stages of diseases. Among the biomarkers that can detect neurological diseases already in their preclinical phase, neurofilament light chain (NfL) has given the most promising results. Recently, its measurement in serum has enabled the identification of neurodegeneration in diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) up to 6–10 years before the onset of symptoms. Similar results have been obtained in conditions such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), up to 2 years before clinical onset. Study of the longitudinal dynamics of serum NfL has also revealed interesting aspects of the pathophysiology of these diseases in the preclinical phase. This review sought to discuss these very recent findings on serum NfL in the presymptomatic phase of neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As a type of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)-dependent deacetylases, sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) is predominantly found in the cytoplasm of cells in the central nervous system (CNS), suggesting its potential role in neurological disorders. Though SIRT2 is generally acknowledged to accelerate the development of neurological pathologies, it protects the brain from deterioration in certain circumstances. This review summarized the complex roles SIRT2 plays in the pathophysiology of diverse neurological disorders, compared and analyzed the discrete roles of SIRT2 in different conditions, and provided possible explanations for its paradoxical functions. In the future, the rapid growth in SIRT2 research may clarify its impacts on neurological disorders and develop therapeutic strategies targeting this protein.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Isometric maximum muscle strength (MVC) of elbow flexors and extensors was evaluated using the robot at the beginning and end of each training session. Clinical measures including Fugl-Meyer Assessment of upper extremity (FMA-UE), Motricity Index (MI) for upper extremities, Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) were measured at baseline, after the 4-week training program, and at a 1-month follow-up. The muscle strength recovery curve over the training period was characterized as a logarithmic learning curve with three parameters (i.e., initial muscle strength, rate of improvement, and number of the training session).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: At the baseline, participants had moderate to severe upper limb motor impairment {FMA-UE [median (interquartile range)]: 28 (18–45)} and mild spasticity in elbow flexors {MAS [median (interquartile range)]: 0 (0–1)}. After about 4 weeks of training, significant improvements were observed in FMA-UE (p = 0.003) and MI (p = 0.005), and the improvements were sustained at the follow-up. The elbow flexors MVC significantly increased by 1.93 Nm (95% CI: 0.93 to 2.93 Nm, p = 0.017) and the elbow extensor MVC increased by 0.68 Nm (95% CI: 0.05 to 1.98 Nm, p = 0.036). Muscle strength recovery curve showed that patients with severe upper limb motor impairment had a greater improvement rate in elbow flexor strength than those with moderate motor impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: In-bed wearable elbow robotic rehabilitation is feasible and effective in improving biomechanical and clinical outcomes for early and late subacute stroke in-patients. Results from the pilot study suggested that patients with severe upper limb motor impairment may benefit more from the robot training compared to those with moderate impairment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Event-Based Trajectory Prediction Using Spiking Neural Networks</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.658764</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, event-based sensors have been combined with spiking neural networks (SNNs) to create a new generation of bio-inspired artificial vision systems. These systems can process spatio-temporal data in real time, and are highly energy efficient. In this study, we used a new hybrid event-based camera in conjunction with a multi-layer spiking neural network trained with a spike-timing-dependent plasticity learning rule. We showed that neurons learn from repeated and correlated spatio-temporal patterns in an unsupervised way and become selective to motion features, such as direction and speed. This motion selectivity can then be used to predict ball trajectory by adding a simple read-out layer composed of polynomial regressions, and trained in a supervised manner. Hence, we show that a SNN receiving inputs from an event-based sensor can extract relevant spatio-temporal patterns to process and predict ball trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: A Complex-Valued Oscillatory Neural Network for Storage and Retrieval of Multidimensional Aperiodic Signals</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.551111</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recurrent neural networks with associative memory properties are typically based on fixed-point dynamics, which is fundamentally distinct from the oscillatory dynamics of the brain. There have been proposals for oscillatory associative memories, but here too, in the majority of cases, only binary patterns are stored as oscillatory states in the network. Oscillatory neural network models typically operate at a single/common frequency. At multiple frequencies, even a pair of oscillators with real coupling exhibits rich dynamics of Arnold tongues, not easily harnessed to achieve reliable memory storage and retrieval. Since real brain dynamics comprises of a wide range of spectral components, there is a need for oscillatory neural network models that operate at multiple frequencies. We propose an oscillatory neural network that can model multiple time series simultaneously by performing a Fourier-like decomposition of the signals. We show that these enhanced properties of a network of Hopf oscillators become possible by operating in the complex-variable domain. In this model, the single neural oscillator is modeled as a Hopf oscillator, with adaptive frequency and dynamics described over the complex domain. We propose a novel form of coupling, dubbed “power coupling,” between complex Hopf oscillators. With power coupling, expressed naturally only in the complex-variable domain, it is possible to achieve stable (normalized) phase relationships in a network of multifrequency oscillators. Network connections are trained either by Hebb-like learning or by delta rule, adapted to the complex domain. The network is capable of modeling N-channel electroencephalogram time series with high accuracy and shows the potential as an effective model of large-scale brain dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: BACHD Mice Recapitulate the Striatal Parvalbuminergic Interneuron Loss Found in Huntington’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.673177</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Huntington’s disease (HD) is a dominantly inherited, adult-onset neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor, psychiatric, and cognitive abnormalities. Neurodegeneration is prominently observed in the striatum where GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSN) are the most affected neuronal population. Interestingly, recent reports of pathological changes in HD patient striatal tissue have identified a significant reduction in the number of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons which becomes more robust in tissues of higher disease grade. Analysis of other interneuron populations, including somatostatin, calretinin, and cholinergic, did not reveal significant neurodegeneration. Electrophysiological experiments in BACHD mice have identified significant changes in the properties of parvalbumin and somatostatin expressing interneurons in the striatum. Furthermore, their interactions with MSNs are altered as the mHTT expressing mouse models age with increased input onto MSNs from striatal somatostatin and parvalbumin-expressing neurons. In order to determine whether BACHD mice recapitulate the alterations in striatal interneuron number as observed in HD patients, we analyzed the number of striatal parvalbumin, somatostatin, calretinin, and choline acetyltransferase positive cells in symptomatic 12–14 month-old mice by immunofluorescent labeling. We observed a significant decrease in the number of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons as well as a decrease in the area and perimeter of these cells. No significant changes were observed for somatostatin, calretinin, or cholinergic interneuron numbers while a significant decrease was observed for the area of cholinergic interneurons. Thus, the BACHD mice recapitulate the degenerative phenotype observed in the parvalbumin interneurons in HD patient striata without affecting the number of other interneuron populations in the striatum.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Molecular Characterization of Superficial Layers of the Presubiculum During Development</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.662724</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The presubiculum, a subarea of the parahippocampal region, plays a critical role in spatial navigation and spatial representation. An outstanding aspect of presubicular spatial codes is head-direction selectivity of the firing of excitatory neurons, called head-direction cells. Head-direction selectivity emerges before eye-opening in rodents and is maintained in adulthood through neurophysiological interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Although the presubiculum has been physiologically profiled in terms of spatial representation during development, the histological characteristics of the developing presubiculum are poorly understood. We found that the expression of vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGluT2) could be used to delimit the superficial layers of the presubiculum, which was identified using an anterograde tracer injected into the anterior thalamic nucleus (ATN). Thus, we immunostained slices from mice ranging in age from neonates to adults using an antibody against VGluT2 to evaluate the VGluT2-positive area, which was identified as the superficial layers of the presubiculum, during development. We also immunostained the slices using antibodies against parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SOM) and found that in the presubicular superficial layers, PV-positive neurons progressively increased in number during development, whereas SOM-positive neurons exhibited no increasing trend. In addition, we observed repeating patch structures in presubicular layer III from postnatal days 12. The abundant expression of VGluT2 suggests that the presubicular superficial layers are regulated primarily by VGluT2-mediated excitatory neurotransmission. Moreover, developmental changes in the densities of PV- and SOM-positive interneurons and the emergence of the VGluT2-positive patch structures during adolescence may be associated with the functional development of spatial codes in the superficial layers of the presubiculum.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Is There Any Association Between Neurodegenerative Diseases and Periodontitis? A Systematic Review</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.651437</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Neurodegenerative diseases are a group of progressive disorders that affect the central nervous system (CNS) such as Alzheimer, Parkinson, and multiple sclerosis. Inflammation plays a critical role in the onset and progression of these injuries. Periodontitis is considered an inflammatory disease caused by oral biofilms around the tooth-supporting tissues, leading to a systemic and chronic inflammatory condition. Thus, this systematic review aimed to search for evidence in the association between neurodegenerative disorders and periodontitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: This systematic review was registered at International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) under the code CRD 42016038327. The search strategy was performed in three electronic databases and one gray literature source—PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and OpenGrey, based on the PECO acronym: observational studies in humans (P) in which a neurodegenerative disease was present (E) or absent (C) to observe an association with periodontitis (O). The Fowkes and Fulton checklist was used to critically appraise the methodological quality and the risk of bias of individual studies. The quality of evidence was assessed by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: From 534 articles found, 12 were included, of which eight were case–control, three were cross-sectional, and one was a cohort, giving a total of 3,460 participants. All the included studies reported an association between some neurodegenerative diseases and periodontitis and presented a low risk of bias. According to the GRADE approach, the level of evidence of probing pocket depth was considered very low due to the significant heterogeneity across the studies' upgrading imprecision and inconsistency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Although all the included studies in this review reported an association between neurodegenerative diseases and periodontitis, the level of evidence was classified to be very low, which suggests a cautious interpretation of the results.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Mild Behavioral Impairment Is Associated With Atrophy of Entorhinal Cortex and Hippocampus in a Memory Clinic Cohort</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.643271</link>
	<content:encoded>Objectives&lt;p&gt;Mild behavioral impairment (MBI) is a syndrome describing late-onset persistent neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in non-demented older adults. Few studies to date have investigated the associations of MBI with structural brain changes. Our aim was to explore structural correlates of NPS in a non-demented memory clinic sample using the Mild Behavioral Impairment Checklist (MBI-C) that has been developed to measure MBI.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;One hundred sixteen non-demented older adults from the Czech Brain Aging Study with subjective cognitive concerns were classified as subjective cognitive decline (n = 37) or mild cognitive impairment (n = 79). Participants underwent neurological and neuropsychological examinations and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (1.5 T). The Czech version of the MBI-C was administered to participants’ informants. Five a priori selected brain regions were measured, namely, thicknesses of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and entorhinal cortex (ERC) and volume of the hippocampus (HV), and correlated with MBI-C total and domain scores.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Entorhinal cortex was associated with MBI-C total score (r&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; = −0.368, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and with impulse dyscontrol score (r&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; = −0.284, p = 0.002). HV was associated with decreased motivation (r&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; = −0.248, p = 0.008) and impulse dyscontrol score (r&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; = −0.240, p = 0.011).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Neuropsychiatric symptoms, particularly in the MBI impulse dyscontrol and motivation domains, are associated with medial temporal lobe atrophy in a clinical cohort of non-demented older adults. This study supports earlier involvement of temporal rather than frontal regions in NPS manifestation. Since these regions are typically affected early in the course of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the MBI-C may potentially help further identify individuals at-risk of developing AD dementia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/67709</link>
	<content:encoded>ESCRT-III polymerization is required for all endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-dependent events in the cell. However, the relative contributions of the eight ESCRT-III subunits differ between each process. The minimal features of ESCRT-III proteins necessary for function and the role for the multiple ESCRT-III subunits remain unclear. To identify essential features of ESCRT-III subunits, we previously studied the polymerization mechanisms of two ESCRT-III subunits Snf7 and Vps24, identifying the association of the helix-4 region of Snf7 with the helix-1 region of Vps24 (Banjade et al., 2019a). Here, we find that mutations in the helix-1 region of another ESCRT-III subunit Vps2 can functionally replace Vps24 in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;. Engineering and genetic selections revealed the required features of both subunits. Our data allow us to propose three minimal features required for ESCRT-III function – spiral formation, lateral association of the spirals through heteropolymerization, and binding to the AAA + ATPase Vps4 for dynamic remodeling.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: A phosphorylation of RIPK3 kinase initiates an intracellular apoptotic pathway that promotes prostaglandin2α-induced corpus luteum regression</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/67409</link>
	<content:encoded>Receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) normally signals to necroptosis by phosphorylating MLKL. We report here that when the cellular RIPK3 chaperone Hsp90/CDC37 level is low, RIPK3 also signals to apoptosis. The apoptotic function of RIPK3 requires phosphorylation of the serine 165/threonine 166 sites on its kinase activation loop, resulting in inactivation of RIPK3 kinase activity while gaining the ability to recruit RIPK1, FADD, and caspase-8 to form a cytosolic caspase-activating complex, thereby triggering apoptosis. We found that PGF&lt;sub&gt;2α&lt;/sub&gt; induces RIPK3 expression in luteal granulosa cells in the ovary to cause luteal regression through this RIPK3-mediated apoptosis pathway. Mice carrying homozygous phosphorylation-resistant RIPK3 S165A/T166A knockin mutations failed to respond to PGF&lt;sub&gt;2α&lt;/sub&gt; but retained pro-necroptotic function, whereas mice with phospho-mimicking S165D/T166E homozygous knock-in mutation underwent spontaneous apoptosis in multiple RIPK3-expressing tissues and died shortly after birth. Thus, RIPK3 signals to either necroptosis or apoptosis depending on its serine 165/threonine 166 phosphorylation status.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Midbrain dopaminergic inputs gate amygdala intercalated cell clusters by distinct and cooperative mechanisms in male mice</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63708</link>
	<content:encoded>Dopaminergic signaling plays an important role in associative learning, including fear and extinction learning. Dopaminergic midbrain neurons encode prediction error-like signals when threats differ from expectations. Within the amygdala, GABAergic intercalated cell (ITC) clusters receive one of the densest dopaminergic projections, but their physiological consequences are incompletely understood. ITCs are important for fear extinction, a function thought to be supported by activation of ventromedial ITCs that inhibit central amygdala fear output. In mice, we reveal two distinct novel mechanisms by which mesencephalic dopaminergic afferents control ITCs. Firstly, they co-release GABA to mediate rapid, direct inhibition. Secondly, dopamine suppresses inhibitory interactions between distinct ITC clusters via presynaptic D1 receptors. Early extinction training augments both GABA co-release onto dorsomedial ITCs and dopamine-mediated suppression of dorso- to ventromedial inhibition between ITC clusters. These findings provide novel insights into dopaminergic mechanisms shaping the activity balance between distinct ITC clusters that could support their opposing roles in fear behavior.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23335?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
The role of the hippocampus in recognition memory has long been a source of debate. Tasks used to study recognition that typically require an explicit probe, where the participant must make a response to prove they remember, yield mixed results on hippocampal involvement. Here, we tasked monkeys to freely view naturalistic videos, and only tested their memory via looking times for two separate novel versus repeat video conditions on each trial. Notably, a large proportion (&amp;gt;30%) of hippocampal neurons differentiated these videos via changes in firing rates time‐locked to the duration of their presentation on screen, and not during the delay period between them as would be expected for working memory. Many of these single neurons (&amp;gt;15%) contributed to both retrieval conditions, and differentiated novel from repeat videos across trials with trial‐unique content, suggesting they detect familiarity. The majority of neurons contributing to the classifier showed an enhancement in firing rate on repeat compared with novel videos, a pattern which has not previously been shown in hippocampus. These results suggest the hippocampus contributes to recognition memory via familiarity during free‐viewing.</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Gut microbiome signatures of risk and prodromal markers of Parkinson's disease</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26128?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objectives
Alterations of the gut microbiome in Parkinson's disease (PD) have been repeatedly demonstrated. However, little is known about whether such alterations precede disease onset and how they relate to risk and prodromal markers of PD. We investigated associations of these features with gut microbiome composition.


Methods
Established risk and prodromal markers of PD as well as factors related to diet/lifestyle, bowel function and medication were studied in relation to bacterial α−/β‐diversity, enterotypes, and differential abundance in stool samples of 666 elderly TREND study participants.


Results
Among risk and prodromal markers, physical inactivity, occupational solvent exposure, and constipation showed associations with α‐diversity. Physical inactivity, sex, constipation, possible REM‐sleep behavior disorder (RBD), and smoking were associated with β‐diversity. Subthreshold parkinsonism and physical inactivity showed an interaction effect. Amongst other factors, age and urate‐lowering medication were associated with α‐ and β‐diversity. Constipation was highest in individuals with the Firmicutes‐enriched enterotype, and physical inactivity was most frequent in the Bacteroides‐enriched enterotype. Constipation was lowest and subthreshold parkinsonism least frequent in individuals with the Prevotella‐enriched enterotype. Differentially abundant taxa were linked to constipation, physical inactivity, possible RBD, smoking, and subthreshold parkinsonism. Substantia nigra hyperechogenicity, olfactory loss, depression, orthostatic hypotension, urinary/erectile dysfunction, PD family history and the prodromal PD probability showed no significant microbiome associations.


Interpretation
Several risk and prodromal markers of PD are associated with gut microbiome composition. However, the impact of the gut microbiome on PD risk and potential microbiome‐dependent subtypes in the prodrome of PD need further investigation based on prospective clinical and (multi)omics data in incident PD cases.

	<content:encoded>Cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills were both related to neurocognitive functioning and white matter microstructure. No evidence was found for a mediating role of white matter microstructure in the relationship between both cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills with neurocognitive functioning.

Abstract
Recent evidence indicates that both cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skill performance are related to enhanced neurocognitive functioning in children by influencing brain structure and functioning. This study investigates the role of white matter microstructure in the relationship of both cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills with neurocognitive functioning in healthy children. In total 92 children (mean age 9.1 years, range 8.0–10.7) were included in this study. Cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skill performance were assessed using performance‐based tests. Neurocognitive functioning was assessed using computerized tests (working memory, inhibition, interference control, information processing, and attention). Diffusion tensor imaging was used in combination with tract‐based spatial statistics to assess white matter microstructure as defined by fractional anisotropy (FA), axial and radial diffusivity (AD, RD). The results revealed positive associations of both cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills with neurocognitive functioning. Information processing and motor response inhibition were associated with FA in a cluster located in the corpus callosum. Within this cluster, higher cardiovascular fitness and better gross motor skills were both associated with greater FA, greater AD, and lower RD. No mediating role was found for FA in the relationship of both cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills with neurocognitive functioning. The results indicate that cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills are related to neurocognitive functioning as well as white matter microstructure in children. However, this study provides no evidence for a mediating role of white matter microstructure in these relationships.</content:encoded>

Interest in gene drive technology has continued to grow as promising new drive systems have been developed in the lab and discussions are moving towards implementing field trials. The prospect of field trials requires models that incorporate a significant degree of ecological detail, including parameters that change over time in response to environmental data such as temperature and rainfall, leading to seasonal patterns in mosquito population density. Epidemiological outcomes are also of growing importance, as: i) the suitability of a gene drive construct for release will depend on its expected impact on disease transmission, and ii) initial field trials are expected to have a measured entomological outcome and a modeled epidemiological outcome. We present MGDrivE 2 (Mosquito Gene Drive Explorer 2): a significant development from the MGDrivE 1 simulation framework that investigates the population dynamics of a variety of gene drive architectures and their spread through spatially-explicit mosquito populations. Key strengths and fundamental improvements of the MGDrivE 2 framework are: i) the ability of parameters to vary with time and induce seasonal population dynamics, ii) an epidemiological module accommodating reciprocal pathogen transmission between humans and mosquitoes, and iii) an implementation framework based on stochastic Petri nets that enables efficient model formulation and flexible implementation. Example MGDrivE 2 simulations are presented to demonstrate the application of the framework to a CRISPR-based split gene drive system intended to drive a disease-refractory gene into a population in a confinable and reversible manner, incorporating time-varying temperature and rainfall data. The simulations also evaluate impact on human disease incidence and prevalence. Further documentation and use examples are provided in vignettes at the project’s CRAN repository. MGDrivE 2 is freely available as an open-source R package on CRAN (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MGDrivE2). We intend the package to provide a flexible tool capable of modeling gene drive constructs as they move closer to field application and to infer their expected impact on disease transmission.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ilj39Jhio9I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Leveraging eQTLs to identify individual-level tissue of interest for a complex trait</title>

Genetic predisposition for complex traits often acts through multiple tissues at different time points during development. As a simple example, the genetic predisposition for obesity could be manifested either through inherited variants that control metabolism through regulation of genes expressed in the brain, or that control fat storage through dysregulation of genes expressed in adipose tissue, or both. Here we describe a statistical approach that leverages tissue-specific expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) corresponding to tissue-specific genes to prioritize a relevant tissue underlying the genetic predisposition of a given individual for a complex trait. Unlike existing approaches that prioritize relevant tissues for the trait in the population, our approach probabilistically quantifies the tissue-wise genetic contribution to the trait for a given individual. We hypothesize that for a subgroup of individuals the genetic contribution to the trait can be mediated primarily through a specific tissue. Through simulations using the UK Biobank, we show that our approach can predict the relevant tissue accurately and can cluster individuals according to their tissue-specific genetic architecture. We analyze body mass index (BMI) and waist to hip ratio adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI) in the UK Biobank to identify subgroups of individuals whose genetic predisposition act primarily through brain versus adipose tissue, and adipose versus muscle tissue, respectively. Notably, we find that these individuals have specific phenotypic features beyond BMI and WHRadjBMI that distinguish them from random individuals in the data, suggesting biological effects of tissue-specific genetic contribution for these traits.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/702WWWjDJ6w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Evidence of impaired naming in patients with hippocampal amnesia</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23325?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Object naming involves accessing meaning and retrieving the associated word form from remote semantic memory. Historically, previously acquired semantic knowledge (i.e., remote semantic memory) was thought to be independent of the hippocampus via neocortical consolidation. This view is based on evidence demonstrating a dissociation in behavior in patients with hippocampal amnesia: amnesic patients are impaired in acquiring new vocabulary yet can name and define previously acquired words. More recently, the view that remote semantic memory is hippocampus‐independent has been challenged by the documentation of disruptions in aspects of remote semantic memory in patients with hippocampal amnesia, particularly in language use and depth of semantic knowledge. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that the hippocampus plays a long‐term role in remote semantic memory. We tested amnesic patients and demographically matched healthy comparison participants in an extensive naming task using photographic images of objects normalized for familiarity, object agreement, and visual complexity. Amnesic patients were less likely to correctly name objects than healthy comparison participants. Further, amnesic patients' performance worsened for words that were less familiar, more visually complex, and had less object agreement. These findings suggest that the hippocampus may play a long‐term role in semantic memory processes, rather than a time‐limited role in the initial acquisition of semantic information, and that hippocampal damage can disrupt object naming.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Neurons including hippocampal spatial view cells, and navigation in primates including humans</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23324?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
A new theory is proposed of mechanisms of navigation in primates including humans in which spatial view cells found in the primate hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus are used to guide the individual from landmark to landmark. The navigation involves approach to each landmark in turn (taxis), using spatial view cells to identify the next landmark in the sequence, and does not require a topological map. Two other cell types found in primates, whole body motion cells, and head direction cells, can be utilized in the spatial view cell navigational mechanism, but are not essential. If the landmarks become obscured, then the spatial view representations can be updated by self‐motion (idiothetic) path integration using spatial coordinate transform mechanisms in the primate dorsal visual system to transform from egocentric to allocentric spatial view coordinates. A continuous attractor network or time cells or working memory is used in this approach to navigation to encode and recall the spatial view sequences involved. I also propose how navigation can be performed using a further type of neuron found in primates, allocentric‐bearing‐to‐a‐landmark neurons, in which changes of direction are made when a landmark reaches a particular allocentric bearing. This is useful if a landmark cannot be approached. The theories are made explicit in models of navigation, which are then illustrated by computer simulations. These types of navigation are contrasted with triangulation, which requires a topological map. It is proposed that the first strategy utilizing spatial view cells is used frequently in humans, and is relatively simple because primates have spatial view neurons that respond allocentrically to locations in spatial scenes. An advantage of this approach to navigation is that hippocampal spatial view neurons are also useful for episodic memory, and for imagery.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Mossy fiber sprouting into the hippocampal region CA2 in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23323?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Hippocampal sclerosis (HS) in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) shows neuronal death in cornu ammonis (CA)1, CA3, and CA4. It is known that granule cells and CA2 neurons survive and their axons, the mossy fibers (MF), lose their target cells in CA3 and CA4 and sprout to the granule cell layer and molecular layer. We examined in TLE patients and in a mouse epilepsy model, whether MF sprouting is directed to the dentate gyrus or extends to distant CA regions and whether sprouting is associated with death of target neurons in CA3 and CA4. In 319 TLE patients, HS was evaluated by Wyler grade and International League against Epilepsy (ILAE) types using immunohistochemistry against neuronal nuclei (NeuN). Synaptoporin was used to colocalize MF. In addition, transgenic Thy1‐eGFP mice were intrahippocampally injected with kainate and sprouting of eGFP‐positive MFs was analyzed together with immunocytochemistry for regulator of G‐protein signaling 14 (RGS14). In human HS Wyler III and IV as well as in ILAE 1, 2, and 3 specimens, we found synaptoporin‐positive axon terminals in CA2 and even in CA1, associated with the extent of granule cell dispersion. Sprouting was seen in cases with cell death of target neurons in CA3 and CA4 (classical severe HS ILAE type 1) but also without this cell death (atypical HS ILAE type 2). Similarly, in epileptic mice eGFP‐positive MFs sprouted to CA2 and beyond. The presence of MF terminals in the CA2 pyramidal cell layer and in CA1 was also correlated with the extent of granule cell dispersion. The similarity of our findings in human specimens and in the mouse model highlights the importance and opens up new chances of using translational approaches to determine mechanisms underlying TLE.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Episodic processes in moral decisions: Evidence from medial temporal lobe amnesia</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23321?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Theoretical accounts of moral decision making imply distinct ways in which episodic memory processes may contribute to judgments about moral dilemmas that entail high conflict between a harmful action and a greater good resulting from such action. Yet, studies examining the status of moral judgment in amnesic patients with medial temporal lobe (MTL) lesions have yielded inconsistent results. To examine whether and how episodic processes contribute to high conflict moral decisions, amnesic patients with MTL damage and control participants were asked to judge the moral acceptability of a harmful action across two conditions that differed in the framing of the moral question. We predicted that personal (but not abstract) framing would engage episodic processes involved in mental simulation, yielding a selective impairment in MTL patients in the personal framing condition. This prediction was not confirmed as neither patients nor controls were influenced by the framing of the moral question. With the exception of a patient whose lesion extended into the amygdala bilaterally, patients were less willing than controls to endorse the utilitarian option, rejecting the harmful action despite its beneficial outcome. They also rated actions as emotionally more intense than did controls. These findings suggest that episodic processes involved in mental simulation are necessary to prospectively evaluate action‐outcome contingencies.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: The hippocampal‐entorhinal system represents nested hierarchical relations between words during concept learning</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23320?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
A fundamental skill of an intelligent mind is that of being able to rapidly discover the structural organization underlying the relations across the objects or the events in the world. Humans, thanks to language, master this skill. For example, a child learning that dolphins and cats can also be referred to as mammals, not only will infer the presence of a hierarchical organization for which dolphins and cats are subordinate exemplars of the category mammals, but will also derive that dolphins are, at least at one conceptual level, more similar to cats than to sharks, despite their indisputable higher perceptual similarity to the latter. The hippocampal‐entorhinal system, classically known for its involvement in relational and inferential memory, is a likely candidate to construct and hold these complex relational structures between concepts. To test this hypothesis, we trained healthy human adults to organize a novel audio‐visual object space into categories labeled with novel words. Crucially, a hierarchical taxonomy existed between the object categories, and participants discovered it via inference during a simple associative object‐to‐word training. Using functional MRI after learning, and a combination of ROI‐based multivariate analyses, we found that both the mid‐anterior hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex represented the inferred hierarchical structure between words: subordinate‐level words were represented more similarly to their related superordinate than to unrelated ones. This was paired, in the entorhinal cortex, by an additional signature of internalized structural representation of nested hierarchy: words referring to subordinate concepts belonging to the same superordinate category were represented more similarly compared with those not belonging to the same superordinate level: interestingly, this similarity was never directly taught to subjects nor it was made explicit during the task, but only indirectly derived through a logical inferential process and, crucially, contrasted the evidence coming from the definitional perceptual properties of the concepts. None of these results were observed before learning, when the same words were not yet semantically organized. A whole‐brain searchlight revealed that the effect in the entorhinal cortex extends to a wider network of areas, encompassing the prefrontal, temporal, and parietal cortices, partially overlapping with the semantic network.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: The unique plasticity of hippocampal adult‐born neurons: Contributing to a heterogeneous dentate</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23318?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
The dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus is evolutionarily conserved as one of the few sites of adult neurogenesis in mammals. Although there is clear evidence that neurogenesis is necessary for healthy hippocampal function, whether adult‐born neurons are simply integrated into existing hippocampal networks to serve a similar purpose to that of developmentally born neurons or whether they represent a discrete cell population with unique functions remains less clear. In this review, we consider evidence for discrete cellular, synaptic, and structural features of adult‐born DG neurons, suggesting that neurogenesis contributes to the formation of a heterogeneous DG. We therefore propose that hippocampal neurogenesis creates a specialized neuronal subpopulation that may play a key role in hippocampal functions like episodic memory. We note critical gaps in this extensive body of work, including a general failure to include female animals in relevant research and a need for more precise consideration of intrahippocampal neuroanatomy.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Long-Lasting Event-Related Beta Synchronizations of Electroencephalographic Activity in Response to Support-Surface Perturbations During Upright Stance: A Pilot Study Associating Beta Rebound and Active Monitoring in the Intermittent Postural Control</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.660434</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Movement related beta band cortical oscillations, including beta rebound after execution and/or suppression of movement, have drawn attention in upper extremity motor control literature. However, fewer studies focused on beta band oscillations during postural control in upright stance. In this preliminary study, we examined beta rebound and other components of electroencephalogram (EEG) activity during perturbed upright stance to investigate supraspinal contributions to postural stabilization. Particularly, we aimed to clarify the timing and duration of beta rebound within a non-sustained, but long-lasting postural recovery process that occurs more slowly compared to upper extremities. To this end, EEG signals were acquired from nine healthy young adults in response to a brief support-surface perturbation, together with the center of pressure, the center of mass and electromyogram (EMG) activities of ankle muscles. Event-related potentials (ERPs) and event-related spectral perturbations were computed from EEG data using the perturbation-onset as a triggering event. After short-latency (&amp;lt;0.3 s) ERPs, our results showed a decrease in high-beta band oscillations (event-related desynchronization), which was followed by a significant increase (event-related synchronization) in the same band, as well as a decrease in theta band oscillations. Unlike during upper extremity motor tasks, the beta rebound in this case was initiated before the postural recovery was completed, and sustained for as long as 3 s with small EMG responses for the first half period, followed by no excessive EMG activities for the second half period. We speculate that those novel characteristics of beta rebound might be caused by slow postural dynamics along a stable manifold of the unstable saddle-type upright equilibrium of the postural control system without active feedback control, but with active monitoring of the postural state, in the framework of the intermittent control.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.677895</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by accumulation of sulfatides in both glial cells and neurons. MLD results from an inherited deficiency of arylsulfatase A (ARSA) and myelin degeneration in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Currently, no effective treatment is available for the most frequent late infantile (LI) form of MLD after symptom onset. The LI form results in rapid neurological degradation and early death. ARSA enzyme must be rapidly and efficiently delivered to brain and spinal cord oligodendrocytes of patients with LI MLD in order to potentially stop the progression of the disease. We previously showed that brain gene therapy with adeno-associated virus serotype rh10 (AAVrh10) driving the expression of human ARSA cDNA alleviated most long-term disease manifestations in MLD mice but was not sufficient in MLD patient to improve disease progression. Herein, we evaluated the short-term effects of intravenous AAVPHP.eB delivery driving the expression of human ARSA cDNA under the control of the cytomegalovirus/b-actin hybrid (CAG) promoter in 6-month-old MLD mice that already show marked sulfatide accumulation and brain pathology. Within 3 months, a single intravenous injection of AAVPHP.eB-hARSA-HA resulted in correction of brain and spinal cord sulfatide storage, and improvement of astrogliosis and microgliosis in brain and spinal cord of treated animals. These results strongly support to consider the use of AAVPHP.eB-hARSA vector for intravenous gene therapy in symptomatic rapidly progressing forms of MLD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: CircRNA-ceRNA Network Revealing the Potential Regulatory Roles of CircRNA in Alzheimer’s Disease Involved the cGMP-PKG Signal Pathway</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.665788</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disease. The characteristic pathologies include extracellular senile plaques formed by β-amyloid protein deposition, neurofibrillary tangles formed by hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, and neuronal loss with glial cell hyperplasia. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are rich in miRNA-binding sites (miRNA response elements, MREs), which serve as miRNA sponges or competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). Although several research groups have identified dysregulated circRNAs in the cerebral cortex of SAMP8 mice or APP/PS1 mice using deep RNA-seq analysis, we need to further explore circRNA expression patterns, targets, functions and the signaling pathways involved in the pathogenesis of AD and in particular the hippocampal circRNA expression profiles in AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We used deep RNA sequencing to investigate circRNA-ceRNA network patterns in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In our study, 70 dysregulated circRNAs, 39 dysregulated miRNAs and 121 dysregulated mRNAs were identified between the APP/PS1 group and the wild-type group at 8 months in the hippocampus of the mice. Through correlation analysis, we identified 11 dysregulated circRNAs, 7 dysregulated miRNAs and 8 dysregulated mRNAs forming 16 relationships in the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network. Gene ontology (GO) analysis indicated that the dysregulated circRNAs were most enriched in biological metabolic processes. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed that the dysregulation of circRNAs was enriched in the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway, cAMP signaling pathway, Hippo signaling pathway, platelet activation, long-term potentiation and axon guidance. In addition, our findings preliminarily verified that the novel_circ_0003012/mmu-miR-298-3p/Smoc2 signaling axis may regulate the pathophysiology of AD by affecting the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: These newly identified circRNAs in networks and signaling pathways reveal potential diagnostic or therapeutic targets for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Mental syndromes such as anxiety and depression are common comorbidities in patients with chronic insomnia disorder (CID). The locus coeruleus noradrenergic (LC-NE) system is considered to be crucial for modulation of emotion and sleep/wake cycle. LC-NE system is also a critical mediator of the stress-induced anxiety. However, whether the LC-NE system contributes to the underlying mechanism linking insomnia and these comorbidities remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the LC-NE system alterations in patients with insomnia and its relationship with depression and anxiety symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;Materials and Methods&lt;p&gt;Seventy patients with CID and 63 matched good sleep control (GSC) subjects were recruited and underwent resting-state functional MRI scan. LC-NE functional network was constructed by using seed-based functional connectivity (FC) analysis. The alterations in LC-NE FC network in patients with CID and their clinical significance was explored.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Compared with GSC group, the CID group showed decreased left LC-NE FC in the left inferior frontal gyrus, while they had increased LC-NE FC in the left supramarginal gyrus and the left middle occipital gyrus (MOG). For the right LC-NE FC network, decreased FC was found in left dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Interesting, the increased LC-NE FC was located in sensory cortex, while decreased LC-NE FC was located in frontal control cortex. In addition, the FC between the left LC and left MOG was associated with the duration of the disease, while abnormal FC between right LC and left dACC was associated with the anxiety scores in patients with CID.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The present study found abnormal LC-NE functional network in patients with CID, and the altered LC-NE function in dACC was associated with anxiety symptoms in CID. The present study substantially extended our understanding of the neuropathological basis of CID and provided the potential treatment target for CID patients who also had anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Simultaneous CMOS-Based Imaging of Calcium Signaling of the Central Amygdala and the Dorsal Raphe Nucleus During Nociception in Freely Moving Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.667708</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fluorescence imaging devices have been indispensable in elucidating the workings of the brain in living animals, including unrestrained, active ones. Various devices are available, each with their own strengths and weaknesses in terms of many factors. We have developed CMOS-based needle-type imaging devices that are small and lightweight enough to be doubly implanted in freely moving mice. The design also allowed angled implantations to avoid critical areas. We demonstrated the utility of the devices by using them on GCaMP6 mice in a formalin test experiment. Simultaneous implantations to the capsular-lateral central amygdala (CeLC) and dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) were proven to be safe and did not hinder the execution of the study. Analysis of the collected calcium signaling data, supported by behavior data, showed increased activity in both regions as a result of pain stimulation. Thus, we have successfully demonstrated the various advantages of the device in its application in the pain experiment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Energy-Period Profiles of Brain Networks in Group fMRI Resting-State Data: A Comparison of Empirical Mode Decomposition With the Short-Time Fourier Transform and the Discrete Wavelet Transform</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.663403</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, functional networks in resting-state data were investigated with linear Fourier and wavelet-related methods to characterize their frequency content by relying on pre-specified frequency bands. In this study, Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), an adaptive time-frequency method, is used to investigate the naturally occurring frequency bands of resting-state data obtained by Group Independent Component Analysis. Specifically, energy-period profiles of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) obtained by EMD are created and compared for different resting-state networks. These profiles have a characteristic distribution for many resting-state networks and are related to the frequency content of each network. A comparison with the linear Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and the Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform (MODWT) shows that EMD provides a more frequency-adaptive representation of different types of resting-state networks. Clustering of resting-state networks based on the energy-period profiles leads to clusters of resting-state networks that have a monotone relationship with frequency and energy. This relationship is strongest with EMD, intermediate with MODWT, and weakest with STFT. The identification of these relationships suggests that EMD has significant advantages in characterizing brain networks compared to STFT and MODWT. In a clinical application to early Parkinson’s disease (PD) vs. normal controls (NC), energy and period content were studied for several common resting-state networks. Compared to STFT and MODWT, EMD showed the largest differences in energy and period between PD and NC subjects. Using a support vector machine, EMD achieved the highest prediction accuracy in classifying NC and PD subjects among STFT, MODWT, and EMD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Early-Stage Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Altered Posterior–Anterior Cerebrum Effective Connectivity in Methylazoxymethanol Acetate Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.652715</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The aim of the current resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was to investigate the potential mechanism of schizophrenia through the posterior–anterior cerebrum imbalance in methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) rats and to evaluate the effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) as an early-stage intervention. The rats were divided into four groups: the MAM-sham group, vehicle-sham group, MAM-rTMS group, and vehicle-rTMS group. The rTMS treatment was targeted in the visual cortex (VC) in adolescent rats. Granger Causality Analysis (GCA) was used to evaluate the effective connectivity between regions of interest. Results demonstrated a critical right VC–nucleus accumbens (Acb)–orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) pathway in MAM rats; significant differences of effective connectivity (EC) were found between MAM-sham and vehicle-sham groups (from Acb shell to OFC: t = −2.553, p = 0.021), MAM-rTMS and MAM-sham groups (from VC to Acb core: t = −2.206, p = 0.043; from Acb core to OFC: t = 4.861, p &amp;lt; 0.001; from Acb shell to OFC: t = 4.025, p = 0.001), and MAM-rTMS and vehicle-rTMS groups (from VC to Acb core: t = −2.482, p = 0.025; from VC to Acb shell: t = −2.872, p = 0.012; from Acb core to OFC: t = 4.066, p = 0.001; from Acb shell to OFC: t = 3.458, p = 0.004) in the right hemisphere. Results of the early-stage rTMS intervention revealed that right nucleus accumbens played the role as a central hub, and VC was a potentially novel rTMS target region during adolescent schizophrenia. Moreover, the EC of right nucleus accumbens shell and orbitofrontal cortex was demonstrated to be a potential biomarker. To our knowledge, this was the first resting-state fMRI study using GCA to assess the deficits of a visual-reward neural pathway and the effectiveness of rTMS treatment in MAM rats. More randomized controlled trials in both animal models and schizophrenia patients are needed to further elucidate the disease characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Sweat the Fall Stuff: Physical Activity Moderates the Association of White Matter Hyperintensities With Falls Risk in Older Adults</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.671464</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Falls in older adults are a major public health problem. White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are highly prevalent in older adults and are a risk factor for falls. In the absence of a cure for WMHs, identifying potential strategies to counteract the risk of WMHs on falls are of great importance. Physical activity (PA) is a promising countermeasure to reduce both WMHs and falls risk. However, no study has yet investigated whether PA attenuates the association of WMHs with falls risk. We hypothesized that PA moderates the association between WMHs and falls risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Seventy-six community-dwelling older adults aged 70–80 years old were included in this cross-sectional study. We indexed PA using the Physical Activity Score for the Elderly (PASE) Questionnaire. Falls risk was assessed using the Physiological Profile Assessment (PPA), and WMH volume (mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) was determined by an experienced radiologist on T2-weighted and PD-weighted MRI scans. We first examined the independent associations of WMH volume and PASE score with PPA. Subsequently, we examined whether PASE moderated the relationship between WMH volume and PPA. We plotted simple slopes to interpret the interaction effects. Age, sex, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score were included as covariates in all models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Participants had a mean age of 74 years (SD = 3 years) and 54 (74%) were female. Forty-nine participants (66%) had a Fazekas score of 1, 19 (26%) had a score of 2, and 6 (8%) a score of 3. Both PASE (β = −0.26 ± 0.11; p = 0.022) and WMH volume (β = 0.23 ± 0.11; p = 0.043) were each independently associated with PPA score. The interaction model indicated that PASE score moderated the association between WMH volume and PPA (β = −0.27 ± 0.12; p = 0.030), whereby higher PASE score attenuated the association between WMHs and falls risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: PA is an important moderator of falls risk. Importantly, older adults with WMH can reduce their risk of falls by increasing their PA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Predicting Brain Regions Related to Alzheimer's Disease Based on Global Feature</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.659838</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that commonly affects the elderly; early diagnosis and timely treatment are very important to delay the course of the disease. In the past, most brain regions related to AD were identified based on imaging methods, and only some atrophic brain regions could be identified. In this work, the authors used mathematical models to identify the potential brain regions related to AD. In this study, 20 patients with AD and 13 healthy controls (non-AD) were recruited by the neurology outpatient department or the neurology ward of Peking University First Hospital from September 2017 to March 2019. First, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to construct the brain structural network. Next, the authors set a new local feature index 2hop-connectivity to measure the correlation between different regions. Compared with the traditional graph theory index, 2hop-connectivity exploits the higher-order information of the graph structure. And for this purpose, the authors proposed a novel algorithm called 2hopRWR to measure 2hop-connectivity. Then, a new index global feature score (GFS) based on a global feature was proposed by combing five local features, namely degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, the number of maximal cliques, and 2hop-connectivity, to judge which brain regions are related to AD. As a result, the top ten brain regions identified using the GFS scoring difference between the AD and the non-AD groups were associated to AD by literature verification. The results of the literature validation comparing GFS with the local features showed that GFS was superior to individual local features. Finally, the results of the canonical correlation analysis showed that the GFS was significantly correlated with the scores of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scale and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale. Therefore, the authors believe the GFS can also be used as a new biomarker to assist in diagnosis and objective monitoring of disease progression. Besides, the method proposed in this paper can be used as a differential network analysis method for network analysis in other domains.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Notch3-Dependent Effects on Adult Neurogenesis and Hippocampus-Dependent Learning in a Modified Transgenic Model of CADASIL</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.617733</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We and others have reported that Notch3 is a regulator of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), the most common genetic form of vascular dementia, is caused by mutations in Notch3. The present study intended to investigate whether there is a correlation between altered adult hippocampal neurogenesis and spatial memory performance in CADASIL transgenic mice. To overcome visual disabilities that hampered behavioral testing of the original mice (on an FVB background) we back-crossed the existing TgN3&lt;sup&gt;R169C&lt;/sup&gt; CADASIL mouse model onto the C57BL/6J background. These animals showed an age-dependent increase in the pathognomonic granular osmiophilic material (GOM) deposition in the hippocampus. Analysis in the Morris water maze task at an age of 6 and 12 months revealed deficits in re-learning and perseverance in the CADASIL transgenic mice. Overexpression of Notch3 alone resulted in deficits in the use of spatial strategies and diminished adult neurogenesis in both age groups. The additional CADASIL mutation compensated the effect on strategy usage but not on adult neurogenesis. In brain bank tissue samples from deceased CADASIL patients we found signs of new neurons, as assessed by calretinin immunohistochemistry, but no conclusive quantification was possible. In summary, while our study confirmed the role of Notch3 in adult neurogenesis, we found a specific effect of the CADASIL mutation only on the reversion of the Notch3 effect on behavior, particularly visible at 6 months of age, consistent with a loss of function. The mutation did not revert the Notch3-dependent changes in adult neurogenesis or otherwise affected adult neurogenesis in this model.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a powerful tool for massive detection of DNA sequence variants such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), multi-nucleotide polymorphisms (MNPs) and insertions/deletions (indels). For routine screening of numerous samples, these variants are often converted into cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers which are based on the presence versus absence of restriction sites within PCR products. Current computational tools for SNP to CAPS conversion are limited and usually infeasible to use for large datasets as those generated with NGS. Moreover, there is no available tool for massive conversion of MNPs and indels into CAPS markers. Here, we present VCF2CAPS–a new software for identification of restriction endonucleases that recognize SNP/MNP/indel-containing sequences from NGS experiments. Additionally, the program contains filtration utilities not available in other SNP to CAPS converters–selection of markers with a single polymorphic cut site within a user-specified sequence length, and selection of markers that differentiate up to three user-defined groups of individuals from the analyzed population. Performance of VCF2CAPS was tested on a thoroughly analyzed dataset from a genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) experiment. A selection of CAPS markers picked by the program was subjected to experimental verification. CAPS markers, also referred to as PCR-RFLPs, belong to basic tools exploited in plant, animal and human genetics. Our new software–VCF2CAPS–fills the gap in the current inventory of genetic software by high-throughput CAPS marker design from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. The program should be of interest to geneticists involved in molecular diagnostics. In this paper we show a successful exemplary application of VCF2CAPS and we believe that its usefulness is guaranteed by the growing availability of NGS services.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uDC8hhIenBE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The visual system must make predictions to compensate for inherent delays in its processing. Yet little is known, mechanistically, about how prediction aids natural behaviors. Here, we show that despite a 20-30ms intrinsic processing delay, the vertical motion sensitive (VS) network of the blowfly achieves maximally efficient prediction. This prediction enables the fly to fine-tune its complex, yet brief, evasive flight maneuvers according to its initial ego-rotation at the time of detection of the visual threat. Combining a rich database of behavioral recordings with detailed compartmental modeling of the VS network, we further show that the VS network has axonal gap junctions that are critical for optimal prediction. During evasive maneuvers, a VS subpopulation that directly innervates the neck motor center can convey predictive information about the fly’s future ego-rotation, potentially crucial for ongoing flight control. These results suggest a novel sensory-motor pathway that links sensory prediction to behavior.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8TBlQCb56lA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Many students are taught about genome assembly using the dichotomy between the complexity of finding Eulerian and Hamiltonian cycles (easy versus hard, respectively). This dichotomy is sometimes used to motivate the use of de Bruijn graphs in practice. In this paper, we explain that while de Bruijn graphs have indeed been very useful, the reason has nothing to do with the complexity of the Hamiltonian and Eulerian cycle problems. We give 2 arguments. The first is that a genome reconstruction is never unique and hence an algorithm for finding Eulerian or Hamiltonian cycles is not part of any assembly algorithm used in practice. The second is that even if an arbitrary genome reconstruction was desired, one could do so in linear time in both the Eulerian and Hamiltonian paradigms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AaSxW5SRoR4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Conformational plasticity and dynamic interactions of the N-terminal domain of the chemokine receptor CXCR1</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/ZHuW7BxNtJY/article</link>

The dynamic interactions between G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and their cognate protein partners are central to several cell signaling pathways. For example, the association of CXC chemokine receptor 1 (CXCR1) with its cognate chemokine, interleukin-8 (IL8 or CXCL8) initiates pathways leading to neutrophil-mediated immune responses. The N-terminal domain of chemokine receptors confers ligand selectivity, but unfortunately the conformational dynamics of this intrinsically disordered region remains unresolved. In this work, we have explored the interaction of CXCR1 with IL8 by microsecond time scale coarse-grain simulations, complemented by atomistic models and NMR chemical shift predictions. We show that the conformational plasticity of the &lt;i&gt;apo&lt;/i&gt;-receptor N-terminal domain is restricted upon ligand binding, driving it to an open C-shaped conformation. Importantly, we corroborated the dynamic complex sampled in our simulations against chemical shift perturbations reported by previous NMR studies and show that the trends are similar. Our results indicate that chemical shift perturbation is often not a reporter of residue contacts in such dynamic associations. We believe our results represent a step forward in devising a strategy to understand intrinsically disordered regions in GPCRs and how they acquire functionally important conformational ensembles in dynamic protein-protein interfaces.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZHuW7BxNtJY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The adaptive immune system serves as a potent and highly specific defense mechanism against pathogen infection. One component of this system, the effector T cell, facilitates pathogen clearance upon detection of specific antigens by the T cell receptor (TCR). A critical process in effector T cell activation is transmission of signals from the TCR to a key transcriptional regulator, NF-κB. The transmission of this signal involves a highly dynamic process in which helical filaments of Bcl10, a key protein constituent of the TCR signaling cascade, undergo competing processes of polymeric assembly and macroautophagy-dependent degradation. Through computational analysis of three-dimensional, super-resolution optical micrographs, we quantitatively characterize TCR-stimulated Bcl10 filament assembly and length dynamics, and demonstrate that filaments become shorter over time. Additionally, we develop an image-based, bootstrap-like resampling method that demonstrates the preferred association between autophagosomes and both Bcl10-filament ends and punctate-Bcl10 structures, implying that autophagosome-driven macroautophagy is directly responsible for Bcl10 filament shortening. We probe Bcl10 polymerization-depolymerization dynamics with a stochastic Monte-Carlo simulation of nucleation-limited filament assembly and degradation, and we show that high probabilities of filament nucleation in response to TCR engagement could provide the observed robust, homogeneous, and tunable response dynamic. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the speed of filament disassembly preferentially at filament ends provides effective regulatory control. Taken together, these data suggest that Bcl10 filament growth and degradation act as an excitable system that provides a digital response mechanism and the reliable timing critical for T cell activation and regulatory processes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/V-_mpr38Fp8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Extracellular DJ-1 induces sterile inflammation in the ischemic brain</title>

Inflammation is implicated in the onset and progression of various diseases, including cerebral pathologies. Here, we report that DJ-1, which plays a role within cells as an antioxidant protein, functions as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) and triggers inflammation if released from dead cells into the extracellular space. We first found that recombinant DJ-1 protein induces the production of various inflammatory cytokines in bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMMs) and dendritic cells (BMDCs). We further identified a unique peptide sequence in the αG and αH helices of DJ-1 that activates Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4. In the ischemic brain, DJ-1 is released into the extracellular space from necrotic neurons within 24 h after stroke onset and makes direct contact with TLR2 and TLR4 in infiltrating myeloid cells. Although DJ-1 deficiency in a murine model of middle cerebral artery occlusion did not attenuate neuronal injury, the inflammatory cytokine expression in infiltrating immune cells was significantly decreased. Next, we found that the administration of an antibody to neutralize extracellular DJ-1 suppressed cerebral post-ischemic inflammation and attenuated ischemic neuronal damage. Our results demonstrate a previously unknown function of DJ-1 as a DAMP and suggest that extracellular DJ-1 could be a therapeutic target to prevent inflammation in tissue injuries and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/zsBOh2aXGow&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: A causal role for the pulvinar in coordinating task‐independent cortico‐cortical interactions</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25193?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
The pulvinar is the largest nucleus in the primate thalamus and has topographically organized connections with multiple cortical areas, thereby forming extensive cortico‐pulvino‐cortical input‐output loops. Neurophysiological studies have suggested a role for these transthalamic pathways in regulating information transmission between cortical areas. However, evidence for a causal role of the pulvinar in regulating cortico‐cortical interactions is sparse and it is not known whether pulvinar's influences on cortical networks are task‐dependent or, alternatively, reflect more basic large‐scale network properties that maintain functional connectivity across networks regardless of active task demands. In the current study, under passive viewing conditions, we conducted simultaneous electrophysiological recordings from ventral (area V4) and dorsal (LIP) nodes of macaque visual system, while reversibly inactivating the dorsal part of lateral pulvinar (dPL), which shares common anatomical connectivity with V4 and LIP, to probe a causal role of the pulvinar. Our results show a significant reduction in local field potential phase coherence between LIP and V4 in low frequencies (4‐15 Hz) following muscimol injection into dPL. At the local level, no significant changes in firing rates or LFP power were observed in LIP or in V4 following dPL inactivation. Synchronization between pulvinar spikes and cortical LFP phase decreased in low frequencies (4‐15 Hz) both in LIP and V4, while the low frequency synchronization between LIP spikes and pulvinar phase increased. These results indicate a causal role for pulvinar in synchronizing neural activity between interconnected cortical nodes of a large‐scale network, even in the absence of an active task state.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders typically characterized by recurrent and uncontrollable seizures, which seriously affects the quality of life of epilepsy patients. The effective tool utilized in the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy is the Electroencephalogram (EEG). The emergence of machine learning promotes the development of automated epilepsy detection techniques. New algorithms are continuously introduced to shorten the detection time and improve classification accuracy. This minireview summarized the latest research of epilepsy detection techniques that focused on acquiring, preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification of epileptic EEG signals. The application of seizure prediction and localization based on EEG signals in the diagnosis of epilepsy was also introduced. And then, the future development trend of epilepsy detection technology has prospected at the end of the article.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.683527</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Currently, the management of acute and chronic pain in clinical practice remains unsatisfactory due to the existence of limited effective treatments, and novel therapeutic strategies for pathological pain are urgently needed. In the past few decades, the role of serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1) in the development of pain and diurnal rhythms has been implicated in numerous studies. The expression levels of SGK1 mRNA and protein were found to be elevated in the spinal cord and brain in various pathological pain models. Blocking SGK1 significantly attenuated pain-like responses and the development of pathological pain. These studies provide strong evidence that SGK1 plays a role in the development of various types of pathological pain and that targeting SGK1 may be a novel therapeutic strategy for pain management. In this review article, we provide evidence from animal models for the potential role of SGK1 in the regulation of pathological pain caused by inflammation, nerve injury, psychiatric disorders, and chronic opioid exposure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.670303</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Due to the relatively small number of neurons (few tens of thousands), the well-established multipurpose model organism Lymnaea stagnalis, great pond snail, has been extensively used to study the functioning of the nervous system. Unlike the more complex brains of higher organisms, L. stagnalis has a relatively simple central nervous system (CNS) with well-defined circuits (e.g., feeding, locomotion, learning, and memory) and identified individual neurons (e.g., cerebral giant cell, CGC), which generate behavioral patterns. Accumulating information from electrophysiological experiments maps the network of neuronal connections and the neuronal circuits responsible for basic life functions. Chemical signaling between synaptic-coupled neurons is underpinned by neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. This review looks at the rapidly expanding contributions of mass spectrometry (MS) to neuropeptide discovery and identification at different granularity of CNS organization. Abundances and distributions of neuropeptides in the whole CNS, eleven interconnected ganglia, neuronal clusters, single neurons, and subcellular compartments are captured by MS imaging and single cell analysis techniques. Combining neuropeptide expression and electrophysiological data, and aided by genomic and transcriptomic information, the molecular basis of CNS-controlled biological functions is increasingly revealed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.582497</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Research on microglia has established the differentiation between the so-called M1 and M2 phenotypes. However, new frameworks have been proposed attempting to discern between meaningful microglia profiles. We have set up an in vitro microglial activation model by adding an injured spinal cord (SCI) lysate to microglial cultures, obtained from postnatal rats, in order to mimic the environment of the spinal cord after injury. We found that under the presence of the SCI lysate microglial cells changed their phenotype, developing less ramified but longer processes, and proliferated. The SCI lysate also led to upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, downregulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-4, and a biphasic profile of iNOS. In addition, a latex beads phagocytosis assay revealed the SCI lysate stimulated the phagocytic capacity of microglia. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that microglial cells showed a pro-inflammatory profile in the presence of SCI lysate. Finally, characterization of the microglial activation in the spinal cord on day 7 after contusion injury, we showed that these cells have a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Overall, these results indicate that the use of SCI lysates could be a useful tool to skew microglia towards a closer phenotype to that observed after the spinal cord contusion injury than the use of LPS or IFNγ.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2021.619160</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer’s disease. It is a chronic and progressive disorder estimated to affect at least 4 million people worldwide. Although the etiology of PD remains unclear, it has been found that the dysfunction of synaptic vesicle endocytosis (SVE) in neural terminal happens before the loss of dopaminergic neurons. Recently, accumulating evidence reveals that the PD-linked synaptic genes, including DNAJC6, SYNJ1, and SH3GL2, significantly contribute to the disruptions of SVE, which is vital for the pathogenesis of PD. In addition, the proteins encoded by other PD-associated genes such as SNCA, LRRK2, PRKN, and DJ-1 also play key roles in the regulation of SVE. Here we present the facts about SVE-related genes and discussed their potential relevance to the pathogenesis of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Combining Electrostimulation With Fiber Tracking to Stratify the Inferior Fronto-Occipital Fasciculus</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.683348</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) is one of the longest association fiber tracts of the brain. According to the most recent anatomical studies, it may be formed by several layers, suggesting a role in multiple cognitive functions. However, to date, no attempt has been made to dissociate the functional contribution of the IFOF subpathways. In this study, real-time, cortico-subcortical mapping with direct electrostimulation was performed in 111 patients operated on in wide-awake surgery for a right low-grade glioma. Patients performed two behavioral tasks during stimulation, tapping, respectively, mentalizing and visual semantic cognition—two functions supposed to be partly mediated by the IFOF. Responsive white matter sites were first subjected to a clustering analysis to assess potential topological differences in network organization. Then they were used as seeds to generate streamline tractograms based on the HC1021 diffusion dataset (template-based approach). The tractograms obtained for each function were overlapped and contrasted to determine whether some fiber pathways were more frequently involved in one or the other function. The obtained results not only provided strong evidence for a role of the right IFOF in both functions, but also revealed that the tract is dissociable into two functional strata according to a ventral (semantic) and dorsal (mentalizing) compartmentalization. Besides, they showed a high degree of anatomo-functionnal variability across patients in the functional implication of the IFOF, possibly related to symmetrical/hemispheric differences in network organization. Collectively, these findings support the view that the right IFOF is a functionally multi-layered structure, with nevertheless interindividual variations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Knock-Out of Tenascin-C Ameliorates Ischemia-Induced Rod-Photoreceptor Degeneration and Retinal Dysfunction</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.642176</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Retinal ischemia is a common pathomechanism in various eye diseases. Recently, evidence accumulated suggesting that the extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoprotein tenascin-C (Tnc) plays a key role in ischemic degeneration. However, the possible functional role of Tnc in retinal ischemia is not yet known. The aim of our study was to explore retinal function and rod-bipolar/photoreceptor cell degeneration in wild type (WT) and Tnc knock-out (KO) mice after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Therefore, I/R was induced by increasing intraocular pressure in the right eye of wild type (WT I/R) and Tnc KO (KO I/R) mice. The left eye served as untreated control (WT CO and KO CO). Scotopic electroretinogram (ERG) recordings were performed to examine rod-bipolar and rod-photoreceptor cell function. Changes of Tnc, rod-bipolar cells, photoreceptors, retinal structure and apoptotic and synaptic alterations were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, Hematoxylin and Eosin staining, Western blot, and quantitative real time PCR. We found increased Tnc protein levels 3 days after ischemia, while Tnc immunoreactivity decreased after 7 days. Tnc mRNA expression was comparable in the ischemic retina. ERG measurements after 7 days showed lower a-/b-wave amplitudes in both ischemic groups. Nevertheless, the amplitudes in the KO I/R group were higher than in the WT I/R group. We observed retinal thinning in WT I/R mice after 3 and 7 days. Although compared to the KO CO group, retinal thinning was not observed in the KO I/R group until 7 days. The number of PKCα&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; rod-bipolar cells, recoverin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; photoreceptor staining and Prkca and Rcvrn expression were comparable in all groups. However, reduced rhodopsin protein as well as Rho and Gnat1 mRNA expression levels of rod-photoreceptors were found in the WT I/R, but not in the KO I/R retina. Additionally, a lower number of activated caspase 3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells was observed in the KO I/R group. Finally, both ischemic groups displayed enhanced vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGlut1) levels. Collectively, KO mice showed diminished rod-photoreceptor degeneration and retinal dysfunction after I/R. Elevated vGlut1 levels after ischemia could be related to an impaired glutamatergic photoreceptor-bipolar cell signaling and excitotoxicity. Our study provides novel evidence that Tnc reinforces ischemic retinal degeneration, possibly by synaptic remodeling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: A Systematic Review of Glucose Transport Alterations in Alzheimer's Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.626636</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by cerebral glucose hypometabolism. Hypometabolism may be partly due to reduced glucose transport at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and across astrocytic and neuronal cell membranes. Glucose transporters (GLUTs) are integral membrane proteins responsible for moving glucose from the bloodstream to parenchymal cells where it is metabolized, and evidence indicates vascular and non-vascular GLUTs are altered in AD brains, a process which could starve the brain of glucose and accelerate cognitive decline. Here we review the literature on glucose transport alterations in AD from human and rodent studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Literature published between 1st January 1946 and 1st November 2020 within EMBASE and MEDLINE databases was searched for the terms “glucose transporters” AND “Alzheimer's disease”. Human and rodent studies were included while reviews, letters, and in-vitro studies were excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Forty-three studies fitting the inclusion criteria were identified, covering human (23 studies) and rodent (20 studies). Post-mortem studies showed consistent reductions in GLUT1 and GLUT3 in the hippocampus and cortex of AD brains, areas of the brain closely associated with AD pathology. Tracer studies in rodent models of AD and human AD also exhibit reduced uptake of glucose and glucose-analogs into the brain, supporting these findings. Longitudinal rodent studies clearly indicate that changes in GLUT1 and GLUT3 only occur after amyloid-β pathology is present, and several studies indicate amyloid-β itself may be responsible for GLUT changes. Furthermore, evidence from human and rodent studies suggest GLUT depletion has severe effects on brain function. A small number of studies show GLUT2 and GLUT12 are increased in AD. Anti-diabetic medications improved glucose transport capacity in AD subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: GLUT1 and GLUT3 are reduced in hippocampal and cortical regions in patients and rodent models of AD, and may be caused by high levels of amyloid-β in these regions. GLUT3 reductions appear to precede the onset of clinical symptoms. GLUT2 and GLUT12 appear to increase and may have a compensatory role. Repurposing anti-diabetic drugs to modify glucose transport shows promising results in human studies of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Effect of Focal Damage to the Right Medial Posterior Cerebellum on Word and Sentence Comprehension and Production</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.664650</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Functional imaging studies of neurologically intact adults have demonstrated that the right posterior cerebellum is activated during verb generation, semantic processing, sentence processing, and verbal fluency. Studies of patients with cerebellar damage converge to show that the cerebellum supports sentence processing and verbal fluency. However, to date there are no patient studies that investigated the specific importance of the right posterior cerebellum in language processing, because: (i) case studies presented patients with lesions affecting the anterior cerebellum (with or without damage to the posterior cerebellum), and (ii) group studies combined patients with lesions to different cerebellar regions, without specifically reporting the effects of right posterior cerebellar damage. Here we investigated whether damage to the right posterior cerebellum is critical for sentence processing and verbal fluency in four patients with focal stroke damage to different parts of the right posterior cerebellum (all involving Crus II, and lobules VII and VIII). We examined detailed lesion location by going beyond common anatomical definitions of cerebellar anatomy (i.e., according to lobules or vascular territory), and employed a recently proposed functional parcellation of the cerebellum. All four patients experienced language difficulties that persisted for at least a month after stroke but three performed in the normal range within a year. In contrast, one patient with more damage to lobule IX than the other patients had profound long-lasting impairments in the comprehension and repetition of sentences, and the production of spoken sentences during picture description. Spoken and written word comprehension and visual recognition memory were also impaired, however, verbal fluency was within the normal range, together with object naming, visual perception and verbal short-term memory. This is the first study to show that focal damage to the right posterior cerebellum leads to language difficulties after stroke; and that processing impairments persisted in the case with most damage to lobule IX. We discuss these results in relation to current theories of cerebellar contribution to language processing. Overall, our study highlights the need for longitudinal studies of language function in patients with focal damage to different cerebellar regions, with functional imaging to understand the mechanisms that support recovery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Thalamic but Not Subthalamic Neuromodulation Simplifies Word Use in Spontaneous Language</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.656188</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Several investigations have shown language impairments following electrode implantation surgery for Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) in movement disorders. The impact of the actual stimulation, however, differs between DBS targets with further deterioration in formal language tests induced by thalamic DBS in contrast to subtle improvement observed in subthalamic DBS. Here, we studied speech samples from interviews with participants treated with DBS of the thalamic ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) for essential tremor (ET), or the subthalamic nucleus (STN) for Parkinson’s disease (PD), and healthy volunteers (each n = 13). We analyzed word frequency and the use of open and closed class words. Active DBS increased word frequency in case of VIM, but not STN stimulation. Further, relative to controls, both DBS groups produced fewer open class words. Whereas VIM DBS further decreased the proportion of open class words, it was increased by STN DBS. Thus, VIM DBS favors the use of relatively common words in spontaneous language, compatible with the idea of lexical simplification under thalamic stimulation. The absence or even partial reversal of these effects in patients receiving STN DBS is of interest with respect to biolinguistic concepts suggesting dichotomous thalamic vs. basal ganglia roles in language processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Clinical Validation of the Champagne Algorithm for Epilepsy Spike Localization</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.642819</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is increasingly used for presurgical planning in people with medically refractory focal epilepsy. Localization of interictal epileptiform activity, a surrogate for the seizure onset zone whose removal may prevent seizures, is challenging and depends on the use of multiple complementary techniques. Accurate and reliable localization of epileptiform activity from spontaneous MEG data has been an elusive goal. One approach toward this goal is to use a novel Bayesian inference algorithm—the Champagne algorithm with noise learning—which has shown tremendous success in source reconstruction, especially for focal brain sources. In this study, we localized sources of manually identified MEG spikes using the Champagne algorithm in a cohort of 16 patients with medically refractory epilepsy collected in two consecutive series. To evaluate the reliability of this approach, we compared the performance to equivalent current dipole (ECD) modeling, a conventional source localization technique that is commonly used in clinical practice. Results suggest that Champagne may be a robust, automated, alternative to manual parametric dipole fitting methods for localization of interictal MEG spikes, in addition to its previously described clinical and research applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Sex Differences in Anxiety: An Investigation of the Moderating Role of Sex in Performance Monitoring and Attentional Bias to Threat in High Trait Anxious Individuals</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.627589</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Anxiety disorders are more predominant in women than men, however there is a lack of understanding as to what neurocognitive mechanisms drive this sex difference. Recent investigation has found a potential moderating role of sex in the relationship between anxiety and the error related negativity (ERN)—a component of error-monitoring that is prevalent in high anxiety individuals—such that females display a positive relationship between anxiety/worry and ERN amplitude. We strove to further explore the influence of sex on the relationship between trait anxiety and performance monitoring, specifically with ERN, as well as extend this work to include another hallmark of anxiety, attentional bias to threat. To meet this end, participants performed the flanker and dot-probe tasks, respectively. We did not find a significant difference in the relationship between attention bias scores and anxiety for female vs. males participants. Furthermore, ΔERN amplitudes were greater in males compared to females, and males had more positive CRN amplitudes than females. There were no significant associations between ERN or ΔERN with anxiety in both male and female participants. However, there was a significant relationship between CRN amplitudes and trait anxiety in male but not female participants. Given these results, the effect of sex on the relationship between components of performance monitoring—namely the CRN and ERN—and anxiety may be more nuanced than the current understanding. Our study was limited to detecting medium to large sized moderation effects. Our findings may be important for future meta-analysis on sex differences in anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: A Non-spiking Neuron Model With Dynamic Leak to Avoid Instability in Recurrent Networks</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.656401</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recurrent circuitry components are distributed widely within the brain, including both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections. Recurrent neuronal networks have potential stability problems, perhaps a predisposition to epilepsy. More generally, instability risks making internal representations of information unreliable. To assess the inherent stability properties of such recurrent networks, we tested a linear summation, non-spiking neuron model with and without a “dynamic leak”, corresponding to the low-pass filtering of synaptic input current by the RC circuit of the biological membrane. We first show that the output of this neuron model, in either of its two forms, follows its input at a higher fidelity than a wide range of spiking neuron models across a range of input frequencies. Then we constructed fully connected recurrent networks with equal numbers of excitatory and inhibitory neurons and randomly distributed weights across all synapses. When the networks were driven by pseudorandom sensory inputs with varying frequency, the recurrent network activity tended to induce high frequency self-amplifying components, sometimes evident as distinct transients, which were not present in the input data. The addition of a dynamic leak based on known membrane properties consistently removed such spurious high frequency noise across all networks. Furthermore, we found that the neuron model with dynamic leak imparts a network stability that seamlessly scales with the size of the network, conduction delays, the input density of the sensory signal and a wide range of synaptic weight distributions. Our findings suggest that neuronal dynamic leak serves the beneficial function of protecting recurrent neuronal circuitry from the self-induction of spurious high frequency signals, thereby permitting the brain to utilize this architectural circuitry component regardless of network size or recurrency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Differential Contributions of Inhibitory Subnetwork to Visual Cortical Modulations Identified via Computational Model of Working Memory</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.632730</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Extrastriate visual neurons show no firing rate change during a working memory (WM) task in the absence of sensory input, but both αβ oscillations and spike phase locking are enhanced, as is the gain of sensory responses. This lack of change in firing rate is at odds with many models of WM, or attentional modulation of sensory networks. In this article we devised a computational model in which this constellation of results can be accounted for via selective activation of inhibitory subnetworks by a top-down working memory signal. We confirmed the model prediction of selective inhibitory activation by segmenting cells in the experimental neural data into putative excitatory and inhibitory cells. We further found that this inhibitory activation plays a dual role in influencing excitatory cells: it both modulates the inhibitory tone of the network, which underlies the enhanced sensory gain, and also produces strong spike-phase entrainment to emergent network oscillations. Using a phase oscillator model we were able to show that inhibitory tone is principally modulated through inhibitory network gain saturation, while the phase-dependent efficacy of inhibitory currents drives the phase locking modulation. The dual contributions of the inhibitory subnetwork to oscillatory and non-oscillatory modulations of neural activity provides two distinct ways for WM to recruit sensory areas, and has relevance to theories of cortical communication.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: The Face Module Emerged in a Deep Convolutional Neural Network Selectively Deprived of Face Experience</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.626259</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Can we recognize faces with zero experience on faces? This question is critical because it examines the role of experiences in the formation of domain-specific modules in the brain. Investigation with humans and non-human animals on this issue cannot easily dissociate the effect of the visual experience from that of the hardwired domain-specificity. Therefore, the present study built a model of selective deprivation of the experience on faces with a representative deep convolutional neural network, AlexNet, by removing all images containing faces from its training stimuli. This model did not show significant deficits in face categorization and discrimination, and face-selective modules automatically emerged. However, the deprivation reduced the domain-specificity of the face module. In sum, our study provides empirical evidence on the role of nature vs. nurture in developing the domain-specific modules that domain-specificity may evolve from non-specific experience without genetic predisposition, and is further fine-tuned by domain-specific experience.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Imaging the intact brain of awake behaving mice without the dampening effects of anesthesia, has revealed an exceedingly rich repertoire of astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals. Analyzing and interpreting such complex signals pose many challenges. Traditional analyses of fluorescent changes typically rely on manually outlined static region-of-interests, but such analyses fail to capture the intricate spatiotemporal patterns of astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dynamics. Moreover, all astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging data obtained from awake behaving mice need to be interpreted in light of the complex behavioral patterns of the animal. Hence processing multimodal data, including animal behavior metrics, stimulation timings, and electrophysiological signals is needed to interpret astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals. Managing and incorporating these data types into a coherent analysis pipeline is challenging and time-consuming, especially if research protocols change or new data types are added. Here, we introduce Begonia, a MATLAB-based data management and analysis toolbox tailored for the analyses of astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals in conjunction with behavioral data. The analysis suite includes an automatic, event-based algorithm with few input parameters that can capture a high level of spatiotemporal complexity of astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals. The toolbox enables the experimentalist to quantify astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals in a precise and unbiased way and combine them with other types of time series data.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes comprise a heterogeneous cell population characterized by distinct morphologies, protein expression and function. Unlike neurons, astrocytes do not generate action potentials, however, they are electrically dynamic cells with extensive electrophysiological heterogeneity and diversity. Astrocytes are hyperpolarized cells with low membrane resistance. They are heavily involved in the modulation of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and express an array of different voltage-dependent and voltage-independent channels to help with this ion regulation. In addition to these K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels, astrocytes also express several different types of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels; intracellular Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling in astrocytes has been linked to some of their functional properties. The physiological hallmark of astrocytes is their extensive intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling cascades, which vary at the regional, subregional, and cellular levels. In this review article, we highlight the physiological properties of astrocytes and the implications for their function and influence of network and synaptic activity.

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.590537</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Embryonic Dissociated Dorsal Root Ganglia (DRG) cultures are often used to investigate the role of novel molecular pathways or drugs in Schwann cell development and myelination. These cultures largely recapitulate the order of cellular and molecular events that occur in Schwann cells of embryonic nerves. However, the timing of Schwann cell developmental transitions, notably the transition from Schwann Cell Precursors (SCP) to immature Schwann cells (iSC) and then to myelinating Schwann cells, has not been estimated so far in this culture system. In this study, we determined the expression profiles of Schwann cell developmental genes during the first week of culture and then compared our data to the expression profiles of these genes in developing spinal nerves. This helped in identifying that SCP transition into iSC between the 5th and 7th day in vitro. Furthermore, we also investigated the transition of immature cells into pro-myelinating and myelinating Schwann cells upon the induction of myelination in vitro. Our results suggest that Schwann cell differentiation beyond the immature stage can be observed as early as 4 days post the induction of myelination in cocultures. Finally, we compared the myelinating potential of coculture-derived Schwann cell monocultures to cultures established from neonatal sciatic nerves and found that both these culture systems exhibit similar myelinating phenotypes. In effect, our results allow for a better understanding and interpretation of coculture experiments especially in studies that aim to elucidate the role of a novel actor in Schwann cell development and myelination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.678501</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria are essential for neurons and must be optimally distributed along their axon to fulfill local functions. A high density of mitochondria has been observed in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons of an unmyelinated region of the optic nerve, called the glial lamina (GL) in mouse (lamina cribrosa in human). In glaucoma, the world's leading cause of irreversible blindness, the GL is the epicenter of RGC degeneration and is connected to mitochondrial dysfunction. It is generally accepted that the local accumulation of mitochondria in the GL is established due to the higher energy requirement of unmyelinated axons. Here we revisit the connection between mitochondrial positioning and myelin in RGC axons. We show that the high density of mitochondria in the GL is restricted to larger axons and is established before myelination. Thus, contrary to a longstanding belief in the field, the myelination pattern is not responsible for the establishment of the local accumulation of mitochondria in GL axons. Our findings open new research avenues likely critical to understanding the pathophysiology of glaucoma.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Manipulation of the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) pathway has been suggested as a therapeutic approach to treat or prevent vision loss due to retinal disease. In this study, we investigated the effects of deleting one copy of Pten in a well-characterized class of retinal ganglion cells called α-ganglion cells in the mouse retina. In Pten&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt; retinas, α-ganglion cells did not exhibit major changes in their dendritic structure, although most cells developed a few, unusual loop-forming dendrites. By contrast, α-ganglion cells exhibited a significant decrease in heterologous and homologous gap junction mediated cell coupling with other retinal ganglion and amacrine cells. Additionally, the majority of OFF α-ganglion cells (12/18 cells) formed novel coupling to displaced amacrine cells. The number of connexin36 puncta, the predominant connexin that mediates gap junction communication at electrical synapses, was decreased by at least 50% on OFF α-ganglion cells. Reduced and incorrect gap junction connectivity of α-ganglion cells will affect their functional properties and alter visual image processing in the retina. The anomalous connectivity of retinal ganglion cells would potentially limit future therapeutic approaches involving manipulation of the Pten pathway for treating ganglion cell degeneration in diseases like glaucoma, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson’s, and Alzheimer’s diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Predictive Value of Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers for Tap Test Responsiveness in Patients With Suspected Idiopathic Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.665878</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: The value of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for assessing idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) must be determined. This prospective study aimed to reveal the correlation between CSF biomarkers and clinical symptoms of iNPH and the predictive value of these biomarkers for tap test responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Thirty-nine patients with suspected iNPH were recruited, contributed qualified CSF, and underwent a tap test and unified pre- and post-test evaluations of the neurological function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The analysis of biomarkers from the patients’ CSF showed decreased levels of tau and its phosphorylated form, especially in the tap test (+) group. The responsiveness of the tap test was also related to the number of combined symptoms (p &amp;lt; 0.01), and a correlation was found between the end pressure or pressure difference in CSF and tap test responsiveness (p &amp;lt; 0.05). The results of the binary logistic regression analysis showed that P (tap test responsiveness) = 1/1 + e&lt;sup&gt;∧&lt;/sup&gt; − (−5.505 + 55.314 * ratio of p/T-tau − 1.586 * numbers of combined symptoms). The combined indicators (−5.505 + 0.553 * percentage of p/T-tau − 1.586 * numbers of combined symptoms) resulted in the highest sensitivity and specificity of 94.12% and 72.73%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: CSF biomarkers may be assessed to judge tap test responsiveness, which is beneficial for the feasibility of a clinical application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Attention promotes the selection of behaviorally relevant sensory signals from the barrage of sensory information available. Visual attention modulates the gain of neuronal activity in all visual brain areas examined, although magnitudes of gain modulations vary across areas. For example, attention gain magnitudes in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and primary visual cortex (V1) vary tremendously across fMRI measurements in humans and electrophysiological recordings in behaving monkeys. We sought to determine whether these discrepancies are due simply to differences in species or measurement, or more nuanced properties unique to each visual brain area. We also explored whether robust and consistent attention effects, comparable to those measured in humans with fMRI, are observable in the LGN or V1 of monkeys. We measured attentional modulation of multiunit activity in the LGN and V1 of macaque monkeys engaged in a contrast change detection task requiring shifts in covert visual spatial attention. Rigorous analyses of LGN and V1 multiunit activity revealed robust and consistent attentional facilitation throughout V1, with magnitudes comparable to those observed with fMRI. Interestingly, attentional modulation in the LGN was consistently negligible. These findings demonstrate that discrepancies in attention effects are not simply due to species or measurement differences. We also examined whether attention effects correlated with the feature selectivity of recorded multiunits. Distinct relationships suggest that attentional modulation of multiunit activity depends upon the unique structure and function of visual brain areas.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Mechanistic model of nutrient uptake explains dichotomy between marine oligotrophic and copiotrophic bacteria</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/XaITgSK02Sw/article</link>

Marine bacterial diversity is immense and believed to be driven in part by trade-offs in metabolic strategies. Here we consider heterotrophs that rely on organic carbon as an energy source and present a molecular-level model of cell metabolism that explains the dichotomy between copiotrophs—which dominate in carbon-rich environments—and oligotrophs—which dominate in carbon-poor environments—as the consequence of trade-offs between nutrient transport systems. While prototypical copiotrophs, like &lt;i&gt;Vibrios&lt;/i&gt;, possess numerous phosphotransferase systems (PTS), prototypical oligotrophs, such as SAR11, lack PTS and rely on ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, which use binding proteins. We develop models of both transport systems and use them in proteome allocation problems to predict the optimal nutrient uptake and metabolic strategy as a function of carbon availability. We derive a Michaelis–Menten approximation of ABC transport, analytically demonstrating how the half-saturation concentration is a function of binding protein abundance. We predict that oligotrophs can attain nanomolar half-saturation concentrations using binding proteins with only micromolar dissociation constants and while closely matching transport and metabolic capacities. However, our model predicts that this requires large periplasms and that the slow diffusion of the binding proteins limits uptake. Thus, binding proteins are critical for oligotrophic survival yet severely constrain growth rates. We propose that this trade-off fundamentally shaped the divergent evolution of oligotrophs and copiotrophs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XaITgSK02Sw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Sensory modulation of gait characteristics in human locomotion: A neuromusculoskeletal modeling study</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/crkSx4K-c9M/article</link>

The central nervous system of humans and other animals modulates spinal cord activity to achieve several locomotion behaviors. Previous neuromechanical models investigated the modulation of human gait changing selected parameters belonging to CPGs (Central Pattern Generators) feedforward oscillatory structures or to feedback reflex circuits. CPG-based models could replicate slow and fast walking by changing only the oscillation’s properties. On the other hand, reflex-based models could achieve different behaviors through optimizations of large dimensional parameter spaces. However, they could not effectively identify individual key reflex parameters responsible for gait characteristics’ modulation. This study investigates which reflex parameters modulate the gait characteristics through neuromechanical simulations. A recently developed reflex-based model is used to perform optimizations with different target behaviors on speed, step length, and step duration to analyze the correlation between reflex parameters and their influence on these gait characteristics. We identified nine key parameters that may affect the target speed ranging from slow to fast walking (0.48 and 1.71 m/s) as well as a large range of step lengths (0.43 and 0.88 m) and step duration (0.51, 0.98 s). The findings show that specific reflexes during stance significantly affect step length regulation, mainly given by positive force feedback of the ankle plantarflexors’ group. On the other hand, stretch reflexes active during swing of iliopsoas and gluteus maximus regulate all the gait characteristics under analysis. Additionally, the results show that the hamstrings’ group’s stretch reflex during the landing phase is responsible for modulating the step length and step duration. Additional validation studies in simulations demonstrated that the modulation of identified reflexes is sufficient to regulate the investigated gait characteristics. Thus, this study provides an overview of possible reflexes involved in modulating speed, step length, and step duration of human gaits.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/crkSx4K-c9M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Protected areas are the flagship management tools to secure biodiversity from anthropogenic impacts. However, the extent to which adjacent areas with distinct protection levels host different species numbers and compositions remains uncertain. Here, using reef fishes, European alpine plants, and North American birds, we show that the composition of species in adjacent Strictly Protected, Restricted, and Non-Protected areas is highly dissimilar, whereas the number of species is similar, after controlling for environmental conditions, sample size, and rarity. We find that between 12% and 15% of species are only recorded in Non-Protected areas, suggesting that a non-negligible part of regional biodiversity occurs where human activities are less regulated. For imperiled species, the proportion only recorded in Strictly Protected areas reaches 58% for fishes, 11% for birds, and 7% for plants, highlighting the fundamental and unique role of protected areas and their environmental conditions in biodiversity conservation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/MMx7Ri4DYdU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Immature wild orangutans acquire relevant ecological knowledge through sex-specific attentional biases during social learning</title>

As a part of growing up, immature orangutans must acquire vast repertoires of skills and knowledge, a process that takes several years of observational social learning and subsequent practice. Adult female and male orangutans show behavioral differences including sex-specific foraging patterns and male-biased dispersal. We investigated how these differing life trajectories affect social interest and emerging ecological knowledge in immatures. We analyzed 15 years of detailed observational data on social learning, associations, and diet repertoires of 50 immatures (16 females and 34 males), from 2 orangutan populations. Specific to the feeding context, we found sex differences in the development of social interest: Throughout the dependency period, immature females direct most of their social attention at their mothers, whereas immature males show an increasing attentional preference for individuals other than their mothers. When attending to non-mother individuals, males show a significant bias toward immigrant individuals and a trend for a bias toward adult males. In contrast, females preferentially attend to neighboring residents. Accordingly, by the end of the dependency period, immature females show a larger dietary overlap with their mothers than do immature males. These results suggest that immature orangutans show attentional biases through which they learn from individuals with the most relevant ecological knowledge. Diversifying their skills and knowledge likely helps males when they move to a new area. In sum, our findings underline the importance of fine-grained social inputs for the acquisition of ecological knowledge and skills in orangutans and likely in other apes as well.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/CYdfs1p74LI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Meta-analysis of variation suggests that embracing variability improves both replicability and generalizability in preclinical research</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Takuji Usui, Malcolm R. Macleod, Sarah K. McCann, Alistair M. Senior, Shinichi Nakagawa&lt;/p&gt;

The replicability of research results has been a cause of increasing concern to the scientific community. The long-held belief that experimental standardization begets replicability has also been recently challenged, with the observation that the reduction of variability within studies can lead to idiosyncratic, lab-specific results that cannot be replicated. An alternative approach is to, instead, deliberately introduce heterogeneity, known as “heterogenization” of experimental design. Here, we explore a novel perspective in the heterogenization program in a meta-analysis of variability in observed phenotypic outcomes in both control and experimental animal models of ischemic stroke. First, by quantifying interindividual variability across control groups, we illustrate that the amount of heterogeneity in disease state (infarct volume) differs according to methodological approach, for example, in disease induction methods and disease models. We argue that such methods may improve replicability by creating diverse and representative distribution of baseline disease state in the reference group, against which treatment efficacy is assessed. Second, we illustrate how meta-analysis can be used to simultaneously assess efficacy and stability (i.e., mean effect and among-individual variability). We identify treatments that have efficacy and are generalizable to the population level (i.e., low interindividual variability), as well as those where there is high interindividual variability in response; for these, latter treatments translation to a clinical setting may require nuance. We argue that by embracing rather than seeking to minimize variability in phenotypic outcomes, we can motivate the shift toward heterogenization and improve both the replicability and generalizability of preclinical research.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Cqv0I8hcBks&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Reconstruction of nitrergic neurons (NN) found in one section of the representation of the forepaw of the rat in different cortical compartments in somatosensory area S1 and motor area M1. NN are more densely packed in the upper layers (I‐III) and more sparsely distributed in layer V. Scale bar: 100 μm.







Abstract
Nitrergic neurons (NNs) are inhibitory neurons capable of releasing nitric oxide (NO) that are labeled with NADPHd histochemistry. The rat primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortices are a favorable model to investigate NN populations by comparing their morphology, since these areas share the border of forepaw representation. The distribution of the type I NN of the forepaw representation in the S1 and M1 cortices of the rat in different laminar compartments and the morphological parameters related to the cell body and dendritic arborization were measured and compared. We observed that the neuronal density in the S1 (130 NN/mm3) was higher than the neuronal density in the M1 (119 NN/mm3). Most NN neurons were multipolar (S1 with 58%; M1 with 69%), and a minority of the NN neurons were horizontal (S1 with 6%; M1 with 12%). NN found in S1 had a higher verticality index than NN found in M1, and no significant differences were observed for the other morphological parameters. We also demonstrated significant differences in most of the morphological parameters of the NN between different cortical compartments of S1 and M1. Our results indicate that the NN of the forepaw in S1 and M1 corresponds to a neuronal population, where the functionality is independent of the different types of sensory and motor processing. However, the morphological differences found between the cortical compartments of S1 and M1, as well as the higher density of NNs found in S1, indicate that the release of NO varies between the areas.

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Parafacial neurons in the human brainstem express specific markers for neurons of the retrotrapezoid nucleus</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25191?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Relying on duplex in situ hybridization, targeting PPGAL (pre‐pro‐galanin) and SLC17A6 mRNAs, neurons of the human retrotrapezoid nucleus were identified within the parafacial region of the brainstem. NeuromedinB (NMB), suggested as being a specific marker of RTN neurons in mice by others, was not convincing in our anatomical study, but could benefit from more thorough investigations.







ABSTRACT
The retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) is a hub for respiratory chemoregulation in the mammal brainstem that integrates chemosensory information from peripheral sites and central relays. Chemosensitive neurons of the RTN express specific genetic and molecular determinants which have been used to identify RTN precise location within the brainstem of rodents and non‐human primates. Based on a comparative approach, we hypothesized that among mammals, neurons exhibiting the same specific molecular and genetic signature would have the same function. The co‐expression of preprogalanin (PPGAL) and SLC17A6 (VGluT2) mRNAs with duplex in situ hybridization has been studied in formalin fixed paraffin‐embedded postmortem human brainstems. Two specimens were processed and analyzed in line with RTN descriptions in adult rats and macaques. Double‐labeled PPGAL+/SLC17A6+ neurons were only identified in the parafacial region of the brainstem. These neurons were found surrounding the nucleus of the facial nerve, located ventrally to the nucleus VII on caudal sections, and slightly more dorsally on rostral sections. The expression of neuromedin B (NMB) mRNA as a single marker of chemosensitive RTN neurons has not been confirmed in humans.
The location of the RTN in human adults is provided. This should help to develop investigation tools combining anatomic high‐resolution imaging and respiratory functional investigations to explore the pathogenic role of the RTN in congenital or acquired neurodegenerative diseases.

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Dopamine Neurons That Cotransmit Glutamate, From Synapses to Circuits to Behavior</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.665386</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Discovered just over 20 years ago, dopamine neurons have the ability to cotransmit both dopamine and glutamate. Yet, the functional roles of dopamine neuron glutamate cotransmission and their implications for therapeutic use are just emerging. This review article encompasses the current body of evidence investigating the functions of dopamine neurons of the ventral midbrain that cotransmit glutamate. Since its discovery in dopamine neuron cultures, further work in vivo confirmed dopamine neuron glutamate cotransmission across species. From there, growing interest has led to research related to neural functioning including roles in synaptic signaling, development, and behavior. Functional connectome mapping reveals robust connections in multiple forebrain regions to various cell types, most notably to cholinergic interneurons in both the medial shell of the nucleus accumbens and the lateral dorsal striatum. Glutamate markers in dopamine neurons reach peak levels during embryonic development and increase in response to various toxins, suggesting dopamine neuron glutamate cotransmission may serve neuroprotective roles. Findings from behavioral analyses reveal prominent roles for dopamine neuron glutamate cotransmission in responses to psychostimulants, in positive valence and cognitive systems and for subtle roles in negative valence systems. Insight into dopamine neuron glutamate cotransmission informs the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders such as addiction, schizophrenia and Parkinson Disease, with therapeutic implications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

N&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-methyladenosine (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A), the addition of methyl groups to adenine residues, is the most abundant and well understood RNA modification. The current review discusses the regulatory mechanisms governing m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A, how this influences neuronal development and function and how aberrant m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A signaling may contribute to neurological disease. M&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A is known to regulate the stability of mRNA, the processing of microRNAs and function/processing of tRNAs among other roles. The development of antibodies against m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A has facilitated the application of next generation sequencing to profile methylated RNAs in both health and disease contexts, revealing the extent of this transcriptomic modification. The mechanisms by which m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A is deposited, processed, and potentially removed are increasingly understood. Writer enzymes include METTL3 and METTL14 while YTHDC1 and YTHDF1 are key reader proteins, which recognize and bind the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A mark. Finally, FTO and ALKBH5 have been identified as potential erasers of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A, although there in vivo activity and the dynamic nature of this modification requires further study. M&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A is enriched in the brain and has emerged as a key regulator of neuronal activity and function in processes including neurodevelopment, learning and memory, synaptic plasticity, and the stress response. Changes to m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A have recently been linked with Schizophrenia and Alzheimer disease. Elucidating the functional consequences of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A changes in these and other brain diseases may lead to novel insight into disease pathomechanisms, molecular biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Impaired Adaptation and Laminar Processing of the Oddball Paradigm in the Primary Visual Cortex of Fmr1 KO Mouse</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.668230</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Both adaptation and novelty detection are an integral part of sensory processing. Recent animal oddball studies have advanced our understanding of circuitry underlying contextual processing in early sensory areas. However, it is unclear how adaptation and mismatch (MM) responses depend on the tuning properties of neurons and their laminar position. Furthermore, given that reduced habituation and sensory overload are among the hallmarks of altered sensory perception in autism, we investigated how oddball processing might be altered in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome (FX). Using silicon probe recordings and a novel spatial frequency (SF) oddball paradigm, we discovered that FX mice show reduced adaptation and enhanced MM responses compared to control animals. Specifically, we found that adaptation is primarily restricted to neurons with preferred oddball SF in FX compared to WT mice. Mismatch responses, on the other hand, are enriched in the superficial layers of WT animals but are present throughout lamina in FX animals. Last, we observed altered neural dynamics in FX mice in response to stimulus omissions. Taken together, we demonstrated that reduced feature adaptation coexists with impaired laminar processing of oddball responses, which might contribute to altered sensory perception in FX syndrome and autism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Dynamic Changes of Arc Expression in Dorsal Striatum of Mice After Self-Administration of Sucrose</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.654521</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Region-specific plasticity in the striatal circuit plays an important role in the development and long-term maintenance of skills and sequential movement procedures. Studies investigating the molecular substrates that contribute to the plasticity changes during motor skill processes have documented a transition in expression from the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) to the dorsolateral striatum (DLS); however, few studies have explored the expression pattern of molecular substrates in the dorsal striatum during progression of instrumental learning. To address this issue, the activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) expressions in the subregional dorsal striatum were analyzed during the early and late learning phases of the 10-day sucrose self-administration process. We found that Arc protein is primarily detected in the DMS only in the initial learning stage; however, it is expressed in the DLS during both early and late learning stages. Moreover, Arc expression in the DMS correlated with the number of rewards received later in the training. These data indicated that the Arc expression in subregions of the dorsal striatum shows region-specific transfer and that Arc expression in the DMS contributes to obtaining reward in later learning stage during the process of instrumental learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Integrative Analysis of lncRNA and mRNA and Profiles in Postoperative Delirium Patients</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.665935</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Delirium is a common serious complication that often occurs after major surgery. The goals of this study were to explore the expression profiles and functional networks of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and mRNAs in patients of postoperative delirium (POD). Microarray analysis was performed on the peripheral blood samples to identify differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs and mRNAs in 4 POD patients and 4 non-POD volunteers. DE lncRNAs and mRNAs were validated by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). Bioinformatic analyses were performed to identify the critical biological functions and signaling pathways involved in POD. A total of 1195 DE lncRNAs and 735 DE mRNAs were identified between the POD and non-POD groups. Verified by the RT-qPCR, we identified 14 DE lncRNAs that may relate to the pathogenesis of POD. These 14 DE lncRNAs play important regulatory roles in “glutamate and 5-hydroxytryptamine,” “synaptotagmin 7,” “transient receptor potential channel,” “interleukin-2 production.” There was a regulatory relationship between lncRNA ENST00000530057 and synaptotagmin (Syt) 7 mRNA. The mRNA level of PCLO was up-regulated in POD group. This study showed abundant DE lncRNAs and mRNAs in POD that might help in deciphering the disease pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;The objective of the study was to explore patterns of white matter (WM) alteration in preclinical stage familial Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (fCJD) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Seven asymptomatic carriers of the PRNP G114V mutation and six non-carriers were recruited from the same fCJD kindred and follow-up obtained from all asymptomatic carriers and two non-carriers 2 years later. Overlapping WM patterns were also explored in asymptomatic carriers and symptomatic CJD patients. All participants underwent clinical and neuropsychological assessments and DTI at baseline and follow-up. DTI data were subjected to whole-brain voxel-wise analysis of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) in WM using tract-based spatial statistics. Three comparisons were conducted: baseline carriers against non-carriers (baseline analysis), changes after 2 years in carriers (follow-up analysis), and differences between patients with symptomatic CJD and healthy controls (CJD patient analysis).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Neither carriers nor non-carriers developed any neurological symptoms during 2 years of follow-up. Baseline analysis showed no differences between the carrier and non-carrier groups in MD and FA. Follow-up analysis showed significantly increased MD in multiple WM tracts, among which increased MD in the bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus, bilateral anterior thalamic radiation, bilateral cingulate gyrus, and left uncinate fasciculus overlapped the patterns observed in patients with symptomatic CJD.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Changes in integrity within multiple WM tracts can be detected during the preclinical stage of fCJD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Language Impairment in Alzheimer’s Disease—Robust and Explainable Evidence for AD-Related Deterioration of Spontaneous Speech Through Multilingual Machine Learning</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.642033</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a pervasive neurodegenerative disease that affects millions worldwide and is most prominently associated with broad cognitive decline, including language impairment. Picture description tasks are routinely used to monitor language impairment in AD. Due to the high amount of manual resources needed for an in-depth analysis of thereby-produced spontaneous speech, advanced natural language processing (NLP) combined with machine learning (ML) represents a promising opportunity. In this applied research field though, NLP and ML methodology do not necessarily ensure robust clinically actionable insights into cognitive language impairment in AD and additional precautions must be taken to ensure clinical-validity and generalizability of results. In this study, we add generalizability through multilingual feature statistics to computational approaches for the detection of language impairment in AD. We include 154 participants (78 healthy subjects, 76 patients with AD) from two different languages (106 English speaking and 47 French speaking). Each participant completed a picture description task, in addition to a battery of neuropsychological tests. Each response was recorded and manually transcribed. From this, task-specific, semantic, syntactic and paralinguistic features are extracted using NLP resources. Using inferential statistics, we determined language features, excluding task specific features, that are significant in both languages and therefore represent “generalizable” signs for cognitive language impairment in AD. In a second step, we evaluated all features as well as the generalizable ones for English, French and both languages in a binary discrimination ML scenario (AD vs. healthy) using a variety of classifiers. The generalizable language feature set outperforms the all language feature set in English, French and the multilingual scenarios. Semantic features are the most generalizable while paralinguistic features show no overlap between languages. The multilingual model shows an equal distribution of error in both English and French. By leveraging multilingual statistics combined with a theory-driven approach, we identify AD-related language impairment that generalizes beyond a single corpus or language to model language impairment as a clinically-relevant cognitive symptom. We find a primary impairment in semantics in addition to mild syntactic impairment, possibly confounded by additional impaired cognitive functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation on the Affected Hemisphere Enhances Hand Functional Recovery in Subacute Adult Stroke Patients: A Randomized Trial</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.636184</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objectives: Either motor training or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) could modulate the neural plasticity after stroke. Therefore, synchronizing the two interventions may optimize the efficiency of recovery. In the present study, we aim to investigate the effect of rTMS along with hand grip training on the neurobehavioral and hand functional recovery in one cohort of subacute stroke patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Thirty-nine stroke patients were enrolled in a single-center, single-blinded, randomized clinical trial. We tested different intervention effects of rTMS and hand grip training (group A), rTMS alone (group B), and hand grip training alone (group C). For the rTMS-treated groups, patients received 10 consecutive sessions of 5-Hz stimulation over the affected hemisphere with 750 pulses. Jebsen–Taylor Hand Function Test (JTHFT), Fugl-Meyer assessment of upper extremity (FMA-UE), grip strength, modified Barthel index (mBI), and ipsilesional motor evoked potential (iMEP) latency were assessed and compared across the groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We found that only rTMS along with hand grip training group all improved in JTHFT, FMA-UE, grip strength, and mBI (p ≤ 0.01) compared with the baseline among the three groups. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that rTMS plus hand grip training had much better results in improvement of neurobehavioral outcomes compared to the rTMS alone- and hand grip training alone-treated patients (p &amp;lt; 0.05). However, no significant differences were detected in neurophysiologic outcome between intra-groups and inter-groups (p &amp;gt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: These proof-of-concept results suggested that rTMS alone with hand grip training was a unique approach to promote hand functional recovery in stroke patients. It provided important information to design a large-scale multi-center clinical trial to further demonstrate the efficiency of the combination of central and peripheral stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration:http://www.chictr.org.cn (#ChiCTR1900023443).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: CircRNAs have been found to play a crucial role in the pathological process of various kinds of diseases. However, the role of circRNAs in the formation and rupture of intracranial aneurysm is still unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Differentially expressed circRNAs profiles between superficial temporal arteries (n = 5) and intracranial aneurysms (n = 5) were analyzed using the Arraystar human circRNAs microarray. Quantitative real-time PCR was utilized to validate the differential expression of circDUS2. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was meant for the location of circDUS2 in human brain vascular smooth muscle cell (HBVSMC). Structural analysis was used to speculate on the function of circDUS2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Five hundred forty-three upregulated and 397 downregulated significantly in intracranial aneurysm as compared to superficial temporal arteries. Quantitative real-time PCR verified the elevated expression of the upregulated circDUS2. The FISH test revealed that circDUS2 is located in the cytoplasm of brain vascular smooth muscle cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: This study showed differential expression data of circRNAs between superficial temporal artery and intracranial aneurysm and revealed that circDUS2 is a potential molecular marker for intracranial aneurysm.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Single-cell RNA sequencing technology provides an opportunity to study gene expression at single-cell resolution. However, prevalent dropout events result in high data sparsity and noise that may obscure downstream analyses in single-cell transcriptomic studies. We propose a new method, G2S3, that imputes dropouts by borrowing information from adjacent genes in a sparse gene graph learned from gene expression profiles across cells. We applied G2S3 and ten existing imputation methods to eight single-cell transcriptomic datasets and compared their performance. Our results demonstrated that G2S3 has superior overall performance in recovering gene expression, identifying cell subtypes, reconstructing cell trajectories, identifying differentially expressed genes, and recovering gene regulatory and correlation relationships. Moreover, G2S3 is computationally efficient for imputation in large-scale single-cell transcriptomic datasets.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lOJnB7dMGks&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The eukaryotic transcription cycle consists of three main steps: initiation, elongation, and cleavage of the nascent RNA transcript. Although each of these steps can be regulated as well as coupled with each other, their &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; dissection has remained challenging because available experimental readouts lack sufficient spatiotemporal resolution to separate the contributions from each of these steps. Here, we describe a novel application of Bayesian inference techniques to simultaneously infer the effective parameters of the transcription cycle in real time and at the single-cell level using a two-color MS2/PP7 reporter gene and the developing fruit fly embryo as a case study. Our method enables detailed investigations into cell-to-cell variability in transcription-cycle parameters as well as single-cell correlations between these parameters. These measurements, combined with theoretical modeling, suggest a substantial variability in the elongation rate of individual RNA polymerase molecules. We further illustrate the power of this technique by uncovering a novel mechanistic connection between RNA polymerase density and nascent RNA cleavage efficiency. Thus, our approach makes it possible to shed light on the regulatory mechanisms in play during each step of the transcription cycle in individual, living cells at high spatiotemporal resolution.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UGmlFnge6Ac&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Switches in brain states, synaptic plasticity and neuromodulation are fundamental processes in our brain that take place concomitantly across several spatial and timescales. All these processes target neuron intrinsic properties and connectivity to achieve specific physiological goals, raising the question of how they can operate without interfering with each other. Here, we highlight the central importance of a timescale separation in the activation of sodium and T-type calcium channels to sustain robust switches in brain states in thalamic neurons that are compatible with synaptic plasticity and neuromodulation. We quantify the role of this timescale separation by comparing the robustness of rhythms of six published conductance-based models at the cellular, circuit and network levels. We show that robust rhythm generation requires a T-type calcium channel activation whose kinetics are situated between sodium channel activation and T-type calcium channel inactivation in all models despite their quantitative differences.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mLucSWIdP_M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Single-cell Hi-C (scHi-C) sequencing technologies allow us to investigate three-dimensional chromatin organization at the single-cell level. However, we still need computational tools to deal with the sparsity of the contact maps from single cells and embed single cells in a lower-dimensional Euclidean space. This embedding helps us understand relationships between the cells in different dimensions, such as cell-cycle dynamics and cell differentiation. We present an open-source computational toolbox, scHiCTools, for analyzing single-cell Hi-C data comprehensively and efficiently. The toolbox provides two methods for screening single cells, three common methods for smoothing scHi-C data, three efficient methods for calculating the pairwise similarity of cells, three methods for embedding single cells, three methods for clustering cells, and a build-in function to visualize the cells embedding in a two-dimensional or three-dimensional plot. scHiCTools, written in Python3, is compatible with different platforms, including Linux, macOS, and Windows.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9wL-tejoXPM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility, and gene expression represent different levels information in biological process, but a comprehensive multiomics analysis of the mammalian heart is lacking. Here, we applied nucleosome occupancy and methylome sequencing, which detected DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility simultaneously, as well as RNA-seq, for multiomics analysis of the 4 chambers of adult and fetal human hearts, and adult mouse hearts. Our results showed conserved region-specific patterns in the mammalian heart at transcriptome and DNA methylation level. Adult and fetal human hearts showed distinct features in DNA methylome, chromatin accessibility, and transcriptome. Novel long noncoding RNAs were identified in the human heart, and the gene expression profiles of major cardiovascular diseases associated genes were displayed. Furthermore, cross-species comparisons revealed human-specific and mouse-specific differentially expressed genes between the atria and ventricles. We also reported the relationship among multiomics and found there was a bell-shaped relationship between gene-body methylation and expression in the human heart. In general, our study provided comprehensive spatiotemporal and evolutionary insights into the regulation of gene expression in the heart.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/U06HjhHusnE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
The encoding of spatial representations is enabled by synaptic plasticity. The entorhinal cortex sends information to the hippocampus via the lateral (LPP) and medial perforant (MPP) paths that transfer egocentric item‐related and allocentric spatial information, respectively. To what extent LPP and MPP information‐relay results in different homosynaptic synaptic plasticity responses is unclear. We examined the frequency dependency (at 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 200 Hz) of long‐term potentiation (LTP) and long‐term depression (LTD) at MPP and LPP synapses in the dentate gyrus (DG) of freely behaving adult rats. We report that whereas the MPP–DG synapses exhibit a predisposition toward the expression of LTP, LPP–DG synapses prefer to express synaptic depression. The divergence of synaptic plasticity responses is most prominent at afferent frequencies of 5, 100, Hz and 200 Hz. Priming with 10 or 50 Hz significantly modified the subsequent plasticity response in a frequency‐dependent manner, but failed to change the preferred direction of change in synaptic strength of MPP and LPP synapses. Evaluation of the expression of GluN1, GluN2A, or GluN2B subunits of the NMDA receptor revealed equivalent expression in the outer and middle thirds of the molecular layer where LPP and MPP inputs convene, respectively, thus excluding NMDA receptors as a substrate for the frequency‐dependent differences in bidirectional plasticity. These findings demonstrate that the LPP and MPP inputs to the DG enable differentiated and distinct forms of synaptic plasticity in response to the same afferent frequencies. Effects are extremely robust and resilient to metaplastic priming. These properties may support the functional differentiation of allocentric and item information provided to the DG by the MPP and LPP, respectively, that has been proposed by others. We propose that allocentric spatial information, conveyed by the MPP is encoded through hippocampal LTP in a designated synaptic network. This network is refined and optimized to include egocentric contextual information through LTD triggered by LPP inputs.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.624352</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The way spatial memory retrieval is represented in the brain remains unclear to date. Previous studies have displayed a hippocampus-centered navigation network using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis. There have been some studies on the representation of navigation behavior by signal distribution patterns, but only in the hippocampus and adjacent structures. In this study, we aimed to determine (1) the brain regions that represent information in both intensity and distribution patterns during spatial memory retrieval and (2) whether the patterns of neural responses represent spatial memory retrieval behavior performance. Both univariate analysis [general linear model (GLM)] and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) were employed to reveal the spatial distributions of brain responses elicited by spatial memory retrieval. Correlation analyses were performed to detect the correspondences between brain responses and behavior performance. We found that spatial memory retrieval occurred in widespread brain regions, including the bilateral hippocampi, bilateral superior frontal gyrus, bilateral superior parietal lobules, bilateral occipital lobes, and cerebellum. The amplitude of activation in the left hippocampus showed a significant negative correlation (r = −0.46, p = 0.039) with the number of task completions. Additionally, within-subject classification accuracies based on the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal patterns of the right middle temporal gyrus (rMTG) rostral areas in the Brainnetome Atlas showed a significant positive correlation (r = 0.78, p &amp;lt; 0.0001) with retrieval accuracy. In summary, our findings have implications for understanding the separation between navigational and non-navigational states and emphasizing the utility of MVPA in the whole brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Upregulation of lncRNA147410.3 in the Brain of Mice With Chronic Toxoplasma Infection Promoted Microglia Apoptosis by Regulating Hoxb3</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.648047</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Toxoplasma gondii is neurotropic and affects the function of nerve cells, while the mechanism is unclear. LncRNAs are abundantly enriched in the brain and participated in the delicate regulation of the central nervous system (CNS) development. However, whether these lncRNAs are involved in the regulation of microglia activation during the process of T. gondii infection is largely unknown. In this study, the upregulation of a novel lncRNA147410.3 (ENSMUST00000147410.3) was identified as a key factor to influence this process. The target gene of lncRNA147410.3 was predicted and identified as Hoxb3. The localization of lncRNA147410.3 in the brain and cells was proved in the nucleus of neuroglia through FISH assay. Furthermore, the function of lncRNA147410.3 on neuronal cell was confirmed that lncRNA147410.3 could affect proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of mouse microglia by positively regulating Hoxb3. Thus, our study explored the modulatory action of lncRNA147410.3 in T. gondii infected mouse brain, providing a scientific basis for using lncRNA147410.3 as a therapeutic target to treat neurological disorder induced by T. gondii.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Genomewide Association Studies of LRRK2 Modifiers of Parkinson's Disease</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26094?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
The aim of this study was to search for genes/variants that modify the effect of LRRK2 mutations in terms of penetrance and age‐at‐onset of Parkinson's disease.


Methods
We performed the first genomewide association study of penetrance and age‐at‐onset of Parkinson's disease in LRRK2 mutation carriers (776 cases and 1,103 non‐cases at their last evaluation). Cox proportional hazard models and linear mixed models were used to identify modifiers of penetrance and age‐at‐onset of LRRK2 mutations, respectively. We also investigated whether a polygenic risk score derived from a published genomewide association study of Parkinson's disease was able to explain variability in penetrance and age‐at‐onset in LRRK2 mutation carriers.


Results
A variant located in the intronic region of CORO1C on chromosome 12 (rs77395454; p value = 2.5E‐08, beta = 1.27, SE = 0.23, risk allele: C) met genomewide significance for the penetrance model. Co‐immunoprecipitation analyses of LRRK2 and CORO1C supported an interaction between these 2 proteins. A region on chromosome 3, within a previously reported linkage peak for Parkinson's disease susceptibility, showed suggestive associations in both models (penetrance top variant: p value = 1.1E‐07; age‐at‐onset top variant: p value = 9.3E‐07). A polygenic risk score derived from publicly available Parkinson's disease summary statistics was a significant predictor of penetrance, but not of age‐at‐onset.


Interpretation
This study suggests that variants within or near CORO1C may modify the penetrance of LRRK2 mutations. In addition, common Parkinson's disease associated variants collectively increase the penetrance of LRRK2 mutations. ANN NEUROL 2021</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Mutations in HID1 cause syndromic infantile encephalopathy and hypopituitarism</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26127?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Precursors of peptide hormones undergo posttranslational modifications within the trans‐Golgi network (TGN). Dysfunction of proteins involved at different steps of this process cause several complex syndromes affecting the central nervous system (CNS). We aimed to clarify the genetic cause in a group of patients characterized by hypopituitarism in combination with brain atrophy, thin corpus callosum, severe developmental delay, visual impairment, and epilepsy.


Methods
Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed in seven individuals of six unrelated families with these features. Postmortem histopathological and HID1 expression analysis of brain tissue and pituitary gland were conducted in one patient. Functional consequences of the homozygous HID1 variant p.R433W were investigated by Seahorse XF Assay in fibroblasts of two patients.


Results
Bi‐allelic variants in the gene HID1 domain‐containing protein 1 (HID1) were identified in all patients. Post mortem examination confirmed cerebral atrophy with enlarged lateral ventricles. Markedly reduced expression of pituitary hormones was found in pituitary gland tissue. Colocalization of HID1 protein with the TGN was not altered in fibroblasts of patients compared to controls, while the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) upon stimulation with potassium chloride was significantly reduced in patient fibroblasts compared to controls.


Interpretation
Our findings indicate that mutations in HID1 cause an early infantile encephalopathy with hypopituitarism as the leading presentation, and expand the list of syndromic CNS diseases caused by interference of TGN function.

	<title>PLoS Biology: Ventricular, atrial, and outflow tract heart progenitors arise from spatially and molecularly distinct regions of the primitive streak</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/kpRtFzPPbgg/article</link>

The heart develops from 2 sources of mesoderm progenitors, the first and second heart field (FHF and SHF). Using a single-cell transcriptomic assay combined with genetic lineage tracing and live imaging, we find the FHF and SHF are subdivided into distinct pools of progenitors in gastrulating mouse embryos at earlier stages than previously thought. Each subpopulation has a distinct origin in the primitive streak. The first progenitors to leave the primitive streak contribute to the left ventricle, shortly after right ventricle progenitor emigrate, followed by the outflow tract and atrial progenitors. Moreover, a subset of atrial progenitors are gradually incorporated in posterior locations of the FHF. Although cells allocated to the outflow tract and atrium leave the primitive streak at a similar stage, they arise from different regions. Outflow tract cells originate from distal locations in the primitive streak while atrial progenitors are positioned more proximally. Moreover, single-cell RNA sequencing demonstrates that the primitive streak cells contributing to the ventricles have a distinct molecular signature from those forming the outflow tract and atrium. We conclude that cardiac progenitors are prepatterned within the primitive streak and this prefigures their allocation to distinct anatomical structures of the heart. Together, our data provide a new molecular and spatial map of mammalian cardiac progenitors that will support future studies of heart development, function, and disease.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/kpRtFzPPbgg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Encephalitis with Autoantibodies against the Glutamate Kainate Receptors GluK2</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26098?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
The objective of this study was to report the identification of antibodies against the glutamate kainate receptor subunit 2 (GluK2‐abs) in patients with autoimmune encephalitis, and describe the clinical‐immunological features and antibody effects.


Methods
Two sera from 8 patients with similar rat brain immunostaining were used to precipitate the antigen from neuronal cultures. A cell‐based assay (CBA) with GluK2‐expressing HEK293 cells was used to assess 596 patients with different neurological disorders, and 23 healthy controls. GluK2‐ab effects were determined by confocal microscopy in cultured neurons and electrophysiology in GluK2‐expressing HEK293 cells.


Results
Patients’ antibodies precipitated GluK2. GluK2 antibody‐specificity was confirmed by CBA, immunoprecipitation, GluK2‐immunoabsorption, and GluK2 knockout brain immunohistochemistry. In 2 of 8 samples, antibodies reacted with additional GluK2 epitopes present in GluK1 or GluK3; in both, the reactivity was abrogated after GluK2 immuno‐absorption. Six of 8 patients developed acute encephalitis and clinical or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of predominant cerebellar involvement (4 presenting as cerebellitis, which in 2 patients caused obstructive hydrocephalus), and 2 patients had other syndromes (1 with cerebellar symptoms). One of the samples showed mild reactivity with non‐kainate receptors (alpha‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazolepropionic acid receptors [AMPAR] and N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptors [NMDAR]) leading to identify 6 additional cases with GluK2‐abs among patients with anti‐AMPAR (5/71) or anti‐NMDAR encephalitis (1/73). GluK2‐abs internalized GluK2 in HEK293 cells and neurons; these antibody‐effects were reversible in neurons. A significant reduction of GluK2‐mediated currents was observed in cells treated with patients’ GluK2 serum following the time frame of antibody‐mediated GluK2 internalization.


Interpretation
GluK2‐abs associate with an encephalitis with prominent clinicoradiological cerebellar involvement. The antibody effects are predominantly mediated by internalization of GluK2. ANN NEUROL 2021</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>A laser speckle contrast image showing blood flow in the face of a migraineur who had received an infusion of pramlinitide, an agonist for amylin receptors. Amylin is a peptide in the same family as CGRP, with which it shares agonist activity at the AMY1 receptor. Amylin can also provoke migraine‐like attacks, suggesting that an dual amylin‐CGRP antagonist may be effective for migraine. See Ghanizada et al. (pp. 1157–1171) in this issue.</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Alpha‐Synuclein Oligomers and Neurofilament Light Chain Predict Phenoconversion of Pure Autonomic Failure</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26089?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
To explore the role of alpha‐synuclein (αSyn) oligomers and neurofilament light chain (NfL) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with pure autonomic failure (PAF) as markers of future phenoconversion to multiple system atrophy (MSA).


Methods
Well‐characterized patients with PAF (n = 32) were enrolled between June 2016 and February 2019 at Mayo Clinic Rochester and followed prospectively with annual visits to determine future phenoconversion to MSA, Parkinson's disease (PD), or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). ELISA was utilized to measure NfL and protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) to detect αSyn oligomers in CSF collected at baseline.


Results
Patients were followed for a median of 3.9 years. Five patients converted to MSA, 2 to PD, and 2 to DLB. NfL at baseline was elevated only in patients who later developed MSA, perfectly separating those from future PD and DLB converters as well as non‐converters. ASyn‐PMCA was positive in all but two cases (94%). The PMCA reaction was markedly different in five samples with maximum fluorescence and reaction kinetics previously described in MSA patients; all of these patients later developed MSA.


Interpretation
αSyn‐PMCA is almost invariably positive in the CSF of patients with PAF establishing this condition as α‐synucleinopathy. Both NfL and the magnitude and reaction kinetics of αSyn PMCA faithfully predict which PAF patients will eventually phenoconvert to MSA. This finding has important implications not only for prognostication, but also for future trials of disease modifying therapies, allowing for differentiation of MSA from Lewy body synucleinopathies before motor symptoms develop.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Gut Microbiome in Progressive Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26084?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
This study was undertaken to investigate the gut microbiome in progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) and how it relates to clinical disease.


Methods
We sequenced the microbiota from healthy controls and relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS) and progressive MS patients and correlated the levels of bacteria with clinical features of disease, including Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), quality of life, and brain magnetic resonance imaging lesions/atrophy. We colonized mice with MS‐derived Akkermansia and induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).


Results
Microbiota β‐diversity differed between MS patients and controls but did not differ between RRMS and progressive MS or differ based on disease‐modifying therapies. Disease status had the greatest effect on the microbiome β‐diversity, followed by body mass index, race, and sex. In both progressive MS and RRMS, we found increased Clostridium bolteae, Ruthenibacterium lactatiformans, and Akkermansia and decreased Blautia wexlerae, Dorea formicigenerans, and Erysipelotrichaceae CCMM. Unique to progressive MS, we found elevated Enterobacteriaceae and Clostridium g24 FCEY and decreased Blautia and Agathobaculum. Several Clostridium species were associated with higher EDSS and fatigue scores. Contrary to the view that elevated Akkermansia in MS has a detrimental role, we found that Akkermansia was linked to lower disability, suggesting a beneficial role. Consistent with this, we found that Akkermansia isolated from MS patients ameliorated EAE, which was linked to a reduction in RORγt+ and IL‐17–producing γδ T cells.


Interpretation
Whereas some microbiota alterations are shared in relapsing and progressive MS, we identified unique bacteria associated with progressive MS and clinical measures of disease. Furthermore, elevated Akkermansia in MS may be a compensatory beneficial response in the MS microbiome. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:1195–1211</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Superficial Siderosis: A Clinical Review</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26083?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Superficial siderosis of the central nervous system results from subpial hemosiderin deposition due to chronic low‐grade bleeding into the subarachnoid space. The confluent and marginal subpial hemosiderin is best appreciated on iron‐sensitive magnetic resonance imaging sequences. With widespread use of magnetic resonance imaging, the disorder is increasingly being recognized, including in asymptomatic individuals. Gait ataxia, often with hearing impairment is a common clinical presentation. A clinical history of subarachnoid hemorrhage is generally not present. A macrovascular pathology is generally not causative. The most common etiology is dural disease, often dural tears. Prior or less commonly ongoing symptoms of craniospinal hypovolemia may be present. Common etiologies for dural tears include disc disease and trauma, including surgical trauma. Patients with dural tears due to herniated and calcified discs often have a ventral intraspinal fluid collection due to cerebrospinal fluid leak. A precise identification of the dural tear relies on multimodality imaging. It has been speculated that chronic bleeding from fragile blood vessels around the dural tear may be the likely underlying mechanism. Surgical correction of the bleeding source is a logical therapeutic strategy. Clinical outcomes are variable, although neuroimaging evidence of successful dural tear repair is noted. The currently available data regarding use of deferiprone in patients with superficial siderosis is insufficient to recommend its routine use in patients.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Unravelling the Neural Basis of Spatial Delusions After Stroke</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26079?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Knowing explicitly where we are is an interpretation of our spatial representations. Reduplicative paramnesia is a disrupting syndrome in which patients present a firm belief of spatial mislocation. Here, we studied the largest sample of patients with delusional misidentifications of space (ie, reduplicative paramnesia) after stroke to shed light on their neurobiology.


Methods
In a prospective, cumulative, case‐control study, we screened 400 patients with acute right‐hemispheric stroke. We included 64 cases and 233 controls. First, lesions were delimited and normalized. Then, we computed structural and functional disconnection maps using methods of lesion‐track and network‐mapping. The maps were compared, controlling for confounders. Second, we built a multivariate logistic model, including clinical, behavioral, and neuroimaging data. Finally, we performed a nested cross‐validation of the model with a support‐vector machine analysis.


Results
The most frequent misidentification subtype was confabulatory mislocation (56%), followed by place reduplication (19%), and chimeric assimilation (13%). Our results indicate that structural disconnection is the strongest predictor of the syndrome and included 2 distinct streams, connecting right fronto‐thalamic and right occipitotemporal structures. In the multivariate model, the independent predictors of reduplicative paramnesia were the structural disconnection map, lesion sparing of right dorsal fronto‐parietal regions, age, and anosognosia. Good discrimination accuracy was demonstrated (area under the curve = 0.80 [0.75–0.85]).


Interpretation
Our results localize the anatomic circuits that may have a role in the abnormal spatial‐emotional binding and in the defective updating of spatial representations underlying reduplicative paramnesia. This novel data may contribute to better understand the pathophysiology of delusional syndromes after stroke. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:1181–1194</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>There is an accumulating volume of research into neurological manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). However, inconsistent study designs, inadequate controls, poorly validated tests, and differing settings, interventions, and cultural norms weaken study quality and comparability, hence the understanding of the spectrum, burden, and pathophysiology of these complications. Therefore, a global COVID‐19 Neuro Research Coalition, together with the World Health Organization, has reviewed reports of COVID‐19 neurological complications and harmonized clinical measures for future research. This will facilitate well‐designed studies using precise, consistent case definitions of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection and neurological complications, with standardized forms for pooled data analyses that nonspecialists can use, including those in low‐income settings.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Characterization of the Insular Role in Cardiac Function through Intracranial Electrical Stimulation of the Human Insula</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26074?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
The link between brain function and cardiovascular dynamics is an important issue yet to be elucidated completely. The insula is a neocortical brain area that is thought to have a cardiac chronotropic regulatory function, but its role in cardiac contractility is unknown. We aimed to analyze the variability in heart rate and cardiac contractility after functional activation of different insular regions through direct electrical stimulation (E‐stim) in humans.


Methods
This was an observational, prospective study, including patients admitted for stereo‐electroencephalographic recording because of refractory epilepsy, in whom the insular cortex was implanted. Patients with anatomical or electrophysiological insular abnormalities and those in whom E‐stim produced subjective symptoms were excluded. Variations in heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV), and cardiac output (CO) were analyzed during insular E‐stim and compared with control E‐stim of non‐eloquent brain regions and sham stimulations.


Results
Ten patients were included, 5 implanted in the right insula (52 E‐stim) and 5 in the left (37 E‐stim). Demographic and clinical characteristics of both groups were similar. E‐stim of both right and left insulas induced a significant decrease of the CO and HR, and an increase of the SV. E‐stim of control electrodes and sham stimulations were not associated with variations in cardiac function. Blood pressure and respiratory rate remained unaltered.


Interpretation
Our results suggest a direct chronotropic and inotropic cardiac depressor function of the right and left insulas. The evidence of an insular direct cardiac regulatory function might open a path in the prevention or treatment of heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Amylin Analog Pramlintide Induces Migraine‐like Attacks in Patients</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26072?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Migraine is a prevalent and disabling neurological disease. Its genesis is poorly understood, and there remains unmet clinical need. We aimed to identify mechanisms and thus novel therapeutic targets for migraine using human models of migraine and translational models in animals, with emphasis on amylin, a close relative of calcitonin gene‐related peptide (CGRP).


Methods
Thirty‐six migraine without aura patients were enrolled in a randomized, double‐blind, 2‐way, crossover, positive‐controlled clinical trial study to receive infusion of an amylin analogue pramlintide or human αCGRP on 2 different experimental days. Furthermore, translational studies in cells and mouse models, and rat, mouse and human tissue samples were conducted.


Results
Thirty patients (88%) developed headache after pramlintide infusion, compared to 33 (97%) after CGRP (p = 0.375). Fourteen patients (41%) developed migraine‐like attacks after pramlintide infusion, compared to 19 patients (56%) after CGRP (p = 0.180). The pramlintide‐induced migraine‐like attacks had similar clinical characteristics to those induced by CGRP. There were differences between treatments in vascular parameters. Human receptor pharmacology studies showed that an amylin receptor likely mediates these pramlintide‐provoked effects, rather than the canonical CGRP receptor. Supporting this, preclinical experiments investigating symptoms associated with migraine showed that amylin treatment, like CGRP, caused cutaneous hypersensitivity and light aversion in mice.


Interpretation
Our findings propose amylin receptor agonism as a novel contributor to migraine pathogenesis. Greater therapeutic gains could therefore be made for migraine patients through dual amylin and CGRP receptor antagonism, rather than selectively targeting the canonical CGRP receptor.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: NIA‐AA Alzheimer's Disease Framework: Clinical Characterization of Stages</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26071?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Background
To operationalize the National Institute on Aging – Alzheimer's Association (NIA‐AA) Research Framework for Alzheimer's Disease 6‐stage continuum of clinical progression for persons with abnormal amyloid.


Methods
The Mayo Clinic Study of Aging is a population‐based longitudinal study of aging and cognitive impairment in Olmsted County, Minnesota. We evaluated persons without dementia having 3 consecutive clinical visits. Measures for cross‐sectional categories included objective cognitive impairment (OBJ) and function (FXN). Measures for change included subjective cognitive impairment (SCD), objective cognitive change (ΔOBJ), and new onset of neurobehavioral symptoms (ΔNBS). We calculated frequencies of the stages using different cutoff points and assessed stability of the stages over 15 months.


Results
Among 243 abnormal amyloid participants, the frequencies of the stages varied with age: 66 to 90% were classified as stage 1 at age 50 but at age 80, 24 to 36% were stage 1, 32 to 47% were stage 2, 18 to 27% were stage 3, 1 to 3% were stage 4 to 6, and 3 to 9% were indeterminate. Most stage 2 participants were classified as stage 2 because of abnormal ΔOBJ only (44–59%), whereas 11 to 21% had SCD only, and 9 to 13% had ΔNBS only. Short‐term stability varied by stage and OBJ cutoff points but the most notable changes were seen in stage 2 with 38 to 63% remaining stable, 4 to 13% worsening, and 24 to 41% improving (moving to stage 1).


Interpretation
The frequency of the stages varied by age and the precise membership fluctuated by the parameters used to define the stages. The staging framework may require revisions before it can be adopted for clinical trials. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:1145–1156</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Meningeal CGRP‐Prolactin Interaction Evokes Female‐Specific Migraine Behavior</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26070?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Migraine is three times more common in women. CGRP plays a critical role in migraine pathology and causes female‐specific behavioral responses upon meningeal application. These effects are likely mediated through interactions of CGRP with signaling systems specific to females. Prolactin (PRL) levels have been correlated with migraine attacks. Here, we explore a potential interaction between CGRP and PRL in the meninges.


Methods
Prolactin, CGRP, and receptor antagonists CGRP8‐37 or Δ1‐9‐G129R‐hPRL were administered onto the dura of rodents followed by behavioral testing. Immunohistochemistry was used to examine PRL, CGRP and Prolactin receptor (Prlr) expression within the dura. Electrophysiology on cultured and back‐labeled trigeminal ganglia (TG) neurons was used to assess PRL‐induced excitability. Finally, the effects of PRL on evoked CGRP release from ex vivo dura were measured.


Results
We found that dural PRL produced sustained and long‐lasting migraine‐like behavior in cycling and ovariectomized female, but not male rodents. Prlr was expressed on dural afferent nerves in females with little‐to‐no presence in males. Consistent with this, PRL increased excitability only in female TG neurons innervating the dura and selectively sensitized CGRP release from female ex vivo dura. We demonstrate crosstalk between PRL and CGRP systems as CGRP8‐37 decreases migraine‐like responses to dural PRL. Reciprocally, Δ1‐9‐G129R‐hPRL attenuates dural CGRP‐induced migraine behaviors. Similarly, Prlr deletion from sensory neurons significantly reduced migraine‐like responses to dural CGRP.


Interpretation
This CGRP‐PRL interaction in the meninges is a mechanism by which these peptides could produce female‐selective responses and increase the prevalence of migraine in women. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:1129–1144</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Staufen1 in Human Neurodegeneration</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26069?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Mutations in the ATXN2 gene (CAG expansions ≥32 repeats) can be a rare cause of Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We recently reported that the stress granule (SG) protein Staufen1 (STAU1) was overabundant in neurodegenerative disorder spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) patient cells, animal models, and ALS‐TDP‐43 fibroblasts, and provided a link between SG formation and autophagy. We aimed to test if STAU1 overabundance has a role in the pathogenesis of other neurodegenerative diseases.


Methods
With multiple neurodegenerative patient‐derived cell models, animal models, and human postmortem ALS tissue, we evaluate STAU1 function using biochemical and immunohistological analyses.


Results
We demonstrate STAU1 overabundance and increased total and phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in fibroblast cells from patients with ALS with mutations in TDP‐43, patients with dementia with PSEN1 mutations, a patient with parkinsonism with MAPT mutation, Huntington's disease (HD) mutations, and SCA2 mutations. Increased STAU1 levels and mTOR activity were seen in human ALS spinal cord tissues as well as in animal models. Changes in STAU1 and mTOR protein levels were post‐transcriptional. Exogenous expression of STAU1 in wildtype cells was sufficient to activate mTOR and downstream targets and form SGs. Targeting STAU1 by RNAi normalized mTOR, suggesting a potential role for therapy in diseases associated with STAU1 overabundance.


Interpretation
STAU1 overabundance in neurodegeneration is a common phenomenon associated with hyperactive mTOR. Targeting STAU1 with ASOs or miRNA viral vectors may represent a novel, efficacious therapy for neurodegenerative diseases characterized by overabundant STAU1.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: How Can an Na+ Channel Inhibitor Ameliorate Seizures in Lennox–Gastaut Syndrome?</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26068?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is an epileptic encephalopathy frequently associated with multiple types of seizures. The classical Na+ channel inhibitors are in general ineffective against the seizures in LGS. Rufinamide is a new Na+ channel inhibitor, but approved for the treatment of LGS. This is not consistent with a choice of antiseizure drugs (ASDs) according to simplistic categorical grouping.


Methods
The effect of rufinamide on the Na+ channel, cellular discharges, and seizure behaviors was quantitatively characterized in native neurons and mammalian models of epilepsy, and compared with the other Na+ channel inhibitors.


Results
With a much faster binding rate to the inactivated Na+ channel than phenytoin, rufinamide is distinctively effective if the seizure discharges chiefly involve short bursts interspersed with hyperpolarized interburst intervals, exemplified by spike and wave discharges (SWDs) on electroencephalograms. Consistently, rufinamide, but not phenytoin, suppresses SWD‐associated seizures in pentylenetetrazol or AY‐9944 models, which recapitulate the major electrophysiological and behavioral manifestations in typical and atypical absence seizures, including LGS.


Interpretation
Na+ channel inhibitors shall have sufficiently fast binding to exert an action during the short bursts and then suppress SWDs, in which cases rufinamide is superior. For the epileptiform discharges where the interburst intervals are not so hyperpolarized, phenytoin could be better because of the higher affinity. Na+ channel inhibitors with different binding kinetics and affinity to the inactivated channels may have different antiseizure scope. A rational choice of ASDs according to in‐depth molecular pharmacology and the attributes of ictal discharges is advisable. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:1099–1113</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Risk factors for developing dementia from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) probably differ between MCI subtypes. We investigated how frailty relates to dementia risk in amnestic MCI (a‐MCI; n = 2,799) and non‐amnestic MCI (na‐MCI; n = 629) in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database. Although higher frailty increased dementia risk for people with either a‐MCI or na‐MCI, the larger risk was in na‐MCI (interaction hazard ratio = 1.35 [95% confidence interval = 1.15–1.59], p &amp;lt; 0.001). Even after the onset of clinically significant cognitive impairment, poor general health, quantified by a high degree of frailty, is a significant risk for dementia.

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26063?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>A rapidly expanding catalog of neurogenetic disorders has encouraged a diagnostic shift towards early clinical whole exome sequencing (WES). Adult primary mitochondrial diseases (PMDs) frequently exhibit neurological manifestations that overlap with other nervous system disorders. However, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is not routinely analyzed in standard clinical WES bioinformatic pipelines. We reanalyzed 11,424 exomes, enriched with neurological diseases, for pathogenic mtDNA variants. Twenty‐four different mtDNA mutations were detected in 64 exomes, 11 of which were considered disease causing based on the associated clinical phenotypes. These findings highlight the diagnostic uplifts gained by analyzing mtDNA from WES data in neurological diseases. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:1240–1247</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26062?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Although Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) is hypothesized to be a prerequisite for multiple sclerosis (MS), up to 15% of children with a diagnosis of MS were reported to be EBV‐seronegative. When re‐evaluating 25 EBV‐seronegative children out of 189 pediatric patients with a diagnosis of clinically isolated syndrome/MS, we found anti–myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody in 11 of 25 (44%) EBV‐seronegative but only 9 of 164 (5.5%, p &amp;lt; 0.001) EBV‐seropositive patients. After critical review, MS remained a plausible diagnosis in only 4 of 14 EBV‐seronegative/MOG antibody–negative patients. In children with an MS‐like presentation, EBV seronegativity should alert clinicians to consider diagnoses other than MS, especially MOG‐antibody disease.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Long‐Term Safety and Efficacy of Eculizumab in Aquaporin‐4 IgG‐Positive NMOSD</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26049?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
During PREVENT (NCT01892345), eculizumab significantly reduced relapse risk versus placebo in patients with aquaporin‐4 immunoglobulin G‐positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (AQP4‐IgG+ NMOSD). We report an interim analysis of PREVENT's ongoing open‐label extension (OLE; NCT02003144) evaluating eculizumab's long‐term safety and efficacy.


Methods
Patients who completed PREVENT could enroll in the OLE to receive eculizumab (maintenance dose = 1,200 mg/2 weeks, after a blinded induction phase). Safety and efficacy data from PREVENT and its OLE (interim data cut, July 31, 2019) were combined for this analysis.


Results
Across PREVENT and the OLE, 137 patients received eculizumab and were monitored for a median (range) of 133.3 weeks (5.1–276.9 weeks), for a combined total of 362.3 patient‐years (PY). Treatment‐related adverse event (AE) and serious adverse event (SAE) rates were 183.5 in 100 PY and 8.6 in 100 PY, respectively. Serious infection rates were 10.2 in 100 PY in eculizumab‐treated patients versus 15.1 in 100 PY in the PREVENT placebo group. No patient developed a meningococcal infection. At 192 weeks (3.7 years), 94.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 88.6–97.3) of patients remained adjudicated relapse‐free. The adjudicated annualized relapse rate was 0.025 (95% CI = 0.013–0.048) in all eculizumab‐treated patients versus 0.350 (95% CI = 0.199–0.616) in the PREVENT placebo group. During the OLE, 37% of patients (44 of 119 patients) stopped or decreased background immunosuppressive therapy use.


Interpretation
This analysis demonstrates that eculizumab's long‐term safety profile in NMOSD is consistent with its established profile across other indications. This analysis also demonstrated the sustained ability of long‐term eculizumab treatment to reduce relapse risk in patients with AQP4‐IgG+ NMOSD. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:1088–1098</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), early diagnosis is essential for both current and potential treatments. To find a supportive approach for the diagnosis, we constructed an artificial intelligence‐based prediction model of ALS using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Images of spinal motor neurons derived from healthy control subject and ALS patient iPSCs were analyzed by a convolutional neural network, and the algorithm achieved an area under the curve of 0.97 for classifying healthy control and ALS. This prediction model by deep learning algorithm with iPSC technology could support the diagnosis and may provide proactive treatment of ALS through future prospective research.

Inclusion of a greater diversity of individuals in immunogenomics studies will substantially enhance our understanding of human immunology.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nmeth/rss/current/~4/iFaZF-qjG2M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Numerical calculations now suggest that the higher-pressure state is an electride liquid, in which electrons behave like localized anions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nphys/rss/current/~4/GwRkQITiShY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>
