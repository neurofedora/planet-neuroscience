	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Generation of Binary Tree-Child phylogenetic networks</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/s5tnl7_8aiY/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Gabriel Cardona, Joan Carles Pons, Celine Scornavacca&lt;/p&gt;

Phylogenetic networks generalize phylogenetic trees by allowing the modelization of events of reticulate evolution. Among the different kinds of phylogenetic networks that have been proposed in the literature, the subclass of binary tree-child networks is one of the most studied ones. However, very little is known about the combinatorial structure of these networks. In this paper we address the problem of generating all possible binary tree-child (BTC) networks with a given number of leaves in an efficient way via reduction/augmentation operations that extend and generalize analogous operations for phylogenetic trees, and are biologically relevant. Since our solution is recursive, this also provides us with a recurrence relation giving an upper bound on the number of such networks. We also show how the operations introduced in this paper can be employed to extend the evolutive history of a set of sequences, represented by a BTC network, to include a new sequence. An implementation in python of the algorithms described in this paper, along with some computational experiments, can be downloaded from https://github.com/bielcardona/TCGenerators.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/s5tnl7_8aiY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Predicting gene expression in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum using histone modification, nucleosome positioning, and 3D localization features</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/CgVvroWnzaY/article</link>

Empirical evidence suggests that the malaria parasite &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; employs a broad range of mechanisms to regulate gene transcription throughout the organism’s complex life cycle. To better understand this regulatory machinery, we assembled a rich collection of genomic and epigenomic data sets, including information about transcription factor (TF) binding motifs, patterns of covalent histone modifications, nucleosome occupancy, GC content, and global 3D genome architecture. We used these data to train machine learning models to discriminate between high-expression and low-expression genes, focusing on three distinct stages of the red blood cell phase of the &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; life cycle. Our results highlight the importance of histone modifications and 3D chromatin architecture in &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; transcriptional regulation and suggest that AP2 transcription factors may play a limited regulatory role, perhaps operating in conjunction with epigenetic factors.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CgVvroWnzaY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Network trade-offs and homeostasis in &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt; shoot architectures</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/TF4zSo6nRtU/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Adam Conn, Arjun Chandrasekhar, Martin van Rongen, Ottoline Leyser, Joanne Chory, Saket Navlakha&lt;/p&gt;

Understanding the optimization objectives that shape shoot architectures remains a critical problem in plant biology. Here, we performed 3D scanning of 152 &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt; shoot architectures, including wildtype and 10 mutant strains, and we uncovered a design principle that describes how architectures make trade-offs between competing objectives. First, we used graph-theoretic analysis to show that &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt; shoot architectures strike a Pareto optimal that can be captured as maximizing performance in transporting nutrients and minimizing costs in building the architecture. Second, we identify small sets of genes that can be mutated to shift the weight prioritizing one objective over the other. Third, we show that this prioritization weight feature is significantly less variable across replicates of the same genotype compared to other common plant traits (e.g., number of rosette leaves, total volume occupied). This suggests that this feature is a robust descriptor of a genotype, and that local variability in structure may be compensated for globally in a homeostatic manner. Overall, our work provides a framework to understand optimization trade-offs made by shoot architectures and provides evidence that these trade-offs can be modified genetically, which may aid plant breeding and selection efforts.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TF4zSo6nRtU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Role of dynamic nuclear deformation on genomic architecture reorganization</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/ngw9xQu4YbI/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Sungrim Seirin-Lee, Fumitaka Osakada, Junichi Takeda, Satoshi Tashiro, Ryo Kobayashi, Takashi Yamamoto, Hiroshi Ochiai&lt;/p&gt;

Higher-order genomic architecture varies according to cell type and changes dramatically during differentiation. One of the remarkable examples of spatial genomic reorganization is the rod photoreceptor cell differentiation in nocturnal mammals. The inverted nuclear architecture found in adult mouse rod cells is formed through the reorganization of the conventional architecture during terminal differentiation. However, the mechanisms underlying these changes remain largely unknown. Here, we found that the dynamic deformation of nuclei via actomyosin-mediated contractility contributes to chromocenter clustering and promotes genomic architecture reorganization during differentiation by conducting an &lt;i&gt;in cellulo&lt;/i&gt; experiment coupled with phase-field modeling. Similar patterns of dynamic deformation of the nucleus and a concomitant migration of the nuclear content were also observed in rod cells derived from the developing mouse retina. These results indicate that the common phenomenon of dynamic nuclear deformation, which accompanies dynamic cell behavior, can be a universal mechanism for spatiotemporal genomic reorganization.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ngw9xQu4YbI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: An Epilepsy-Associated KCNT1 Mutation Enhances Excitability of Human iPSC-Derived Neurons by Increasing Slack KNa Currents</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/37/7438?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mutations in the KCNT1 (Slack, K&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt;1.1) sodium-activated potassium channel produce severe epileptic encephalopathies. Expression in heterologous systems has shown that the disease-causing mutations give rise to channels that have increased current amplitude. It is not known, however, whether such gain of function occurs in human neurons, nor whether such increased K&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt; current is expected to suppress or increase the excitability of cortical neurons. Using genetically engineered human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons, we have now found that sodium-dependent potassium currents are increased several-fold in neurons bearing a homozygous P924L mutation. In current-clamp recordings, the increased K&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt; current in neurons with the P924L mutation acts to shorten the duration of action potentials and to increase the amplitude of the afterhyperpolarization that follows each action potential. Strikingly, the number of action potentials that were evoked by depolarizing currents as well as maximal firing rates were increased in neurons expressing the mutant channel. In networks of spontaneously active neurons, the mean firing rate, the occurrence of rapid bursts of action potentials, and the intensity of firing during the burst were all increased in neurons with the P924L Slack mutation. The feasibility of an increased K&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt; current to increase firing rates independent of any compensatory changes was validated by numerical simulations. Our findings indicate that gain-of-function in Slack K&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt; channels causes hyperexcitability in both isolated neurons and in neural networks and occurs by a cell-autonomous mechanism that does not require network interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;KCNT1&lt;/i&gt; mutations lead to severe epileptic encephalopathies for which there are no effective treatments. This study is the first demonstration that a &lt;i&gt;KCNT1&lt;/i&gt; mutation increases the Slack current in neurons. It also provides the first explanation for how this increased potassium current induces hyperexcitability, which could be the underlining factor causing seizures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Reciprocal Predictive Relationships between Amyloid and Tau Biomarkers in Alzheimer's Disease Progression: An Empirical Model</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/37/7428?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There is an urgent need to understand the relationships between amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau in the progression of Alzheimer's disease to identify treatment targets. Here we examine reciprocal predictions of brain Aβ burden quantified by positron emission tomography and CSF concentrations of Aβ42 and phosphorylated tau (p-tau). Each biomarker was examined over 48 months in two separate cross-lagged models; one in asymptomatic healthy elderly people (men and women), and one in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The models examine predictions of each biomarker on the progression of the others, considering each previous and concurrent measure. In healthy elderly, lower CSF Aβ42 predicted Aβ deposition and reciprocally, Aβ burden predicted a decrease in CSF Aβ42. Lower CSF Aβ42 predicted an increase in CSF p-tau, and CSF p-tau predicted Aβ deposition. In AD/MCI, lower CSF Aβ42 predicted Aβ deposition and Aβ burden reciprocally predicted CSF Aβ42 changes; however, in contrast to healthy elderly, CSF p-tau concentrations did not predict Aβ biomarkers, or vice versa. In &lt;i&gt;post hoc&lt;/i&gt; models examining cognitive status, CSF Aβ42 predicted Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores in healthy elderly, whereas Aβ burden and CSF p-tau predicted MMSE scores in AD/MCI. The findings describe reciprocal predictions between Aβ and tau biomarkers in healthy elderly and they implicate mechanisms underlying low CSF Aβ42 in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis and progression. In symptomatic Alzheimer's disease, CSF Aβ42 and Aβ deposition predicted each other; however, Aβ and CSF p-tau progressed independently and they independently predicted cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This study offers empirical evidence concerning the hypothesized &quot;amyloid cascade&quot;, as it progressed over 4 years in healthy elderly people and in Alzheimer's disease patients. In healthy elderly, CSF amyloid changes predicted amyloid deposition, CSF phosphorylated tau concentrations, and a decline in cognitive status. Phosphorylated tau concentrations specifically predicted amyloid deposition. In Alzheimer's disease patients, although amyloid deposition and CSF amyloid changes continued to &quot;cascade&quot;, there was no evidence to suggest that amyloid and tau biomarkers predicted each other, although both amyloid deposition and CSF tau progression predicted cognitive decline independently. Taking advantage of repeated amyloid PET and CSF measures, this dynamic view offers new insight into the progression of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers and their relationships with cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Differential Signaling Mediated by ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4 in Human Neurons Parallels Alzheimer's Disease Risk</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/37/7408?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In blood, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a component of circulating lipoproteins and mediates the clearance of these lipoproteins from blood by binding to ApoE receptors. Humans express three genetic ApoE variants, ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4, which exhibit distinct ApoE receptor-binding properties and differentially affect Alzheimer's disease (AD), such that ApoE2 protects against, and ApoE4 predisposes to AD. In brain, ApoE-containing lipoproteins are secreted by activated astrocytes and microglia, but their functions and role in AD pathogenesis are largely unknown. Ample evidence suggests that ApoE4 induces microglial dysregulation and impedes Aβ clearance in AD, but the direct neuronal effects of ApoE variants are poorly studied. Extending previous studies, we here demonstrate that the three ApoE variants differentially activate multiple neuronal signaling pathways and regulate synaptogenesis. Specifically, using human neurons (male embryonic stem cell-derived) cultured in the absence of glia to exclude indirect glial mechanisms, we show that ApoE broadly stimulates signal transduction cascades. Among others, such stimulation enhances APP synthesis and synapse formation with an ApoE4&amp;gt;ApoE3&amp;gt;ApoE2 potency rank order, paralleling the relative risk for AD conferred by these ApoE variants. Unlike the previously described induction of &lt;i&gt;APP&lt;/i&gt; transcription, however, ApoE-induced synaptogenesis involves CREB activation rather than cFos activation. We thus propose that in brain, ApoE acts as a glia-secreted signal that activates neuronal signaling pathways. The parallel potency rank order of ApoE4&amp;gt;ApoE3&amp;gt;ApoE2 in AD risk and neuronal signaling suggests that ApoE4 may in an apparent paradox promote AD pathogenesis by causing a chronic increase in signaling, possibly via enhancing APP expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Humans express three genetic variants of apolipoprotein E (ApoE), ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4. ApoE4 constitutes the most important genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), whereas ApoE2 protects against AD. Significant evidence suggests that ApoE4 impairs microglial function and impedes astrocytic Aβ clearance in brain, but the direct neuronal effects of ApoE are poorly understood, and the differences between ApoE variants in these effects are unclear. Here, we report that ApoE acts on neurons as a glia-secreted signaling molecule that, among others, enhances synapse formation. In activating neuronal signaling, the three ApoE variants exhibit a differential potency of ApoE4&amp;gt;ApoE3&amp;gt;ApoE2, which mirrors their relative effects on AD risk, suggesting that differential signaling by ApoE variants may contribute to AD pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Separate vmPFC Ensembles Control Cocaine Self-Administration Versus Extinction in Rats</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/37/7394?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent studies suggest that the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) encodes both operant drug self-administration and extinction memories. Here, we examined whether these opposing memories are encoded by distinct neuronal ensembles within the vmPFC with different outputs to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in male and female rats. Using cocaine self-administration (3 h/d for 14 d) and extinction procedures, we demonstrated that vmPFC was similarly activated (indexed by Fos) during cocaine-seeking tests after 0 (no-extinction) or 7 extinction sessions. Selective Daun02 lesioning of the self-administration ensemble (no-extinction) decreased cocaine seeking, whereas Daun02 lesioning of the extinction ensemble increased cocaine seeking. Retrograde tracing with fluorescent cholera toxin subunit B injected into NAc combined with Fos colabeling in vmPFC indicated that vmPFC self-administration ensembles project to NAc core while extinction ensembles project to NAc shell. Functional disconnection experiments (Daun02 lesioning of vmPFC and acute dopamine D1-receptor blockade with SCH39166 in NAc core or shell) confirm that vmPFC ensembles interact with NAc core versus shell to play dissociable roles in cocaine self-administration versus extinction, respectively. Our results demonstrate that neuronal ensembles mediating cocaine self-administration and extinction comingle in vmPFC but have distinct outputs to the NAc core and shell that promote or inhibit cocaine seeking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neuronal ensembles within the vmPFC have recently been shown to play a role in self-administration and extinction of food seeking. Here, we used the Daun02 chemogenetic inactivation procedure, which allows selective inhibition of neuronal ensembles identified by the activity marker Fos, to demonstrate that different ensembles for cocaine self-administration and extinction memories coexist in the ventral mPFC and interact with distinct subregions of the nucleus accumbens.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Circular RNA TLK1 Aggravates Neuronal Injury and Neurological Deficits after Ischemic Stroke via miR-335-3p/TIPARP</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/37/7369?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are expressed at high levels in the brain and are involved in various CNS diseases. However, the potential role of circRNAs in ischemic stroke-associated neuronal injury remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the important functions of circRNA &lt;i&gt;TLK1&lt;/i&gt; (circTLK1) in this process. The levels of circTLK1 were significantly increased in brain tissues in a mouse model of focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. Knockdown of circTLK1 significantly decreased infarct volumes, attenuated neuronal injury, and improved neurological deficits. Furthermore, circTLK1 functioned as an endogenous miR-335-3p sponge to inhibit miR-335-3p activity, resulting in the increase of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin-inducible poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase expression and a subsequent exacerbation of neuronal injury. Clinical studies confirmed increased levels of circTLK1 in the plasma of patients with acute ischemic stroke (59 males and 12 females). Our findings reveal a detrimental role of circTLK1 in ischemic brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The extent of neuronal injury after brain ischemia is a primary factor determining stroke outcomes. However, the molecular switches that control the death of ischemic neurons are poorly understood. While our previous studies indicated the involvement of circRNAs in ischemic stroke, the potential role of circRNAs in neuronal injury remains largely unknown. The levels of circTLK1 were significantly increased in the brain tissue and plasma isolated from animal models of ischemic stroke and patients. Knockdown of circTLK1 significantly decreased infarct volumes, attenuated neuronal injury, and improved subsequent long-term neurological deficits. To our knowledge, these results provide the first definitive evidence that circTLK1 is detrimental in ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Consolidation of conditioned fear to a stimulus (S1) paired with shock requires &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; protein synthesis in the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA), whereas consolidation of conditioned fear to a stimulus (S2) paired with the fear-eliciting S1 requires DNA methylation but not &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; protein synthesis in the BLA. The present experiments merged these protocols by exposing rats to pairings of a serial S2-S1 compound and shock to examine if/when protein synthesis in the BLA is required to consolidate fear to S2. Rats received a BLA infusion of the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, immediately after the S2-S1-shock session and were subsequently tested with S2. The infusion disrupted consolidation of fear to S2 when there had been no prior training of S1 (Experiment 1), the prior training had consisted of unpaired presentations of S1 and shock (Experiment 4), or in pairings of S1 and sucrose (Experiment 5). Consolidation of fear to S2 was unaffected by the infusion of cycloheximide but was disrupted by the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-AZA, when S1 had been previously fear-conditioned (Experiments 2a, 2b, and 3). These findings imply that what has already been learned about S1 determines the BLA processes that consolidate fear to S2. The already-fear-conditioned S1 blocks the S2-shock association that otherwise forms (and whose consolidation requires &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; protein synthesis in the BLA) while simultaneously acting as a learned source of danger for its S2 associate (whose consolidation requires DNA methylation but not &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; protein synthesis in the BLA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Protein synthesis is widely thought to be crucial for consolidating new learning into stable memories, including the consolidation of conditioned fear memories in the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA). However, our data provide clear evidence that the requirement for protein synthesis to consolidate conditioned fear in the BLA depends on an animal's previous training history, and the type of learning that is consolidated. Further, within the BLA, our data show that DNA methylation, and not protein synthesis, is necessary to consolidate higher-order conditioned fear, indicating that epigenetic mechanisms may provide a more fundamental mnemonic substrate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Relating Divisive Normalization to Neuronal Response Variability</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/37/7344?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cortical responses to repeated presentations of a sensory stimulus are variable. This variability is sensitive to several stimulus dimensions, suggesting that it may carry useful information beyond the average firing rate. Many experimental manipulations that affect response variability are also known to engage divisive normalization, a widespread operation that describes neuronal activity as the ratio of a numerator (representing the excitatory stimulus drive) and denominator (the normalization signal). Although it has been suggested that normalization affects response variability, we lack a quantitative framework to determine the relation between the two. Here we extend the standard normalization model, by treating the numerator and the normalization signal as variable quantities. The resulting model predicts a general stabilizing effect of normalization on neuronal responses, and allows us to infer the single-trial normalization strength, a quantity that cannot be measured directly. We test the model on neuronal responses to stimuli of varying contrast, recorded in primary visual cortex of male macaques. We find that neurons that are more strongly normalized fire more reliably, and response variability and pairwise noise correlations are reduced during trials in which normalization is inferred to be strong. Our results thus suggest a novel functional role for normalization, namely, modulating response variability. Our framework could enable a direct quantification of the impact of single-trial normalization strength on the accuracy of perceptual judgments, and can be readily applied to other sensory and nonsensory factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Divisive normalization is a widespread neural operation across sensory and nonsensory brain areas, which describes neuronal responses as the ratio between the excitatory drive to the neuron and a normalization signal. Normalization plays a key role in several important computations, including adjusting the neuron's dynamic range, reducing redundancy, and facilitating probabilistic inference. However, the relation between normalization and neuronal response variability (a fundamental aspect of neural coding) remains unclear. Here we develop a new model and test it on primary visual cortex responses. We show that normalization has a stabilizing effect on neuronal activity, beyond the known suppression of firing rate. This modulation of variability suggests a new functional role for normalization in neural coding and perception.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Functional Architecture and Encoding of Tactile Sensorimotor Behavior in Rat Posterior Parietal Cortex</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/37/7332?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) in rodents is reciprocally connected to primary somatosensory and vibrissal motor cortices. The PPC neuronal circuitry could thus encode and potentially integrate incoming somatosensory information and whisker motor output. However, the information encoded across PPC layers during refined sensorimotor behavior remains largely unknown. To uncover the sensorimotor features represented in PPC during voluntary whisking and object touch, we performed loose-patch single-unit recordings and extracellular recordings of ensemble activity, covering all layers of PPC in anesthetized and awake, behaving male rats. First, using single-cell receptive field mapping, we revealed the presence of coarse somatotopy along the mediolateral axis in PPC. Second, we found that spiking activity was modulated during exploratory whisking in layers 2–4 and layer 6, but not in layer 5 of awake, behaving rats. Population spiking activity preceded actual movement, and whisker trajectory endpoints could be decoded by population spiking, suggesting that PPC is involved in movement planning. Finally, population spiking activity further increased in response to active whisker touch but only in PPC layers 2–4. Thus, we find layer-specific processing, which emphasizes the computational role of PPC during whisker sensorimotor behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is thought to merge information on motor output and sensory input to orchestrate interaction with the environment, but the function of different PPC microcircuit components is poorly understood. We recorded neuronal activity in rat PPC during sensorimotor behavior involving motor and sensory pathways. We uncovered that PPC layers have dedicated function: motor and sensory information is merged in layers 2–4; layer 6 predominantly represents motor information. Collectively, PPC activity predicts future motor output, thus entailing a motor plan. Our results are important for understanding how PPC computationally processes motor output and sensory input. This understanding may facilitate decoding of brain activity when using brain–machine interfaces to overcome loss of function after, for instance, spinal cord injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Sensorimotor Cortical Oscillations during Movement Preparation in 16p11.2 Deletion Carriers</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/37/7321?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sensorimotor deficits are prevalent in many neurodevelopmental disorders like autism, including one of its common genetic etiologies, a 600 kb reciprocal deletion/duplication at 16p11.2. We have previously shown that copy number variations of 16p11.2 impact regional brain volume, white matter integrity, and early sensory responses in auditory cortex. Here, we test the hypothesis that abnormal cortical neurophysiology is present when genes in the 16p11.2 region are haploinsufficient, and in humans that this in turn may account for behavioral deficits specific to deletion carriers. We examine sensorimotor cortical network activity in males and females with 16p11.2 deletions compared with both typically developing individuals, and those with duplications of 16p11.2, using magnetoencephalographic imaging during preparation of overt speech or hand movements in tasks designed to be easy for all participants. In deletion carriers, modulation of beta oscillations (12–30 Hz) were increased during both movement types over effector-specific regions of motor cortices compared with typically developing individuals or duplication carriers, with no task-related performance differences between cohorts, even when corrected for their own cognitive and sensorimotor deficits. Reduced left hemispheric language specialization was observed in deletion carriers but not in duplication carriers. Neural activity over sensorimotor cortices in deletion carriers was linearly related to clinical measures of speech and motor impairment. These findings link insufficient copy number repeats at 16p11.2 to excessive neural activity (e.g., increased beta oscillations) in motor cortical networks for speech and hand motor control. These results have significant implications for understanding the neural basis of autism and related neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The recurrent ~600 kb deletion at 16p11.2 (BP4–BP5) is one of the most common genetic etiologies of ASD and, more generally, of neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, we use high-resolution magnetoencephalographic imaging (MEG-I) to define with millisecond precision the underlying neurophysiological signature of motor impairments for individuals with 16p11.2 deletions. We identify significant increases in beta (12–30 Hz) suppression in sensorimotor cortices related to performance during speech and hand movement tasks. These findings not only provide a neurophysiological phenotype for the clinical presentation of this genetic deletion, but also guide our understanding of how genetic variation encodes for neural oscillatory dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dynamic Interaction between Cortico-Brainstem Pathways during Training-Induced Recovery in Stroke Model Rats</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/37/7306?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Reorganization of residual descending motor circuits underlies poststroke recovery. We previously clarified a causal relationship between the cortico-rubral tract and intensive limb use-induced functional recovery after internal capsule hemorrhage (ICH). However, other descending tracts, such as the cortico-reticular tract, might also be involved in rehabilitation-induced compensation. To investigate whether rehabilitation-induced recovery after ICH involves a shift in the compensatory circuit from the cortico-rubral tract to the cortico-reticular tract, we established loss of function of the cortico-rubral tract or/and cortico-reticular tract using two sets of viral vectors comprising the Tet-on system and designer receptors exclusively activated by the designer drug system. We used an ICH model that destroyed almost 60% of the corticofugal fibers. Anterograde tracing in rehabilitated rats revealed abundant sprouting of axons from the motor cortex in the red nucleus but not in the medullary reticular formation during the early phase of recovery. This primary contribution of the cortico-rubral tract was demonstrated by its selective blockade, whereas selective cortico-reticular tract silencing had little effect. Interestingly, cortico-rubral tract blockade from the start of rehabilitation induced an obvious increase of axon sprouting in the reticular formation with substantial functional recovery. Additional cortico-reticular tract silencing under the cortico-rubral tract blockade significantly worsened the recovered forelimb function. Furthermore, the alternative recruitment of the cortico-reticular tract was gradually induced by intensive limb use under cortico-rubral tract blockade, in which cortico-reticular tract silencing caused an apparent motor deficit. These findings indicate that individual cortico-brainstem pathways have dynamic compensatory potency to support rehabilitative functional recovery after ICH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This study aimed to clarify the interaction between the cortico-rubral and the cortico-reticular tract during intensive rehabilitation and functional recovery after capsular stroke. Pathway-selective disturbance by two sets of viral vectors revealed that the cortico-rubral tract was involved in rehabilitation-induced recovery of forelimb function from an early phase after internal capsule hemorrhage, but that the cortico-reticular tract was not. The sequential disturbance of both tracts revealed that the cortico-reticular tract was recruited and involved in rehabilitation-induced recovery when the cortico-rubral tract failed to function. Our data demonstrate a dynamic compensatory action of individual cortico-brainstem pathways for recovery through poststroke rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Akt Phosphorylates NQO1 and Triggers its Degradation, Abolishing Its Antioxidative Activities in Parkinson's Disease</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/37/7291?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The oxidative metabolism of dopamine and consequent oxidative stress are implicated in dopaminergic neuronal loss, mediating the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). The inducible detoxifying antioxidative enzyme Quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) (NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1), neuroprotective to counteract reactive oxidative species, is most prominent in the active stage of the disease and virtually absent at the end stage of the disease. However, the molecular mechanism dictating NQO1 expression oscillation remains unclear. Here we show that Akt phosphorylates NQO1 at T128 residues and triggers its polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, abrogating its antioxidative effects in PD. Akt binds NQO1 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Interestingly, Akt, but not PINK1, provokes NQO1 phosphorylation and polyubiquitination with Parkin as an E3 ligase. Unphosphorylatable NQO1 mutant displays more robust neuroprotective activity than WT NQO1 in suppressing reactive oxidative species and against MPTP-induced dopaminergic cell death, rescuing the motor disorders in both α-synuclein transgenic transgenic male and female mice elicited by the neurotoxin. Thus, our findings demonstrate that blockade of Akt-mediated NQO1 degradation may ameliorate PD pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Dopaminergic neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with the imbalance of oxidative metabolism of dopamine. Quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1), a potent antioxidant system, its expression levels are prominently increased in the early and intermediate stages of PD and disappeared in the end-stage PD. The molecular modification behavior of NQO1 after it is upregulated by oxidative stress in the early stage of PD, however, remains unclear. This study shows that Akt binds and phosphorylates NQO1 at T128 residue and promotes its ubiquitination and degradation, and Parkin acts as an E3 ligase in this process, which affects the antioxidant capacity of NQO1. This finding provides a novel molecular mechanism for NQO1 oscillation in PD pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Distinct Properties of Layer 3 Pyramidal Neurons from Prefrontal and Parietal Areas of the Monkey Neocortex</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/37/7277?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In primates, working memory function depends on activity in a distributed network of cortical areas that display different patterns of delay task-related activity. These differences are correlated with, and might depend on, distinctive properties of the neurons located in each area. For example, layer 3 pyramidal neurons (L3PNs) differ significantly between primary visual and dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPFC) cortices. However, to what extent L3PNs differ between DLPFC and other association cortical areas is less clear. Hence, we compared the properties of L3PNs in monkey DLPFC versus posterior parietal cortex (PPC), a key node in the cortical working memory network. Using patch-clamp recordings and biocytin cell filling in acute brain slices, we assessed the physiology and morphology of L3PNs from monkey DLPFC and PPC. The L3PN transcriptome was studied using laser microdissection combined with DNA microarray or quantitative PCR. We found that in both DLPFC and PPC, L3PNs were divided into regular spiking (RS-L3PNs) and bursting (B-L3PNs) physiological subtypes. Whereas regional differences in single-cell excitability were modest, B-L3PNs were rare in PPC (RS-L3PN:B-L3PN, 94:6), but were abundant in DLPFC (50:50), showing greater physiological diversity. Moreover, DLPFC L3PNs display larger and more complex basal dendrites with higher dendritic spine density. Additionally, we found differential expression of hundreds of genes, suggesting a transcriptional basis for the differences in L3PN phenotype between DLPFC and PPC. These data show that the previously observed differences between DLPFC and PPC neuron activity during working memory tasks are associated with diversity in the cellular/molecular properties of L3PNs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In the human and nonhuman primate neocortex, layer 3 pyramidal neurons (L3PNs) differ significantly between dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPFC) and sensory areas. Hence, L3PN properties reflect, and may contribute to, a greater complexity of computations performed in DLPFC. However, across association cortical areas, L3PN properties are largely unexplored. We studied the physiology, dendrite morphology and transcriptome of L3PNs from macaque monkey DLPFC and posterior parietal cortex (PPC), two key nodes in the cortical working memory network. L3PNs from DLPFC had greater diversity of physiological properties and larger basal dendrites with higher spine density. Moreover, transcriptome analysis suggested a molecular basis for the differences in the physiological and morphological phenotypes of L3PNs from DLPFC and PPC.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: How to Build a Fast and Highly Sensitive Sound Detector That Remains Robust to Temperature Shifts</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/37/7260?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Frogs must have sharp hearing abilities during the warm summer months to successfully find mating partners. This study aims to understand how frog hair cell ribbon-type synapses preserve both sensitivity and temporal precision during temperature changes. Under room (~24°C) and high (~32°C) temperature, we performed &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; patch-clamp recordings of hair cells and their afferent fibers in amphibian papillae of either male or female bullfrogs. Afferent fibers exhibited a wide heterogeneity in membrane input resistance (R&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;) from 100 m to 1000 m, which may contribute to variations in spike threshold and firing frequency. At higher temperatures, most fibers increased their frequency of spike firing due to an increase in spontaneous EPSC frequencies. Hair cell resting membrane potential (V&lt;sub&gt;rest&lt;/sub&gt;) remained surprisingly stable during temperature increases, because Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; outflux increased simultaneously. This increase in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; current likely enhanced spontaneous EPSC frequencies. These larger &quot;leak currents&quot; at V&lt;sub&gt;rest&lt;/sub&gt; also lowered R&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; and produced higher electrical resonant frequencies. Lowering R&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; will reduce the hair cells receptor potential and presumably moderate the systems sensitivity. Using membrane capacitance measurements, we suggest that hair cells can partially compensate for this reduced sensitivity by increasing exocytosis efficiency and the size of the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles. Furthermore, paired recordings of hair cells and their afferent fibers showed that synaptic delays shortened and multivesicular release becomes more synchronous at higher temperatures, which should improve temporal precision. Together, our results explain many previous &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; observations on the temperature dependence of spikes in auditory nerves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The vertebrate inner ear detects and transmits auditory information over a broad dynamic range of sound frequency and intensity. It achieves remarkable sensitivity to soft sounds and precise frequency selectivity. How does the ear of cold-blooded vertebrates maintain its performance level as temperature changes? More specifically, how does the hair cell to afferent fiber synapse in bullfrog amphibian papilla adjust to a wide range of physiological temperatures without losing its sensitivity and temporal fidelity to sound signals? This study uses &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments to reveal the biophysical mechanisms that explain many observations made from &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; auditory nerve fiber recordings. We find that higher temperature facilitates vesicle exocytosis and electrical tuning to higher sound frequencies, which benefits sensitivity and selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Early Life Inflammation Increases CA1 Pyramidal Neuron Excitability in a Sex and Age Dependent Manner through a Chloride Homeostasis Disruption</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/37/7244?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Early life, systemic inflammation causes long-lasting changes in behavior. To unmask possible mechanisms associated with this phenomenon, we asked whether the intrinsic membrane properties in hippocampal neurons were altered as a consequence of early life inflammation. C57BL/6 mice were bred in-house and both male and female pups from multiple litters were injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 100 μg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle at postnatal day (P)14, and kept until adolescence (P35–P45) or adulthood (P60–P70), when brain slices were prepared for whole-cell and perforated-patch recordings from CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons. In neurons of adult male mice pretreated with LPS, the number of action potentials elicited by depolarizing current pulses was significantly increased compared with control neurons, concomitant with increased input resistance, and a lower action potential threshold. Although these changes were not associated with changes in relevant sodium channel expression or differences in capacitance or dendritic architecture, they were linked to a mechanism involving intracellular chloride overload, revealed through a depolarized GABA reversal potential and increased expression of the chloride transporter, NKCC1. In contrast, no significant changes were observed in neurons of adult female mice pretreated with LPS, nor in adolescent mice of either sex. These data uncover a potential mechanism involving neonatal inflammation-induced plasticity in chloride homeostasis, which may contribute to early life inflammation-induced behavioral alterations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Early life inflammation results in long-lasting changes in many aspects of adult physiology. In this paper we reveal that a brief exposure to early life peripheral inflammation with LPS increases excitability in hippocampal neurons in a sex- and age-dependent manner through a chloride homeostasis disruption. As this hyperexcitability was only seen in adult males, and not in adult females or adolescent animals of either sex, it raises the possibility of a hormonal interaction with early life inflammation. Furthermore, as neonatal inflammation is a normal feature of early life in most animals, as well as humans, these findings may be very important for the development of animal models of disease that more appropriately resemble the human condition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/37/7228?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The landscape of gender in education and the workforce has shifted over the past decades: women have made gains in representation, equitable pay, and recognition through awards, grants, and publications. Despite overall change, differences persist in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). This Viewpoints article on gender disparities in STEM offers an overarching perspective by addressing what the issues are, why the issues may emerge, and how the issues may be solved. In Part 1, recent data on gaps in representation, compensation, and recognition (awards, grants, publications) are reviewed, highlighting differences across subfields (e.g., computer science vs biology) and across career trajectories (e.g., bachelor's degrees vs senior faculty). In Part 2, evidence on leading explanations for these gaps, including explanations centered on abilities, preferences, and explicit and implicit bias, is presented. Particular attention is paid to implicit bias: mental processes that exist largely outside of conscious awareness and control in both male and female perceivers and female targets themselves. Given its prevalence and persistence, implicit bias warrants a central focus for research and application. Finally, in Part 3, the current knowledge is presented on interventions to change individuals' beliefs and behaviors, as well as organizational culture and practices. The moral issues surrounding equal access aside, understanding and addressing the complex issues surrounding gender in STEM are important because of the possible benefits to STEM and society that will be realized only when full participation of all capable and qualified individuals is guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Neuronal circuit activity during neonatal hypoxic‐ischemic seizures in mice</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25601?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To identify circuits active during neonatal hypoxic‐ischemic (HI) seizures and seizure propagation using electroencephalography (EEG), behavior, and whole brain neuronal activity mapping.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mice were exposed to hypoxia‐ischemia on postnatal day (p) 10 using unilateral carotid ligation and global hypoxia. EEG and video were recorded for the duration of the experiment. Using immediately early gene (IEG) reporter mice, active cells expressing cfos were permanently tagged with reporter protein, tdTomato, during a 90 minute window. After one week, allowing maximal expression of the reporter protein, whole brains were processed, lipid cleared, imaged with confocal microscopy. Whole brain reconstruction and analysis of active neurons (colocalized tdTomato/NeuN) was performed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HI resulted in seizure behaviors that were bilateral or unilateral tonic‐clonic and non‐convulsive in this model. Mice exhibited characteristic EEG background patterns, such as, burst suppression and suppression. Neuronal activity mapping revealed bilateral motor cortex and unilateral, ischemic somatosensory cortex, lateral thalamus, and hippocampal circuit activation. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed regional differences in myelination, which coincide with these activity patterns. Astrocytes and blood vessel endothelial cells also expressed cfos during HI.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a combination of EEG, seizure semiology analysis and whole brain neuronal activity mapping we suggest that this rodent model of neonatal hypoxia‐ischemia results in EEG patterns similar to those observed in human neonates. Activation patterns revealed in this study help explain complex seizure behaviors and EEG patterns observed in neonatal HI injury. This pattern may be, in part, secondary to regional differences in development in the neonatal brain.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate the multifactorial processes underlying cognitive aging based on the hypothesis that multiple causal pathways and mechanisms (amyloid, vascular, and resilience) influence longitudinal cognitive decline in each individual through worsening brain health.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;METHODS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified 1230 elderly (aged ≥50 years) with average 4.9 years of clinical follow‐up and with amyloid‐PET, DTI, and structural MRI scans from the population‐based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. We examined imaging markers of amyloid and brain health (white matter microstructural integrity and cortical thinning), systemic vascular health preceding the imaging markers, and early to mid‐life intellectual enrichment to predict longitudinal cognitive trajectories. We used latent growth curve models for modeling longitudinal cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the pathways (amyloid, vascular, resilience) converged through their effects on cortical thinning and worsening cognition and together explained patterns in cognitive decline. Resilience and vascular pathways (aging process, sex differences, education/occupation, and systemic vascular health) had significant impact on white matter microstructural integrity. Education/occupation levels contributed to white matter integrity through systemic vascular health. Worsening white matter integrity contributed to significant cortical thinning and subsequently longitudinal cognitive decline. Baseline amyloidosis contributed to a significant proportion of cognitive decline that accelerated with longer follow‐up times and its primary impact was through cortical thinning.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;INTERPRETATION&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We developed an integrated framework to help explain the dynamic and complex process of cognitive aging by considering key causal pathways. Such an approach is not only important for better comprehension of cognitive aging processes but can aid in the development of successful intervention strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Chronic Dengue Virus Panencephalitis in a Patient with Progressive Dementia with Extrapyramidal Features</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25588?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine the underlying etiology in a patient with progressive dementia with extrapyramidal signs and chronic inflammation referred to the National Institutes of Health Undiagnosed Diseases Program.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extensive investigations included metabolic profile, autoantibody panel, infectious etiologies, genetic screening, whole exome sequencing, and the phage‐display assay, VirScan, for viral immune responses. An etiological diagnosis was established postmortem.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using VirScan, enrichment of dengue viral antibodies was detected in cerebrospinal fluid as compared to serum. No virus was detected in serum or cerebrospinal fluid, but postmortem analysis confirmed dengue virus in the brain by immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and sequencing. Dengue virus was also detectable by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing from brain biopsy tissue collected 33 months antemortem, confirming a chronic infection despite a robust immune response directed against the virus. Immunoprofiling and whole exome sequencing of the patient did not reveal any immunodeficiency, and sequencing of the virus demonstrated wild‐type dengue virus in the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dengue virus is the most common arbovirus worldwide and represents a significant public health concern. Infections with dengue virus are usually self‐limiting, and chronic dengue infections have not been previously reported. Our findings suggest that dengue virus infections may persist in the central nervous system causing a panencephalitis and should be considered in patients with progressive dementia with extrapyramidal features in endemic regions or with relevant travel history. Furthermore, this work highlights the utility of comprehensive antibody profiling assays to aid in the diagnosis of encephalitis of unknown etiology. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Lasting Effects of Low-Frequency Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Writer’s Cramp: a Case Report</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00314</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The treatment of writer’s cramp (W’sC) is essentially based on the use of botulinum toxin. However, additional treatments are sometime required to prolong the effects of the toxin, compensate for its progressive loss of efficacy in some subjects, and re-educate handwriting (e.g., rehabilitation strategies). Low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been employed to improve W’sC, but with short-lasting and controversial outcomes. We report on the effects of a long-lasting low-frequency rTMS paradigm on W’sC symptoms. A 25 year-old male with a diagnosis of simple W’sC was enrolled in the study. He underwent an objective assessment using the Writer's Cramp Rating Scale and the 1-minute writing test. Further, we recorded muscle activation of the upper limb during handwriting using an EMG wireless system. The patient was provided with 1200 biphasic magnetic pulses delivered at 1 Hz over the left premotor cortex (PMC), 15 times scheduled every two days, thus covering a period of 5 weeks, followed by 10 days of rest. This block of stimulations was practiced other four times, for a period of six months. The patient showed a gradual clinical improvement with the progression of the treatments. W’sC symptoms totally disappeared and all the clinical scores showed a significant improvement after rTMS completion. Such improvement lasted up to one year after the end of the treatment. Moreover, we detected a long-lasting improvement in sensorimotor plasticity as measured by a paired associative stimulation protocol. Our case suggests that the long-lasting application of 1Hz rTMS to PMC is a safe and potentially valuable tool to improve W’sC symptoms enduringly, probably by reverting maladaptive plasticity mechanisms within the sensory-motor areas of the hemisphere contralateral to the dystonic hand.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The ability to reuse lessons from past experiences is one of the most
critical abilities for intelligent behavior. In this paper, we introduce three
terms: kernel, kernel dimension, and kernelization. The first to describe what
is being reused, the second to describe the size of what is being reused, and
the last to describe the process of seeking past experience from present input.
Based on the abnormalities of two psychiatric disorders, autism and
schizophrenia, we hypothesize that the structure of the pyramidal neurons of
the Prefrontal Cortex determines the dimension and we make two demonstrations
with artificial intelligence - one to show that certain a structural property
of influences the kernel dimension and the other to show that cognitive
functioning is effected by the dimension of the kernel.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04400</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Prediction in language has traditionally been studied using simple designs in
which neural responses to expected and unexpected words are compared in a
categorical fashion. However, these designs have been contested as being
`prediction encouraging', potentially exaggerating the importance of prediction
in language understanding. A few recent studies have begun to address these
worries by using model-based approaches to probe the effects of linguistic
predictability in naturalistic stimuli (e.g. continuous narrative). However,
these studies so far only looked at very local forms of prediction, using
models that take no more than the prior two words into account when computing a
word's predictability. Here, we extend this approach using a state-of-the-art
neural language model that can take roughly 500 times longer linguistic
contexts into account. Predictability estimates from the neural network offer a
much better fit to EEG data from subjects listening to naturalistic narrative
than simpler models, and reveal strong surprise responses akin to the P200 and
N400. These results show that predictability effects in language are not a
side-effect of simple designs, and demonstrate the practical use of recent
advances in AI for the cognitive neuroscience of language.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04390</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We show that fMRI analysis using machine learning tools are sufficient to
distinguish valence (i.e., positive or negative) of freely retrieved
autobiographical memories in a cross-participant setting. Our methodology uses
feature selection (ReliefF) in combination with boosting methods, both applied
directly to data represented in voxel space. In previous work using the same
data set, Nawa and Ando showed that whole-brain based classification could
achieve above-chance classification accuracy only when both training and
testing data came from the same individual. In a cross-participant setting,
classification results were not statistically significant. Additionally, on
average the classification accuracy obtained when using ReliefF is
substantially higher than previous results - 81% for the within-participant
classification, and 62% for the cross-participant classification. Furthermore,
since features are defined in voxel space, it is possible to show brain maps
indicating the regions of that are most relevant in determining the results of
the classification. Interestingly, the voxels that were selected using the
proposed computational pipeline seem to be consistent with current
neurophysiological theories regarding the brain regions actively involved in
autobiographical memory processes.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04358</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A given neural network in the brain is involved in many different tasks. This
implies that, when considering a specific task, the network's connectivity
contains a component which is related to the task and another component which
can be considered random. Understanding the interplay between the structured
and random components, and their effect on network dynamics and functionality
is an important open question. Recent studies addressed the co-existence of
random and structured connectivity, but considered the two parts to be
uncorrelated. This constraint limits the dynamics and leaves the random
connectivity non-functional. Algorithms that train networks to perform specific
tasks typically generate correlations between structure and random
connectivity. Here we study nonlinear networks with correlated structured and
random components, assuming the structure to have a low rank. We develop an
analytic framework to establish the precise effect of the correlations on the
eigenvalue spectrum of the joint connectivity. We find that the spectrum
consists of a bulk and multiple outliers, whose location is predicted by our
theory. Using mean-field theory, we show that these outliers directly determine
both the fixed points of the system and their stability. Taken together, our
analysis elucidates how correlations allow structured and random connectivity
to synergistically extend the range of computations available to networks.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10037</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The human brain can effectively learn a new task from a small number of
samples, which indicate that the brain can transfer its prior knowledge to
solve tasks in different domains. This function is analogous to transfer
learning (TL) in the field of machine learning. TL uses a well-trained feature
space in a specific task domain to improve performance in new tasks with
insufficient training data. TL with rich feature representations, such as
features of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), shows high generalization
ability across different task domains. However, such TL is still insufficient
in making machine learning attain generalization ability comparable to that of
the human brain. To examine if the internal representation of the brain could
be used to achieve more efficient TL, we introduce a method for TL mediated by
human brains. Our method transforms feature representations of audiovisual
inputs in CNNs into those in activation patterns of individual brains via their
association learned ahead using measured brain responses. Then, to estimate
labels reflecting human cognition and behavior induced by the audiovisual
inputs, the transformed representations are used for TL. We demonstrate that
our brain-mediated TL (BTL) shows higher performance in the label estimation
than the standard TL. In addition, we illustrate that the estimations mediated
by different brains vary from brain to brain, and the variability reflects the
individual variability in perception. Thus, our BTL provides a framework to
improve the generalization ability of machine-learning feature representations
and enable machine learning to estimate human-like cognition and behavior,
including individual variability.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The brain is an assembly of neuronal populations interconnected by structural
pathways. Brain activity is expressed on and constrained by this substrate.
Therefore, statistical dependencies between functional signals in directly
connected areas can be expected higher. However, the degree to which brain
function is bound by the underlying wiring diagram remains a complex question
that has been only partially answered. Here, we introduce the
structural-decoupling index to quantify the coupling strength between structure
and function, and we reveal a macroscale gradient from brain regions more
strongly coupled, to regions more strongly decoupled, than expected by
realistic surrogate data. This gradient spans behavioral domains from
lower-level sensory function to high-level cognitive ones and shows for the
first time that the strength of structure-function coupling is spatially
varying in line with evidence derived from other modalities, such as functional
connectivity, gene expression, microstructural properties and temporal
hierarchy.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Climbing Fibers Provide Graded Error Signals in Cerebellar Learning</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00046</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The cerebellum plays a critical role in coordinating and learning complex movements. Although its importance has been well recognized, the mechanisms of learning remain hotly debated. According to the classical cerebellar learning theory, depression of parallel fiber synapses instructed by error signals from climbing fibers, drives cerebellar learning. The uniqueness of long-term depression (LTD) in cerebellar learning has been challenged by evidence showing multi-site synaptic plasticity. In Purkinje cells, long-term potentiation (LTP) of parallel fiber synapses is now well established and it can be achieved with or without climbing fiber signals, making the role of climbing fiber input more puzzling. The central question is how individual Purkinje cells extract global errors based on climbing fiber input. Previous data seemed to demonstrate that climbing fibers are inefficient instructors, because they were thought to carry “binary” error signals to individual Purkinje cells, which significantly constrains the efficiency of cerebellar learning in several regards. In recent years, new evidence has challenged the traditional view of “binary” climbing fiber responses, suggesting that climbing fibers can provide graded information to efficiently instruct individual Purkinje cells to learn. Here we review recent experimental and theoretical progress regarding modulated climbing fiber responses in Purkinje cells. Analog error signals are generated by the interaction of varying climbing fibers inputs with simultaneous other synaptic input and with firing states of targeted Purkinje cells. Accordingly, the calcium signals which trigger synaptic plasticity can be graded in both amplitude and spatial range to affect the learning rate and even learning direction. We briefly discuss how these new findings complement the learning theory and help to further our understanding of how the cerebellum works.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: T Cells as an Emerging Target for Chronic Pain Therapy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00216</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The immune system is critically involved in the development and maintenance of chronic pain. However, T cells, one of the main regulators of the immune response, have only recently become a focus of investigations on chronic pain pathophysiology. Emerging clinical data suggest that patients with chronic pain have a different phenotypic profile of circulating T cells compared to controls. At the preclinical level, findings on the function of T cells are mixed and differ between nerve injury, chemotherapy, and inflammatory models of persistent pain. Depending on the type of injury, the subset of T cells and the sex of the animal, T cells may contribute to the onset and/or the resolution of pain, underlining T cells as a major player in the transition from acute to chronic pain. Specific T cell subsets release mediators such as cytokines and endogenous opioid peptides that can promote, suppress, or even resolve pain. Inhibiting the pain-promoting functions of T cells and/or enhancing the beneficial effects of pro-resolution T cells may offer new disease-modifying strategies for the treatment of chronic pain, a critical need in view of the current opioid crisis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Generation and Characterization of Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells and Retinal Organoids From a Leber’s Congenital Amaurosis Patient With Novel RPE65 Mutations</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00212</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;RPE65-associated Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is one of highly heterogeneous, early onset, severe retinal dystrophies with at least 130 gene mutation sites identified. Their pathogenicity has not been directly clarified due to lack of diseased cells. Here, we generated human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from one putative LCA patient carrying two novel RPE65 mutations with c.200T&amp;gt;G (p.L67R) and c.430T&amp;gt;C (p.Y144H), named RPE65-hiPSCs, which were confirmed to contain the same mutations. The RPE65-hiPSCs presented typical morphological features with normal karyotype, expressed pluripotency markers, and developed teratoma in NOD-SCID mice. Moreover, the patient hiPSCs were able to differentiate toward retinal lineage fate and self-form retinal organoids with layered neural retina. All major retinal cell types including photoreceptor and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells were also acquired overtime. Compared to healthy control, RPE cells from patient iPSCs had lower expression of RPE65, but similar phagocytic activity and VEGF secretion level. This study provided the valuable patient specific, disease targeted retinal organoids containing photoreceptor and RPE cells, which would facilitate the study of personalized pathogenic mechanisms of disease, drug screening, and cell replacement therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Semantic Incongruency Interferes With Endogenous Attention in Cross-Modal Integration of Semantically Congruent Objects</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00053</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Efficient multisensory integration is often influenced by other cognitive processes including, but not limited to, semantic congruency and focused endogenous attention. Semantic congruency can re-allocate processing resources to the location of a congruent stimulus, while attention can prioritize the integration of multi-sensory stimuli under focus. Here, we explore the robustness of this phenomenon in the context of three stimuli, two of which are in the focus of endogenous attention. Participants completed an endogenous attention task with a stimulus compound consisting of 3 different objects: (1) a visual object (V) in the foreground, (2) an auditory object (A), and (3) a visual background scene object (B). Three groups of participants focused their attention on either the visual object and auditory sound (Group VA, n = 30), the visual object and the background (VB, n = 27), or the auditory sound and the background (AB, n = 30), and judged the semantic congruency of the objects under focus. Congruency varied systematically across all 3 stimuli: All stimuli could be semantically incongruent (e.g., V, ambulance; A, church bell; and B, swimming-pool) or all could be congruent (e.g., V, lion; A, roar; and B, savannah), or two objects could be congruent with the remaining one incongruent to the other two (e.g., V, duck; A, quack; and B, phone booth). Participants exhibited a distinct pattern of errors: when participants attended two congruent objects (e.g., group VA: V, lion; A, roar), in the presence of an unattended, incongruent third object (e.g., B, bath room) they tended to make more errors than in any other stimulus combination. Drift diffusion modeling of the behavioral data revealed a significantly smaller drift rate in two-congruent-attended condition, indicating slower evidence accumulation, which was likely due to interference from the unattended, incongruent object. Interference with evidence accumulation occurred independently of which pair of objects was in the focus of attention, which suggests that the vulnerability of congruency judgments to incongruent unattended distractors is not affected by sensory modalities. A control analysis ruled out the simple explanation of a negative response bias. These findings implicate that our perceptual system is highly sensitive to semantic incongruencies even when they are not endogenously attended.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Linear Registration of Brain MRI Using Knowledge-Based Multiple Intermediator Libraries</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00909</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Linear registration is often the crucial first step for various types of image analysis. Although this is mathematically simple, failure is not uncommon. When investigating the brain by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the brain is the target organ for registration but the existence of other tissues, in addition to a variety of fields of view, different brain locations, orientations and anatomical features, poses some serious fundamental challenges. Consequently, a number of different algorithms have been put forward to minimize potential errors. In the present study, we tested a knowledge-based approach that can be combined with any form of registration algorithm. This approach consisted of a library of intermediate images (mediators) with known transformation to the target image. Test images were first registered to all mediators and the best mediator was selected to ensure optimum registration to the target. In order to select the best mediator, we evaluated two similarity criteria: the sum of squared differences and mutual information. This approach was applied to 48 mediators and 96 test images. In order to reduce one of the main drawbacks of the approach, increased computation time, we reduced the size of the library by clustering. Our results indicated clear improvement in registration accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00856</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The spontaneous dynamic characteristics of resting-state functional networks contain much internal brain physiological or pathological information. The metastate analysis of brain functional networks is an effective technique to quantify the essence of brain functional connectome dynamics. However, the widely used functional connectivity-based metastate analysis ignored the topological structure, which could be locally reflected by node centrality. In this study, 23 healthy young volunteers (21–26 years) were recruited and scanned twice with a 1-week interval. Based on the time sequences of node centrality, we promoted a node centrality-based clustering method to find metastates of functional connectome and conducted a test-retest experiment to assess the stability of those identified metastates using the described method. The hub regions of metastates were further compared with the structural networks’ organization to depict its potential relationship with brain structure. Results of extracted metastates showed repeatable dynamic features between repeated scans and high overlapping rate of hub regions with brain intrinsic sub-networks. These identified hub patterns from metastates further highly overlapped with the structural hub regions. These findings indicated that the proposed node centrality-based metastates detection method could reveal reliable and meaningful metastates of spontaneous dynamics and indicate the underlying nature of brain dynamics as well as the potential relationship between these dynamics and the organization of the brain connectome.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Theories and Methods for Labeling Cognitive Workload: Classification and Transfer Learning</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00295</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There are a number of key data-centric questions that must be answered when developing classifiers for operator functional states. “Should a supervised or unsupervised learning approach be used? What degree of labeling and transformation must be performed on the data? What are the trade-offs between algorithm flexibility and model interpretability, as generally these features are at odds?” Here, we focus exclusively on the labeling of cognitive load data for supervised learning. We explored three methods of labeling cognitive states for three-state classification. The first method labels states derived from a tertiary split of trial difficulty during a spatial memory task. The second method was more adaptive; it employed a mixed-effects stress–strain curve and estimated an individual’s performance asymptotes with respect to the same spatial memory task. The final method was similar to the second approach; however, it employed a mixed-effects Rasch model to estimate individual capacity limits within the context of item response theory for the spatial memory task. To assess the strength of each of these labeling approaches, we compared the area under the curve (AUC) for receiver operating curves (ROCs) from elastic net and random forest classifiers. We chose these classifiers based on a combination of interpretability, flexibility, and past modeling success. We tested these techniques across two groups of individuals and two tasks to test the effects of different labeling techniques on cross-person and cross-task transfer. Overall, we observed that the Rasch model labeling paired with a random forest classifier led to the best model fits and showed evidence of both cross-person and cross-task transfer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Stochastic Resonance (SR) and Coherence Resonance (CR) are non-linear phenomena, in which an optimal amount of noise maximizes an objective function, such as the sensitivity for weak signals in SR, or the coherence of stochastic oscillations in CR. Here, we demonstrate a related phenomenon, which we call “Recurrence Resonance” (RR): noise can also improve the information flux in recurrent neural networks. In particular, we show for the case of three-neuron motifs with ternary connection strengths that the mutual information between successive network states can be maximized by adding a suitable amount of noise to the neuron inputs. This striking result suggests that noise in the brain may not be a problem that needs to be suppressed, but indeed a resource that is dynamically regulated in order to optimize information processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Developmental Aspects of Glucose and Calcium Availability on the Persistence of Memory Function Over the Lifespan</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00253</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An important aspect concerning the underlying nature of memory function is an understanding of how memories are acquired and lost. The stability, and ultimate demise, of memory over the lifespan of an organism remains a critical topic in determining the neurobiological mechanisms that mediate memory representations. This has important implications for the elucidation and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). One important question in the context of preserving functional plasticity over the lifespan is the determination of the neurobiological structural and functional changes that contribute to the formation of memory during the juvenile time frame that might provide protection against later memory dysfunction by promoting the establishment of redundant neural pathways. The main question being, if memory formation during the juvenile period does strengthen and preserve memory stability over the lifespan, what are the neurobiological structural or functional substrates that mediate this effect? One neural attribute whose function may be altered with early life experience and provide a mechanism to preserve memory through the lifespan is glucose transport-linked calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) buffering. Because peak increases in glucose utilization overlap with a timeframe during which spatial training can enhance later memory processing, it might be the case that learning-associated changes in glucose utilization would provide an important neural functional change to preserve memory function throughout the lifespan. The glucose transporters are proteins that are reduced in AD pathology and there is evidence that glucose reductions can impair Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; buffering. In the absence of an appropriate supply of ATP, provided via glucose transport and glycolysis, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels can rise leading to neural vulnerability with ensuing pathological outcomes. In this review, we explore the hypothesis that enhancing glucose utilization with spatial training during the preadolescent period will provide a functional enhancement that regulates glucose-dependent Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling during aging or neurodegeneration and provide essential neural resources to preserve functional plasticity and memory function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00251</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This study evaluates the longitudinal changes in the amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition with [18F]-flutemetamol (FMM) PET imaging across the spectrum of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), compared with [11C]-Pittsburgh Compound-B (PIB) PET. Eleven AD, 17 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 13 cognitively normal (CN) subjects underwent neuropsychological assessment and amyloid PET imaging using [18F]-FMM and [11C]-PIB during a follow-up period. Regions of interest were defined on co-registered MRI, and the FMM and PIB standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) was used in the same cortical regions. The annual rate of change in FMM and PIB SUVRs was calculated. Cortical FMM SUVR in amyloid-positive subjects increased over a follow-up of 3.1 ± 0.5 years. An individual FMM SUVR was significantly correlated with PIB SUVR at baseline and at follow-up in the same AD, MCI, and CN subjects. The annual rate of increase in FMM SUVR was significantly greater in typical amyloid-positive (0.033 ± 0.023, n = 7), focal positive MCI (0.076 ± 0.034, n = 4) and positive CN (0.039 ± 0.027, n = 4) while that in AD (0.020 ± 0.018, n = 11) was smaller. Among amyloid-positive patients, the baseline FMM SUVR was inversely related with the increased rate in FMM SUVR (r=−0.44, n = 26, p &amp;lt; 0.05). An individual annual rate in change of cortical FMM SUVR was significantly correlated with that in cortical PIB SUVR. Our results suggest that the [18F]-FMM PET imaging can clarify the longitudinal assessment of Aβ deposition across the AD spectrum, similarly to [11C]-PIB PET. The Increase in Aβ deposition is faster in the predementia stage but not at a constant rate across the clinical stages of the AD spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: PET Imaging of Astrogliosis and Tau Facilitates Diagnosis of Parkinsonian Syndromes</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00249</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative parkinsonian syndromes comprise a number of disorders that are characterized by similar clinical features but are separated on the basis of different pathologies, i.e., aggregates of α-synuclein or tau protein. Due to the overlap of signs and symptoms a precise differentiation is often difficult, especially early in the disease course. Enormous efforts have been taken to develop tau-selective PET imaging agents, but strong off-target binding to monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) has been observed across first generation ligands. Nonetheless, astrogliosis-related MAO-B elevation is a common histopathological known feature of all parkinsonian syndromes and might be itself an interesting imaging target. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the performance of [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]-THK5351, a combined MAO-B and tau tracer for differential diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes. [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]-THK5351 PET was performed in 34 patients: six with Parkinson’s disease (PD), nine with multiple system atrophy with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P), six with MSA with predominant cerebellar ataxia (MSA-C), and 13 with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) Richardson’s syndrome. Volume-of-interest-based quantification of standardized-uptake-values was conducted in different parkinsonian syndrome-related target regions. PET results were subjected to multinomial logistic regression to create a prediction model discriminating among groups. Furthermore, we correlated tracer uptake with clinical findings. Elevated [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]-THK5351 uptake in midbrain and diencephalon differentiated PSP patients from PD and MSA-C. MSA-C patients were distinguishable by high tracer uptake in the pons and cerebellar deep white matter when compared to PSP and PD patients, whereas MSA-P patients tended to show higher tracer uptake in the lentiform nucleus. A multinomial logistic regression classified 33/34 patients into the correct clinical diagnosis group. Tracer uptake in the pons, cerebellar deep white matter, and striatum was closely associated with the presence of cerebellar and parkinsonian symptoms of MSA patients. The current study demonstrates that combined MAO-B and tau binding of THK5351 facilitates differential diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes. Furthermore, our data indicate a correlation of MSA phenotype with [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]-THK5351 uptake in certain brain regions, illustrating their relevance for the emergence of clinical symptoms and underlining the potential of THK5351 PET as a biomarker that correlates with pathological changes as well as with disease stage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Classical models of cerebellar learning posit that climbing fibers operate according to a supervised learning rule to instruct changes in motor output by signaling the occurrence of movement errors. However, cerebellar output is also associated with non-motor behaviors, and recently with modulating reward association pathways in the VTA. To test how the cerebellum processes reward related signals in the same type of classical conditioning behavior typically studied to evaluate reward processing in the VTA and striatum, we have used calcium imaging to visualize instructional signals carried by climbing fibers across the lateral cerebellum in mice before and after learning. We find distinct climbing fiber responses in three lateral cerebellar regions that can each signal reward prediction. These instructional signals are well suited to guide cerebellar learning based on reward expectation and enable a cerebellar contribution to reward driven behaviors, suggesting a broad role for the lateral cerebellum in reward-based learning.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/46668</link>
	<content:encoded>Herbivore natural enemies protect plants by regulating herbivore populations. Whether they can alter the behavior of their prey to increase predation success is unknown. We investigate if and how infection by the entomopathogenic nematode &lt;i&gt;Heterorhabditis bacteriophora&lt;/i&gt; changes the behavior of healthy larvae of the western corn rootworm (&lt;i&gt;Diabrotica virgifera&lt;/i&gt;), a major pest of maize. We found that nematode-infected rootworm cadavers are attractive to rootworm larvae, and that this behavior increases nematode reproductive success. Nematode-infected rootworms release distinct volatile bouquets, including the unusual volatile butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). BHT alone attracts rootworms, and increases nematode reproductive success. A screen of different nematode and herbivore species shows that attraction of healthy hosts to nematode-infected cadavers is widespread and likely involves species-specific volatile cues. This study reveals a new facet of the biology of herbivore natural enemies that boosts their predation success by increasing the probability of host encounters.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Allosteric interactions between the voltage-sensing domain (VSD), the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-binding sites, and the pore domain govern the mammalian Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;- and voltage-activated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (BK) channel opening. However, the functional relevance of the crosstalk between the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;- and voltage-sensing mechanisms on BK channel gating is still debated. We examined the energetic interaction between Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; binding and VSD activation by investigating the effects of internal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; on BK channel gating currents. Our results indicate that Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensor occupancy has a strong impact on VSD activation through a coordinated interaction mechanism in which Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; binding to a single α-subunit affects all VSDs equally. Moreover, the two distinct high-affinity Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-binding sites contained in the C-terminus domains, RCK1 and RCK2, contribute equally to decrease the free energy necessary to activate the VSD. We conclude that voltage-dependent gating and pore opening in BK channels is modulated to a great extent by the interaction between Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensors and VSDs.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Hormonal and neural correlates of care in active versus observing poison frog parents</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/765503v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The occasional reversal of sex-typical behavior across species suggests that many of the neural circuits underlying behavior are conserved between males and females and can be activated in response to the appropriate social condition or stimulus. Most poison frog species (Family Dendrobatidae) exhibit male uniparental care, but flexible compensation has been observed in some species, where females can perform parental care duties when males disappear. Here, we investigated hormonal and neural mechanisms of sex-typical and sex-reversed parental care in a typically male uniparental species, the Dyeing Poison Frog (Dendrobates tinctorius). We first characterized hormone levels and whole brain gene expression across parental care stages during sex-typical behavior. Surprisingly, hormonal changes and brain gene expression differences associated with parental care in males were mirrored in their non-caregiving female partners. To further explore the disconnect between underlying neuroendocrine mechanisms and behavior, we characterized hormone levels and neural activity patterns in females performing sex-reversed parental care. In contrast to hormone and gene expression patterns, we found that patterns of neural activity were linked to the active performance of parental behavior, with sex-reversed tadpole transporting females exhibiting neural activity patterns more similar to those of transporting males than non-caregiving females. We suggest that parallels in hormones and brain gene expression in parental males and non-caregiving females are related to the ability of females to flexibly take over parental care in the absence of their male partners.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The hippocampus is critical for spatial relational attention</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/765222v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The hippocampus is traditionally considered to be a system that is specialized for long-term memory. Recent work has challenged this notion by demonstrating that this region can contribute to many domains of cognition beyond long-term memory, including perception and attention. One potential reason why the hippocampus contributes broadly to cognition is that it contains relational representations - representations of muli-dimensional features of experience - that are useful in many different cognitive domains. Here, we explore the hypothesis that the hippocampus plays a critical role in attention via its relational representations. We compared human participants with hippocampal damage to healthy age- and education-matched individuals on attention tasks that varied in the type and amount of relational processing required. On each trial, participants viewed two images (rooms with paintings). On room relational trials, they judged whether the rooms had the same spatial layout from a different perspective. On art relational trials, they judged whether the paintings could have been painted by the same artist. Control trials placed fewer demands on relational processing: Participants simply had to detect identical paintings or rooms. Patients with hippocampal damage were significantly impaired on the room relational task. Selective hippocampal lesions had comparable effects to more extensive medial temporal lobe damage, suggesting that the hippocampus itself plays a critical role in spatial relational attention. This work provides further evidence that the hippocampus plays a ubiquitous role in cognition by virtue of its relational representations, and highlights that spatial relations may be particularly important.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: From competing motor plans to a single action within a single trial on the human motor periphery</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/765180v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Contemporary theories of motor control have suggested that multiple motor commands compete for action selection. While most of these competitions are completed prior to movement onset, averaged saccadic eye movements that land at an intermediate location between two visual targets are thought to arise when a movement is initiated prior to the resolution of the competition. In contrast, while averaged reach movements have been reported, there is still debate on whether averaged reach movements are the result of a resolved competition between two potential actions or a strategic behavior that optimally incorporates the current task demands. Here, we use a reach version of the paradigm that has previously shown to elicit saccadic averaging to examine whether similar averaging occurs based on neuromuscular activity of an upper limb muscle. On a single trial basis, we observed a temporal evolution of the two competing motor commands during a free-choice reach task to one of two visual targets. The initial wave of directionally-tuned muscle activity (~100 ms after target onset) was an averaged of the two motor commands which then transformed into a single goal-directed motor command at the onset of the voluntary reach (~200-300 ms after target onset). The transition from an early motor command to a single goal-direct command resembled the fact that saccadic averaging was most prominent for short-latency saccades. Further, the idiosyncratic choice made on a given trial was correlated with the biases in the averaged motor command.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Neurocognitive patterns dissociating semantic processing from executive control are linked to more detailed off-task mental time travel</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/765073v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Features of ongoing experience are common across individuals and cultures. However, certain people express specific patterns to a greater extent than others. The current psychological theory assumes that individual differences in thought patterns occur because different types of experience depend on differences in associated neurocognitive mechanisms. Consequently, individual variation in the underlying neurocognitive architecture is hypothesised to determine the ease with which certain thought patterns are generated or maintained. Our study (N=178) tested this hypothesis using multivariate pattern analysis to infer shared variance among measures of cognitive function and neural organisation and examined whether these hidden structures explain reports of the patterns of on-going thoughts people experienced in the lab. We found that relatively better performance on tasks requiring primarily semantic knowledge, rather than executive control, was linked to a neural functional organisation that was associated, via meta-analysis, with task labels related to semantic associations (sentence processing, reading and verbal semantics). Variability of this functional mode predicted significant individual variation in the types of thoughts that individuals experienced in the laboratory: Neurocognitive patterns linked to better performance at tasks that required guidance from semantic representation, rather than those dependent on executive control, were associated with patterns of thought characterised by greater subjective detail and a focus on time periods other than the here and now. These relationships were consistent across different days and did not vary with task condition, indicating they are relatively stable features of an individual's cognitive profile. Together these data confirm that individual variation in aspects of ongoing experience can be inferred from hidden neurocognitive architecture and demonstrate that performance trade-offs between executive control and long term semantic knowledge are linked to a person's tendency to imagine situations that transcend the here and now.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Sequences of Intonation Units Form a 1 Hz Rhythm</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/765016v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Studies of speech processing investigate the relationship between temporal structure in speech stimuli and neural activity (Giraud &amp;amp; Poeppel, 2012; Gross et al., 2013; Park, Ince, Schyns, Thut, &amp;amp; Gross, 2015). The speech envelope, a representation of speech that captures amplitude fluctuations in the acoustic speech signal, has been used to probe this temporal relationship. The envelope is most commonly understood to reflect the succession of syllables at ~5 Hz (Ding et al., 2017; Greenberg, Carvey, Hitchcock, &amp;amp; Chang, 2003; Raesaenen, Doyle, &amp;amp; Frank, 2018; Varnet, Ortiz-Barajas, Erra, Gervain, &amp;amp; Lorenzi, 2017). Despite clear evidence for auditory tracking of the envelope at lower frequencies (Gross et al., 2013; Park et al., 2015), it is not well understood what linguistic information is captured in the speech envelope beyond the syllable level. Here, we harness linguistic theory to focus on Intonation Units (IUs), while analyzing their temporal structure as captured in the speech envelope. IUs are prosodic units (Chafe, 1994; Du Bois, Cumming, Schuetze-Coburn, &amp;amp; Paolino, 1992; Himmelmann, Sandler, Strunk, &amp;amp; Unterladstetter, 2018) which are defined by a specific pattern of syllable delivery, together with resets in pitch and articulatory force. Linguistic studies of spontaneous speech indicate that this prosodic segmentation paces new information in language use across numerous and diverse languages. Therefore, IUs provide an important structural cue for the cognitive dynamics producing and comprehending speech universally. We study the relation between IUs and the periodic components of the speech envelope in six languages. We apply analysis methods from investigations of neural synchronization (Vinck, van Wingerden, Womelsdorf, Fries, &amp;amp; Pennartz, 2010) to study recordings from every-day speech contexts of over 100 speakers. We find that sequences of IUs form a consistent 1 Hz rhythm. Our results demonstrate that IUs form a significant periodic cue within the speech envelope that could be utilized by the cognitive and neural systems when tracking speech.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Saccadic foraging reveals mechanisms of value-based decision-making in primate superior colliculus</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/764357v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Much progress has been made in understanding the neural basis of value-based decision-making using two-alternative forced-choice tasks. A limitation of these tasks is that the value of each option is often confounded with other cognitive factors (e.g. attention/choice probability/motor preparation). To overcome this limitation, monkeys were trained to use gaze to forage among many visual targets of varying value while neurophysiology was conducted in the saccade control center superior colliculus (SC). Surprisingly, each target's value was represented in the SC predominantly in an absolute manner, that is, irrespective of the value of other available items. After fixating a target, the next choice was quickly selected once neural activity rose to a provisional selection level. This selection level systematically decreased, not as individual targets were harvested, but only after a class of value items was completely depleted. Our results reveal the exquisite balance across SC activities that transform value to choice.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Multi-hit autism genomic architecture evidenced from consanguineous families with involvement of FEZF2 and mutations in high-risk genes</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/759480v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) are a heterogeneous collection of neurodevelopmental disorders with a strong genetic basis. Recent studies identified that a single hit of either a de novo or transmitted gene-disrupting, or likely gene-disrupting, mutation in a subset of 65 strongly associated genes can be sufficient to generate an ASD phenotype. We took advantage of consanguineous families with an ASD proband to evaluate this model. By a genome-wide homozygosity mapping of ten families with eleven children displaying ASD, we identified a linkage region of 133 kb in five families at the 3p14.2 locus that includes FEZF2 with a LOD score of 5.8 suggesting a founder effect. Sequencing FEZF2 revealed a common deletion of four codons. However, the damaging FEZF2 mutation did not appear to be sufficient to induce the disease as non-affected parents also carry the mutation and, similarly, Fezf2 knockout mouse embryos electroporated with the mutant human FEZF2 construct did not display any obvious defects in the corticospinal tract, a pathway whose development depends on FEZF2. We extended the genetic analysis of these five FEZF2-linked families versus five FEZF2 non-linked families by studying de novo and transmitted copy number variation (CNV) and performing Whole Exome Sequencing (WES). We identified damaging mutations in the subset of 65 genes strongly associated with ASD whose co-expression analysis suggests an impact on the prefrontal cortex during the mid-fetal periods. From these results, we propose that both FEZF2 deletion and multiple hits in the repertoire of these 65 genes are necessary to generate an ASD phenotype.</content:encoded>

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in American men. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has become a standard treatment strategy for advanced PCa. Although a majority of patients initially respond to ADT well, most of them will eventually develop castration-resistant PCa (CRPC). Previous studies suggest that ADT-induced changes in the immune microenvironment (mE) in PCa might be responsible for the failures of various therapies. However, the role of the immune system in CRPC development remains unclear. To systematically understand the immunity leading to CRPC progression and predict the optimal treatment strategy &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt;, we developed a 3D Hybrid Multi-scale Model (HMSM), consisting of an ODE system and an agent-based model (ABM), to manipulate the tumor growth in a defined immune system. Based on our analysis, we revealed that the key factors (e.g. WNT5A, TRAIL, CSF1, etc.) mediated the activation of PC-Treg and PC-TAM interaction pathways, which induced the immunosuppression during CRPC progression. Our HMSM model also provided an optimal therapeutic strategy for improving the outcomes of PCa treatment.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ikDg0267fmg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Kinetic models of metabolic networks offer the promise of quantitative phenotype prediction. The mechanistic characterization of enzyme catalyzed reactions allows for tracing the effect of perturbations in metabolite concentrations and reaction fluxes in response to genetic and environmental perturbation that are beyond the scope of stoichiometric models. In this study, we develop a two-step computational pipeline for the rapid parameterization of kinetic models of metabolic networks using a curated metabolic model and available &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-labeling distributions under multiple genetic and environmental perturbations. The first step involves the elucidation of all intracellular fluxes in a core model of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; containing 74 reactions and 61 metabolites using &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-Metabolic Flux Analysis (&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-MFA). Here, fluxes corresponding to the mid-exponential growth phase are elucidated for seven single gene deletion mutants from upper glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway and the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. The computed flux ranges are then used to parameterize the same (i.e., k-ecoli74) core kinetic model for &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; with 55 substrate-level regulations using the newly developed K-FIT parameterization algorithm. The K-FIT algorithm employs a combination of equation decomposition and iterative solution techniques to evaluate steady-state fluxes in response to genetic perturbations. k-ecoli74 predicted 86% of flux values for strains used during fitting within a single standard deviation of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-MFA estimated values. By performing both tasks using the same network, errors associated with lack of congruity between the two networks are avoided, allowing for seamless integration of data with model building. Product yield predictions and comparison with previously developed kinetic models indicate shifts in flux ranges and the presence or absence of mutant strains delivering flux towards pathways of interest from training data significantly impact predictive capabilities. Using this workflow, the impact of completeness of fluxomic datasets and the importance of specific genetic perturbations on uncertainties in kinetic parameter estimation are evaluated.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LTEXX56v5VM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Astrocyte Subtype Vulnerability in Stem Cell Models of Vanishing White Matter</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25585?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes have gained attention as important players in neurological disease. In line with their heterogeneous character, defects in specific astrocyte subtypes have been identified. Leukodystrophy vanishing white matter (VWM) shows selective vulnerability in white matter astrocytes, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Induced pluripotent stem cell technology is being extensively explored in studies of pathophysiology and regenerative medicine. However, models for distinct astrocyte subtypes for VWM are lacking, thereby hampering identification of disease‐specific pathways.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we characterize human and mouse pluripotent stem cell–derived gray and white matter astrocyte subtypes to generate an in vitro VWM model. We examined morphology and functionality, and used coculture methods, high‐content microscopy, and RNA sequencing to study VWM cultures.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found intrinsic vulnerability in specific astrocyte subpopulations in VWM. When comparing VWM and control cultures, white matter–like astrocytes inhibited oligodendrocyte maturation, and showed affected pathways in both human and mouse cultures, involving the immune system and extracellular matrix. Interestingly, human white matter–like astrocytes presented additional, human‐specific disease mechanisms, such as neuronal and mitochondrial functioning.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astrocyte subtype cultures revealed disease‐specific pathways in VWM. Cross‐validation of human‐ and mouse‐derived protocols identified human‐specific disease aspects. This study provides new insights into VWM disease mechanisms, which helps the development of in vivo regenerative applications, and we further present strategies to study astrocyte subtype vulnerability in neurological disease.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03153</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Bypass sockets allow researchers to perform tests of prosthetic systems from
the prosthetic user's perspective. We designed a modular upper-limb bypass
socket with 3D-printed components that can be easily modified for use with a
variety of terminal devices. Our bypass socket preserves access to forearm
musculature and the hand, which are necessary for surface electromyography and
to provide substituted sensory feedback. Our bypass socket allows a sufficient
range of motion to complete tasks in the frontal working area, as measured on
non-amputee participants. We examined the performance of non-amputee
participants using the bypass socket on the original and modified Box and Block
Tests. Participants moved 11.3 +/- 2.7 and 11.7 +/- 2.4 blocks in the original
and modified Box and Block Tests (mean +/- SD), respectively, within the range
of reported scores using amputee participants. Range-of-motion for users
wearing the bypass socket meets or exceeds most reported range-of-motion
requirements for activities of daily living. The bypass socket was originally
designed with a freely rotating wrist; we found that adding elastic resistance
to user wrist rotation while wearing the bypass socket had no significant
effect on motor decode performance. We have open-sourced the design files and
an assembly manual for the bypass socket. We anticipate that the bypass socket
will be a useful tool to evaluate and develop sensorized myoelectric prosthesis
technology.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Pre-surgical language mapping with functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) is routinely conducted to assist the neurosurgeon in preventing damage

the monolingual versus the bilingual brain, whereas clinical fMRI tasks are
typically conducted in a single language. The presence of secondary language
processing mechanisms is a potential source of error in the inferred language
map. From fMRI data of healthy bilingual and monolingual subjects we obtain
language maps as functional networks. Our results show a sub-network &quot;core&quot;
architecture consisting of the Broca's, pre-supplementary motor, and premotor
areas present across all subjects. Wernicke's Area was found to connect to the
&quot;core&quot; to a different extent across groups. The $k$ core centrality measure
shows &quot;core&quot; areas belong to the maximum core while WA and other fROIs vary
across groups. The results may provide a benchmark to preserve equal treatment
outcomes for bilingual patients.

consider by FBC and thus effective brain connectivity (EBC) is used to measure
causal intervention between one neuronal region and the rest of the neuronal
regions. Our main purpose is to provide a reliable automatic seizure detection
approach.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methods
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, three new methods are provided. Deep modular neural network
(DMNN) is developed based on a combination of various EBC classification
results in the different frequencies. Another method is named &quot;modular
effective neural networks (MENN)&quot;. This method combines the classification
results of the three different EBC in the specific frequency. &quot;Modular
frequency neural networks (MFNN)&quot; is another method that combines the
classification results of the specific EBC in the seven different frequencies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mean accuracy of the MFNN are 97.14%, 98.53%, and 97.91% using directed
transfer function, directed coherence, and generalized partial directed
coherence, respectively. Using the MENN, the highest mean accuracy is 98.34%.
Finally, DMNN has the highest mean accuracy which is equal to 99.43. To our
best knowledge, the proposed method is a new method that provides the high
accuracy in comparison to other studies which used MIT-CHB database.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusion and significance
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The knowledge of structure-function relationships between different areas of
the brain is necessary for characterizing the underlying dynamics. Hence,
features based on EBC can provide a reliable automatic seizure detection
approach.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A community-based transcriptomics classification and nomenclature of neocortical cell types. (arXiv:1909.03083v1 [q-bio.GN])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03083</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;To understand the function of cortical circuits it is necessary to classify
their underlying cellular diversity. Traditional attempts based on comparing
anatomical or physiological features of neurons and glia, while productive,
have not resulted in a unified taxonomy of neural cell types. The recent
development of single-cell transcriptomics has enabled, for the first time,
systematic high-throughput profiling of large numbers of cortical cells and the
generation of datasets that hold the promise of being complete, accurate and
permanent. Statistical analyses of these data have revealed the existence of
clear clusters, many of which correspond to cell types defined by traditional
criteria, and which are conserved across cortical areas and species. To
capitalize on these innovations and advance the field, we, the Copenhagen
Convention Group, propose the community adopts a transcriptome-based taxonomy
of the cell types in the adult mammalian neocortex. This core classification
should be ontological, hierarchical and use a standardized nomenclature. It
should be configured to flexibly incorporate new data from multiple approaches,
developmental stages and a growing number of species, enabling improvement and
revision of the classification. This community-based strategy could serve as a
common foundation for future detailed analysis and reverse engineering of
cortical circuits and serve as an example for cell type classification in other
parts of the nervous system and other organs.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Modeling transport and mean age of dense core vesicles in large axonal arbors. (arXiv:1903.10120v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10120</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A model simulating transport of dense core vesicles (DCVs) in type II axonal
terminals of Drosophila motoneurons has been developed. The morphology of type
II terminals is characterized by the large number of en passant boutons. The
lack of both scaled up DCV transport and scaled down DCV capture in boutons
results in a less efficient supply of DCVs to distal boutons. Furthermore, the
large number of boutons that DCVs pass as they move anterogradely, until they
reach the most distal bouton, may lead to the capture of a majority of DCVs
before they turn around in the most distal bouton to move in the retrograde
direction. This may lead to a reduced retrograde flux of DCVs and a lack of DCV
circulation in type II terminals. The developed model simulates DCV
concentrations in boutons, DCV fluxes between the boutons, age density
distributions of DCVs, and the mean age of DCVs in various boutons. Unlike
published experimental observations, our model predicts DCV circulation in type
II terminals after these terminals are filled to saturation. This disagreement
is likely because experimentally observed terminals were not at steady-state,
but rather were accumulating DCVs for later release. Our estimates show that
the number of DCVs in the transiting state is much smaller than that in the
resident state. DCVs traveling in the axon, rather than DCVs transiting in the
terminal, may provide a reserve of DCVs for replenishing boutons after a
release. The techniques for modeling transport of DCVs developed in our paper
can be used to model the transport of other organelles in axons.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Automatic classification of epliptic seizure types in EEG datacould enable
more precise diagnosis and efficient manage-ment of the disease. Automatic
seizure type classificationusing clinical electroencephalograms (EEGs) is
challengingdue to factors such as low signal to noise ratios, signal
arte-facts, high variance in the seizure semiology among individ-ual epileptic
patients, and limited availability of clinical data.To overcome these
challenges, in this paper, we present adeep learning based framework which
learns multi-spectralfeature embeddings using multiple CNN models in an
ensem-ble architecture for accurate cross-patient seizure type clas-sification.
Experiments on the recently released TUH EEGSeizure Corpus show that our

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Brain-Dependent Processes Fuel Pain-Induced Hemorrhage After Spinal Cord Injury</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00044</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Pain (nociceptive) input caudal to a spinal contusion injury can undermine long-term recovery and increase tissue loss (secondary injury). Prior work suggests that nociceptive stimulation has this effect because it fosters the breakdown of the blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) at the site of injury, allowing blood to infiltrate the tissue. The present study examined whether these effects impact tissue rostral and caudal to the site of injury. In addition, the study evaluated whether cutting communication with the brain, by means of a rostral transection, affects the development of hemorrhage. Eighteen hours after rats received a lower thoracic (T11–12) contusion injury, half underwent a spinal transection at T2. Noxious electrical stimulation (shock) was applied 6 h later. Cellular assays showed that, in non-transected rats, nociceptive stimulation increased hemoglobin content, activated pro-inflammatory cytokines and engaged signals related to cell death at the site of injury. These effects were not observed in transected animals. In the next experiment, the spinal transection was performed at the time of contusion injury. Nociceptive stimulation was applied 24 h later and tissue was sectioned for microscopy. In non-transected rats, nociceptive stimulation increased the area of hemorrhage and this effect was blocked by spinal transection. These findings imply that the adverse effect of noxious stimulation depends upon spared ascending fibers and the activation of rostral (brain) systems. If true, stimulation should induce less hemorrhage after a severe contusion injury that blocks transmission to the brain. To test this, rats were given a mild, moderate, or severe, injury and electrical stimulation was applied 24 h later. Histological analyses of longitudinal sections showed that nociceptive stimulation triggered less hemorrhage after a severe contusion injury. The results suggest that brain-dependent processes drive pain-induced hemorrhage after spinal cord injury (SCI).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Dialectics of Free Energy Minimization</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00042</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Karl Friston’s free energy minimization has been received with great enthusiasm. With good reason: it not only makes the bold claim to a unifying theory of the brain, but it is presented as an a priori principle applicable to living systems in general. In this article, we set out to show how the breadth of scope of Friston’s framework converges with the dialectics of Georg Hegel. Through an appeal to the work of Catherine Malabou, we aim to demonstrate how Friston not only reinvigorates Hegelian dialectics from the perspective of neuroscience, but that the implicit alignment with Hegel necessitates a reading of free energy minimization from the perspective of Hegel’s speculative philosophy. It is this reading that moves beyond the discussion between cognitivism and enactivism surrounding Friston’s framework; beyond the question whether the organism is a secluded entity separated from its surroundings, or whether it is a dynamical system characterized by perpetual openness and mutual exchange. From a Hegelian perspective, it is the tension between both positions itself that is operative at the level of the organism; as a contradiction the organism sustains over the course of its life. Not only does the organism’s secluded existence depend on a perpetual relation with its surroundings, but the condition for there to be such a relation is the existence of a secluded entity. We intend to show how this contradiction—tension internalized—is at the center of Friston’s anticipatory organism; how it is this contradiction that grounds the perpetual process of free energy minimization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Long Non-coding RNA TUG1 Sponges Mir-145a-5p to Regulate Microglial Polarization After Oxygen-Glucose Deprivation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00215</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microglia plays a critical role in neuroinflammation after ischemic stroke by releasing diverse inflammatory cytokines. Long non-coding RNA taurine up-regulated gene 1 (lncRNA TUG1) is widely expressed in adult brain and has been reported to participate in multiple biological processes associated with nervous system diseases. However, the role of TUG1 in microglial activation remains unidentified. BV-2 microglial cells were cultured in vitro and TUG1 siRNA was used to knock down its RNA level. Microglial cells were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) for 4 h following TUG1 siRNA or scramble siRNA transient transfection. After 24 h reoxygenation, TUG1 level and microglial M1/M2 phenotype, as well as releasing inflammatory cytokines and their role to viability of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), ELISA, immunofluorescence and western blot. In addition, miR-145a-5p, a putative microRNA to bind with TUG1 by bioinformatics analysis, was simultaneously examined, then the interaction of TUG1 with miR-145a-5p and the potential involvement of NF-κB pathway were further evaluated by RNA-RNA pull-down assay and western blot. The cellular level of TUG1 was transiently up-regulated in microglial cells 24 h after OGD treatment, with an inverse correlation to downregulated miR-145a-5p. TUG1 knockdown drove microglial M1-like to M2-like phenotypic transformation with reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, TNF-α; interleukin-6, IL-6) and incremental release of anti-inflammatory cytokine (interleukin-10, IL-10), as a result, promoted the survival of SH-SY5Y cells. Meanwhile, TUG1 knockdown prevented OGD-induced activation of NF-κB pathway as well, represented by decreased ratios of p-p65/p65 and p-IκBα/IκBα proteins. Furthermore, we found that TUG1 could physically bind to miR-145a-5p while miR-145a-5p inhibitor abolished the protective effects of TUG1 knockdown through activation of NF-κB pathway, suggesting a negative interaction between TUG1 and miR-145a-5p. Our study demonstrated that lncRNA TUG1, sponging miR-145a-5p with negative interaction, could regulate microglial polarization and production of inflammatory cytokines at a relatively early stage after OGD insult, where NF-κB pathway might be involved, possibly providing a promising therapeutic target against inflammatory injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: A Conserved Tyrosine Residue in Slitrk3 Carboxyl-Terminus Is Critical for GABAergic Synapse Development</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00213</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Single-passing transmembrane protein, Slitrk3 (Slit and Trk-like family member 3, ST3), is a synaptic cell adhesion molecule highly expressed at inhibitory synapses. Recent studies have shown that ST3, through its extracellular domain, selectively regulates inhibitory synapse development via the trans-synaptic interaction with presynaptic cell adhesion molecule, receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase δ (PTPδ) and the cis-interaction with postsynaptic cell adhesion molecule, Neuroligin 2 (NL2). However, little is known about the physiological function of ST3 intracellular, carboxyl (C)-terminal region. Here we report that in heterologous cells, ST3 C-terminus is not required for ST3 homo-dimerization and trafficking to the cell surface. In contrast, in hippocampal neurons, ST3 C-terminus, more specifically, the conserved tyrosine Y969 (in mice), is critical for GABAergic synapse development. Indeed, overexpression of ST3 Y969A mutant markedly reduced the gephyrin puncta density and GABAergic transmission in hippocampal neurons. In addition, single-cell genetic deletion of ST3 strongly impaired GABAergic transmission. Importantly, wild-type (WT) ST3, but not the ST3 Y969A mutant, could fully rescue GABAergic transmission deficits in neurons lacking endogenous ST3, confirming a critical role of Y969 in the regulation of inhibitory synapses. Taken together, our data identify a single critical residue in ST3 C-terminus that is important for GABAergic synapse development and function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Model-Based Evaluation of Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation Controller to Adapt to Dynamic Changes in Reference Signal</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00956</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;High-frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is effective in suppressing the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Current clinically-deployed DBS technology operates in an open-loop fashion, i.e., fixed parameter high-frequency stimulation is delivered continuously, invariant to the needs or status of the patient. This poses two major challenges: (1) depletion of the stimulator battery due to the energy demands of continuous high-frequency stimulation, (2) high-frequency stimulation-induced side-effects. Closed-loop deep brain stimulation (CL DBS) may be effective in suppressing parkinsonian symptoms with stimulation parameters that require less energy and evoke fewer side effects than open loop DBS. However, the design of CL DBS comes with several challenges including the selection of an appropriate biomarker reflecting the symptoms of PD, setting a suitable reference signal, and implementing a controller to adapt to dynamic changes in the reference signal. Dynamic changes in beta oscillatory activity occur during the course of voluntary movement, and thus there may be a performance advantage to tracking such dynamic activity. We addressed these challenges by studying the performance of a closed-loop controller using a biophysically-based network model of the basal ganglia. The model-based evaluation consisted of two parts: (1) we implemented a Proportional-Integral (PI) controller to compute optimal DBS frequencies based on the magnitude of a dynamic reference signal, the oscillatory power in the beta band (13–35 Hz) recorded from model globus pallidus internus (GPi) neurons. (2) We coupled a linear auto-regressive model based mapping function with the Routh-Hurwitz stability analysis method to compute the parameters of the PI controller to track dynamic changes in the reference signal. The simulation results demonstrated successful tracking of both constant and dynamic beta oscillatory activity by the PI controller, and the PI controller followed dynamic changes in the reference signal, something that cannot be accomplished by constant open-loop DBS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Cognitive, Emotional and Psychological Manifestations in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis at Baseline and Overtime: A Review</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00951</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It is now well recognized that, in addition to motor impairment, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) may cause extra-motor clinical signs and symptoms. These can include the alteration of certain cognitive functions, impaired social cognition, and changes in the perception and processing of emotions. Where these extra-motor manifestations occur in ALS, they usually do so from disease onset. In about 10% of cases, the cognitive and behavioral changes meet the diagnostic criteria for frontotemporal dementia. The timecourse of behavioral and cognitive involvement in ALS is unclear. Whereas longitudinal studies have failed to show cognitive decline over time, some cross-sectional studies have demonstrated poorer cognitive performances in the advanced stages of the disease. Neuroimaging studies show that in ALS, extra-motor signs and symptoms are associated with specific brain lesions, but little is known about how they change over time. Finally, patients with ALS appear less depressed than might be expected, given the prognosis. Moreover, many patients achieve satisfactory psychosocial adjustment throughout the course of the disease, regardless of their degree of motor disability. There are scant longitudinal data on extra-motor impairment in ALS, and to our knowledge, no systematic review on this subject has yet been published. Even so, a better understanding of patients’ clinical trajectory is essential if they are to be provided with tailored care and given the best possible support. We therefore undertook to review the evidence for extra-motor changes and their time course in ALS, in both the cognitive, emotional and psychological domains, with a view to identifying mechanisms that may help these patients cope with their disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00945</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs) are a large and heterogeneous group of degenerative diseases caused by mutations in various genes. Given the favorable anatomical and immunological characteristics of the eye, gene therapy holds great potential for their treatment. Our goal is to validate the preservation of visual functions by viral-free homology directed repair (HDR) in an autosomal recessive loss of function mutation. We used a tailored gene editing system based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) to prevent retinal photoreceptor death in the retinal degeneration 10 (Rd10) mouse model of retinitis pigmentosa. We tested the gene editing tool in vitro and then used in vivo subretinal electroporation to deliver it to one of the retinas of mouse pups at different stages of photoreceptor differentiation. Three months after gene editing, the treated eye exhibited a higher visual acuity compared to the untreated eye. Moreover, we observed preservation of light-evoked responses both in explanted retinas and in the visual cortex of treated animals. Our study validates a CRISPR/Cas9-based therapy as a valuable new approach for the treatment of retinitis pigmentosa caused by autosomal recessive loss-of-function point mutations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Ear-EEG Forward Models: Improved Head-Models for Ear-EEG</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00943</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Computational models for mapping electrical sources in the brain to potentials on the scalp have been widely explored. However, current models do not describe the external ear anatomy well, and is therefore not suitable for ear-EEG recordings. Here we present an extension to existing computational models, by incorporating an improved description of the external ear anatomy based on 3D scanned impressions of the ears. The result is a method to compute an ear-EEG forward model, which enables mapping of sources in the brain to potentials in the ear. To validate the method, individualized ear-EEG forward models were computed for four subjects, and ear-EEG and scalp EEG were recorded concurrently from the subjects in a study comprising both auditory and visual stimuli. The EEG recordings were analyzed with independent component analysis (ICA) and using the individualized ear-EEG forward models, single dipole fitting was performed for each independent component (IC). A subset of ICs were selected, based on how well they were modeled by a single dipole in the brain volume. The correlation between the topographic IC map and the topographic map predicted by the forward model, was computed for each IC. Generally, the correlation was high in the ear closest to the dipole location, showing that the ear-EEG forward models provided a good model to predict ear potentials. In addition, we demonstrated that the developed forward models can be used to explore the sensitivity to brain sources for different ear-EEG electrode configurations. We consider the proposed method to be an important step forward in the characterization and utilization of ear-EEG.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Application of T1-/T2-Weighted Ratio Mapping to Elucidate Intracortical Demyelination Process in the Alzheimer’s Disease Continuum</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00904</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background The biological diagnosis criteria of the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) suggests that previous work may misclassify the cognitive impairment caused by other factors into AD. Consequently, re-assessing the imaging profile of AD continuum is needed. Considering the high vulnerability of cortical association fibers, we aimed to elucidate the cortical demyelination process in the AD continuum biologically defined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods According to the biological diagnosis criteria, we determined the positive amyloid status (A+) as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;–&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 192 pg/ml, Florbetapir Positron emission tomography (PET) composite standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) &amp;gt;1.11. Also, the positive Tau status (T+) was determined as p-Tau&lt;sub&gt;181&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; 23 pg/ml. Based on the cognitive characterization, we further categorized 252 subjects into 27 cognitively unimpaired with normal AD biomarkers (A−T−, controls), 49 preclinical AD (A+T+), 113 AD with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (A+T+), and 63 AD dementia (A+T+). We estimated the intracortical myelin content used the T1- and T2-weighted (T1W/T2W) ratio mapping. To investigate the sensitivity of the ratio mapping, we also utilized well-validated AD imaging biomarkers as the reference, including gray matter volume and Fludeoxyglucose PET (FDG-PET). Based on the general linear model, we conducted the voxel-wise two-sample T-tests between the controls and each group in the AD continuum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results Compared to the controls, the results showed that the preclinical AD patients exhibited decreased T1W/T2W ratio value in the right inferior parietal lobule (IPL); as the disease progresses, the prodromal AD patients demonstrated lower ratio value in bilateral IPL, with hippocampus (HP) atrophy. Lastly, the AD dementia patients exhibited decreased ratio value in bilateral IPL and hippocampus; also, we observed the bilateral temporal cortices atrophy and widespread decreased metabolism in the AD dementia patients. After corrected with gray volume, the results remained mostly unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion Our study implied the decreased right IPL T1W/T2W ratio might represent early AD-related demyelination in disease continuum. Additionally, we demonstrated that the T1W/T2W ratio mapping is an easy-to-implement and sensitive metric to assess the intracortical myelin content in AD, particularly in the early stage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Bioenergetics and Autophagic Imbalance in Patients-Derived Cell Models of Parkinson Disease Supports Systemic Dysfunction in Neurodegeneration</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00894</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder worldwide affecting 2–3% of the population over 65 years. This prevalence is expected to rise as life expectancy increases and diagnostic and therapeutic protocols improve. PD encompasses a multitude of clinical, genetic, and molecular forms of the disease. Even though the mechanistic of the events leading to neurodegeneration remain largely unknown, some molecular hallmarks have been repeatedly reported in most patients and models of the disease. Neuroinflammation, protein misfolding, disrupted endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria crosstalk, mitochondrial dysfunction and consequent bioenergetic failure, oxidative stress and autophagy deregulation, are amongst the most commonly described. Supporting these findings, numerous familial forms of PD are caused by mutations in genes that are crucial for mitochondrial and autophagy proper functioning. For instance, late and early onset PD associated to mutations in Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) and Parkin (PRKN) genes, responsible for the most frequent dominant and recessive inherited forms of PD, respectively, have emerged as promising examples of disease due to their established role in commanding bioenergetic and autophagic balance. Concomitantly, the development of animal and cell models to investigate the etiology of the disease, potential biomarkers and therapeutic approaches are being explored. One of the emerging approaches in this context is the use of patient’s derived cells models, such as skin-derived fibroblasts that preserve the genetic background and some environmental cues of the patients. An increasing number of reports in these PD cell models postulate that deficient mitochondrial function and impaired autophagic flux may be determinant in PD accelerated nigral cell death in terms of limitation of cell energy supply and accumulation of obsolete and/or unfolded proteins or dysfunctional organelles. The reliance of neurons on mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and their post-mitotic nature, may explain their increased vulnerability to undergo degeneration upon mitochondrial challenges or autophagic insults. In this scenario, proper mitochondrial function and turnover through mitophagy, are gaining in strength as protective targets to prevent neurodegeneration, together with the use of patient-derived fibroblasts to further explore these events. These findings point out the presence of molecular damage beyond the central nervous system (CNS) and proffer patient-derived cell platforms to the clinical and scientific community, which enable the study of disease etiopathogenesis and therapeutic approaches focused on modifying the natural history of PD through, among others, the enhancement of mitochondrial function and autophagy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00313</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Converging behavioral and functional neuroimaging evidence indicates that East Asian and Western individuals have different orientations for processing information that may stem from contrasting cultural values. In this cross-cultural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study, we used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) approach to investigate culture-related and individual differences of independent-interdependent orientation in structural brain volume between 57 Taiwanese and 56 Western participants. Each participant’s degree of endorsement of independent and interdependent cultural value was assessed by their self-report on the Singelis Self-Construal Scale (SCS). Behaviorally, Taiwanese rated higher SCS scores than Westerners in interdependent value and Westerners rated higher SCS scores than Taiwanese in independent value. The VBM results demonstrated that Western participants showed greater gray matter (GM) volume in the fronto-parietal network, whereas Taiwanese participants showed greater regional volume in temporal and occipital regions. Our findings provide supportive evidence that socio-cultural experiences of learned independent-interdependent orientations may play a role in regional brain volumes. However, strategic differences in cognition, genetic variation, and/or modulations of other environmental factors should also be considered to interpret such culture-related effects and potential individual differences.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Identifying the Speech Production Stages in Early and Late Adulthood by Using Electroencephalography</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00298</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Structural changes in the brain take place throughout one’s life. Changes related to cognitive decline may delay the stages of the speech production process in the aging brain. For example, semantic memory decline and poor inhibition may delay the retrieval of a concept from the mental lexicon. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a valuable method for identifying the timing of speech production stages. So far, studies using EEG mainly focused on a particular speech production stage in a particular group of subjects. Differences between subject groups and between methodologies have complicated identifying time windows of the speech production stages. For the current study, the speech production stages lemma retrieval, lexeme retrieval, phonological encoding, and phonetic encoding were tracked using a 64-channel EEG in 20 younger adults and 20 older adults. Picture-naming tasks were used to identify lemma retrieval, using semantic interference through previously named pictures from the same semantic category, and lexeme retrieval, using words with varying age of acquisition. Non-word reading was used to target phonological encoding (using non-words with a variable number of phonemes) and phonetic encoding (using non-words that differed in spoken syllable frequency). Stimulus-locked and response-locked cluster-based permutation analyses were used to identify the timing of these stages in the full time course of speech production from stimulus presentation until 100 ms before response onset in both subject groups. It was found that the timing of each speech production stage could be identified. Even though older adults showed longer response times for every task, only the timing of the lexeme retrieval stage was later for the older adults compared to the younger adults, while no such delay was found for the timing of the other stages. The results of a second cluster-based permutation analysis indicated that clusters that were observed in the timing of the stages for one group were absent in the other subject group, which was mainly the case in stimulus-locked time windows. A z-score mapping analysis was used to compare the scalp distributions related to the stages between the older and younger adults. No differences between both groups were observed with respect to scalp distributions, suggesting that the same groups of neurons are involved in the four stages, regardless of the adults’ age, even though the timing of the individual stages is different in both groups.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Objectives&lt;p&gt;The potential effects of exposure to repetitive subconcussive head impacts through routine participation in sport are not understood. To investigate the effects of repetitive subconcussive head impacts we studied boxers following customary training (sparring) using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), decomposition electromyographic (EMG) and tests of memory.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Twenty amateur boxers performed three 3-min sparring bouts. Parameters of brain function and motor control were assessed prior to sparring and again immediately, 1 h and 24 h post-sparring. Twenty control participants were assessed following mock-sparring.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;One hour after sparring boxers showed increased corticomotor inhibition, altered motor unit recruitment strategies, and decreased memory performance relative to controls, with values returning to baseline by the 24 h follow up.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Repetitive subconcussive head impacts associated with sparring resulted in acute and transient brain changes similar to those previously reported in soccer heading, providing convergent evidence that sport-related head impacts produce a GABAergic response. These acute changes in brain health are reminiscent of effects seen following brain injury, and suggest a potential mechanism underlying the damaging long-term effects of routine repetitive head impacts in sport.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Discrimination of Prion Strain Targeting in the Central Nervous System via Reactive Astrocyte Heterogeneity in CD44 Expression</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00411</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Prion diseases or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are fatal, progressive, neurodegenerative, protein-misfolding disorders. Prion diseases may arise spontaneously, be inherited genetically or be acquired by infection and affect a variety of mammalian species including humans. Prion infections in the central nervous system (CNS) cause extensive neuropathology, including abnormal accumulations of misfolded host prion protein, vacuolar change resulting in sponge-like (spongiform) appearance of CNS tissue, neurodegeneration and reactive glial responses. Many different prion agent strains exist and these can differ based on disease duration, clinical signs and the targeting and distribution of the neuropathology in distinct brain areas. Reactive astrocytes are a prominent feature in the prion disease affected CNS as revealed by distinct morphological changes and upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). The CD44 antigen is a transmembrane glycoprotein involved in cell-cell interactions, cell adhesion and migration. Here we show that CD44 is also highly expressed in a subset of reactive astrocytes in regions of the CNS targeted by prions. Astrocyte heterogeneity revealed by differential CD44 upregulation occurs coincident with the earliest neuropathological changes during the pre-clinical phase of disease, and is not affected by the route of infection. The expression and distribution of CD44 was compared in brains from a large collection of 15 distinct prion agent strains transmitted to mice of different prion protein (Prnp) genotype backgrounds. Our data show that the pattern of CD44 upregulation observed in the hippocampus in each prion agent strain and host Prnp genotype combination was unique. Many mouse-adapted prion strains and hosts have previously been characterized based on the pattern of the distribution of the spongiform pathology or the misfolded PrP deposition within the brain. Our data show that CD44 expression also provides a reliable discriminatory marker of prion infection with a greater dynamic range than misfolded prion protein deposition, aiding strain identification. Together, our data reveal CD44 as a novel marker to detect reactive astrocyte heterogeneity during CNS prion disease and for enhanced identification of distinct prion agent strains.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Restoration of Olfactory Memory in Drosophila Overexpressing Human Alzheimer’s Disease Associated Tau by Manipulation of L-Type Ca2+ Channels</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00409</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The cellular underpinnings of memory deficits in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are poorly understood. We utilized the tractable neural circuits sub-serving memory in Drosophila to investigate the role of impaired Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; handling in memory deficits caused by expression of human 0N4R isoform of tau which is associated with AD. Expression of tau in mushroom body neuropils, or a subset of mushroom body output neurons, led to impaired memory. By using the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; reporter GCaMP6f, we observed changes in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling when tau was expressed in these neurons, an effect that could be blocked by the L-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel antagonist nimodipine or reversed by RNAi knock-down of the L-type channel gene. The L-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel itself is required for memory formation, however, RNAi knock-down of the L-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel in neurons overexpressing human tau resulted in flies whose memory is restored to levels equivalent to wild-type. Expression data suggest that Drosophila L-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel mRNA levels are increased upon tau expression in neurons, thus contributing to the effects observed on memory and intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis. Together, our Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging and memory experiments suggest that expression of the 0N4R isoform of human tau increases the number of L-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels in the membrane resulting in changes in neuronal excitability that can be ameliorated by RNAi knockdown or pharmacological blockade of L-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels. This highlights a role for L-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels in tauopathy and their potential as a therapeutic target for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1 (PARP1) Deficiency and Pharmacological Inhibition by Pirenzepine Protects From Cisplatin-Induced Ototoxicity Without Affecting Antitumor Efficacy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00406</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cisplatin remains an indispensable drug for the systemic treatment of many solid tumors. However, a major dose-limiting side-effect is ototoxicity. In some scenarios, such as treatment of germ cell tumors or adjuvant therapy of non-small cell lung cancer, cisplatin cannot be replaced without undue loss of efficacy. Inhibition of polyadenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase-1 (PARP1), is presently being evaluated as a novel anti-neoplastic principle. Of note, cisplatin-induced PARP1 activation has been related to inner ear cell death. Thus, PARP1 inhibition may exert a protective effect on the inner ear without compromising the antitumor activity of cisplatin. Here, we evaluated PARP1 deficiency and PARP1 pharmacological inhibition as a means to protect the auditory hair cells from cisplatin-mediated ototoxicity. We demonstrate that cisplatin-induced loss of sensory hair cells in the organ of Corti is attenuated in PARP1-deficient cochleae. The PARP inhibitor pirenzepine and its metabolite LS-75 mimicked the protective effect observed in PARP1-deficient cochleae. Moreover, the cytotoxic potential of cisplatin was unchanged by PARP inhibition in two different cancer cell lines. Taken together, the results from our study suggest that the negative side-effects of cisplatin anti-cancer treatment could be alleviated by a PARP inhibition adjunctive therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00250</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;To study the efficacy of grip strength (GS) as a predictor of cognitive function in a large, nationwide sample of Chinese participants aged 45 years and above.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We used data from three waves (W1, W2, and W3) fielded by the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). Cognitive function was tested biennially and calculated using two categories: episodic memory and mental intactness. Demographics, health behaviors, and medical conditions were considered potential confounders. Using multivariate linear regression models (MLRMs), we examined the association between baseline GS (measure in W1) and cognitive function in W3. Using a generalized estimating equation (GEE), we examined baseline GS as a predictor of cognitive function change.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Total 9,333 individuals (53.2% women), with a mean baseline episodic memory score of 6.5, mean baseline mental intactness score of 7.2, and aged over 45 years (mean age = 58.6), were selected. The mean follow-up time was 4.0 years (range: 3.3–5.0 years). Using MLRMs and comparing the lowest GS score with the highest baseline GS score, we observed a significant correlation with a higher global cognitive function in both women (β = 1.061, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and men (β = 1.233, p &amp;lt; 0.001). After adjusting baseline global cognition, the highest GS level was still statistically significant in both women (β = 0.543, p &amp;lt; 0.05) and men (β = 0.742, p &amp;lt; 0.001). GEE suggested that the participants in the highest GS quartile had better cognitive performance over time in both women (β = 0.116, p = 0.030) and men (β = 0.143, p = 0.008) than those in the lowest quartile.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Higher baseline level of GS was significantly related to better cognitive function and slowed the rate of its decline. Thus, it is an independent predictor of better cognitive status in middle-aged and elderly Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/49696</link>
	<content:encoded>The segregation of cells with distinct regional identity underlies formation of a sharp border, which in some tissues serves to organise a boundary signaling centre. It is unclear whether or how border sharpness is coordinated with induction of boundary-specific gene expression. We show that forward signaling of EphA4 is required for border sharpening and induction of boundary cells in the zebrafish hindbrain, which we find both require kinase-dependent signaling, with a lesser input of PDZ domain-dependent signaling. We find that boundary-specific gene expression is regulated by myosin II phosphorylation, which increases actomyosin contraction downstream of EphA4 signaling. Myosin phosphorylation leads to nuclear translocation of Taz, which together with Tead1a is required for boundary marker expression. Since actomyosin contraction maintains sharp borders, there is direct coupling of border sharpness to boundary cell induction that ensures correct organisation of signaling centres.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/49041</link>
	<content:encoded>Cues in the environment can elicit complex emotional states, and thereby maladaptive behavior, as a function of their ascribed value. Here we capture individual variation in the propensity to attribute motivational value to reward-cues using the sign-tracker/goal-tracker animal model. Goal-trackers attribute predictive value to reward-cues, and sign-trackers attribute both predictive and incentive value. Using chemogenetics and microdialysis, we show that, in sign-trackers, stimulation of the neuronal pathway from the prelimbic cortex (PrL) to the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) decreases the incentive value of a reward-cue. In contrast, in goal-trackers, inhibition of the PrL-PVT pathway increases both the incentive value and dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens shell. The PrL-PVT pathway, therefore, exerts top-down control over the dopamine-dependent process of incentive salience attribution. These results highlight PrL-PVT pathway as a potential target for treating psychopathologies associated with the attribution of excessive incentive value to reward-cues, including addiction.</content:encoded>

Bile acids elicited Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; responses in cultured hDRG neurons, and bile acids or a MRGPRX4 specific agonist induced itch in human subjects. However, a specific agonist for another bile acid receptor TGR5 failed to induce itch in human subjects and we find that human TGR5 is not expressed in hDRG neurons. Finally, we show positive correlation between cholestatic itch and plasma bile acids level in itchy patients and the elevated bile acids is sufficient to activate MRGPRX4. Taken together, our data strongly suggest that MRGPRX4 is a novel bile acid receptor that likely underlies cholestatic itch in human, providing a promising new drug target for anti-itch therapies.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Processing of different spatial scales in the human brain</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/47492</link>
	<content:encoded>Humans navigate across a range of spatial scales, from rooms to continents, but the brain systems underlying spatial cognition are usually investigated only in small-scale environments. Do the same brain systems represent and process larger spaces? Here we asked subjects to compare distances between real-world items at six different spatial scales (room, building, neighborhood, city, country, continent) under functional MRI. Cortical activity showed a gradual progression from small to large scale processing, along three gradients extending anteriorly from the parahippocampal place area (PPA), retrosplenial complex (RSC) and occipital place area (OPA), and along the hippocampus posterior-anterior axis. Each of the cortical gradients overlapped with the visual system posteriorly and the default-mode network (DMN) anteriorly. These results suggest a progression from concrete to abstract processing with increasing spatial scale, and offer a new organizational framework for the brain’s spatial system, that may also apply to conceptual spaces beyond the spatial domain.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/46923</link>
	<content:encoded>Marker-gene and metagenomic sequencing have profoundly expanded our ability to measure biological communities. But the measurements they provide differ from the truth, often dramatically, because these experiments are biased toward detecting some taxa over others. This experimental bias makes the taxon or gene abundances measured by different protocols quantitatively incomparable and can lead to spurious biological conclusions. We propose a mathematical model for how bias distorts community measurements based on the properties of real experiments. We validate this model with 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomics data from defined bacterial communities. Our model better fits the experimental data despite being simpler than previous models. We illustrate how our model can be used to evaluate protocols, to understand the effect of bias on downstream statistical analyses, and to measure and correct bias given suitable calibration controls. These results illuminate new avenues toward truly quantitative and reproducible metagenomics measurements.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/46540</link>
	<content:encoded>CRISPR-Cas systems protect bacteria and archaea from phages and other mobile genetic elements, which use small anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins to overcome CRISPR-Cas immunity. Because Acrs are challenging to identify, their natural diversity and impact on microbial ecosystems are underappreciated. To overcome this discovery bottleneck, we developed a high-throughput functional selection to isolate ten DNA fragments from human oral and fecal metagenomes that inhibit &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus pyogenes&lt;/i&gt; Cas9 (SpyCas9) in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;. The most potent Acr from this set, AcrIIA11, was recovered from a &lt;i&gt;Lachnospiraceae&lt;/i&gt; phage. We found that AcrIIA11 inhibits SpyCas9 in bacteria and in human cells. AcrIIA11 homologs are distributed across diverse bacteria; many distantly-related homologs inhibit both SpyCas9 and a divergent Cas9 from &lt;i&gt;Treponema denticola&lt;/i&gt;. We find that AcrIIA11 antagonizes SpyCas9 using a different mechanism than other previously characterized Type II-A Acrs. Our study highlights the power of functional selection to uncover widespread Cas9 inhibitors within diverse microbiomes.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/46490</link>
	<content:encoded>Human and other animal cells deploy three closely related dioxygenases (PHD 1, 2 and 3) to signal oxygen levels by catalysing oxygen regulated prolyl hydroxylation of the transcription factor HIF. The discovery of the HIF prolyl-hydroxylase (PHD) enzymes as oxygen sensors raises a key question as to the existence and nature of non-HIF substrates, potentially transducing other biological responses to hypoxia. Over 20 such substrates are reported. We therefore sought to characterise their reactivity with recombinant PHD enzymes. Unexpectedly, we did not detect prolyl-hydroxylase activity on any reported non-HIF protein or peptide, using conditions supporting robust HIF-α hydroxylation. We cannot exclude PHD-catalysed prolyl hydroxylation occurring under conditions other than those we have examined. However, our findings using recombinant enzymes provide no support for the wide range of non-HIF PHD substrates that have been reported.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/46089</link>
	<content:encoded>How circuits assemble starting from stem cells is a fundamental question in developmental neurobiology. We test the hypothesis that, in neuronal stem cells, temporal transcription factors predictably control neuronal terminal features and circuit assembly. Using the Drosophila motor system, we manipulate expression of the classic temporal transcription factor, Hunchback (Hb) specifically in the NB7-1 stem cell, which produces U motor neurons (MNs), and then we monitor dendrite morphology and neuromuscular synaptic partnerships. We find that prolonged expression of Hb leads to transient specification of U MN identity, and that embryonic molecular markers do not accurately predict U MN terminal features. Nonetheless, our data show Hb acts as a potent regulator of neuromuscular wiring decisions. These data introduce important refinements to current models, show that molecular information acting early in neurogenesis as a switch to control motor circuit wiring and provide novel insight into the relationship between stem cell and circuit.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/45009</link>
	<content:encoded>Queens of social insects make all mate-choice decisions on a single day, except in honeybees whose queens can conduct mating flights for several days even when already inseminated by a number of drones. Honeybees therefore appear to have a unique, evolutionarily derived form of sexual conflict: a queen’s decision to pursue risky additional mating flights is driven by later-life fitness gains from genetically more diverse worker-offspring but reduces paternity shares of the drones she already mated with. We used artificial insemination, RNA-sequencing and electroretinography to show that seminal fluid induces a decline in queen vision by perturbing the phototransduction pathway within 24–48 hr. Follow up field trials revealed that queens receiving seminal fluid flew two days earlier than sister queens inseminated with saline, and failed more often to return. These findings are consistent with seminal fluid components manipulating queen eyesight to reduce queen promiscuity across mating flights.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/43625</link>
	<content:encoded>An important computational goal of the visual system is ‘representational untangling’ (RU): representing increasingly complex features of visual scenes in an easily decodable format. RU is typically assumed to be achieved in high-level visual cortices via several stages of cortical processing. Here we show, using a canonical population coding model, that RU of low-level orientation information is already performed at the first cortical stage of visual processing, but not before that, by a fundamental cellular-level property: the thresholded firing rate nonlinearity of simple cells in the primary visual cortex (V1). We identified specific, experimentally measurable parameters that determined the optimal firing threshold for RU and found that the thresholds of V1 simple cells extracted from in vivo recordings in awake behaving mice were near optimal. These results suggest that information re-formatting, rather than maximisation, may already be a relevant computational goal for the early visual system.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/764886v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Cerebellar granule cells (GCs) making up majority of all the neurons in the vertebrate brain, but heterogeneities among GCs and potential functional consequences are poorly understood. Here, we identified unexpected gradients in the biophysical properties of GCs. GCs closer to the white matter (inner-zone GCs) had higher firing thresholds and could sustain firing with larger current inputs. Dynamic clamp experiments showed that inner- and outer-zone GCs preferentially respond to high- and low-frequency mossy fiber inputs, respectively, enabling to disperse the mossy fiber input into its frequency components as performed by a Fourier transformation. Furthermore, inner-zone GCs have faster axonal conduction velocity and elicit faster synaptic potentials in Purkinje cells. Neuronal network modeling revealed that these gradients improve spike-timing precision of Purkinje cells and decrease the number of GCs required to learn spike-sequences. Thus, our study uncovers biophysical gradients in the cerebellar cortex enabling a Fourier-like transformation of mossy fiber inputs.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/764803v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Our attention seldom remains on a singular activity, instead veering off into thoughts unrelated to the task at hand. Studies adopting a component process view of off-task thought have begun to identify the underlying mechanisms and associated electrophysiological correlates underlying ongoing thought. In the present study, we developed subject-independent classification algorithms based on electroencephalographic (EEG) markers to discriminate on-task vs off-task as well as intentional vs unintentional off-task thought. To that end, spatio-temporal and spectral features extracted from EEG activity prior to reports of ongoing thought during a test of sustained attention were ranked according to their discriminative power. Using data collected from 26 participants, average classification accuracies of 83.4% and 71.6% were achieved using a regularized linear model for on-task vs off-task and intentional vs unintentional off-task thought, respectively. Our results identified gamma oscillations as the most discriminative feature to distinguish on-task from off-task states, and alpha synchronization as the most prominent feature when off-task states are engaged in deliberately rather than when experienced as arising spontaneously. Our work represents the first successful attempt at reliably discriminating the degree of intentionality experienced during task-unrelated thought and highlights the importance of recognizing the heterogeneous nature of off-task states.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>This research uses ERPs method to study how different valence of feedback influence family resemblance category learning. The results showed that at the behavioral level, participants in the negative feedback condition received higher test scores than those in the positive feedback condition; at the physiological level, the four kinds of ERPs evoked by both negative and positive feedback are P200, P300, and FRN. Compared with the non-feedback condition, P300 is more sensitive to negative feedback, and negative feedback induces larger amplitude, while P300 is not sensitive to positive feedback. For both negative and positive feedback, when feedback was presented after 200-300ms, the reaction to errors induced FRN production, and FRN produced under negative feedback condition led to more activation. This research has deepened our understanding of the influence of feedback valence on category learning from the brain mechanisms as well.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The widespread loss of hearing is one of the major threats to future wellbeing in ageing human societies. Amongst its various forms, age-related hearing loss (ARHL) carries the vast bulk of the global disease burden. The causes for the terminal decline of auditory function, however, are as unknown as the mechanisms that maintain sensitive hearing before its breakdown. We here present an in-depth analysis of maintenance and ageing in the auditory system of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. We show that Drosophila, just like humans, display ARHL and that their auditory life span is homeostatically supported by a set of evolutionarily conserved transcription factors. The transcription factors Onecut (closest human orthologues: ONECUT2, ONECUT3), Optix (SIX3, SIX6), Worniu (SNAI2) and Amos (ATOH1, ATOH7, NEUROD1) emerged as key regulators acting upstream of core sensory genes, including components of the fly molecular machinery for auditory transduction and amplification.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Animals vary considerably in size, shape, and physiological features across individuals, but yet achieve behavioral performances that are virtually indistinguishable between conspecifics. We examined how animals compensate for morphophysiological variation by measuring the system dynamics of individual knifefish (Eigenmannia virescens) in a refuge tracking task. Kinematic measurements of Eigenmannia were used to generate individualized estimates of each fish's locomotor plant and controller revealing substantial variability between fish. To test the impact of this variability on behavioral performance, these models were used to perform simulated 'brain transplants'-computationally swapping controllers and plants between individuals. We found that simulated closed-loop performance was robust to mismatch between plant and controller. This suggests that animals rely on feedback rather than precisely tuned neural controllers to compensate for morphophysiological variability.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Animals sense ambient temperature so that they can adjust their behavior to the environment; they avoid noxious heat and coldness and stay within a survivable temperature range. C. elegans can sense temperature, memorize past cultivation temperature and navigate towards preferable temperature, for which a thermosensory neuron, AFD, is essential. AFD responds to temperature increase from the past cultivation temperature by increasing intracellular Ca2+ level. We aimed to reveal how AFD encodes and memorizes the information of temperature. Although cGMP synthesis is crucial for thermosensation by AFD, whether and how cGMP level temporally fluctuates in AFD remained elusive. We therefore monitored cGMP level in AFD and found that cGMP dynamically responded to temperature change in a manner dependent on past cultivation temperature. Given that cGMP dynamics is supposed to be upstream of Ca2+ dynamics, our results suggest that AFD's memory is formed by simpler molecular mechanisms than previously expected from the Ca2+ dynamics. Moreover, we analyzed how guanylyl cyclases and phosphodiesterases, which synthesize and degrade cGMP, respectively, contributed to cGMP and Ca2+ dynamics and thermotaxis behavior.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>That attention is a fundamentally rhythmic process has recently received abundant empirical evidence. The essence of temporal attention, however, is to flexibly focus in time. Whether this function is hampered by an underlying rhythmic mechanism is unknown. In six interrelated experiments, we behaviourally quantify the sampling capacities of periodic temporal attention during auditory or visual perception. We reveal the presence of limited attentional capacities, with an optimal sampling rate of ~1.4 Hz in audition and ~0.7 Hz in vision. Investigating the motor contribution to temporal attention, we show that it scales with motor rhythmic precision, maximal at ~1.7 Hz. Critically, the motor modulation is beneficial to auditory but detrimental to visual temporal attention. These results are captured by a computational model of coupled oscillators, that reveals the underlying structural constraints governing the temporal alignment between motor and attention fluctuations.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/764506v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Purpose: Several recent studies have utilized a 3-tissue constrained spherical deconvolution pipeline to obtain quantitative metrics of brain tissue microstructure from diffusion-weighted MRI data. The three tissue compartments, comprising white matter-, grey matter-, and CSF-like (free water) signals, are potentially useful in the evaluation of brain microstructure in a range of pathologies. However, the reliability and long-term stability of these metrics has not yet been evaluated. Methods: This study examined estimates of whole brain microstructure for the three tissue compartments, in three separate test-retest cohorts. Each cohort has different lengths of time between baseline and retest, ranging from within the same scanning session in the shortest interval to three months in the longest interval. Each cohort was also collected with different acquisition parameters. Results: The CSF-like compartment displayed the greatest reliability across all cohorts, with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values being above 0.95 in each cohort. White matter-like and grey matter-like compartments both demonstrated very high reliability in the immediate cohort (both ICC&amp;gt;0.90), however this declined in the 3 month interval cohort to both compartments having ICC&amp;gt;0.80. Regional CSF-like signal fraction was examined in bilateral hippocampus and had an ICC&amp;gt;0.80 in each cohort. Conclusion: The 3-tissue CSD techniques provide reliable and stable estimates of tissue microstructure composition, up to 3 months longitudinally in a control population. This forms an important basis for further investigations utilizing 3-tissue CSD techniques to track changes in microstructure across a variety of brain pathologies.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/764456v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Sequence learning is a vital cognitive function and has been observed in numerous brain areas. Discovering the algorithms underlying sequence learning has been a major endeavor in both neuroscience and machine learning. In earlier work, we showed that by constraining the sparsity of the emission matrix of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) in a biologically-plausible manner we are able to efficiently learn higher-order temporal dependencies and recognize contexts in noisy signals. The central basis of our model, referred to as the Cloned HMM (CHMM), is the observation that cortical neurons sharing the same receptive field properties can learn to represent unique incidences of bottom-up information within different temporal contexts. CHMMs can efficiently learn higher-order temporal dependencies, recognize long-range contexts and, unlike recurrent neural networks, are able to natively handle uncertainty. In this paper we introduce a biologically plausible CHMM learning algorithm, memorize-generalize, that can rapidly memorize sequences as they are encountered, and gradually generalize as more data is accumulated. We demonstrate that CHMMs trained with the memorize generalize algorithm can model long-range structure in bird songs with only a slight degradation in performance compared to expectation maximization, while still outperforming other representations.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/764282v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The cognitive map is often assumed to be a Euclidean map that isometrically represents the real world (i.e. the Euclidean distance between any two locations in the physical world should be preserved on the cognitive map). However, accumulating evidence suggests that environmental boundaries can distort the mental representations of a physical space. For example, the distance between two locations can be remembered as longer than the true physical distance if the locations are separated by a boundary. While this overestimation is observed under different experimental conditions, even when the boundary is formed by flat surface cues, its physiological basis is not well understood. We examined the neural representation of flat surface cue boundaries, and of the space segregated by these boundaries, by recording place cell activity from dorsal CA1 and CA3 while rats foraged on a circular track or square platform with inhomogeneous surface textures. About 40% of the place field edges concentrated near the surface cue boundaries on the circular track (significantly above the chance level 33%). Similarly, the place field edges were more prevalent near the boundaries on the platforms than expected by chance. In both 1-dimensional and dimensional environments, the population vectors of place cell activity changed more abruptly with distance between locations that crossed cue boundaries than between locations within a bounded region. These results show that the locations of surface boundaries were evident as enhanced decorrelations of the neural representations of locations to either side of the boundaries. This enhancement might underlie the cognitive phenomenon of overestimation of distances across boundaries.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/764258v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Evolution is a blind fitting process by which organisms, over generations, adapt to the niches of an ever-changing environment. Does the mammalian brain use similar brute-force fitting processes to learn how to perceive and act upon the world? Recent advances in training deep neural networks has exposed the power of optimizing millions of synaptic weights to map millions of observations along ecologically relevant objective functions. This class of models has dramatically outstripped simpler, more intuitive models, operating robustly in real-life contexts spanning perception, language, and action coordination. These models do not learn an explicit, human-interpretable representation of the underlying structure of the data; rather, they use local computations to interpolate over task-relevant manifolds in a high-dimensional parameter space. Furthermore, counterintuitively, over-parameterized models, similarly to evolutionary processes, can be simple and parsimonious as they provide a versatile, robust solution for learning a diverse set of functions. In contrast to traditional scientific models, where the ultimate goal is interpretability, over-parameterized models eschew interpretability in favor of solving real-life problems or tasks. We contend that over-parameterized blind fitting presents a radical challenge to many of the underlying assumptions and practices in computational neuroscience and cognitive psychology. At the same time, this shift in perspective informs longstanding debates and establishes unexpected links with evolution, ecological psychology, and artificial life.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/764233v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Microglia play critical roles during CNS development and undergo dramatic changes in tissue distribution, morphology, and gene expression as they transition from embryonic to neonatal to adult microglial phenotypes. Despite the magnitude of these phenotypic shifts, little is known about the time course and dynamics of these transitions and whether they vary across brain regions. Here we define the time course of microglial maturation in key regions of the basal ganglia in mice where significant regional differences in microglial phenotype are present in adults. We found that microglial density peaks in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) during the third postnatal week, driven by a burst of microglial proliferation. Microglial abundance is then refined to adult levels through a combination of tissue expansion and microglial programmed cell death. This overproduction and refinement of microglia was significantly more pronounced in the NAc and was accompanied by a sharp peak in NAc microglial lysosome abundance in the third postnatal week. Collectively, these data identify a key developmental window when elevated microglial density in discrete basal ganglia nuclei may support circuit refinement and could increase susceptibility to inflammatory insults.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Local network determinants of spontaneously emerging cortical maps</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/764068v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Spontaneously emerging cortical maps related to the functional architecture of visual cortex have been observed initially in anesthetized cats and, subsequently, in monkey, albeit only under certain anesthetic regimes, and not in the awake state. Here we propose a network model that can accommodate these diverse findings. The model identifies two crucial determinants for the emergence of spontaneous map-like activity - local balance between excitatory and inhibitory activity, and the strength of feature-specific synaptic connections (e.g. orientation, ocularity). Our model further shows that dynamically, map-like activity patterns could be triggered either by standing or travelling waves, a mode of operation which is determined by the spatial extent of lateral connections within a given network. Our results suggest that careful pharmacological intervention can unveil the prevalence of maps - recurring spatial patterns of inhomogeneous lateral connectivity - in cortex without the need to explicitly identify area specific optimal features.</content:encoded>

T cells use their T-cell receptors (TCRs) to scan other cells for antigenic peptides presented by MHC molecules (pMHC). If a TCR encounters a pMHC, it can trigger a signalling pathway that could lead to the activation of the T cell and the initiation of an immune response. It is currently not clear how the binding of pMHC to the TCR initiates signalling within the T cell. One hypothesis is that conformational changes in the TCR lead to further downstream signalling. Here we investigate four different TCRs in their free state as well as in their pMHC bound state using large scale molecular simulations totalling 26 000 ns. We find that the dynamical features within TCRs differ significantly between unbound TCR and TCR/pMHC simulations. However, apart from expected results such as reduced solvent accessibility and flexibility of the interface residues, these features are not conserved among different TCR types. The presence of a pMHC alone is not sufficient to cause cross-TCR-conserved dynamical features within a TCR. Our results argue against models of TCR triggering involving conserved allosteric conformational changes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pWUJJpzBfnc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

In various fields, statistical models of interest are analytically intractable and inference is usually performed using a simulation-based method. However elegant these methods are, they are often painstakingly slow and convergence is difficult to assess. As a result, statistical inference is greatly hampered by computational constraints. However, for a given statistical model, different users, even with different data, are likely to perform similar computations. Computations done by one user are potentially useful for other users with different data sets. We propose a pooling of resources across researchers to capitalize on this. More specifically, we preemptively chart out the entire space of possible model outcomes in a prepaid database. Using advanced interpolation techniques, any individual estimation problem can now be solved on the spot. The prepaid method can easily accommodate different priors as well as constraints on the parameters. We created prepaid databases for three challenging models and demonstrate how they can be distributed through an online parameter estimation service. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art estimation techniques in both speed (with a 23,000 to 100,000-fold speed up) and accuracy, and is able to handle previously quasi inestimable models.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/o2pSi36siNM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Chemotherapy resistance is a major challenge to the effective treatment of cancer. Thus, a systematic pipeline for the efficient identification of effective combination treatments could bring huge biomedical benefit. In order to facilitate rational design of combination therapies, we developed a comprehensive computational model that incorporates the available biological knowledge and relevant experimental data on the life-and-death response of individual cancer cells to cisplatin or cisplatin combined with the TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). The model’s predictions, that a combination treatment of cisplatin and TRAIL would enhance cancer cell death and exhibit a “two-wave killing” temporal pattern, was validated by measuring the dynamics of p53 accumulation, cell fate, and cell death in single cells. The validated model was then subjected to a systematic analysis with an ensemble of diverse machine learning methods. Though each method is characterized by a different algorithm, they collectively identified several molecular players that can sensitize tumor cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis (sensitizers). The identified sensitizers are consistent with previous experimental observations. Overall, we have illustrated that machine learning analysis of an experimentally validated mechanistic model can convert our available knowledge into the identity of biologically meaningful sensitizers. This knowledge can then be leveraged to design treatment strategies that could improve the efficacy of chemotherapy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5J8yM9XG9_w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: An Open Source Syringe Pump Controller for Fluid Delivery of Multiple Volumes</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/5/ENEURO.0240-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Syringe pumps are a necessary piece of laboratory equipment that are used for fluid delivery in behavioral neuroscience laboratories. Many experiments provide rodents and primates with fluid rewards such as juice, water, or liquid sucrose. Current commercialized syringe pumps are not customizable and do not have the ability to deliver multiple volumes of fluid based on different inputs to the pump. Additionally, many syringe pumps are expensive and cannot be used in experiments with paired neurophysiological recordings due to electrical noise. We developed an open source syringe pump controller using commonly available parts. The controller adjusts the acceleration and speed of the motor to deliver three different volumes of fluid reward within one common time epoch. This syringe pump controller is cost effective and has been successfully implemented in rodent behavioral experiments with paired neurophysiological recordings in the rat frontal cortex while rats lick for different volumes of liquid sucrose rewards. Our syringe pump controller will enable new experiments to address the potential confound of temporal information in studies of reward signaling by fluid magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Large-Scale Networks for Auditory Sensory Gating in the Awake Mouse</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/5/ENEURO.0207-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The amplitude of the brain response to a repeated auditory stimulus is diminished as compared to the response to the first tone (T1) for interstimulus intervals (ISI) lasting up to hundreds of milliseconds. This adaptation process, called auditory sensory gating (ASG), is altered in various psychiatric diseases including schizophrenia and is classically studied by focusing on early evoked cortical responses to the second tone (T2) using 500-ms ISI. However, mechanisms underlying ASG are still not well-understood. We investigated ASG in awake mice from the brainstem to cortex at variable ISIs (125–2000 ms) using high-density EEG and intracerebral recordings. While ASG decreases at longer ISIs, it is still present at durations (500–2000 ms) far beyond the time during which brain responses to T1 could still be detected. T1 induces a sequence of specific stable scalp EEG topographies that correspond to the successive activation of distinct neural networks lasting about 350 ms. These brain states remain unaltered if T2 is presented during this period, although T2 is processed by the brain, suggesting that ongoing networks of brain activity are active for longer than early evoked-potentials and are not overwritten by an upcoming new stimulus. Intracerebral recordings demonstrate that ASG is already present at the level of ventral cochlear nucleus (vCN) and inferior colliculus and is amplified across the hierarchy in bottom-up direction. This study uncovers the extended stability of sensory-evoked brain states and long duration of ASG, and sheds light on generators of ASG and possible interactions between bottom-up and top-down mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Hand posture as localizing sign in adult focal epileptic seizures</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25589?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to identify specific ictal hand postures (HP) as localizing signs of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) in patients with frontal or temporal lobe epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study we retrospectively analyzed ictal semiology of 489 temporal lobe or frontal lobe seizures recorded over a 6‐year period at the Seizure Disorder Center of UCLA ‐ USA (45 patients) or at the “C. Munari” Epilepsy Surgery Centre of the Niguarda Hospital in Milan ‐ Italy (34 patients). Our criterion for EZ localization was at least two years of seizure freedom after surgery. We analyzed presence and latency of ictal HP. We then examined if specific initial HP are predictive for EZ localization.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that ictal HP were present in 72.5% of patients with frontal and 54.5% of patients with temporal lobe seizures. We divided HP into 6 classes depending on the reciprocal position of the fingers (“fist”, “cup”, “politician's fist”, “pincer”, “extended hand”, “pointing”). We found a striking correlation between EZ localization and ictal HP. In particular “fist” and “pointing” HP are strongly predictive of frontal lobe EZ; “cup”, “politician's fist” and “pincer” are strongly predictive of temporal lobe EZ.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study offers simple ictal signs that appear to clarify differential diagnosis of temporal vs frontal lobe EZ localization. These results are meant to be used as a novel complementary tool, during presurgical evaluation for epilepsy. At the same time they give us important insight into the neurophysiology of hand movements.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Intravenous thrombolysis for suspected ischemic stroke with seizure at onset</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25582?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seizure at onset (SaO) has been considered a relative contraindication for intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in patients with acute ischemic stroke, although this appraisal is not evidence based. Here, we investigated the prognostic significance of SaO in patients treated with IVT for suspected ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this multicenter, IVT‐registry–based study we assessed the association between SaO and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH, European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study II definition), 3‐month mortality, and 3‐month functional outcome on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) using unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression, coarsened exact matching, and inverse probability weighted analyses.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among 10,074 IVT‐treated patients, 146 (1.5%) had SaO. SaO patients had significantly higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score and glucose on admission, and more often female sex, prior stroke, and prior functional dependence than non‐SaO patients. In unadjusted analysis, they had generally less favorable outcomes. After controlling for confounders in adjusted, matched, and weighted analyses, all associations between SaO and any of the outcomes disappeared, including sICH (odds ratio [OR]&lt;sub&gt;unadjusted&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.53 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.74–3.14], OR&lt;sub&gt;adjusted&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.52 [95% CI = 0.13–2.16], OR&lt;sub&gt;matched&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.68 [95% CI = 0.15–3.03], OR&lt;sub&gt;weighted&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.95 [95% CI = 0.39–2.32]), mortality (OR&lt;sub&gt;unadjusted&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.49 [95% CI = 1.00–2.24], OR&lt;sub&gt;adjusted&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.98 [95% CI = 0.5–1.92], OR&lt;sub&gt;matched&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.13 [95% CI = 0.55–2.33], OR&lt;sub&gt;weighted&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.17 [95% CI = 0.73–1.88]), and functional outcome (mRS ≥ 3/ordinal mRS: OR&lt;sub&gt;unadjusted&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.33 [95% CI = 0.96–1.84]/1.35 [95% CI = 1.01–1.81], OR&lt;sub&gt;adjusted&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.78 [95% CI = 0.45–1.32]/0.78 [95% CI = 0.52–1.16], OR&lt;sub&gt;matched&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.75 [95% CI = 0.43–1.32]/0.45 [95% CI = 0.10–2.06], OR&lt;sub&gt;weighted&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.87 [95% CI = 0.57–1.34]/1.00 [95% CI = 0.66–1.52]). These results were consistent regardless of whether patients had an eventual diagnosis of ischemic stroke (89/146) or stroke mimic (57/146 SaO patients).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SaO was not an independent predictor of poor prognosis. Withholding IVT from patients with assumed ischemic stroke presenting with SaO seems unjustified. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02947</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Combinatorial threshold-linear networks (CTLNs) are a special class of neural
networks whose dynamics are tightly controlled by an underlying directed graph.
In prior work, we showed that target-free cliques of the graph correspond to
stable fixed points of the dynamics, and we conjectured that these are the only
stable fixed points allowed. In this paper we prove that the conjecture holds
in a variety of special cases, including for graphs with very strong inhibition
and graphs of size $n \leq 4$. We also provide further evidence for the
conjecture by showing that sparse graphs and graphs that are nearly cliques can
never support stable fixed points. Finally, we translate some results from
extremal combinatorics to upper bound the number of stable fixed points of
CTLNs in cases where the conjecture holds.

dis-regulation on the level of the single entities is still unclear. Using
generic Hodgkin-Huxley type of models, we investigate here how channel defects
in single beta-cells affect the intercellular communication, and whether the
collective dynamics of the population can be thereby influenced. We identify a
stark contrast between the dynamical behavior of homogeneous and heterogenous
populations of cells. Whereas in the first case, when all of the cells acquired
channel defects, a coupling interval can be found for which the pathological
dynamics is stabilized and will be exhibited with $\approx 100\%$ probability,
in a heterogenous population, at least $N/2+1$ cells must have the channel
defects in order for the pathological dynamics to be stabilizied. The numerical
simulations demonstrated however that the probability to exhibit the
pathological dynamics in this case is maintained at $&amp;lt;10\%$, even when the
population contains only a single cell that displays physiological dynamics.
This results therefore suggest that the physiological bursting dynamics of a
population of beta-cells is cooperatively regulated, even when single-cells
acquire disfunctional channels that induce intercellular communication defects.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02931</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This study presents a comprehensive analytic description in terms of the
empirical &quot;whole minus sum&quot; version of Integrated Information in comparison to
the &quot;decoder based&quot; version for the &quot;spiking-bursting&quot; discrete-time,
discrete-state stochastic model, which was recently introduced to describe a
specific type of dynamics in a neuron-astrocyte network. The &quot;whole minus sum&quot;
information may change sign, and an interpretation of this transition in terms
of &quot;net synergy&quot; is available in the literature. This motivates our particular
interest to the sign of the &quot;whole minus sum&quot; information in our analytical
consideration. The behavior of the &quot;whole minus sum&quot; and &quot;decoder based&quot;
information measures are found to bear a lot of similarity, showing their
mutual asymptotic convergence as time-uncorrelated activity is increased, with
the sign transition of the &quot;whole minus sum&quot; information associated to a rapid
growth in the &quot;decoder based&quot; information. The study aims at creating a
theoretical base for using the spiking-bursting model as a well understood
reference point for applying Integrated Information concepts to systems
exhibiting similar bursting behavior (in particular, to neuron-astrocyte
networks). The model can also be of interest as a new discrete-state test bench
for different formulations of Integrated Information.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02833</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;With the advancement of synthetic biology, several new tools have been
conceptualized over the years as alternative treatments for current medical
procedures. Most of those applications are applied to various chronic diseases.
This work investigates how synthetically engineered neurons can operate as
digital logic gates that can be used towards bio-computing for the brain. We
quantify the accuracy of logic gates under high firing rates amid a network of
neurons and by how much it can smooth out uncontrolled neuronal firings. To
test the efficacy of our method, simulations composed of computational models
of neurons connected in a structure that represents a logic gate are performed.
The simulations demonstrated the accuracy of performing the correct logic
operation, and how specific properties such as the firing rate can play an
important role in the accuracy. As part of the analysis, the Mean squared error
is used to quantify the quality of our proposed model and predicting the
accurate operation of a gate based on different sampling frequencies. As an
application, the logic gates were used to trap epileptic seizures in a neuronal
network, where the results demonstrated the effectiveness of reducing the
firing rate. Our proposed system has the potential for computing numerous
neurological conditions of the brain.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many biological learning systems such as the mushroom body, hippocampus, and
cerebellum are built from sparsely connected networks of neurons. For a new
understanding of such networks, we study the function spaces induced by sparse
random features and characterize what functions may and may not be learned. A
network with $d$ inputs per neuron is found to be equivalent to an additive
model of order $d$, whereas with a degree distribution the network combines
additive terms of different orders. We identify three specific advantages of
sparsity: additive function approximation is a powerful inductive bias that
limits the curse of dimensionality, sparse networks are stable to outlier noise
in the inputs, and sparse random features are scalable. Thus, even simple brain
architectures can be powerful function approximators. Finally, we hope that
this work helps popularize kernel theories of networks among computational
neuroscientists.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02076</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The increasing access to brain signal data using electroencephalography
creates new opportunities to study electrophysiological brain activity and
perform ambulatory diagnoses of neuronal diseases. This work proposes a
pairwise distance learning approach for Schizophrenia classification relying on
the spectral properties of the signal. Given the limited number of observations
(i.e. the case and/or control individuals) in clinical trials, we propose a
Siamese neural network architecture to learn a discriminative feature space
from pairwise combinations of observations per channel. In this way, the
multivariate order of the signal is used as a form of data augmentation,
further supporting the network generalization ability. Convolutional layers
with parameters learned under a cosine contrastive loss are proposed to
adequately explore spectral images derived from the brain signal. Results on a
case-control population show that the features extracted using the proposed
neural network lead to an improved Schizophrenia diagnosis (+10pp in accuracy
and sensitivity) against spectral features, thus suggesting the existence of
non-trivial, discriminative electrophysiological brain patterns.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00905</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human sensorimotor control exhibits remarkable speed and accuracy, and the
tradeoff between them is encapsulated in Fitts' Law for reaching and pointing.
While Fitts related this to Shannon's channel capacity theorem, despite
widespread study of Fitts' Law, a theory that connects implementation of
sensorimotor control at the system and hardware level has not emerged. Here we
describe a theory that connects hardware (neurons and muscles with inherent
severe speed-accuracy tradeoffs) with system level control to explain Fitts'
Law for reaching and related laws. The results supporting the theory show that
diversity between hardware components is exploited to achieve both fast and
accurate control performance despite slow or inaccurate hardware. Such
&quot;diversity-enabled sweet spots&quot; (DESSs) are ubiquitous in biology and
technology, and explain why large heterogeneities exist in biological and
technical components and how both engineers and natural selection routinely
evolve fast and accurate systems using imperfect hardware.

MD patients display a pronounced decrease in global and inter-hemispheric frontal connectivity compared to healthy controls.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/50130</link>
	<content:encoded>Centrosomes are formed when mother centrioles recruit pericentriolar material (PCM) around themselves. The PCM expands dramatically as cells prepare to enter mitosis (a process termed centrosome maturation), but it is unclear how this expansion is achieved. In flies, Spd-2 and Cnn are thought to form a scaffold around the mother centriole that recruits other components of the mitotic PCM, and the Polo-dependent phosphorylation of Cnn at the centrosome is crucial for scaffold assembly. Here, we show that, like Cnn, Spd-2 is specifically phosphorylated at centrosomes. This phosphorylation appears to create multiple phosphorylated S-S/T(p) motifs that allow Spd-2 to recruit Polo to the expanding scaffold. If the ability of Spd-2 to recruit Polo is impaired, the scaffold is initially assembled around the mother centriole, but it cannot expand outwards, and centrosome maturation fails. Our findings suggest that interactions between Spd-2, Polo and Cnn form a positive feedback loop that drives the dramatic expansion of the mitotic PCM in fly embryos.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/49682</link>
	<content:encoded>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) imports ATP and uses energy from ATP hydrolysis for protein folding and trafficking. However, little is known about how this vital ATP transport occurs across the ER membrane. Here, using three commonly used cell lines (CHO, INS1 and HeLa), we report that ATP enters the ER lumen through a cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-antagonized mechanism, or &lt;i&gt;Ca&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;ATiER&lt;/i&gt; (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-Antagonized Transport into ER). Significantly, we show that mitochondria supply ATP to the ER and a SERCA-dependent Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; gradient across the ER membrane is necessary for ATP transport into the ER, through SLC35B1/AXER. We propose that under physiological conditions, increases in cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; inhibit ATP import into the ER lumen to limit ER ATP consumption. Furthermore, the ATP level in the ER is readily depleted by oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) inhibitors and that ER protein misfolding increases ATP uptake from mitochondria into the ER. These findings suggest that ATP usage in the ER may increase mitochondrial OxPhos while decreasing glycolysis, i.e., an '&lt;i&gt;anti-Warburg&lt;/i&gt;' effect.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/48629</link>
	<content:encoded>Kinesin-1 and cytoplasmic dynein are microtubule (MT) motors that transport intracellular cargos. It remains unclear how these motors move along MTs densely coated with obstacles of various sizes in the cytoplasm. Here, we tested the ability of single and multiple motors to bypass synthetic obstacles on MTs &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Contrary to previous reports, we found that mammalian dynein is highly capable of bypassing obstacles. Human kinesin-1 motors fail to avoid obstacles, consistent with their inability to take sideways steps on to neighboring MT protofilaments. Kinesins overcome this limitation when working in teams, bypassing obstacles as effectively as multiple dyneins. Cargos driven by multiple kinesin or dyneins are also capable of rotating around the MT to bypass large obstacles. These results suggest that multiplicity of motors is required not only for transporting cargos over long distances and generating higher forces, but also for maneuvering of the cargos on obstacle-coated MT surfaces.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Evolution of Yin and Yang isoforms of a chromatin remodeling subunit precedes the creation of two genes</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/48119</link>
	<content:encoded>Genes can encode multiple isoforms, broadening their functions and providing a molecular substrate to evolve phenotypic diversity. Evolution of isoform function is a potential route to adapt to new environments. Here we show that &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt;, beneficial alleles in the &lt;i&gt;nurf-1 &lt;/i&gt;gene became fixed in two laboratory lineages of &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; after isolation from the wild in 1951, before methods of cryopreservation were developed. &lt;i&gt;nurf-1 &lt;/i&gt;encodes an ortholog of BPTF, a large (&amp;gt;300kD) multidomain subunit of the NURF chromatin remodeling complex. Using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing and transgenic rescue, we demonstrate that in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;nurf-1 &lt;/i&gt;has split into two, largely non-overlapping isoforms (NURF-1.D and NURF-1.B, which we call Yin and Yang, respectively) that share only two of 26 exons. Both isoforms are essential for normal gametogenesis but have opposite effects on male/female gamete differentiation. Reproduction in hermaphrodites, which involves production of both sperm and oocytes, requires a balance of these opposing Yin and Yang isoforms. Transgenic rescue and genetic position of the fixed mutations suggest that different isoforms are modified in each laboratory strain. In a related clade of &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis &lt;/i&gt;nematodes, the shared exons have duplicated, resulting in the split of the Yin and Yang isoforms into separate genes, each containing approximately 200 amino acids of duplicated sequence that has undergone accelerated protein evolution following the duplication. Associated with this duplication event is the loss of two additional &lt;i&gt;nurf-1 &lt;/i&gt;transcripts, including the long-form transcript and a newly identified, highly expressed transcript encoded by the duplicated exons. We propose these lost transcripts are non-functional side products necessary to transcribe the Yin and Yang transcripts in the same cells. Our work demonstrates how gene sharing, through the production of multiple isoforms, can precede the creation of new, independent genes.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Learning the structure of the world: The adaptive nature of state-space and action representations in multi-stage decision-making</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/S86QKhfqMKs/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Amir Dezfouli, Bernard W. Balleine&lt;/p&gt;

State-space and action representations form the building blocks of decision-making processes in the brain; states map external cues to the current situation of the agent whereas actions provide the set of motor commands from which the agent can choose to achieve specific goals. Although these factors differ across environments, it is currently unknown whether or how accurately state and action representations are acquired by the agent because previous experiments have typically provided this information a priori through instruction or pre-training. Here we studied how state and action representations adapt to reflect the structure of the world when such a priori knowledge is not available. We used a sequential decision-making task in rats in which they were required to pass through multiple states before reaching the goal, and for which the number of states and how they map onto external cues were unknown a priori. We found that, early in training, animals selected actions as if the task was not sequential and outcomes were the immediate consequence of the most proximal action. During the course of training, however, rats recovered the true structure of the environment and made decisions based on the expanded state-space, reflecting the multiple stages of the task. Similarly, we found that the set of actions expanded with training, although the emergence of new action sequences was sensitive to the experimental parameters and specifics of the training procedure. We conclude that the profile of choices shows a gradual shift from simple representations to more complex structures compatible with the structure of the world.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/S86QKhfqMKs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Cost-benefit trade-offs in decision-making and learning</title>

Value-based decision-making involves trading off the cost associated with an action against its expected reward. Research has shown that both physical and mental effort constitute such subjective costs, biasing choices away from effortful actions, and discounting the value of obtained rewards. Facing conflicts between competing action alternatives is considered aversive, as recruiting cognitive control to overcome conflict is effortful. Moreover, engaging control to proactively suppress irrelevant information that could conflict with task-relevant information would presumably also be cognitively costly. Yet, it remains unclear whether the cognitive control demands involved in preventing and resolving conflict also constitute costs in value-based decisions. The present study investigated this question by embedding irrelevant distractors (flanker arrows) within a reversal-learning task, with intermixed free and instructed trials. Results showed that participants learned to adapt their free choices to maximize rewards, but were nevertheless biased to follow the suggestions of irrelevant distractors. Thus, the perceived cost of investing cognitive control to suppress an external suggestion could sometimes trump internal value representations. By adapting computational models of reinforcement learning, we assessed the influence of conflict at both the decision and learning stages. Modelling the decision showed that free choices were more biased when participants were less sure about which action was more rewarding. This supports the hypothesis that the costs linked to conflict management were traded off against expected rewards. During the learning phase, we found that learning rates were reduced in instructed, relative to free, choices. Learning rates were further reduced by conflict between an instruction and subjective action values, whereas learning was not robustly influenced by conflict between one’s actions and external distractors. Our results show that the subjective cognitive control costs linked to conflict factor into value-based decision-making, and highlight that different types of conflict may have different effects on learning about action outcomes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pJISSmHKN50&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Deciphering the mechanisms of regulation of metabolic networks subjected to perturbations, including disease states and drug-induced stress, relies on tracing metabolic fluxes. One of the most informative data to predict metabolic fluxes are &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C based metabolomics, which provide information about how carbons are redistributed along central carbon metabolism. Such data can be integrated using &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C Metabolic Flux Analysis (&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C MFA) to provide quantitative metabolic maps of flux distributions. However, &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C MFA might be unable to reduce the solution space towards a unique solution either in large metabolic networks or when small sets of measurements are integrated. Here we present parsimonious &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C MFA (p&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CMFA), an approach that runs a secondary optimization in the &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C MFA solution space to identify the solution that minimizes the total reaction flux. Furthermore, flux minimization can be weighted by gene expression measurements allowing seamless integration of gene expression data with &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C data. As proof of concept, we demonstrate how p&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CMFA can be used to estimate intracellular flux distributions from &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C measurements and transcriptomics data. We have implemented p&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CMFA in Iso2Flux, our in-house developed isotopic steady-state &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C MFA software.

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Adaptations during Maturation in an Identified Honeybee Interneuron Responsive to Waggle Dance Vibration Signals</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/5/ENEURO.0454-18.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Honeybees are social insects, and individual bees take on different social roles as they mature, performing a multitude of tasks that involve multi-modal sensory integration. Several activities vital for foraging, like flight and waggle dance communication, involve sensing air vibrations through their antennae. We investigated changes in the identified vibration-sensitive interneuron DL-Int-1 in the honeybee &lt;i&gt;Apis mellifera&lt;/i&gt; during maturation by comparing properties of neurons from newly emerged adult and forager honeybees. Although comparison of morphological reconstructions of the neurons revealed no significant changes in gross dendritic features, consistent and region-dependent changes were found in dendritic density. Comparison of electrophysiological properties showed an increase in the firing rate differences between stimulus and nonstimulus periods in foragers compared with newly emerged adult bees. The observed differences in neurons of foragers compared with newly emerged adult honeybees suggest refined connectivity, improved signal propagation, and enhancement of response features possibly important for the network processing of air vibration signals relevant for the waggle dance communication of honeybees.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Dimethylethanolamine Decreases Epileptiform Activity in Acute Human Hippocampal Slices in vitro</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00209</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of focal epilepsy with about 30% of patients developing pharmacoresistance. These patients continue to suffer from seizures despite polytherapy with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and have an increased risk for premature death, thus requiring further efforts for the development of new antiepileptic therapies. The molecule dimethylethanolamine (DMEA) has been tested as a potential treatment in various neurological diseases, albeit the functional mechanism of action was never fully understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of DMEA on neuronal activity in single-cell recordings of primary neuronal cultures. DMEA decreased the frequency of spontaneous synaptic events in a concentration-dependent manner with no apparent effect on resting membrane potential (RMP) or action potential (AP) threshold. We further tested whether DMEA can exert antiepileptic effects in human brain tissue ex vivo. We analyzed the effect of DMEA on epileptiform activity in the CA1 region of the resected hippocampus of TLE patients in vitro by recording extracellular field potentials in the pyramidal cell layer. Epileptiform burst activity in resected hippocampal tissue from TLE patients remained stable over several hours and was pharmacologically suppressed by lacosamide, demonstrating the applicability of our platform to test antiepileptic efficacy. Similar to lacosamide, DMEA also suppressed epileptiform activity in the majority of samples, albeit with variable interindividual effects. In conclusion, DMEA might present a new approach for treatment in pharmacoresistant TLE and further studies will be required to identify its exact mechanism of action and the involved molecular targets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00040</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Years of research have added to our understanding of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). None-the-less there is still much that is poorly understood. There is a need for, and ongoing interest in, developing a deeper understanding of this disorder to optimally identify risk and better inform treatment. Here, we present a compilation of findings examining ADHD both behaviorally and using neurophysiologic markers. Drawing on early work of McIntosh and co-investigators, we examined response to sensory challenge in children with ADHD, measuring HPA activity and electrodermal response (EDR) secondary to sensory stressors. In addition, we have examined the relationship between these physiologic measures, and reports of behavioral sensory over-responsivity and anxiety. Findings suggest that sensory responsivity differentiates among children with ADHD and warrants consideration. We link these findings with research conducted both prior to and after our own work and emphasize that there a growing knowledge supporting a relationship between ADHD and sensory over-responsivity, but more research is needed. Given the call from the National Institute of Health to move toward a more dimensional diagnostic process for mental health concerns, and away from the more routine categorical diagnostic process, we suggest sensory over-responsivity as a dimension in the diagnostic process for children with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Modulation of Neural Activity for Myelination in the Central Nervous System</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00952</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electrical stimulation has been playing a significant role in revealing various functions and mechanisms of the nervous system. It is no different for myelination, a process in which oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS) or Schwann Cells in the peripheral nerve system (PNS) wrap around axons to provide an insulating layer in vitro and in vivo. It has been widely recognized that the myelin sheath accelerates axon signal conduction and provides neuroprotection. Recent studies have begun to reveal its role in plasticity. The major mechanism that enables this process is activity-dependent myelination – the phenomenon where neuronal activity supports oligodendrocyte maturation and myelin sheath formation. In light of recent discoveries, a better understanding of this phenomenon has a potential to provide therapeutic targets for not only demyelinating diseases, but also psychiatric disorders. There is a growing need for experimental platforms capable of dissecting the effect of neural activity on myelination in health and disease. The effect of neural activity is commonly studied by comparing the myelination levels in cultures with neurons of low and high activity. Electrical stimulation is particularly well suited as a method of inducing neural activity in these systems. In this review, we describe in vitro platforms for studying activity-dependent myelination, which utilize neuron stimulation via electrical field. We also discuss stimulation profiles, as well as the alternatives to electrical stimulation in the context of regular, compartmentalized, and organotypic co-cultures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is a major neurological disorder characterized by repeated seizures afflicting 1% of the global population. The emergence of seizures is associated with several comorbidities and severely decreases the quality of life of patients. Unfortunately, around 30% of patients do not respond to first-line treatment using anti-seizure drugs (ASDs). Furthermore, it is still unclear how seizures arise in the healthy brain. Therefore, it is critical to have well developed models where a causal understanding of epilepsy can be investigated. While the development of seizures has been studied in several animal models, using chemical or electrical induction, deciphering the results of such studies has been difficult due to the uncertainty of the cell population being targeted as well as potential confounds such as brain damage from the procedure itself. Here we describe novel approaches using combinations of optical and genetic methods for studying epileptogenesis. These approaches can circumvent some shortcomings associated with the classical animal models and may thus increase the likelihood of developing new treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00935</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are incurable neurodegenerative conditions. A non-coding hexanucleotide (GGGGCC) repeat expansion in the c9orf72 gene is the most common genetic cause of ALS/FTD. We present a cellular model of c9ALS/FTD where induced neurons (iNeurons) are generated within 2 weeks by direct conversion of patients‘ dermal fibroblasts through down-regulation of polypyrimidine-tract-binding protein 1 (PTB1). While sense (S) and anti-sense (AS) intranuclear RNA foci were observed in both fibroblasts and iNeurons, the accumulation of (S) and (AS) repeat-associated non-ATG translation (RANT) products were detected only in iNeurons. Importantly, anti-sense oligonucleotides (ASOs) against the (S) repeat transcript lead to decreased (S) RNA foci staining and a reduction of the corresponding RANT products without affecting its (AS) counterparts. ASOs treatment also rescued the cell viability upon stressful stimulus. The results indicate that iNeurons is an advantageous model that not only recapitulates c9ALS/FTD hallmark features but can also help uncover promising therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00819</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Optogenetics provide a potential alternative approach to the treatment of chronic pain, in which complex pathology often hampers efficacy of standard pharmacological approaches. Technological advancements in the development of thin, wireless, and mechanically flexible optoelectronic implants offer new routes to control the activity of subsets of neurons and nerve fibers in vivo. This study reports a novel and advanced design of battery-free, flexible, and lightweight devices equipped with one or two miniaturized LEDs, which can be individually controlled in real time. Two proof-of-concept experiments in mice demonstrate the feasibility of these devices. First, we show that blue-light devices implanted on top of the lumbar spinal cord can excite channelrhodopsin expressing nociceptors to induce place aversion. Second, we show that nocifensive withdrawal responses can be suppressed by green-light optogenetic (Archaerhodopsin-mediated) inhibition of action potential propagation along the sciatic nerve. One salient feature of these devices is that they can be operated via modern tablets and smartphones without bulky and complex lab instrumentation. In addition to the optical stimulation, the design enables the simultaneously wireless recording of the temperature in proximity of the stimulation area. As such, these devices are primed for translation to human patients with implications in the treatment of neurological and psychiatric conditions far beyond chronic pain syndromes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Evaluation of Neural Degeneration Biomarkers in the Prefrontal Cortex for Early Identification of Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment: An fNIRS Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00317</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a condition characterizing poor cognition, is associated with aging and depicts early symptoms of severe cognitive impairment, known as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Meanwhile, early detection of MCI can prevent progression to AD. A great deal of research has been performed in the past decade on MCI detection. However, availability of biomarkers for MCI detection requires greater attention. In our study, we evaluated putative and reliable biomarkers for diagnosing MCI by performing different mental tasks (i.e., N-back task, Stroop task, and verbal fluency task) using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals on a group of 15 MCI patients and 9 healthy control (HC). The 15 digital biomarkers (i.e., five means, seven slopes, peak, skewness, and kurtosis) and two image biomarkers (t-map, correlation map) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) (i.e., left PFC, middle PFC, and right PFC) between the MCI and HC groups were investigated by the statistical analysis, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and convolutional neural network (CNN) individually. The results reveal that the statistical analysis using digital biomarkers (with a p-value &amp;lt; 0.05) could not distinguish the MCI patients from the HC over 60% accuracy. Therefore, the current statistical analysis needs to be improved to be used for diagnosing the MCI patients. The best accuracy with LDA was 76.67% with the N-back and Stroop tasks. However, the CNN classification results trained by image biomarkers showed a high accuracy. In particular, the CNN results trained via t-maps revealed the best accuracy (90.62%) with the N-back task, whereas the CNN result trained by the correlation maps was 85.58% with the N-back task. Also, the results illustrated that investigating the sub-regions (i.e., right, middle, left) of the PFC for detecting MCI would be better than examining the whole PFC. The t-map (or/and the correlation map) is conclusively recommended as an image biomarker for early detection of AD. The combination of CNN and image biomarkers can provide a reliable clinical tool for diagnosing MCI patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00312</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When interacting with the environment, the sensorimotor system faces temporal and spatial discrepancies between sensory inputs, such as delay in sensory information transmission, and asymmetrical visual inputs across space. These discrepancies can affect motor control and the representation of space. We recently showed that adaptation to a laterally asymmetric delay in the visual feedback induces neglect-like effects in blind drawing movements, expressed by asymmetrical elongation of circles that are drawn in different workspaces and directions; this establishes a possible connection between delayed feedback and asymmetrical spatial processing in the control of action. In the current study, we investigate whether such adaptation also influences visual perception. In addition, we examined transfer to another motor task – a line bisection task that is commonly used to detect spatial disorders, and extend these results to examine the mapping of these neglect-like effects. We performed two sets of experiments in which participants executed lateral reaching movements, and were exposed to visual feedback delay only in the left workspace. We examined transfer of adaptation to a perceptual line bisection task – answers about the perceived midline of lines that were presented in different directions and workspaces, and to a blind motor line bisection task – reaching movements toward the centers of similar lines. We found that the adaptation to the asymmetrical delay transferred to the control of lateral movements, but did not affect the perceived location of the midlines. Our results clarify the effect of asymmetrical delayed visual feedback on perception and action, and provide potential insights on the link between visuomotor delay and neurological disorders such as the hemispatial neglect syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: How Neurophysiological Measures Can be Used to Enhance the Evaluation of Remote Tower Solutions</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00303</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;New solutions in operational environments are often, among objective measurements, evaluated by using subjective assessment and judgment from experts. Anyhow, it has been demonstrated that subjective measures suffer from poor resolution due to a high intra and inter-operator variability. Also, performance measures, if available, could provide just partial information, since an operator could achieve the same performance but experiencing a different workload. In this study, we aimed to demonstrate: (i) the higher resolution of neurophysiological measures in comparison to subjective ones; and (ii) how the simultaneous employment of neurophysiological measures and behavioral ones could allow a holistic assessment of operational tools. In this regard, we tested the effectiveness of an electroencephalography (EEG)-based neurophysiological index (W&lt;sub&gt;EEG&lt;/sub&gt; index) in comparing two different solutions (i.e., Normal and Augmented) in terms of experienced workload. In this regard, 16 professional air traffic controllers (ATCOs) have been asked to perform two operational scenarios. Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) has also been recorded to evaluate the level of arousal (i.e., operator involvement) during the two scenarios execution. NASA-TLX questionnaire has been used to evaluate the perceived workload, and an expert was asked to assess performance achieved by the ATCOs. Finally, reaction times on specific operational events relevant for the assessment of the two solutions, have also been collected. Results highlighted that the Augmented solution induced a local increase in subjects performance (Reaction times). At the same time, this solution induced an increase in the workload experienced by the participants (W&lt;sub&gt;EEG&lt;/sub&gt;). Anyhow, this increase is still acceptable, since it did not negatively impact the performance and has to be intended only as a consequence of the higher engagement of the ATCOs. This behavioral effect is totally in line with physiological results obtained in terms of arousal (GSR), that increased during the scenario with augmentation. Subjective measures (NASA-TLX) did not highlight any significant variation in perceived workload. These results suggest that neurophysiological measure provide additional information than behavioral and subjective ones, even at a level of few seconds, and its employment during the pre-operational activities (e.g., design process) could allow a more holistic and accurate evaluation of new solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Simultaneous EEG-NIRS Measurement of the Inferior Parietal Lobule During a Reaching Task With Delayed Visual Feedback</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00301</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We investigated whether the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) responds in real-time to multisensory inconsistency during movement. The IPL is thought to be involved in both the detection of inconsistencies in multisensory information obtained during movement and that obtained during self-other discrimination. However, because of the limited temporal resolution of conventional neuroimaging techniques, it is difficult to distinguish IPL activity during movement from that during self-other discrimination. We simultaneously conducted electroencephalography (EEG) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) with the goal of examining IPL activity with a high spatiotemporal resolution during single reaching movements. Under a visual feedback-delay condition, gamma event-related synchronization (γ-ERS), i.e., an increase in gamma (31–47 Hz) EEG power occurred during reaching movements. This γ-ERS is considered to reflect processing of information about prediction errors. To integrate this temporal information with spatial information from the NIRS signals, we developed a new analysis technique that enabled estimation of the regions that show a hemodynamic response characterized by EEG fluctuation present in the visual feedback-delay condition. As a result, IPL activity was explained by γ-ERS specific to visual feedback delay during movements. Thus, we succeeded in demonstrating real-time activation of the IPL in response to multisensory inconsistency. However, we did not find any correlation between either IPL activity or γ-ERS with the sense of agency. Therefore, our results suggest that while the IPL is influenced by prediction error signals, it does not engage in direct processing underlying the conscious experience of making a movement, which is the foundation of self-other discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Humans often face situations requiring a decision about where to throw an object or when to respond to a stimulus under risk. Several behavioral studies have shown that such motor decisions can be suboptimal, which results from a cognitive bias toward risk-seeking behavior. However, brain regions involved in risk-attitude of motor decision-making remain unclear. Here, we investigated the role of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in risky motor decisions using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). The experiment comprised a selective timing task requiring participants to make a continuous decision about the timing of their response under the risk of no rewards. The participants performed this task twice in a day: before and while receiving either anodal stimulation over the right DLPFC with cathodal stimulation over the left DLPFC (20 min, 2 mA), cathodal stimulation over the right DLPFC with anodal stimulation over the left DLPFC, or sham stimulation. In line with previous studies, their strategies before the stimulation were biased toward risk-seeking. During anodal stimulation over right DLPFC with cathodal stimulation over left DLPFC, participants showed a more conservative strategy to avoid the risk of no rewards. The additional experiment confirmed that tDCS did not affect the ability of timing control regarding the time intervals at which they aimed to respond. These results suggest a potential role for the DLPFC in modulating action selection in motor decision-making under risk.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Brain–Computer Interface-Based Adaptive Automation to Prevent Out-Of-The-Loop Phenomenon in Air Traffic Controllers Dealing With Highly Automated Systems</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00296</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Increasing the level of automation in air traffic management is seen as a measure to increase the performance of the service to satisfy the predicted future demand. This is expected to result in new roles for the human operator: he will mainly monitor highly automated systems and seldom intervene. Therefore, air traffic controllers (ATCos) would often work in a supervisory or control mode rather than in a direct operating mode. However, it has been demonstrated how human operators in such a role are affected by human performance issues, known as Out-Of-The-Loop (OOTL) phenomenon, consisting in lack of attention, loss of situational awareness and de-skilling. A countermeasure to this phenomenon has been identified in the adaptive automation (AA), i.e., a system able to allocate the operative tasks to the machine or to the operator depending on their needs. In this context, psychophysiological measures have been highlighted as powerful tool to provide a reliable, unobtrusive and real-time assessment of the ATCo’s mental state to be used as control logic for AA-based systems. In this paper, it is presented the so-called “Vigilance and Attention Controller”, a system based on electroencephalography (EEG) and eye-tracking (ET) techniques, aimed to assess in real time the vigilance level of an ATCo dealing with a highly automated human–machine interface and to use this measure to adapt the level of automation of the interface itself. The system has been tested on 14 professional ATCos performing two highly realistic scenarios, one with the system disabled and one with the system enabled. The results confirmed that (i) long high automated tasks induce vigilance decreasing and OOTL-related phenomena; (ii) EEG measures are sensitive to these kinds of mental impairments; and (iii) AA was able to counteract this negative effect by keeping the ATCo more involved within the operative task. The results were confirmed by EEG and ET measures as well as by performance and subjective ones, providing a clear example of potential applications and related benefits of AA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Safety and Feasibility of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation for Cognitive Rehabilitation in Patients With Mild or Major Neurocognitive Disorders: A Randomized Sham-Controlled Pilot Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00273</link>
	<content:encoded>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a potentially novel strategy for cognitive enhancement in patients with mild or major neurocognitive disorders. This study aims to assess the safety and efficacy of tDCS during cognitive training on cognitive functioning in patients with mild or major neurocognitive disorders.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;This study was primarily a single arm for safety, secondary a two-arm, parallel, randomized, and sham-controlled trial for potential efficacy. Patients with mild or major neurocognitive disorders were recruited. The participants and raters were blinded to the group assignment. The participants in the active arm received tDCS (anodal; F3, cathodal, Fp2, 2A, 20 min) twice daily for five consecutive days, whereas those in the sham arm received the same amount of sham-tDCS. Calculation and reading tasks were conducted in both arms as a form of cognitive intervention for 20 min during tDCS. The primary outcome was the attrition rate during the trial in the active arm, which is expected to be less than 10%. The secondary outcomes were the between-group differences of adjusted means for several cognitive scales from baseline to post-intervention and follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Twenty patients [nine women (45%)], with a mean (standard deviation) age of 76.1 years participated; nine patients (45%) with minor neurocognitive disorders and 11 (55%) with major neurocognitive disorders were randomized, and 19 of them completed the trial. The attrition rate in the active arm was 0%, with no serious adverse events. Further, in the Intention-to-Treat analysis, patients in the active arm showed no statistically significant improvement compared with those who received the sham in the mean change scores of the mini-mental state examination [0.41; 95% CI (−1.85; 2.67) at day five, 1.08; 95% CI (−1.31; 3.46) at follow-up] and Alzheimer’s disease assessment scale – cognition subscale [1.61; 95% CI (−4.2; 0.98) at day 5, 0.36; 95%CI (−3.19; 2.47) at follow-up].&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that tDCS is safe and tolerable but causes no statistically significant cognitive effects in patients with mild or major neurocognitive disorders. Additional large-scale, well-designed clinical trials are warranted to evaluate the cognitive effects of tDCS as an augmentation to cognitive training.&lt;/p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration&lt;p&gt;www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT03050385.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Metastable Resting State Brain Dynamics</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00062</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Metastability refers to the fact that the state of a dynamical system spends a large amount of time in a restricted region of its available phase space before a transition takes place, bringing the system into another state from where it might recur into the previous one. beim Graben and Hutt (2013) suggested to use the recurrence plot (RP) technique introduced by Eckmann et al. (1987) for the segmentation of system's trajectories into metastable states using recurrence grammars. Here, we apply this recurrence structure analysis (RSA) for the first time to resting-state brain dynamics obtained from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Brain regions are defined according to the brain hierarchical atlas (BHA) developed by Diez et al. (2015), and as a consequence, regions present high-connectivity in both structure (obtained from diffusion tensor imaging) and function (from the blood-level dependent-oxygenation—BOLD—signal). Remarkably, regions observed by Diez et al. were completely time-invariant. Here, in order to compare this static picture with the metastable systems dynamics obtained from the RSA segmentation, we determine the number of metastable states as a measure of complexity for all subjects and for region numbers varying from 3 to 100. We find RSA convergence toward an optimal segmentation of 40 metastable states for normalized BOLD signals, averaged over BHA modules. Next, we build a bistable dynamics at population level by pooling 30 subjects after Hausdorff clustering. In link with this finding, we reflect on the different modeling frameworks that can allow for such scenarios: heteroclinic dynamics, dynamics with riddled basins of attraction, multiple-timescale dynamics. Finally, we characterize the metastable states both functionally and structurally, using templates for resting state networks (RSNs) and the automated anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00410</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dysregulation of various APP trafficking components in the endosome has been previously implicated in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Although single nucleotide polymorphisms within the gene locus encoding the endosomal component, SNX8 have been previously associated with AD, how SNX8 levels are altered and its contribution to AD onset is currently unknown. Here, we observe decreased expression of SNX8 in human AD and AD mouse brain. SNX8 predominantly localized to early and late endosomes, where SNX8 overexpression enhanced total APP levels, cell surface APP distribution and consequent soluble APPα cleavage. SNX8 depletion resulted in elevated β-amyloid (Aβ) levels, while SNX8 overexpression reduced Aβ levels in cells and in an APP/PS1 AD mouse model. Importantly, SNX8 overexpression rescued cognitive impairment in APP/PS1 mice. Together, these results implicate a neuroprotective role for SNX8 in enhancing non-amyloidogenic APP trafficking and processing pathways. Given that endosomal dysfunction is an early event in AD, restoration of dysfunctional endosomal components such as SNX8 may be beneficial in future therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Excitability Tuning of Axons by Afterdepolarization</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00407</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The axon provides a sole output of the neuron which propagates action potentials reliably to the axon terminal and transmits neuronal information to the postsynaptic neuron across the synapse. A classical view of neuronal signaling is based on these two processes, namely binary (all or none) signaling along the axon and graded (tunable) signaling at the synapse. Recent studies, however, have revealed that the excitability of the axon is subject to dynamic tuning for a short period after axonal action potentials. This was first described as post-spike hyperexcitability, as measured by the changes in stimulus threshold for a short period after an action potential. Later on, direct recordings from central nervous system (CNS) axons or axon terminals using subcellular patch-clamp recording showed that axonal spikes are often followed by afterdepolarization (ADP) lasting for several tens of milliseconds and has been suggested to mediate post-spike hyperexcitability. In this review article, I focused on the mechanisms as well as the functional significance of ADP in fine-scale modulation of axonal spike signaling in the CNS, with special reference to hippocampal mossy fibers, one of the best-studied CNS axons. As a common basic mechanism underlying axonal ADP, passive propagation by the capacitive discharge of the axonal membrane as well as voltage-dependent K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductance underlies the generation of ADP. Small but prolonged axonal ADP lasting for several tens of milliseconds may influence the subsequent action potential and transmitter release from the axon terminals. Both duration and amplitude of axonal spike are subject to such modulation by preceding action potential-ADP sequence, deviating from the conventional assumption of digital nature of axonal spike signaling. Impact on the transmitter release is also discussed in the context of axonal spike plasticity. Axonal spike is subject to dynamic control on a fine-scale and thereby contributes to the short-term plasticity at the synapse.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00404</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the role of axons in neuronal information processing is a fundamental task in neuroscience. Over the last years, sophisticated patch-clamp investigations have provided unexpected and exciting data on axonal phenomena and functioning, but there is still a need for methods to investigate full axonal arbors at sufficient throughput. Here, we present a new method for the simultaneous mapping of the axonal arbors of a large number of individual neurons, which relies on their extracellular signals that have been recorded with high-density microelectrode arrays (HD-MEAs). The segmentation of axons was performed based on the local correlation of extracellular signals. Comparison of the results with both, ground truth and receiver operator characteristics, shows that the new segmentation method outperforms previously used methods. Using a standard HD-MEA, we mapped the axonal arbors of 68 neurons in &amp;lt;6 h. The fully automated method can be extended to new generations of HD-MEAs with larger data output and is estimated to provide data of axonal arbors of thousands of neurons within recording sessions of a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Unique Features of Network Bursts Emerge From the Complex Interplay of Excitatory and Inhibitory Receptors in Rat Neocortical Networks</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00377</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spontaneous network activity plays a fundamental role in the formation of functional networks during early development. The landmark of this activity is the recurrent emergence of intensive time-limited network bursts (NBs) rapidly spreading across the entire dissociated culture in vitro. The main excitatory mediators of NBs are glutamatergic alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) and N-Methyl-D-aspartic-acid receptors (NMDARs) that express fast and slow ion channel kinetics, respectively. The fast inhibition of the activity is mediated through gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;Rs). Although the AMPAR, NMDAR and GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R kinetics have been biophysically characterized in detail at the monosynaptic level in a variety of brain areas, the unique features of NBs emerging from the kinetics and the complex interplay of these receptors are not well understood. The goal of this study is to analyze the contribution of fast GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;Rs on AMPAR- and NMDAR- mediated spontaneous NB activity in dissociated neonatal rat cortical cultures at 3 weeks in vitro. The networks were probed by both acute and gradual application of each excitatory receptor antagonist and combinations of acute excitatory and inhibitory receptor antagonists. At the same time, the extracellular network-wide activity was recorded with microelectrode arrays (MEAs). We analyzed the characteristic NB measures extracted from NB rate profiles and the distributions of interspike intervals, interburst intervals, and electrode recruitment time as well as the similarity of spatio-temporal patterns of network activity under different receptor antagonists. We show that NBs were rapidly initiated and recruited as well as diversely propagated by AMPARs and temporally and spatially maintained by NMDARs. GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;Rs reduced the spiking frequency in AMPAR-mediated networks and dampened the termination of NBs in NMDAR-mediated networks as well as slowed down the recruitment of activity in all networks. Finally, we show characteristic super bursts composed of slow NBs with highly repetitive spatio-temporal patterns in gradually AMPAR blocked networks. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to unravel in detail how the three main mediators of synaptic transmission uniquely shape the NB characteristics, such as the initiation, maintenance, recruitment and termination of NBs in cortical cell cultures in vitro.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Accelerated Ovarian Failure as a Unique Model to Study Peri-Menopause Influence on Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00242</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Despite decades of extensive research efforts, efficacious therapies for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are lacking. The multi-factorial nature of AD neuropathology and symptomatology has taught us that a single therapeutic approach will most likely not fit all. Women constitute ~70% of the affected AD population, and pathology and rate of symptoms progression are 2–3 times higher in women than men. Epidemiological data suggest that menopausal estrogen loss may be causative of the more severe symptoms observed in AD women, however, results from clinical trials employing estrogen replacement therapy are inconsistent. AD pathological hallmarks—amyloid β (Aβ), neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and chronic gliosis—are laid down during a 20-year prodromal period before clinical symptoms appear, which coincides with the menopause transition (peri-menopause) in women (~45–54-years-old). Peri-menopause is marked by widely fluctuating estrogen levels resulting in periods of irregular hormone-receptor interactions. Recent studies showed that peri-menopausal women have increased indicators of AD phenotype (brain Aβ deposition and hypometabolism), and peri-menopausal women who used hormone replacement therapy (HRT) had a reduced AD risk. This suggests that neuroendocrine changes during peri-menopause may be a trigger that increases risk of AD in women. Studies on sex differences have been performed in several AD rodent models over the years. However, it has been challenging to study the menopause influence on AD due to lack of optimal models that mimic the human process. Recently, the rodent model of accelerated ovarian failure (AOF) was developed, which uniquely recapitulates human menopause, including a transitional peri-AOF period with irregular estrogen fluctuations and a post-AOF stage with low estrogen levels. This model has proven useful in hypertension and cognition studies with wild type animals. This review article will highlight the molecular mechanisms by which peri-menopause may influence the female brain vulnerability to AD and AD risk factors, such as hypertension and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype. Studies on these biological mechanisms together with the use of the AOF model have the potential to shed light on key molecular pathways underlying AD pathogenesis for the development of precision medicine approaches that take sex and hormonal status into account.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00236</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a severe sociological and clinical problem. Since it was first described, there has been a constant increase in its incidence and, for now, there are no effective treatments since current approved medications have only shown short-term symptomatic benefits. Therefore, it is imperative to increase efforts in the search for molecules and non-pharmacological strategies that are capable of slowing or stopping the progress of the disease and, ideally, to reverse it. The amyloid cascade hypothesis based on the fundamental role of amyloid has been the central hypothesis in the last 30 years. However, since amyloid-directed treatments have shown no relevant beneficial results other theories have been postulated to explain the origin of the pathology. The brain is a highly metabolically active energy-consuming tissue in the human body. It has an almost complete dependence on the metabolism of glucose and uses most of its energy for synaptic transmission. Thus, alterations on the utilization or availability of glucose may be cause for the appearance of neurodegenerative pathologies like AD. In this review article, the hypothesis known as Type 3 Diabetes (T3D) will be evaluated by summarizing some of the data that has been reported in recent years. According to published research, the adherence over time to low saturated fatty acids diets in the context of the Mediterranean diet would reduce the inflammatory levels in brain, with a decrease in the pro-inflammatory glial activation and mitochondrial oxidative stress. In this situation, the insulin receptor pathway would be able to fine tune the mitochondrial biogenesis in neuronal cells, regulation the adenosine triphosphate/adenosine diphosphate intracellular balance, and becoming a key factor involved in the preservation of the synaptic connexions and neuronal plasticity. In addition, new targets and strategies for the treatment of AD will be considered in this review for their potential as new pharmacological or non-pharmacological approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;To examine the prospective association between blood biomarkers of immune functioning (i.e., innate immune activation, adaptive immunity, and inflammation) and subsequent cognitive decline and clinical progression to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in cognitively normal individuals.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The BIOCARD study is an observational cohort study of N = 191 initially cognitively healthy participants (mean age 65.2 years). Blood plasma samples were assayed for markers of chronic inflammation (TNFR1, IL-6), adaptive immunity (CD25), and innate immune activation (CD14 and CD163). Participants were followed annually for ongoing clinical assessment and cognitive testing for up to 7.3 years. Primary study outcomes were progression to MCI and cognitive change over time, as measured by a global factor score encompassing multiple cognitive domains.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Higher levels of plasma TNFR1 were associated with greater risk of progression from normal cognition to MCI (HR: 3.27; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.27, 8.40). Elevated levels of TNFR1 were also associated with steeper rate of cognitive decline on follow-up but not with baseline cognitive performance. Baseline IL-6 levels and markers of innate and adaptive immune activation showed no relationship with MCI risk or cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Inflammation, mediated by TNF signaling, may play a selective role in the early phase of AD. Accordingly, plasma TNFR1 may facilitate improved prediction of disease progression for individuals in the preclinical stage of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: 3D computational models explain muscle activation patterns and energetic functions of internal structures in fish swimming</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/A2T-f6QuEvU/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Tingyu Ming, Bowen Jin, Jialei Song, Haoxiang Luo, Ruxu Du, Yang Ding&lt;/p&gt;

How muscles are used is a key to understanding the internal driving of fish swimming. However, the underlying mechanisms of some features of the muscle activation patterns and their differential appearance in different species are still obscure. In this study, we explain the muscle activation patterns by using 3D computational fluid dynamics models coupled to the motion of fish with prescribed deformation and examining the torque and power required along the fish body with two primary swimming modes. We find that the torque required by the hydrodynamic forces and body inertia exhibits a wave pattern that travels faster than the curvature wave in both anguilliform and carangiform swimmers, which can explain the traveling wave speeds of the muscle activations. Notably, intermittent negative power (i.e., power delivered by the fluid to the body) on the posterior part, along with a timely transfer of torque and energy by tendons, explains the decrease in the duration of muscle activation towards the tail. The torque contribution from the body elasticity further clarifies the wave speed increase or the reverse of the wave direction of the muscle activation on the posterior part of a carangiform swimmer. For anguilliform swimmers, the absence of the aforementioned changes in the muscle activation on the posterior part is consistent with our torque prediction and the absence of long tendons from experimental observations. These results provide novel insights into the functions of muscles and tendons as an integral part of the internal driving system, especially from an energy perspective, and they highlight the differences in the internal driving systems between the two primary swimming modes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/A2T-f6QuEvU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Long-Lasting Input-Specific Experience-Dependent Changes of Hippocampus Synaptic Function Measured in the Anesthetized Rat</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/5/ENEURO.0506-18.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;How experience causes long-lasting changes in the brain is a central question in neuroscience. The common view is that synaptic function is altered by experience to change brain circuit functions that underlie conditioned behavior. We examined hippocampus synaptic circuit function &lt;i&gt;in vivo,&lt;/i&gt; in three groups of animals, to assess the impact of experience on hippocampus function in rats. The &quot;conditioned&quot; group acquired a shock-conditioned place response during a cognitively-challenging, hippocampus synaptic plasticity-dependent task. The no-shock group had similar exposure to the environmental conditions but no conditioning. The home-cage group was experimentally naive. After the one-week retention test, under anesthesia, we stimulated the perforant path inputs to CA1, which terminate in stratum lacunosum moleculare (slm), and to the dentate gyrus (DG), which terminate in the molecular layer. We find synaptic compartment specific changes that differ amongst the groups. The evoked field EPSP (fEPSP) and pre-spike field response are enhanced only at the DG input layer and only in conditioned animals. The DG responses, measured by the population spiking activity and post-spike responses, are enhanced in both the conditioned and no-shock groups compared to home-cage animals. These changes are pathway specific because no differences are observed in slm of CA1. These findings demonstrate long-term, experience-dependent, pathway-specific alterations to synaptic circuit function of the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Bursts with High and Low Load of Epileptiform Spikes Show Context-Dependent Correlations in Epileptic Mice</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/5/ENEURO.0299-18.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hypersynchronous network activity is the defining hallmark of epilepsy and manifests in a wide spectrum of phenomena, of which electrographic activity during seizures is only one extreme. The aim of this study was to differentiate between different types of epileptiform activity (EA) patterns and investigate their temporal succession and interactions. We analyzed local field potentials (LFPs) from freely behaving male mice that had received an intrahippocampal kainate injection to model mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). Epileptiform spikes occurred in distinct bursts. Using machine learning, we derived a scale reflecting the spike load of bursts and three main burst categories that we labeled high-load, medium-load, and low-load bursts. We found that bursts of these categories were non-randomly distributed in time. High-load bursts formed clusters and were typically surrounded by transition phases with increased rates of medium-load and low-load bursts. In apparent contradiction to this, increased rates of low-load bursts were also associated with longer background phases, i.e., periods lacking high-load bursting. Furthermore, the rate of low-load bursts was more strongly correlated with the duration of background phases than the overall rate of epileptiform spikes. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that low-level EA could promote network stability but could also participate in transitions towards major epileptiform events, depending on the current state of the network.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Stimulus-Locked Responses on Human Upper Limb Muscles and Corrective Reaches are Preferentially Evoked by Low Spatial Frequencies</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0301-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;In situations requiring immediate action, humans can generate visually-guided responses at remarkably short latencies. Here, to better understand the visual attributes that best evoke such rapid responses, we recorded upper limb muscle activity while participants performed visually-guided reaches towards Gabor patches composed of differing spatial frequencies. We studied reaches initiated from a stable posture (experiment 1, a static condition), or during on-line reach corrections to an abruptly displaced target (experiment 2, a dynamic condition). In both experiments, we detail the latency and prevalence of stimulus-locked responses (SLRs), which are brief bursts of EMG activity that are time-locked to target presentation rather than movement onset. SLRs represent the first wave of EMG recruitment influenced by target presentation, and enable quantification of rapid visuomotor transformations. In both experiments, reach targets composed of low spatial frequencies elicited the shortest latency and most prevalent SLRs, with SLR latency increasing and SLR prevalence decreasing for reach targets composed of progressively higher spatial frequencies. SLRs could be evoked in either the static or dynamic condition, and when present in experiment 2, were associated with shorter latency and larger magnitude corrections. The results in experiment 2 are consistent with a linkage between the forces produced by SLRs and the earliest portion of on-line reach corrections. Overall, our results demonstrate that stimuli composed of low spatial frequencies preferentially evoke the most rapid visuomotor responses that, in the context of rapidly correcting an on-going reaching movement, are associated with earlier and larger on-line reach corrections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Humans have a remarkable capacity to respond quickly to changes in our visual environment. Although our visual world is composed of a range of spatial frequencies, surprisingly little is known about which frequencies preferentially evoke rapid reaching responses. Here, we systematically varied the spatial frequency of peripheral reach targets while measuring EMG activity on an upper limb muscle. We found that visual stimuli composed of low-spatial frequencies elicit the most rapid and robust EMG responses, and also elicit corrective reaches at shorter latencies. Thus, when time is of the essence, low spatial frequencies preferentially drive fast visuomotor responses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Automated Behavioral Experiments in Mice Reveal Periodic Cycles of Task Engagement within Circadian Rhythms</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0121-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;High-throughput automated experiments accelerate discovery in neuroscience research and reduce bias. To enable high-throughput behavioral experiments, we developed a user-friendly and scalable automated system that can simultaneously train hundreds of mice on behavioral tasks, with time-stamped behavioral information recorded continuously for weeks. We trained 12 cages of C57Bl6/J mice (24 mice, 2 mice per cage) to perform auditory behavioral tasks. We found that circadian rhythms modulated overall behavioral activity as expected for nocturnal animals. However, auditory detection and discrimination accuracy remained consistently high in both light and dark cycles. We also found a periodic modulation of behavioral response rates only during the discrimination task, suggesting that the mice periodically reduce task-engagement (i.e., take ‘breaks’) when task difficulty increases due to the more complex stimulus-response paradigm for discrimination vs detection. Our results highlight how automated systems for continuous high-throughput behavioral experiments enable both efficient data collection and new observations on animal behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Automated high-throughput behavioral experiments in mice promise researchers the ability to quickly and reliably asses the behavior of large animal populations, while also minimizing experimenter-induced bias. However, the technical complexities of automation have limited widespread adoption of high-throughput behavioral methods. Here, we present a new tool for behavioral research, the ToneBox, which allows both novice and expert behaviorists to automatically test hundreds of mice simultaneously on different behavioral tasks. We provide manufacturing specifications and detailed documentation of system operation. Using C57Bl6/J mice we show that the ToneBox tracks circadian cycles via behavioral response rates, and that task difficultly modulates duty-cycles of task-engagement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1 alpha (HIF-1{alpha}) counteracts the acute death of cells transplanted into the injured spinal cord</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0092-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Cellular transplantation is in clinical testing for a number of central nervous system disorders, including spinal cord injury (SCI). One challenge is acute transplanted cell death. To prevent this death, there is a need to both establish when the death occurs and develop approaches to mitigate its effects. Here, using luciferase (luc) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressing Schwann cell (SC) transplants in the contused thoracic rat spinal cord 7 days post-injury, we establish via &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; bioluminescent (IVIS) imaging and stereology that cell death occurs prior to 2-3 days post-implantation. We then test an alternative approach to the current paradigm of enhancing transplant survival by including multiple factors along with the cells. To stimulate multiple cellular adaptive pathways concurrently, we activate the hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) transcriptional pathway. Retroviral expression of VP16-HIF-1α in SCs increased HIF-α by 5.9-fold and its target genes implicated in oxygen transport and delivery (VEGF, 2.2-fold) and cellular metabolism (enolase, 1.7-fold). In cell death assays &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, HIF-1α protected cells from H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced oxidative damage. It also provided some protection against camptothecin-induced DNA damage, but not thapsigargin-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress or tunicamycin-induced unfolded protein response. Following transplantation, VP16-HIF-1α increased SC survival by 34.3%. The increase in cell survival was detectable by stereology, but not by &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; luciferase or &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; GFP IVIS imaging. The results support the hypothesis that activating adaptive cellular pathways enhances transplant survival and identifies an alternative pro-survival approach that, with optimization, could be amenable to clinical translation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; To maximize the benefits of cellular transplants for human therapeutic use, there is a critical need to develop strategies that effectively promote transplant survival and permit rapid assessment of transplant survival. The current study: 1) identifies the narrow time window in which transplanted cells die within the injured rat spinal cord, thus establishing the time window in which cytoprotection should be targeted to counteract transplanted cell death; 2) tests the effects of elevating HIF-1α on spinal cord transplant survival, thus demonstrating that activating adaptive transcriptional pathways is protective in SCI, and; 3) demonstrates, by comparing three approaches to quantifying transplant survival, that until faster and more sensitive methods can be developed, stereology remains the most reliable method.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Predicting RNA-binding protein (RBP) specificity is important for understanding gene expression regulation and RNA-mediated enzymatic processes. It is widely believed that RBP binding specificity is determined by both the sequence and structural contexts of RNAs. Existing approaches, including traditional machine learning algorithms and more recently, deep learning models, have been extensively applied to integrate RNA sequence and its predicted or experimental RNA structural probabilities for improving the accuracy of RBP binding prediction. Such models were trained mostly on the large-scale &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; datasets, such as the RNAcompete dataset. However, in RNAcompete, most synthetic RNAs are unstructured, which makes machine learning methods not effectively extract RBP-binding structural preferences. Furthermore, RNA structure may be variable or multi-modal according to both theoretical and experimental evidence. In this work, we propose ThermoNet, a thermodynamic prediction model by integrating a new sequence-embedding convolutional neural network model over a thermodynamic ensemble of RNA secondary structures. First, the sequence-embedding convolutional neural network generalizes the existing k-mer based methods by jointly learning convolutional filters and k-mer embeddings to represent RNA sequence contexts. Second, the thermodynamic average of deep-learning predictions is able to explore structural variability and improves the prediction, especially for the structured RNAs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, including RCK, DeepBind and several other recent state-of-the-art methods for predictions on both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; data. The implementation of ThermoNet is available at https://github.com/suyufeng/ThermoNet.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wUFHIbk0RKo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assess whether biological aging as measured by leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is associated with clinical disability and brain volume loss in multiple sclerosis (MS).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adults with MS/CIS in the UCSF‐EPIC cohort study were included. LTL was measured on DNA samples by quantitative PCR and expressed as telomere to somatic DNA ratio (T/S). Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and 3D T1‐weighted brain MRI were performed at baseline and follow‐up. Associations of baseline LTL with cross‐sectional and longitudinal outcomes were assessed using simple and mixed effects linear regression models. A subset (n=46) had LTL measured over time, and we assessed the association of LTL change with EDSS change with mixed effects models.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Included were 356 women and 160 men (mean age 43 years, median disease duration 6 years, median EDSS 1.5 (range 0‐7), mean T/S ratio 0.97 (SD 0.18)). In baseline analyses adjusted for age, disease duration and sex, for every 0.2 lower LTL, EDSS was 0.27 higher (95%CI 0.13‐0.42, p&amp;lt;0.001) and brain volume was 7.4 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; lower (0.10‐14.7, p=0.047). In longitudinal adjusted analyses, those with lower baseline LTL had higher EDSS and lower brain volumes over time. In adjusted analysis of the subset, LTL change was associated with EDSS change over 10 years: for every 0.2 LTL decrease, EDSS was 0.34 higher (0.08‐0.61, p=0.012).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shorter telomere length was associated with disability independent of chronological age, suggesting biological aging may contribute to neurological injury in MS. Targeting aging‐related mechanisms is a potential therapeutic strategy against MS progression.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neuroinflammation and Functional Connectivity in Alzheimer's Disease: Interactive Influences on Cognitive Performance</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/36/7218?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuroinflammation is a key part of the etio-pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We tested the relationship between neuroinflammation and the disruption of functional connectivity in large-scale networks, and their joint influence on cognitive impairment. We combined [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PK11195 positron emission tomography (PET) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) in 28 patients (12 females/16 males) with clinical diagnosis of probable AD or mild cognitive impairment with positive PET biomarker for amyloid, and 14 age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy controls (8 females/6 males). Source-based &quot;inflammetry&quot; was used to extract principal components of [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PK11195 PET signal variance across all participants. rs-fMRI data were preprocessed via independent component analyses to classify neuronal and non-neuronal signals. Multiple linear regression models identified sources of signal covariance between neuroinflammation and brain connectivity profiles, in relation to the diagnostic group (patients, controls) and cognitive status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients showed significantly higher [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PK11195 binding relative to controls, in a distributed spatial pattern including the hippocampus, frontal, and inferior temporal cortex. Patients with enhanced loading on this [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PK11195 binding distribution displayed diffuse abnormal functional connectivity. The expression of a stronger association between such abnormal connectivity and higher levels of neuroinflammation correlated with worse cognitive deficits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study suggests that neuroinflammation relates to the pathophysiological changes in network function that underlie cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease. Neuroinflammation, and its association with functionally-relevant reorganization of brain networks, is proposed as a target for emerging immunotherapeutic strategies aimed at preventing or slowing the emergence of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neuroinflammation is an important aspect of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but it was not known whether the influence of neuroinflammation on brain network function in humans was important for cognitive deficit. Our study provides clear evidence that &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; neuroinflammation in AD impairs large-scale network connectivity; and that the link between neuro inflammation and functional network connectivity is relevant to cognitive impairment. We suggest that future studies should address how neuroinflammation relates to network function as AD progresses, and whether the neuroinflammation in AD is reversible, as the basis of immunotherapeutic strategies to slow the progression of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Indirect Medium Spiny Neurons in the Dorsomedial Striatum Regulate Ethanol-Containing Conditioned Reward Seeking</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/36/7206?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Adenosine 2A receptor (A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R)-containing indirect medium spiny neurons (iMSNs) in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) contribute to reward-seeking behaviors. However, those roles for ethanol-seeking behaviors remain unknown. To investigate ethanol-seeking behaviors, we used an ethanol-containing reward (10% ethanol and 10% sucrose solution; 10E10S). Upon conditioning with 10E10S, mice that initially only preferred 10% sucrose, not 10E10S, showed a stronger preference for 10E10S. Then, we investigated whether the manipulation of the DMS–external globus pallidus (GPe) iMSNs circuit alters the ethanol-containing reward (10E10S) seeking behaviors using the combination of pharmacologic and optogenetic approaches. DMS A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R activation dampened operant conditioning-induced ethanol-containing reward, whereas A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R antagonist abolished the effects of the A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R agonist and restored ethanol-containing reward-seeking. Moreover, pre-ethanol exposure potentiated the A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R-dependent reward-seeking. Interestingly, mice exhibiting ethanol-containing reward-seeking showed the reduction of the DMS iMSNs activity, suggesting that disinhibiting iMSNs decreases reward-seeking behaviors. In addition, we found that A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R activation reversed iMSNs neural activity in the DMS. Similarly, optogenetic stimulation of the DMS-GPe iMSNs reduced ethanol-containing reward-seeking, whereas optogenetic inhibition of the DMS-GPe iMSNs reversed this change. Together, our study demonstrates that DMS A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R and iMSNs regulate ethanol-containing reward-seeking behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Our findings highlight the mechanisms of how operant conditioning develops the preference of ethanol-containing conditioned reward. Mice exhibiting ethanol-containing reward-seeking showed a reduction of the indirect medium spiny neuronal activity in the dorsomedial striatum. Pharmacological activation of adenosine A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor (A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R) or optogenetic activation of indirect medium spiny neurons dampened operant conditioned ethanol-containing reward-seeking, whereas inhibiting this neuronal activity restored ethanol-containing reward-seeking. Furthermore, repeated intermittent ethanol exposure potentiated A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R-dependent reward-seeking. Therefore, our finding suggests that A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R-containing indirect medium spiny neuronal activation reduces ethanol-containing reward-seeking, which may provide a potential therapeutic target for alcohol use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Diverse Mechanisms Lead to Common Dysfunction of Striatal Cholinergic Interneurons in Distinct Genetic Mouse Models of Dystonia</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/36/7195?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Clinical and experimental data indicate striatal cholinergic dysfunction in dystonia, a movement disorder typically resulting in twisted postures via abnormal muscle contraction. Three forms of isolated human dystonia result from mutations in the &lt;i&gt;TOR1A&lt;/i&gt; (DYT1), &lt;i&gt;THAP1&lt;/i&gt; (DYT6), and &lt;i&gt;GNAL&lt;/i&gt; (DYT25) genes. Experimental models carrying these mutations facilitate identification of possible shared cellular mechanisms. Recently, we reported elevated extracellular striatal acetylcholine by &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; microdialysis and paradoxical excitation of cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) by dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) agonism using &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; slice electrophysiology in &lt;i&gt;Dyt1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;GAG/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice. The paradoxical excitation was caused by overactive muscarinic receptors (mAChRs), leading to a switch in D2R coupling from canonical G&lt;sub&gt;i/o&lt;/sub&gt; to noncanonical β-arrestin signaling. We sought to determine whether these mechanisms in &lt;i&gt;Dyt1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;GAG/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice are shared with &lt;i&gt;Thap1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;C54Y/+&lt;/sup&gt; knock-in and &lt;i&gt;Gnal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt; knock-out dystonia models and to determine the impact of sex. We found &lt;i&gt;Thap1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;C54Y/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice of both sexes have elevated extracellular striatal acetylcholine and D2R-induced paradoxical ChI excitation, which was reversed by mAChR inhibition. Elevated extracellular acetylcholine was absent in male and female &lt;i&gt;Gnal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice, but the paradoxical D2R-mediated ChI excitation was retained and only reversed by inhibition of adenosine A2ARs. The G&lt;sub&gt;i/o&lt;/sub&gt;-preferring D2R agonist failed to increase ChI excitability, suggesting a possible switch in coupling of D2Rs to β-arrestin, as seen previously in a DYT1 model. These data show that, whereas elevated extracellular acetylcholine levels are not always detected across these genetic models of human dystonia, the D2R-mediated paradoxical excitation of ChIs is shared and is caused by altered function of distinct G-protein-coupled receptors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Dystonia is a common and often disabling movement disorder. The usual medical treatment of dystonia is pharmacotherapy with nonselective antagonists of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, which have many undesirable side effects. Development of new therapeutics is a top priority for dystonia research. The current findings, considered in context with our previous investigations, establish a role for cholinergic dysfunction across three mouse models of human genetic dystonia: DYT1, DYT6, and DYT25. The commonality of cholinergic dysfunction in these models arising from diverse molecular etiologies points the way to new approaches for cholinergic modulation that may be broadly applicable in dystonia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Gerstmann–Sträussler–Scheinker syndrome (GSS) with the P102L mutation is a rare genetic prion disease caused by a pathogenic mutation at codon 102 in the prion protein gene.

In making a clinical diagnosis or progression estimates of GSS, magnetic resonance imaging and real‐time quaking‐induced conversion may be helpful, but the results should be evaluated with respect to the overall clinical context.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Neuronal Avalanches in Input and Associative Layers of Auditory Cortex</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00045</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The primary auditory cortex processes acoustic sequences for the perception of behaviorally meaningful sounds such as speech. Sound information arrives at its input layer four from where activity propagates to associative layer 2/3. It is currently not known whether there is a characteristic organization of neuronal population activity across layers and sound levels during sound processing. Here, we identify neuronal avalanches, which in theory and experiments have been shown to maximize dynamic range and optimize information transfer within and across networks, in primary auditory cortex. We used in vivo 2-photon imaging of pyramidal neurons in cortical layers L4 and L2/3 of mouse A1 to characterize the populations of neurons that were active spontaneously, i.e., in the absence of a sound stimulus, and those recruited by single-frequency tonal stimuli at different sound levels. Single-frequency sounds recruited neurons of widely ranging frequency selectivity in both layers. We defined neuronal ensembles as neurons being active within or during successive temporal windows at the temporal resolution of our imaging. For both layers, neuronal ensembles were highly variable in size during spontaneous activity as well as during sound presentation. Ensemble sizes distributed according to power laws, the hallmark of neuronal avalanches, and were similar across sound levels. Avalanches activated by sound were composed of neurons with diverse tuning preference, yet with selectivity independent of avalanche size. Our results suggest that optimization principles identified for avalanches guide population activity in L4 and L2/3 of auditory cortex during and in-between stimulus processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Genome-Wide Alteration of 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine in Hypoxic-Ischemic Neonatal Rat Model of Cerebral Palsy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00214</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cerebral palsy (CP) is a neurodevelopmental disorder usually occurring early in life and persisting through the whole life. Several risk factors, including perinatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI), may contribute to occurrence of CP in preterm infants. DNA hydroxymethylation has been shown to play an important role in neurodevelopment and neurodegenerative disorders. However, the effect of DNA hydroxymethylation in CP remains unknown. The aim of this study is to explore whether and how DNA hydroxymethylation is involved in CP pathogenesis. We observed that overall 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) abundance in the cortex of the temporal lobe of rat pups was decreased significantly after hypoxic-ischemic injury, and the reduced expression of Tet1 and Tet2 enzymes might be responsible for this change. Identified differential hydroxymethylation regions (DhMRs) were richly involved in multiple signaling pathways related to neuronal development and function. Furthermore, we found that reduced 5hmC modification on the DhMRs-related genes were accompanied by decrease of their mRNA expression levels. These results suggest that 5hmC modifications are involved in the CP pathogenesis and may potentially serve as a new therapeutic target.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Dynamic Orchestration of Brains and Instruments During Free Guitar Improvisation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00050</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Playing music in ensemble requires enhanced sensorimotor coordination and the non-verbal communication of musicians that need to coordinate their actions precisely with those of others. As shown in our previous studies on guitar duets, and also on a guitar quartet, intra- and inter-brain synchronization plays an essential role during such interaction. At the same time, sensorimotor coordination as an essential part of this interaction requires being in sync with the auditory signals coming from the played instruments. In this study, using acoustic recordings of guitar playing and electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings of brain activity from guitarists playing in duet, we aimed to explore whether the musicians' brain activity synchronized with instrument sounds produced during guitar playing. To do so, we established an analytical method based on phase synchronization between time-frequency transformed guitar signals and raw EEG signals. Given phase synchronization, or coupling between guitar and brain signals, we constructed so-called extended hyper-brain networks comprising all possible interactions between two guitars and two brains. Applying a graph-theoretical approach to these networks assessed across time, we present dynamic changes of coupling strengths or dynamic orchestration of brains and instruments during free guitar improvisation for the first time. We also show that these dynamic network topology changes are oscillatory in nature and are characterized by specific spectral peaks, indicating the temporal structure in the synchronization patterns between guitars and brains. Moreover, extended hyper-brain networks exhibit specific modular organization varying in time, and binding each time, different parts of the network into the modules, which were mostly heterogeneous (i.e., comprising signals from different instruments and brains or parts of them). This suggests that the method capturing synchronization between instruments and brains when playing music provides crucial information about the underlying mechanisms. We conclude that this method may be an indispensable tool in the investigation of social interaction, music therapy, and rehabilitation dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00940</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Film based round the ear electrodes (cEEGrids) provide both, the accessibility of unobtrusive mobile EEG as well as a rapid EEG application in stationary settings when extended measurements are not possible. In a large-scale evaluation of driving abilities of older adults (N &amp;gt; 350) in a realistic driving simulation, we evaluated to what extent mental demands can be measured using cEEGrids in a completely unrestricted environment. For a first frequency-based analysis, the driving scenario was subdivided into different street segments with respect to their task loads (low, medium, high) that was a priori rated by an expert. Theta activity increased with task load but no change in Alpha power was found. Effects gained clarity after removing pink noise effects, that were potentially high in this data set due to motion artifacts. Theta fraction increased with task load and Alpha fraction decreased. We mapped this effect to specific street segments by applying a track-frequency analysis. Whilst participants drove with constant speed and without high steering wheel activity, Alpha was high and theta low. The reverse was the case in sections that required either high activity or increased attentional allocation to the driving context. When calculating mental demands for different street segments based on EEG, this measure is highly significant correlated with the experts’ rating of task load. Deviances can be explained by specific features within the segments. Thus, modulations in spectral power of the EEG were validly reflected in the cEEGrids data. All findings were in line with the prominent literature in the field. The results clearly demonstrate the usability of this low-density EEG method for application in real-world settings where an increase in ecological validity might outweigh the loss of certain aspects of internal validity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Impairment of Mitochondrial Redox Status in Peripheral Lymphocytes of Multiple Sclerosis Patients</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00938</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Literature suggests that oxidative stress (OS) may be involved in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS), in which the immune system is known to play a key role. However, to date, the OS in peripheral lymphocytes and its contribution to the disease remain unknown. The aim of the present study was to explore the influence of OS in peripheral lymphocytes of MS patients. To that end, a cross-sectional, observational pilot study was conducted [n = 58: 34 MS and 24 healthy subjects (control group)]. We have measured superoxide production and protein mitochondrial complex levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from MS patients and control. Lactate levels and the antioxidant capacity were determined in plasma. We adjusted the comparisons between study groups by age, sex and cell count according to case. Results demonstrated that PBMCs, specifically T cells, from MS patients exhibited significantly increased superoxide anion production compared to control group (p = 0.027 and p = 0.041, respectively). Increased superoxide production in PBMCs was maintained after the adjustment (p = 0.044). Regarding mitochondrial proteins, we observe a significant decrease in the representative protein content of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I-V in PBMCs of MS patients (p = 0.002, p = 0.037, p = 0.03, p = 0.044, and p = 0.051, respectively), which was maintained for complexes I, III, and V after the adjustment (p = 0.026; p = 0.033; p = 0.033, respectively). In MS patients, a trend toward increased plasma lactate concentration was detected [8.04 mg lactate/dL (5.25, 9.49) in the control group, 11.36 mg lactate/dL (5.41, 14.81) in MS patients] that was statistically significant after the adjustment (p = 0.013). This might be indicative of compromised mitochondrial function. Finally, antioxidant capacity was also decreased in plasma from MS patients, both before (p = 0.027) and after adjusting for sex and age (p = 0.006). Our findings demonstrate that PBMCs of MS patients show impaired mitochondrial redox status and deficient antioxidant capacity. These results demonstrate for the first time the existence of mitochondrial alterations in the cells immune cells of MS patients already at the peripheral level.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;The abnormal alterations of proteins 14-3-3 and tau in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are widely used for the diagnosis of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD), while the situations of CSF biomarkers in genetic prion diseases (gPrDs), particularly in Chinese gPrDs patients, have not been well documented.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Here, with the help of commercial 14-3-3 and total tau ELISA kits, we evaluated the levels of proteins 14-3-3 and tau in the CSF samples of 140 Chinese patients of 14 different types of gPrDs.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;We found that CSF 14-3-3 ELISA values in the patients with P102L GSS and D178N FFI were remarkably low, while those in the patients with T188K, E196A, and E200K gCJD were relatively high. Linear correlation assays identified a positive correlation between positive rate in Western blot (WB) and ELISA values of CSF 14-3-3. ELISA assays for total tau in CSF samples identified relatively high levels in the cases of T188K, E196A, and E200K gCJD (median: 133840.81, 159992.80, and 153342.92 AU/ml), but relatively low levels in those of P102L GSS and D178N FFI (median: 64397.77 and 43856.79 AU/ml).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These data illustrate heterogeneous profiles of CSF 14-3-3 and tau in various types of gPrDs, depending on the differences in the mutations in PRNP.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) and cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF) promote the survival of midbrain dopamine neurons in animal models of Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, little is known about endogenous concentrations of MANF and CDNF in human PD patients, and their relation to PD pathogenesis. Our main objective was to study whether circulating concentrations of MANF and CDNF differ between PD patients and controls, and if they correlate with clinical parameters. Levels of circulating CDNF were studied for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;MANF and CDNF levels were measured from serum samples of 34 PD patients and 35 controls using validated in-lab-designed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISAs). MANF and CDNF mRNA levels in whole blood samples of 60 PD patients and 30 controls were measured by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). MANF concentrations in different blood cell types were measured by ELISA.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Circulating MANF concentrations were significantly higher in PD patients compared to controls (P &amp;lt; 0.001) and were positively correlated with Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) depression rating. MANF protein was present in blood cells, however, MANF mRNA levels in the blood did not differ between PD patients and controls (P = 0.44). The mean concentration of serum CDNF was 33 pg/ml in the controls. CDNF levels were not altered in PD patients (P = 0.25).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;MANF but not CDNF level was increased in the blood of PD patients. It would be interesting to examine the blood level of MANF from early stage PD patients in future studies to test whether MANF can be used as a clinical marker of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00911</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Over the last several decades, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has evolved from a treatment for select neuropsychiatric disorders to one that holds promise in treating numerous inflammatory conditions. Growing interest has focused on the use of VNS for other indications, such as heart failure, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, ischemic stroke, and traumatic brain injury. As pre-clinical research often guides expansion into new clinical avenues, animal models of VNS have also increased in recent years. To advance this promising treatment, however, there are a number of experimental parameters that must be considered when planning a study, such as physiology of the vagus nerve, electrical stimulation parameters, electrode design, stimulation equipment, and microsurgical technique. In this review, we discuss these important considerations and how a combination of clinically relevant stimulation parameters can be used to achieve beneficial therapeutic results in pre-clinical studies of sub-acute to chronic VNS, and provide a practical guide for performing this work in rodent models. Finally, by integrating clinical and pre-clinical research, we present indeterminate issues as opportunities for future research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Intrinsic Frequencies of the Resting-State fMRI Signal: The Frequency Dependence of Functional Connectivity and the Effect of Mode Mixing</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00900</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The frequency characteristics of the resting-state BOLD fMRI (rs-fMRI) signal are of increasing scientific interest, as we discover more frequency-specific biological interpretations. In this work, we use variational mode decomposition (VMD) to precisely decompose the rs-fMRI time series into its intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) in a data-driven manner. The accuracy of the VMD decomposition of constituent IMFs is verified through simulations, with higher reconstruction accuracy and much-reduced mode mixing relative to previous methods. Furthermore, we examine the relative contribution of the VMD-derived modes (frequencies) to the rs-fMRI signal as well as functional connectivity measurements. Our primary findings are: (1) The rs-fMRI signal within the 0.01–0.25 Hz range can be consistently characterized by four intrinsic frequency clusters, centered at 0.028 Hz (IMF4), 0.080 Hz (IMF3), 0.15 Hz (IMF2) and 0.22 Hz (IMF1); (2) these frequency clusters were highly reproducible, and independent of rs-fMRI data sampling rate; (3) not all frequencies were associated with equivalent network topology, in contrast to previous findings. In fact, while IMF4 is most likely associated with physiological fluctuations due to respiration and pulse, IMF3 is most likely associated with metabolic processes, and IMF2 with vasomotor activity. Both IMF3 and IMF4 could produce the brain-network topology typically observed in fMRI, whereas IMF1 and IMF2 could not. These findings provide initial evidence of feasibility in decomposing the rs-fMRI signal into its intrinsic oscillatory frequencies in a reproducible manner.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00867</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Inducing somatic cells into neural stem cells (iNSCs) in specific ways provides a new cell therapy in a variety of neurological diseases. In the past, iNSCs were generated by transcription factors which increased the risk of mutagenesis, tumor formations, and immune reactions by viral transduction vectors. Therefore, in this study, different small molecules were used to induce mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) into iNSCs in different reprogramming stages, which showed high reprogramming efficiency without altering the genome. We demonstrated that the small molecules staged-induction neural stem cells (SMSINS) have the characteristics of neural stem cells (NSCs) in morphology, gene expression, self-renewal and differentiation potential. Furthermore, valproic acid (VPA), one of small molecules, was showed to enhance neural induction with highest efficiency compared with six other small molecules, which were also investigated in the present study. Moreover, our results suggested that activating the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling enhanced the induction efficiency and neuronal differentiation. Collectively, our findings indicated that using this induction program allowed us to obtain safe and efficient iNSCs which were free of genetic manipulation. The VPA-mediated mTOR signaling pathway may enhance reprogramming efficiency and neuronal differentiation. So we suggested that this program could be a new method of obtaining iNSCs for the treatment of neurological diseases by cell replacement therapy in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Clinical imaging, however, relies heavily on X-ray computed tomography (CT) scans for diagnosis and prognosis. Currently, there is only one image processing pipeline for head CT, which focuses mainly on head CT data with lesions. We present tools and a complete pipeline for processing CT data, focusing on open-source solutions, that focus on head CT but are applicable to most CT analyses. We describe going from raw DICOM data to a spatially normalized brain within CT presenting a full example with code. Overall, we recommend anonymizing data with Clinical Trials Processor, converting DICOM data to NIfTI using dcm2niix, using BET for brain extraction, and registration using a publicly-available CT template for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness meditation has been shown to improve episodic memory and increase theta oscillations which are known to play a role in episodic memory retrieval. The present study examined the effect of mindfulness meditation on episodic memory retrieval and theta oscillations. Using a longitudinal design, subjects in the mindfulness meditation experimental group who underwent 4 weeks of mindfulness meditation training and practice were compared to a waitlist control group. During the pre-training and post-training experimental sessions, subjects completed the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) and studied adjectives and either imagined a scene (Place Task) or judged its pleasantness (Pleasant Task). During the recognition test, subjects decided which task was performed with each word (“Old Place Task” or “Old Pleasant Task”) or “New.” FFMQ scores and source discrimination were greater post-training than pre-training in the mindfulness meditation experimental group. Electroencephalography (EEG) results revealed that for the mindfulness meditation experimental group theta power was greater post-training than pre-training in right frontal and left parietal channels and changes in FFMQ scores correlated with changes in theta oscillations in right frontal channels (n = 20). The present results suggest that mindfulness meditation increases source memory retrieval and theta oscillations in a fronto-parietal network.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00310</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Relatively little attention has been paid to the neural basis of superior memory despite its potential in providing important insight into efforts to improve memory in the general population or to offset age-related cognitive decline. The current study reports a rare opportunity to reproduce and isolate specific neural activities directly associated with exceptional memory. To capture the brain processes responsible for superior memory, we returned to a laboratory task and analytic approach used to explore the nature of exceptional memory, namely, digit-span task combined with verbal protocol analysis. One participant with average memory received approximately 50 h of digit-span training and the participant’s digit-span increased from normative (8 digits) to exceptional (30 digits). Event-related potentials were recorded while the participant’s digit span increased from 19 to 30 digits. Protocol analysis allowed us to identify direct behavioral indices of idiosyncratic encoding processes underlying the superior memory performance. EEG indices directly corresponding to the behavioral indices of encoding processes were identified. The results suggest that the early attention-related encoding processes were reflected in theta and delta whereas the later attention-independent encoding processes were reflected in time-domain slow-wave. This fine-grained approach offers new insights into studying neural mechanism mediating superior memory and the cognitive effort necessary to develop it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and has plagued humans for more than 200 years. The etiology and detailed pathogenesis of PD is unclear, but is currently believed to be the result of the interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Studies have found that PD patients with the LRRK2:G2019S variation have the typical clinical manifestations of PD, which may be familial or sporadic, and have age-dependent pathogenic characteristics. Therefore, the LRRK2:G2019S variation may be an ideal model to study the interaction of multiple factors such as genetic, environmental and natural aging factors in PD in the future. This article reviewed the progress of LRRK2:G2019S studies in PD research in order to provide new research ideas and directions for the pathogenesis and treatment of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Disrupting the pathological synchronous firing patterns of neurons with high frequency stimulation is a common treatment for Parkinsonian symptoms and epileptic seizures when pharmaceutical drugs fail. In this paper, our goal is to design a desynchronization strategy for large networks of spiking neurons such that the neuronal activity of the network remains in the desynchronized regime for a long period of time after the removal of the stimulation. We develop a novel “Forced Temporal-Spike Time Stimulation (FTSTS)” strategy that harnesses the spike-timing dependent plasticity to control the synchronization of neural activity in the network by forcing the neurons in the network to artificially fire in a specific temporal pattern. Our strategy modulates the synaptic strengths of selective synapses to achieve a desired synchrony of neural activity in the network. Our simulation results show that the FTSTS strategy can effectively synchronize or desynchronize neural activity in large spiking neuron networks and keep them in the desired state for a long period of time after the removal of the external stimulation. Using simulations, we demonstrate the robustness of our strategy in desynchronizing neural activity of networks against uncertainties in the designed stimulation pulses and network parameters. Additionally, we show in simulation, how our strategy could be incorporated within the existing desynchronization strategies to improve their overall efficacy in desynchronizing large networks. Our proposed strategy provides complete control over the synchronization of neurons in large networks and can be used to either synchronize or desynchronize neural activity based on specific applications. Moreover, it can be incorporated within other desynchronization strategies to improve the efficacy of existing therapies for numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders associated with pathological synchronization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Normal and Pathological Tau Uptake Mediated by M1/M3 Muscarinic Receptors Promotes Opposite Neuronal Changes</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00403</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The microtubule associated protein tau is mainly found in the cell’s cytosol but recently it was also shown in the extracellular space. In neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer’s disease (AD), pathological tau spreads from neuron to neuron enhancing neurodegeneration. Here, we show that HEK293 cells and neurons in culture uptake extracellular normal and pathological Tau. Muscarinic receptor antagonists atropine and pirenzepine block 80% this uptake. CHO cells do not express these receptors therefore cannot uptake tau, unless transfected with M1 and/or M3 receptor. These results strongly suggest that muscarinic receptors mediate this process. Uptake of normal tau in neurons enhances neuronal process formation but a pseudophosphorylated form of tau (pathological human tau, PH-Tau) disrupts them and accumulates in the somatodendritic compartment. AD hyperphosphorylated tau (AD P-Tau) has similar effects as PH-Tau on cultured neurons. Addition of either PH-Tau or AD P-tau to neuronal cultures induced microglial activation. In conclusion, uptake of extracellular tau is mediated by muscarinic receptors with opposite effects: normal tau stabilizes neurites; whereas pathological tau disrupts this process leading to neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00401</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The purinergic receptor P2X7 is expressed in neural and immune cells known to be involved in neurological diseases. Its ligand, ATP, is a signaling molecule that can act as a neurotransmitter in physiological conditions or as a danger signal when released in high amount by damaged/dying cells or activated glial cells. Thus, ATP is a danger-associated molecular pattern. Binding of ATP by P2X7 leads to the activation of different biochemical pathways, depending on the physiological or pathological environment. The aim of this review is to discuss various functions of P2X7 in the immune and central nervous systems. We present evidence that P2X7 may have a detrimental or beneficial role in the nervous system, in the context of neurological pathologies: epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, age-related macular degeneration and cerebral artery occlusion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Memory Decline and Behavioral Inflexibility in Aged Mice Are Correlated With Dysregulation of Protein Synthesis Capacity</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00246</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying age-associated cognitive impairments will not only contribute to our general knowledge about “aging” biology, but also provide insights for more effective strategies to prevent and improve the quality of life for both normal aging and pathological aging such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Here we first assessed and compared the performance of cognition and synaptic plasticity in young (3–5-month old) and aged c57BL/6J mice (19–21 months old). Findings from behavioral tests demonstrated that old mice, compared to young mice, displayed impairments in spatial learning/memory, working memory, and behavioral flexibility. Further, synaptic electrophysiology experiments on hippocampal slices revealed that the early form of long-term potentiation (LTP, a synaptic model for memory formation) was inhibited in old mice. At the molecular level, biochemical assays on the hippocampus showed dysregulation of signaling pathways controlling protein synthesis capacity including: up-regulation of AKT-mTORC1-p70S6K signaling, which is associated with translation of terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) class of mRNAs that encode translational machinery; hyper-phosphorylation of mRNA translational elongation factor 2 (eEF2) and its upstream regulator AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), indicating repression of general protein synthesis. Moreover, young and old mice exhibited similar brain levels of translational initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) phosphorylation, which is known to be increased in AD and linked to the disease pathophysiology. Thus, our data provide evidence at the molecular level to highlight the similarity and difference between normal and pathological aging, which may contribute to future studies on diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers for aging-related dementia syndromes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Early and late mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients have been reported to have a distinctive prognosis of converting to Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;To evaluate the difference in gray matter volume and assess the association between cognitive function evaluated by comprehensive cognitive function test, and cortical thickness across healthy controls (HCs) (n = 37), early (n = 30), and late MCI patients (n = 35).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Differences in gray matter volume were evaluated by whole brain voxel-based morphometry across the groups. Multiple regression analysis was used to analyze group by memory performance interactions for the normalized gray matter volume.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The early MCI group showed reduced gray matter volume in the right middle temporal gyrus in comparison to the HC group. The late MCI group displayed atrophy in the left parahippocampal gyrus in comparison to the HC group. Late MCI patients exhibited a decreased gray matter volume in the left fusiform gyrus in comparison to patients in the early MCI group (Monte Carlo simulation corrected p &amp;lt; 0.01, Tukey post hoc tests). Furthermore, there was a significant group (HC vs. early MCI) by memory performance interaction for the normalized cortical volume of the right middle temporal gyrus. Additionally, a significant group (early MCI vs. late MCI) by memory performance interaction was found for the normalized gray matter volume of the left fusiform gyrus (p &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Early and late MCI patients showed distinctive associations of gray matter volumes in compensatory brain regions with memory performances. The findings can contribute to a better understanding of the structural changes in compensatory brain regions to elucidate memory decline in the trajectory of the subdivided prodromal stages of the Alzheimer’s disease (AD).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Appoptosin Mediates Lesions Induced by Oxidative Stress Through the JNK-FoxO1 Pathway</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00243</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Oxidative stress is a common feature of neurodegenerative diseases and plays an important role in disease progression. Appoptosin is a pro-apoptotic protein that contributes to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy. However, whether appoptosin mediates oxidative stress-induced neurotoxicity has yet to be determined. Here, we observe that appoptosin protein levels are induced by hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) exposure through the inhibition of proteasomal appoptosin degradation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that overexpression of appoptosin induces apoptosis through the JNK-FoxO1 pathway. Importantly, knockdown of appoptosin can ameliorate H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced JNK activation and apoptosis in primary neurons. Thus, we propose that appoptosin functions as an upstream regulator of the JNK-FoxO1 pathway, contributing to cell death in response to oxidative stress during neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Effect of Aging on Resting State Connectivity of Predefined Networks in the Brain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00234</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent studies have found a deleterious effect of age on a wide variety of measures of functional connectivity, and some hints at a relationship between connectivity at rest and cognitive functioning. However, few studies have combined multiple functional connectivity methods, or examined them over a wide range of adult ages, to try to uncover which metrics and networks seem to be particularly sensitive to age-related decline across the adult lifespan. The present study utilized multiple resting state functional connectivity methods in a sample of adults from 20–80 years old to gain a more complete understanding of the effect of aging on network function and integrity. Whole-brain results showed that aging results in weakening average within-network connectivity, lower system segregation and local efficiency, and higher participation coefficient. Network-level results suggested that nearly every primary sensory and cognitive network faces some degree of age-related decline, including reduced within-network connectivity, higher network-based participation coefficient, and reduced network-level local efficiency. Further, some of these connectivity metrics showed relationships with cognitive performance. Thus, these results suggest that a multi-method analysis of functional connectivity data may be critical to capture the full effect of aging on the health of brain networks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Effects of Exercise Modes on Neural Processing of Working Memory in Late Middle-Aged Adults: An fMRI Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00224</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent studies have highlighted the importance of regular exercise on cognitive function in aging populations, with aerobic exercise and cardiovascular fitness having received the largest amount of research attention. However, the relationship between exercise mode and cognitive function underlying behavioral modification and neural activation remains unknown. The present study, therefore, sought to examine the associations between different exercise modes and the working memory (WM) aspect of executive function as well as its task-evoked brain activation in the late middle-aged population. Seventy late middle-aged adults were classified into open-skill, closed-skill, or irregular exercise groups based on their participation in exercise activities prior to the study and then performed a spatial working memory (SWM) task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning. The results revealed that exercise groups, regardless of exercise modes, showed better SWM and physical fitness performance. Additionally, the open-skill group exhibited greater brain activation in the prefrontal lobe, anterior cingulate cortex/supplementary motor area (ACC/SMA), and hippocampus than those in the closed-skill group, suggesting a mode-sensitive compensatory mechanism in late middle-aged adults. These findings indicate that exercise promotes cognitive health, improves WM, and enhances neurocognitive scaffolding in late middle-aged adults and further suggest that various exercise modes can effectively modulate frontal and hippocampal function in the face of age-related neurocognitive declines, implications that may inform the development of exercise programs for the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Prediction of antibiotic resistance phenotypes from whole genome sequencing data by machine learning methods has been proposed as a promising platform for the development of sequence-based diagnostics. However, there has been no systematic evaluation of factors that may influence performance of such models, how they might apply to and vary across clinical populations, and what the implications might be in the clinical setting. Here, we performed a meta-analysis of seven large &lt;i&gt;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&lt;/i&gt; datasets, as well as &lt;i&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/i&gt; datasets, with whole genome sequence data and antibiotic susceptibility phenotypes using set covering machine classification, random forest classification, and random forest regression models to predict resistance phenotypes from genotype. We demonstrate how model performance varies by drug, dataset, resistance metric, and species, reflecting the complexities of generating clinically relevant conclusions from machine learning-derived models. Our findings underscore the importance of incorporating relevant biological and epidemiological knowledge into model design and assessment and suggest that doing so can inform tailored modeling for individual drugs, pathogens, and clinical populations. We further suggest that continued comprehensive sampling and incorporation of up-to-date whole genome sequence data, resistance phenotypes, and treatment outcome data into model training will be crucial to the clinical utility and sustainability of machine learning-based molecular diagnostics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SZpLL4wo8Y0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Cellular microscopy images contain rich insights about biology. To extract this information, researchers use features, or measurements of the patterns of interest in the images. Here, we introduce a convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically design features for fluorescence microscopy. We use a self-supervised method to learn feature representations of single cells in microscopy images without labelled training data. We train CNNs on a simple task that leverages the inherent structure of microscopy images and controls for variation in cell morphology and imaging: given one cell from an image, the CNN is asked to predict the fluorescence pattern in a second different cell from the same image. We show that our method learns high-quality features that describe protein expression patterns in single cells both yeast and human microscopy datasets. Moreover, we demonstrate that our features are useful for exploratory biological analysis, by capturing high-resolution cellular components in a proteome-wide cluster analysis of human proteins, and by quantifying multi-localized proteins and single-cell variability. We believe paired cell inpainting is a generalizable method to obtain feature representations of single cells in multichannel microscopy images.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/K4OPTPuJ_EY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

We present a new computational model of speech motor control: the Feedback-Aware Control of Tasks in Speech or &lt;i&gt;FACTS&lt;/i&gt; model. FACTS employs a hierarchical state feedback control architecture to control simulated vocal tract and produce intelligible speech. The model includes higher-level control of speech tasks and lower-level control of speech articulators. The task controller is modeled as a dynamical system governing the creation of desired constrictions in the vocal tract, after Task Dynamics. Both the task and articulatory controllers rely on an internal estimate of the current state of the vocal tract to generate motor commands. This estimate is derived, based on efference copy of applied controls, from a forward model that predicts both the next vocal tract state as well as expected auditory and somatosensory feedback. A comparison between predicted feedback and actual feedback is then used to update the internal state prediction. FACTS is able to qualitatively replicate many characteristics of the human speech system: the model is robust to noise in both the sensory and motor pathways, is relatively unaffected by a loss of auditory feedback but is more significantly impacted by the loss of somatosensory feedback, and responds appropriately to externally-imposed alterations of auditory and somatosensory feedback. The model also replicates previously hypothesized trade-offs between reliance on auditory and somatosensory feedback and shows for the first time how this relationship may be mediated by acuity in each sensory domain. These results have important implications for our understanding of the speech motor control system in humans.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7tNJKTuTtS8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Pathway analysis is widely used to gain mechanistic insights from high-throughput omics data. However, most existing methods do not consider signal integration represented by pathway topology, resulting in enrichment of convergent pathways when downstream genes are modulated. Incorporation of signal flow and integration in pathway analysis could rank the pathways based on modulation in key regulatory genes. This implementation can be facilitated for large-scale data by discrete state network modeling due to simplicity in parameterization. Here, we model cellular heterogeneity using discrete state dynamics and measure pathway activities in cross-sectional data. We introduce a new algorithm, Boolean Omics Network Invariant-Time Analysis (BONITA), for signal propagation, signal integration, and pathway analysis. Our signal propagation approach models heterogeneity in transcriptomic data as arising from intercellular heterogeneity rather than intracellular stochasticity, and propagates binary signals repeatedly across networks. Logic rules defining signal integration are inferred by genetic algorithm and are refined by local search. The rules determine the impact of each node in a pathway, which is used to score the probability of the pathway’s modulation by chance. We have comprehensively tested BONITA for application to transcriptomics data from translational studies. Comparison with state-of-the-art pathway analysis methods shows that BONITA has higher sensitivity at lower levels source node modulation and similar sensitivity at higher levels of source node modulation. Application of BONITA pathway analysis to previously validated RNA-sequencing studies identifies additional relevant pathways in &lt;i&gt;in-vitro&lt;/i&gt; human cell line experiments and &lt;i&gt;in-vivo&lt;/i&gt; infant studies. Additionally, BONITA successfully detected modulation of disease specific pathways when comparing relevant RNA-sequencing data with healthy controls. Most interestingly, the two highest impact score nodes identified by BONITA included known drug targets. Thus, BONITA is a powerful approach to prioritize not only pathways but also specific mechanistic role of genes compared to existing methods.

Across diverse biological systems—ranging from neural networks to intracellular signaling and genetic regulatory networks—the information about changes in the environment is frequently encoded in the full temporal dynamics of the network nodes. A pressing data-analysis challenge has thus been to efficiently estimate the amount of information that these dynamics convey from experimental data. Here we develop and evaluate decoding-based estimation methods to lower bound the mutual information about a finite set of inputs, encoded in single-cell high-dimensional time series data. For biological reaction networks governed by the chemical Master equation, we derive model-based information approximations and analytical upper bounds, against which we benchmark our proposed model-free decoding estimators. In contrast to the frequently-used k-nearest-neighbor estimator, decoding-based estimators robustly extract a large fraction of the available information from high-dimensional trajectories with a realistic number of data samples. We apply these estimators to previously published data on Erk and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling in mammalian cells and to yeast stress-response, and find that substantial amount of information about environmental state can be encoded by non-trivial response statistics even in stationary signals. We argue that these single-cell, decoding-based information estimates, rather than the commonly-used tests for significant differences between selected population response statistics, provide a proper and unbiased measure for the performance of biological signaling networks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uyRYVgsS0ao&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

In-silico identification of potential target genes for disease is an essential aspect of drug target discovery. Recent studies suggest that successful targets can be found through by leveraging genetic, genomic and protein interaction information. Here, we systematically tested the ability of 12 varied algorithms, based on network propagation, to identify genes that have been targeted by any drug, on gene-disease data from 22 common non-cancerous diseases in OpenTargets. We considered two biological networks, six performance metrics and compared two types of input gene-disease association scores. The impact of the design factors in performance was quantified through additive explanatory models. Standard cross-validation led to over-optimistic performance estimates due to the presence of protein complexes. In order to obtain realistic estimates, we introduced two novel protein complex-aware cross-validation schemes. When seeding biological networks with known drug targets, machine learning and diffusion-based methods found around 2-4 true targets within the top 20 suggestions. Seeding the networks with genes associated to disease by genetics decreased performance below 1 true hit on average. The use of a larger network, although noisier, improved overall performance. We conclude that diffusion-based prioritisers and machine learning applied to diffusion-based features are suited for drug discovery in practice and improve over simpler neighbour-voting methods. We also demonstrate the large impact of choosing an adequate validation strategy and the definition of seed disease genes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/p0ejWP31Cw8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Distinct mechanisms of imagery differentially influence speech perception</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0261-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Neural representation can be induced without external stimulation, such as in mental imagery. Our previous study found that imagined speaking and imagined hearing modulated perceptual neural responses in opposite directions, suggesting motor-to-sensory transformation and memory retrieval as two separate routes that induce auditory representation (Tian &amp;amp; Poeppel, J Cogn Neurosci. 2013 25:1020-36). We hypothesized that the precision of representation induced from different types of speech imagery led to different modulation effects. Specifically, we predicted that the one-to-one mapping between motor and sensory domains established during speech production would evoke a more precise auditory representation in imagined speaking than retrieving the same sounds from memory in imagined hearing. To test this hypothesis, we built the function of representational precision as the modulation of connection strength in a neural network model. The model fitted the MEG imagery repetition effects, and the best-fitting parameters showed sharper tuning after imagined speaking than imagined hearing, consistent with the representational precision hypothesis. Moreover, this model predicted that different types of speech imagery would affect perception differently. In an imagery-adaptation experiment, the categorization of/ba/-/da/continuum from male and female human participants showed more positive shifts towards the preceding imagined syllable after imagined speaking than imagined hearing. These consistent simulation and behavioral results support our hypothesis that distinct mechanisms of speech imagery construct auditory representation with varying degrees of precision and differentially influence auditory perception. This study provides a mechanistic connection between neural-level activity and psychophysics that reveals the neural computation of mental imagery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Our brain processes sensory information that we receive from the environment and mediates mental activity such as imagination. How do mental and perceptual processes interact to shape our cognition? We constructed a computational model that simulated how two types of imagery – imagined speaking and imagined hearing –differentially modulated perception via two distinct neural pathways. This model further predicted a choice shift in perceptual responses to ambiguous auditory stimuli, which was confirmed in a follow-up imagery-adaptation experiment. These results suggest that parallel neural pathways for mental imagery provide distinct functions to influence perception. These findings may implicate multiple strategies for constructing the brain-computer interface.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Transgenic mouse lines are instrumental in our attempt to understand brain function. Promoters driving transgenic expression of the gene encoding Cre recombinase are crucial to ensure selectivity in Cre-mediated targeting of floxed alleles using the Cre-Lox system. For the study of dopamine neurons, promoter sequences driving expression of the &lt;i&gt;Dopamine transporter&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Dat&lt;/i&gt;) gene are often implemented and several DAT-Cre transgenic mouse lines have been found to faithfully direct Cre activity to dopamine neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; DAT-Cre transgenic mouse lines have been particularly useful in resolving the diverse functions of the brain{acute}s dopamine systems. Here we report DAT-Cre-driven reporter gene expression in cell bodies of non-dopaminergic limbic brain areas, including the lateral septum, the amygdala and the lateral habenula. Co-labeling analysis identified that these DAT-Cre neurons were glutamatergic or GABAergic. Injection of viral-genetic constructs verified the activity of the DAT-Cre transgene in the adult brain, and also enabled identification of projection patterns. This study proposes a new angle by which available DAT-Cre transgenic mice can be implemented as tools for driving targeting to a restricted number of non-dopaminergic neurons of limbic neurocircuitry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Movement and VIP interneuron activation differentially modulate encoding in mouse auditory cortex</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0164-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Information processing in sensory cortex is highly sensitive to non-sensory variables such as anesthetic state, arousal, and task engagement. Recent work in mouse visual cortex (VCtx) suggests that evoked firing rates, stimulus-response mutual information, and encoding efficiency increase when animals are engaged in movement. A disinhibitory circuit appears central this change: inhibitory neurons expressing vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) are activated during movement, and disinhibit pyramidal cells by suppressing other inhibitory interneurons. Paradoxically, although movement activates a similar disinhibitory circuit in auditory cortex (ACtx), most ACtx studies report reduced spiking during movement. It is unclear whether the resulting changes in spike rates result in corresponding changes in stimulus-response mutual information. We examined ACtx responses evoked by tone cloud stimuli, in awake mice of both sexes, during spontaneous movement and still conditions. VIP+ cells were optogenetically activated on half of trials, permitting independent analysis of the consequences of movement and VIP activation, as well as their intersection. Movement decreased stimulus-related spike rates as well as mutual information and encoding efficiency. VIP interneuron activation tended to increase stimulus-evoked spike rates but not stimulus-response mutual information, thus reducing encoding efficiency. The intersection of movement and VIP activation was largely consistent with a linear combination of these main effects: VIP activation recovered movement-induced reduction in spike rates, but not information transfer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The ability of the brain to represent information about the sensory environment is heavily influenced by the behavioral state of the animal. In visual cortex, it is well known that locomotor activity enhances visual stimulus processing. By contrast, the present study found that sound processing in auditory cortex is degraded during locomotor activity. Whereas enhanced stimulus processing in visual cortex is thought to depend on VIP+ interneuron activation, optogenetic activation of VIP+ interneurons in auditory cortex failed to improve stimulus processing. These findings imply that circuitry activated during movement has opposite influences on stimulus processing in visual and auditory cortices. Such differences could reflect a resource allocation shift during movement favoring spatial perception in service of the animal’s navigational needs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Syntaphilin-mediated docking of mitochondria at the growth cone is dispensable for axon elongation in vivo</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0026-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria are abundantly detected at the growth cone, the dynamic distal tip of developing axons that directs growth and guidance. It is however poorly understood how mitochondrial dynamics relate to growth cone behavior &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, and which mechanisms are responsible for anchoring mitochondria at the growth cone during axon pathfinding. Here, we show that in retinal axons elongating along the optic tract in zebrafish, mitochondria accumulate in the central area of the growth cone and are occasionally observed in filopodia extending from the growth cone periphery. Mitochondrial behavior at the growth cone &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; is dynamic, with mitochondrial positioning and anterograde transport strongly correlating with growth cone behavior and axon outgrowth. Using novel zebrafish mutant lines that lack the mitochondrial anchoring proteins Syntaphilin a and b, we further show that Syntaphilins contribute to mitochondrial immobilization at the growth cone. Syntaphilins are however not required for proper growth cone morphology and axon growth &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, indicating that Syntaphilin-mediated anchoring of mitochondria at the growth cone only plays a minor role in elongating axons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Proper axon elongation and pathfinding are essential for nervous system wiring. The growth cone, a dynamic structure at the distal end of axons, mediates axonal growth and guidance. Here, we describe for the first time &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; the behavior of mitochondria at the growth cone of elongating axons. We show that mitochondria accumulate in the growth cone central area and are also present in its periphery. We further provide evidence that Syntaphilin, which immobilizes mitochondria along mature axons, also docks mitochondria at the growth cone. However, loss of Syntaphilin did not cause a complete depletion of mitochondria from the growth cone and did not affect axon elongation, indicating that other mitochondria-docking factors regulate axon growth during development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: LSO:Ce Inorganic Scintillators Are Biocompatible With Neuronal and Circuit Function</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2019.00024</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Optogenetics is widely used in neuroscience to control neural circuits. However, non-invasive methods for light delivery in brain are needed to avoid physical damage caused by current methods. One potential strategy could employ x-ray activation of radioluminescent particles (RPLs), enabling localized light generation within the brain. RPLs composed of inorganic scintillators can emit light at various wavelengths depending upon composition. Cerium doped lutetium oxyorthosilicate (LSO:Ce), an inorganic scintillator that emits blue light in response to x-ray or ultraviolet (UV) stimulation, could potentially be used to control neural circuits through activation of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), a light-gated cation channel. Whether inorganic scintillators themselves negatively impact neuronal processes and synaptic function is unknown, and was investigated here using cellular, molecular, and electrophysiological approaches. As proof of principle, we applied UV stimulation to 4 μm LSO:Ce particles during whole-cell recording of CA1 pyramidal cells in acute hippocampal slices from mice that expressed ChR2 in glutamatergic neurons. We observed an increase in frequency and amplitude of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs), indicating activation of ChR2 and excitation of neurons. Importantly, LSO:Ce particles did not affect survival of primary mouse cortical neurons, even after 24 h of exposure. In extracellular dendritic field potential recordings, no change in the strength of basal glutamatergic transmission was observed during exposure to LSO:Ce microparticles. However, the amplitude of the fiber volley was slightly reduced with high stimulation. Additionally, there was a slight decrease in the frequency of sEPSCs in whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from CA1 pyramidal cells, with no change in current amplitudes. The amplitude and frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents were unchanged. Finally, long term potentiation (LTP), a synaptic modification believed to underlie learning and memory and a robust measure of synaptic integrity, was successfully induced, although the magnitude was slightly reduced. Together, these results show LSO:Ce particles are biocompatible even though there are modest effects on baseline synaptic function and long-term synaptic plasticity. Importantly, we show that light emitted from LSO:Ce particles is able to activate ChR2 and modify synaptic function. Therefore, LSO:Ce inorganic scintillators are potentially viable for use as a new light delivery system for optogenetics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00049</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability and is associated with increased risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), anxiety, ADHD, and epilepsy. While our understanding of FXS pathophysiology has improved, a lack of validated blood-based biomarkers of disease continues to impede bench-to-bedside efforts. To meet this demand, there is a growing effort to discover a reliable biomarker to inform treatment discovery and evaluate treatment target engagement. Such a marker, amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP), has shown potential dysregulation in the absence of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and may therefore be associated with FXS pathophysiology. While APP is best understood in the context of Alzheimer disease, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting the molecule and its derivatives play a broader role in regulating neuronal hyperexcitability, a well-characterized phenotype in FXS. To evaluate the viability of APP as a peripheral biological marker in FXS, we conducted an exploratory ELISA-based evaluation of plasma APP-related species involving 27 persons with FXS (mean age: 22.0 ± 11.5) and 25 age- and sex-matched persons with neurotypical development (mean age: 21.1 ± 10.7). Peripheral levels of both Aβ(1–40) and Aβ(1–42) were increased, while sAPPα was significantly decreased in persons with FXS as compared to control participants. These results suggest that dysregulated APP processing, with potential preferential β-secretase processing, may be a readily accessible marker of FXS pathophysiology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00942</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Migraine is a common headache disorder characterized by unilateral, intense headaches. In migraine with aura, the painful headache is preceded by focal neurological symptoms that can be visual, sensory, or motor in nature. Spreading depression (the most likely cause of migraine with aura and perhaps related headache pain) results in increased neuronal excitability and related increases in inflammation and production of reactive oxygen species. This in turn can promote the transformation of low-frequency, episodic migraine into higher-frequency and eventually chronic migraine. Though migraine affects 11% of adults worldwide, with 3% experiencing chronic headache, existing therapies offer only modest benefits. Here, we focus on the mechanisms by which environmental enrichment (i.e., volitionally increased intellectual, social, and physical activity) mitigates spreading depression. In prior work, we have shown that exposure to environmental enrichment reduces susceptibility to spreading depression in rats. This protective effect is at least in part due to environmental enrichment-mediated changes in the character of serum exosomes produced by circulating immune cells. We went on to show that environmental enrichment-mimetic exosomes can be produced by stimulating dendritic cells with low levels of interferon gamma (a cytokine that is phasically increased during environmental enrichment). Interferon gamma-stimulated dendritic cell exosomes (IFNγ-DC-Exos) significantly improve myelination and reduce oxidative stress when applied to hippocampal slice cultures. Here, we propose that they may also be effective against spreading depression. We found that administration of IFNγ-DC-Exos reduced susceptibility to spreading depression in vivo and in vitro, suggesting that IFNγ-DC-Exos may be a potential therapeutic for migraine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

It is known that innate immunity-related molecules, such as cytokines, toll-like receptors, the complement family, and acquired immunity-related molecules, such as the major histocompatibility complex and antibody receptors, are also expressed in the brain and play important roles in brain development. Moreover, although the brain has previously been regarded as an immune-privileged site, it is known to contain lymphatic vessels. Not only microglia but also lymphocytes regulate cognition and play a vital role in the formation of neuronal circuits. This review provides an overview of the function of immune cells and immune molecules in the CNS, with particular emphasis on their effect on neural developmental processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00914</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The enteric glia, a neural crest-derived cell type that composes the Enteric Nervous System, is involved in controlling gut functions, including motility, gut permeability, and neuronal communication. Moreover this glial cell could to give rise to new neurons. It is believed that enteric neurons are generated up to 21 days postnatally; however, adult gut cells with glial characteristics can give rise to new enteric neurons under certain conditions. The factors that activate this capability of enteric glia to differentiate into neurons remain unknown. Here, we followed the progress of this neuronal differentiation and investigated this ability by challenging enteric glial cells with different culture conditions. We found that, in vitro, enteric glial cells from the gut of adult and neonate mice have a high capability to acquire neuronal markers and undergoing morphological changes. In a co-culture system with 3T3 fibroblasts, the number of glial cells expressing βIIItubulin decreased after 7 days. The effect of 3T3-conditioned medium on adult cells was not significant, and fewer enteric glial cells from neonate mice began the neurogenic process in this medium. Laminin, an extracellular matrix protein that is highly expressed by the niche of the enteric ganglia, seemed to have a large role in inhibiting the differentiation of enteric glia, at least in cells from the adult gut. Our results suggest that, in an in vitro approach that provides conditions more similar to those of enteric glial cells in vivo, these cells could, to some extent, retain their morphology and marker expression, with their neurogenic potential inhibited. Importantly, laminin seemed to inhibit differentiation of adult enteric glial cells. It is possible that the differentiation of enteric glia into neurons is related to severe changes in the microenvironment, leading to disruption of the basement membrane. In summary, our data indicated that the interaction between the enteric glial cells and their microenvironment molecules significantly affects the control of their behavior and functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00060</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Multiple-Network Poroelastic Theory (MPET) is a numerical model to characterize the transport of multiple fluid networks in the brain, which overcomes the problem of conducting separate analyses on individual fluid compartments and losing the interactions between tissue and fluids, in addition to the interaction between the different fluids themselves. In this paper, the blood perfusion results from MPET modeling are partially validated using cerebral blood flow (CBF) data obtained from arterial spin labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which uses arterial blood water as an endogenous tracer to measure CBF. Two subjects—one healthy control and one patient with unilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) stenosis are included in the validation test. The comparison shows several similarities between CBF data from ASL and blood perfusion results from MPET modeling, such as higher blood perfusion in the gray matter than in the white matter, higher perfusion in the periventricular region for both the healthy control and the patient, and asymmetric distribution of blood perfusion for the patient. Although the partial validation is mainly conducted in a qualitative way, it is one important step toward the full validation of the MPET model, which has the potential to be used as a testing bed for hypotheses and new theories in neuroscience research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Berberine Protects C17.2 Neural Stem Cells From Oxidative Damage Followed by Inducing Neuronal Differentiation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00395</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurodegeneration is the loss of structure and/or function of neurons. Oxidative stress has been suggested as one of the common etiology in most of the neurodegenerative diseases. Previous studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of berberine in various neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. In this study, we hypothesized that berberine could protect C17.2 neural stem cells (NSCs) from 2,2′-Azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH)-induced oxidative damage then promote neuronal differentiation. AAPH was used to induce oxidative damage. After the damage, berberine protected C17.2 cells were kept cultured for another week in differentiation medium with/without berberine. Changes in cell morphology were detected by microscopy and cell viability was determined by MTT assay. Real-time PCR and western blot analysis were performed to confirm the associated pathways. Berberine was able to protect C17.2 NSCs from the oxidative damage. It lowered the cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level in C17.2 cells via Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2-Related Factor 1/2 (NRF1/2) – NAD(P)H Quinone Dehydrogenase 1 (NQO-1) – Heme Oxygenase 1 (HO-1) pathway. It also down-regulated the apoptotic factors-Caspase 3 and Bcl2 Associated X (Bax) and upregulated the anti-apoptotic factor-Bcl2 to reduce cell apoptosis. Besides, berberine increased C17.2 cell viability via up-regulating Extracellular-signal-Related Kinase (ERK) and phosphor-Extracellular-signal-Related Kinase (pERK) expression. Then, berberine promoted C17.2 cell to differentiate into neurons and the differentiation mechanism involved the activation of WNT/β-catenin pathway as well as the upregulation of expression levels of pro-neural factors Achaete-Scute Complex-Like 1 (ASCL1), Neurogenin 1 (NeuroG1), Neuronal Differentiation 2 (NeuroD2) and Doublecortin (DCX). In conclusion, berberine protected C17.2 NSCs from oxidative damage then induced them to differentiate into neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Stem Cell-Derived Exosomes Protect Astrocyte Cultures From in vitro Ischemia and Decrease Injury as Post-stroke Intravenous Therapy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00394</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the present study, we assessed efficacy of exosomes harvested from human and mouse stem cell cultures in protection of mouse primary astrocyte and neuronal cell cultures following in vitro ischemia, and against ischemic stroke in vivo. Cell media was collected from primary mouse neural stem cell (NSC) cultures or from human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte (iCM) cultures. Exosomes were extracted and purified by polyethylene glycol complexing and centrifugation, and exosome size and concentration were determined with a NanoSite&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; particle analyzer. Exosomes were applied to primary mouse cortical astrocyte or neuronal cultures prior to, and/or during, combined oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) injury. Cell death was assessed via lactate dehydrogenase (LHD) and propidium iodide staining 24 h after injury. NSC-derived exosomes afforded marked protection to astrocytes following OGD. A more modest (but significant) level of protection was observed with human iCM-derived exosomes applied to astrocytes, and with NSC-derived exosomes applied to primary neuronal cultures. In subsequent experiments, NSC-derived exosomes were injected intravenously into adult male mice 2 h after transient (1 h) middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Gross motor function was assessed 1 day after reperfusion and infarct volume was assessed 4 days after reperfusion. Mice treated post-stroke with intravenous NSC-derived exosomes exhibited significantly reduced infarct volumes. Together, these results suggest that exosomes isolated from mouse NSCs provide neuroprotection against experimental stroke possibly via preservation of astrocyte function. Intravenous NSC-derived exosome treatment may therefore provide a novel clinical adjuvant for stroke in the immediate post-injury period.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Effects of Acute Exercise Duration on the Inhibition Aspect of Executive Function in Late Middle-Aged Adults</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00227</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: This study investigated whether acute exercise duration affects inhibition in late middle-aged adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Over four separate days, 40 late middle-aged adults completed, in a counterbalanced order, three exercise sessions consisting of single bouts of moderate-to-vigorous intensity cycling, with the main acute exercise durations being 10, 20, and 45 min, and a control session consisting of 30 min of reading. Their inhibition performance was then evaluated by administration of the Stroop test following each session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The participants had shorter mean response times for both the congruent and neutral conditions of the Stroop following the acute exercise lasting 20 min than they did after the control session. The acute exercise lasting 20 min also resulted in shorter response times for both conditions of the Stroop than the acute exercise lasting only 10 min. Meanwhile, the acute exercise lasting 45 min resulted in a shorter mean response time for the neutral Stroop condition than did the control session. Finally, the acute exercise lasting 20 min resulted in the shortest mean response time of all four sessions for the Stroop incongruent condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The above findings suggest that the moderate-to-vigorous intensity acute exercise lasting 20 min facilitated multiple cognitive function domains in general, whereas the exercise sessions of shorter and longer duration had negligible effects on executive function in the late middle-aged adults. These results highlight the need to consider the duration of any moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise when developing acute exercise programs to facilitate executive function in aged populations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Age-Dependent Relationship Between Plasma Aβ40 and Aβ42 and Total Tau Levels in Cognitively Normal Subjects</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00222</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Both amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are pathological hallmarks in the brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the constituents of these hallmarks, amyloid beta (Aβ) 40, Aβ42, and total Tau (t-Tau), have been detected in the blood of cognitively normal subjects by using an immunomagnetic reduction (IMR) assay. Whether these levels are age-dependent is not known, and their interrelation remains undefined. We determined the levels of these biomarkers in cognitively normal subjects of different age groups. A total of 391 cognitively normal subjects aged 23–91 were enrolled from hospitals in Asia, Europe, and North America. Healthy cognition was evaluated by NIA-AA guidelines to exclude subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD and by cognitive assessment using the Mini Mental State Examination and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). We examined the effect of age on plasma levels of Aβ40, Aβ42, and t-Tau and the relationship between these biomarkers during aging. Additionally, we explored age-related reference intervals for each biomarker. Plasma t-Tau and Aβ42 levels had modest but significant correlations with chronological age (r = 0.127, p = 0.0120 for t-Tau; r = −0.126, p = 0.0128 for Aβ42), ranging from ages 23 to 91. Significant positive correlations were detected between Aβ42 and t-Tau in the groups aged 50 years and older, with Rho values ranging from 0.249 to 0.474. Significant negative correlations were detected between Aβ40 and t-Tau from age 40 to 91 (r ranged from −0.293 to −0.582) and between Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the age groups of 30–39 (r = −0.562, p = 0.0235), 50–59 (r = −0.261, p = 0.0142), 60–69 (r = −0.303, p = 0.0004), and 80–91 (r = 0.459, p = 0.0083). We also provided age-related reference intervals for each biomarker. In this multicenter study, age had weak but significant effects on the levels of Aβ42 and t-Tau in plasma. However, the age group defined by decade revealed the emergence of a relationship between Aβ40, Aβ42, and t-Tau in the 6th and 7th decades. Validation of our findings in a large-scale and longitudinal study is warranted.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00931</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The underlying pathomechanisms for glaucoma, one of the most common causes of blindness worldwide, are still not identified. In addition to increased intraocular pressure (IOP), oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and immunological processes seem to play a role. Several pharmacological or molecular/genetic methods are currently investigated as treatment options for this disease. Altered autoantibody levels were detected in serum, aqueous humor, and tissue sections of glaucoma patients. To further analyze the role of the immune system, an IOP-independent, experimental autoimmune glaucoma (EAG) animal model was developed. In this model, immunization with ocular antigens leads to antibody depositions, misdirected T-cells, retinal ganglion cell death and degeneration of the optic nerve, similar to glaucomatous degeneration in patients. Moreover, an activation of the complement system and microglia alterations were identified in the EAG as well as in ocular hypertension models. The inhibition of these factors can alleviate degeneration in glaucoma models with and without high IOP. Currently, several neuroprotective approaches are tested in distinct models. It is necessary to have systems that cover underlying pathomechanisms, but also allow for the screening of new drugs. In vitro models are commonly used, including single cell lines, mixed-cultures, and even organoids. In ex vivo organ cultures, pathomechanisms as well as therapeutics can be investigated in the whole retina. Furthermore, animal models reveal insights in the in vivo situation. With all these models, several possible new drugs and therapy strategies were tested in the last years. For example, hypothermia treatment, neurotrophic factors or the blockage of excitotoxity. However, further studies are required to reveal the pressure independent pathomechanisms behind glaucoma. There is still an open issue whether immune mechanisms directly or indirectly trigger cell death pathways. Hence, it might be an imbalance between protective and destructive immune mechanisms. Moreover, identified therapy options have to be evaluated in more detail, since deeper insights could lead to better treatment options for glaucoma patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: October 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 58&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Tatyana O Sharpee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This review connects several lines of research to argue that hyperbolic geometry should be broadly applicable to neural circuits as well as other biological circuits. The reason for this is that networks that conform to hyperbolic geometry are maximally responsive to external and internal perturbations. These networks also allow for efficient communication under conditions where nodes are added or removed. We will argue that one of the signatures of hyperbolic geometry is the celebrated Zipf’s law (also sometimes known as the Pareto distribution) that states that the probability to observe a given pattern is inversely related to its rank. Zipf’s law is observed in a variety of biological systems — from protein sequences, neural networks to economics. These observations provide further evidence for the ubiquity of networks with an underlying hyperbolic metric structure. Recent studies in neuroscience specifically point to the relevance of a three-dimensional hyperbolic space for neural signaling. The three-dimensional hyperbolic space may confer additional robustness compared to other dimensions. We illustrate how the use of hyperbolic coordinates revealed a novel topographic organization within the olfactory system. The use of such coordinates may facilitate representation of relevant signals elsewhere in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Depression as a Risk Factor for Impulse Control Disorders in Parkinson Disease</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25581?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To longitudinally evaluate the role of depression in the development of impulse control disorders (ICDs) in Parkinson disease (PD) patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative, we included PD patients without ICDs at baseline according to the Questionnaire for Impulsive‐Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's Disease (QUIP). Patients were prospectively evaluated first quarterly and then biannually. Development of an ICD was defined as an increase in QUIP scores during follow‐up. Using survival proportional hazard models, we studied the effect of baseline depression on ICD risk. We also evaluated this effect controlling for dopamine agonist use as a time‐dependent variable and for other potential confounders.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among 354 patients, 68 were depressed at baseline. The median follow‐up was 4.08 years. Depression at baseline was associated with higher ICD risk (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.32–2.9, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). This risk remained significant after controlling for dopamine agonist use (HR = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.33–2.9, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), which was also independently linked to ICD development (HR = 1.87, 95% CI = 1.3–2.7, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Therefore, depressed patients faced an even higher ICD risk when receiving dopamine agonists. Controlling for multiple potential confounders did not alter these results.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression predisposes to the development of ICDs in PD. This risk is magnified by dopamine agonists. Dopamine agonists should thus be used cautiously in depressed PD patients. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00043</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;One fundamental feature of consciousness is that the contents of consciousness depend on the state of consciousness. Here, we propose an answer to why this is so: both the state and the contents of consciousness depend on the activity of cortical layer 5 pyramidal (L5p) neurons. These neurons affect both cortical and thalamic processing, hence coupling the cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical loops with each other. Functionally this coupling corresponds to the coupling between the state and the contents of consciousness. Together the cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical loops form a thalamo-cortical broadcasting system, where the L5p cells are the central elements. This perspective makes one quite specific prediction: cortical processing that does not include L5p neurons will be unconscious. More generally, the present perspective suggests that L5p neurons have a central role in the mechanisms underlying consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

In this review article, we summarized the current evidence for the treatment efficacy of acupuncture in AD and PD from the perspective of clinical trials and animal model. Acupuncture can inhibit the accumulation of toxic proteins in neurological diseases, modulate energy supply based on glucose metabolism, depress neuronal apoptosis, etc., and exert a wide range of neuroprotective effects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Sensitivity of Single-Trial Mu-Suppression Detection for Motor Imagery Performance as Compared to Motor Execution and Motor Observation Performance</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00302</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Motor imagery (MI) has been widely used to operate brain-computer interface (BCI) systems for rehabilitation and some life assistive devices. However, the current performance of an MI-based BCI cannot fully meet the needs of its in-field applications. Most of the BCIs utilizing a generalized feature for all participants have been found to greatly hamper the efficacy of the BCI system. Hence, some attempts have made on the exploration of subject-dependent parameters, but it remains challenging to enhance BCI performance as expected. To this end, in this study, we used the independent component analysis (ICA), which has been proved capable of isolating the pure motor-related component from non-motor-related brain processes and artifacts and extracting the common motor-related component across MI, motor execution (ME), and motor observation (MO) conditions. Then, a sliding window approach was used to detect significant mu-suppression from the baseline using the electroencephalographic (EEG) alpha power time course and, thus, the success rate of the mu-suppression detection could be assessed on a single-trial basis. By comparing the success rates using different parameters, we further quantified the extent of the improvement in each motor condition to evaluate the effectiveness of both generalized and individualized parameters. The results showed that in ME condition, the success rate under individualized latency and that under generalized latency was 90.0% and 77.75%, respectively; in MI condition, the success rate was 74.14% for individual latency and 58.47% for generalized latency, and in MO condition, the success rate was 67.89% and 61.26% for individual and generalized latency, respectively. As can be seen, the success rate in each motor condition was significantly improved by utilizing an individualized latency compared to that using the generalized latency. Moreover, the comparison of the individualized window latencies for the mu-suppression detection across different runs of the same participant as well as across different participants showed that the window latency was significantly more consistent in the intra-subject than in the inter-subject settings. As a result, we proposed that individualizing the latency for detecting the mu-suppression feature for each participant might be a promising attempt to improve the MI-based BCI performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Neural Efficiency of Human–Robotic Feedback Modalities Under Stress Differs With Gender</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00287</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sensory feedback, which can be presented in different modalities – single and combined, aids task performance in human–robotic interaction (HRI). However, combining feedback modalities does not always lead to optimal performance. Indeed, it is not known how feedback modalities affect operator performance under stress. Furthermore, there is limited information on how feedback affects neural processes differently for males and females and under stress. This is a critical gap in the literature, particularly in the domain of surgical robotics, where surgeons are under challenging socio-technical environments that burden them physiologically. In the present study, we posited operator performance as the summation of task performance and neurophysiological cost of maintaining that performance. In a within-subject design, we used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to assess cerebral activations of 12 participants who underwent a 3D manipulation task within a virtual environment with concurrent feedback (visual and visual + haptic) in the presence and absence of a cognitive stressor. Cognitive stress was induced with the serial-7 subtraction test. We found that while task performance was higher with visual than visual + haptic feedback, it degraded under stress. The two feedback modalities were found to be associated with varying neural activities and neural efficiencies, and these were stress- and gender-dependent. Our findings engender further investigation into effectiveness of feedback modalities on males and females under stressful conditions in HRI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Reversal of Cognitive Impairment in gp120 Transgenic Mice by the Removal of the p75 Neurotrophin Receptor</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00398</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Activation of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), by the proneurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (proBDNF), triggers loss of synapses and promotes neuronal death. These pathological features are also caused by the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV) envelope protein gp120, which increases the levels of proBDNF. To establish whether p75NTR plays a role in gp120-mediated neurite pruning, we exposed primary cultures of cortical neurons from p75NTR&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice to gp120. We found that the lack of p75NTR expression significantly reduced gp120-mediated neuronal cell death. To determine whether knocking down p75NTR is neuroprotective in vivo, we intercrossed gp120 transgenic (tg) mice with p75NTR heterozygous mice to obtain gp120tg mice lacking one or two p75NTR alleles. The removal of p75NTR alleles inhibited gp120-mediated decrease of excitatory synapses in the hippocampus, as measured by the levels of PSD95 and subunits of the N-methyl-D-Aspartate receptor in synaptosomes. Moreover, the deletion of only one copy of the p75NTR gene was sufficient to restore the cognitive impairment observed in gp120tg mice. Our data suggest that activation of p75NTR is one of the mechanisms crucial for the neurotoxic effect of gp120. These data indicate that p75NTR antagonists could provide an adjunct therapy against synaptic simplification caused by HIV.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The WWOX Gene Influences Cellular Pathways in the Neuronal Differentiation of Human Neural Progenitor Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00391</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The brain is the most functionally organized structure of all organs. It manages behavior, perception and higher cognitive functions. The WWOX gene is non-classical tumor suppressor gene, which has been shown to have an impact on proliferation, apoptosis and migration processes. Moreover, genetic aberrations in WWOX induce severe neuropathological phenotypes in humans and rodents. The aim of the present study was to investigate in detail the impact of WWOX on human neural progenitor cell (hNPC) maintenance and how depletion of WWOX disturbs signaling pathways playing a pivotal role in neuronal differentiation and central nervous system (CNS) organogenesis. hNPC with a silenced WWOX gene exhibited lowered mitochondrial redox potential, enhanced adhesion to fibronectin and extracellular matrix protein mixture, downregulation of MMP2/9 expression and impaired 3D growth. Global transcriptome analysis using cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) found that WWOX downregulation significantly changes the expression of multiple genes engaged in cytoskeleton organization, adhesion, cell signaling and chromatin remodeling. The massive changes in gene expression caused by WWOX silencing may strongly affect the differentiation and migration of neurons in organogenesis, brain injury, cancerogenesis or neurodifferentiation. WWOX gene appears to be an important regulator of neural tissue architecture and function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Effects of Acupuncture Therapy on MCI Patients Using Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00237</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Acupuncture therapy (AT) is a non-pharmacological method of treatment that has been applied to various neurological diseases. However, studies on its longitudinal effect on the neural mechanisms of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) for treatment purposes are still lacking in the literature. In this clinical study, we assess the longitudinal effects of ATs on MCI patients using two methods: (i) Montreal Cognitive Assessment test (MoCA-K, Korean version), and (ii) the hemodynamic response (HR) analyses using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). fNIRS signals of a working memory (WM) task were acquired from the prefrontal cortex. Twelve elderly MCI patients and 12 healthy people were recruited as target and healthy control (HC) groups, respectively. Each group went through an fNIRS scanning procedure three times: The initial data were obtained without any ATs, and subsequently a total of 24 AT sessions were conducted for MCI patients (i.e., MCI-0: the data prior to ATs, MCI-1: after 12 sessions of ATs for 6 weeks, MCI-2: another 12 sessions of ATs for 6 weeks). The mean HR responses of all MCI-0–2 cases were lower than those of HCs. To compare the effects of AT on MCI patients, MoCA-K results, temporal HR data, and spatial activation patterns (i.e., t-maps) were examined. In addition, analyses of functional connectivity (FC) and graph theory upon WM tasks were conducted. With ATs, (i) the averaged MoCA-K test scores were improved (MCI-1, p = 0.002; MCI-2, p = 2.9e&lt;sup&gt;–4&lt;/sup&gt;); (ii) the mean HR response of WM tasks was increased (p &amp;lt; 0.001); and (iii) the t-maps of MCI-1 and MCI-2 were enhanced. Furthermore, an increased FC in the prefrontal cortex in both MCI-1/MCI-2 cases in comparison to MCI-0 was obtained (p &amp;lt; 0.01), and an increasing trend in the graph theory parameters was observed. All these findings reveal that ATs have a positive impact on improving the cognitive function of MCI patients. In conclusion, ATs can be used as a therapeutic tool for MCI patients as a non-pharmacological method (Clinical trial registration number: KCT 0002451 https://cris.nih.go.kr/cris/en/).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Microglia in Alzheimer Disease: Well-Known Targets and New Opportunities</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00233</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microglia are the resident macrophages of the central nervous system. They play key roles in brain development, and physiology during life and aging. Equipped with a variety of molecular sensors and through the various functions they can fulfill, they are critically involved in maintaining the brain’s homeostasis. In Alzheimer disease (AD), microglia reaction was initially thought to be incidental and triggered by amyloid deposits and dystrophic neurites. However, recent genome-wide association studies have established that the majority of AD risk loci are found in or near genes that are highly and sometimes uniquely expressed in microglia. This leads to the concept of microglia being critically involved in the early steps of the disease and identified them as important potential therapeutic targets. Whether microglia reaction is beneficial, detrimental or both to AD progression is still unclear and the subject of intense debate. In this review, we are presenting a state-of-knowledge report intended to highlight the variety of microglial functions and pathways shown to be critically involved in AD progression. We first address both the acquisition of new functions and the alteration of their homeostatic roles by reactive microglia. Second, we propose a summary of new important parameters currently emerging in the field that need to be considered to identify relevant microglial targets. Finally, we discuss the many obstacles in designing efficient therapeutic strategies for AD and present innovative technologies that may foster our understanding of microglia roles in the pathology. Ultimately, this work aims to fly over various microglial functions to make a general and reliable report of the current knowledge regarding microglia’s involvement in AD and of the new research opportunities in the field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Novel Functions of the Neurodegenerative-Related Gene Tau in Cancer</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00231</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The analysis of global and comparative genomics between different diseases allows us to understand the key biological processes that explain the etiology of these pathologies. We have used this type of approach to evaluate the expression of several neurodegeneration-related genes on the development of tumors, particularly brain tumors of glial origin (gliomas), which are an aggressive and incurable type of cancer. We have observed that genes involved in Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), as well as in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, correlate with better prognosis of gliomas. Within these genes, high Tau/MAPT expression shows the strongest correlation with several indicators of prolonged survival on glioma patients. Tau protein regulates microtubule stability and dynamics in neurons, although there have been reports of its expression in glial cells and also in gliomas. However, little is known about the regulation of Tau/MAPT transcription in tumors. Moreover, our in silico analysis indicates that this gene is also expressed in a variety of tumors, showing a general correlation with survival, although its function in cancer has not yet been addressed. Another remarkable aspect of Tau is its involvement in resistance to taxanes in various tumors types such as breast, ovarian and gastric carcinomas. This is due to the fact that taxanes have the same tubulin-binding site as Tau. In the present work we review the main knowledge about Tau function and expression in tumors, with a special focus on brain cancer. We will also speculate with the therapeutic implications of these findings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Association of Iron and the Pathologies of Parkinson’s Diseases in MPTP/MPP+-Induced Neuronal Degeneration in Non-human Primates and in Cell Culture</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00215</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Despite much efforts in the last few decades, the mechanism of degeneration of dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) in Parkinson’s disease (PD) remains unclear. This represents a major knowledge gap in idiopathic and genetic forms of PD. Among various possible key factors postulated, iron metabolism has been widely suggested to be involved with fueling oxidative stress, a known factor in the pathogenesis of PD. However, the correlation between iron and DA neuron loss, specifically in the SN, has not been described in experimental animal models with great detail, with most studies utilizing rodents and, rarely, non-human primates. In the present study, aiming to gain further evidence of a pathological role of iron in PD, we have examined the correlation of iron with DA neuron loss in a non-human primate model of PD induced by MPTP. We report a significant iron accumulation accompanied by both DA degeneration in the SN and motor deficits in the monkey that displayed the most severe PD pathology and behavioral deficits. The other two monkeys subjected to MPTP displayed less severe PD pathologies and motor deficits, however, their SN iron levels were significantly lower than controls. These findings suggest that high iron may indicate and contribute to heightened MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced PD pathology in late or severe stages of PD, while depressed levels of iron may signal an early stage of disease. Similarly, using a cell culture preparation, we have found that high doses of ferric ammonium citrate (FAC), a factor known to enhance iron accumulation, increased MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced cell death in U251 and SH-SY5Y cells, and even in control cells. However, at low dose FAC restored or increased the viability of U251 and SH-SY5Y cells in the absence or presence of MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. These observations imply that high levels of iron likely contribute to or heighten MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; toxicity in the later stages of PD. While we report reduced iron levels in the earlier stages of MPTP induced PD, the significance of these changes remains to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: A Computational Model of Oxytocin Modulation of Olfactory Recognition Memory</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/4/ENEURO.0201-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Social recognition in mammals depends on complex interactions between sensory and other brain areas as well as modulatory inputs by specific neuropeptides such as oxytocin (OXT). Social recognition memory specifically has been shown to depend among others on olfactory processing, and can be probed using methods similar to those used when probing non-social odor memory. We here use a computational model of two interconnected olfactory networks in the mouse, the olfactory bulb (OB) and anterior olfactory nucleus, to propose a mechanism for olfactory short-term recognition memory and its modulation in social situations. Based on previous experiments, we propose one early locus for memory to be the OB. During social encounters in mice, pyramidal cells in the anterior olfactory nucleus, themselves driven by olfactory input, are rendered more excitable by OXT release, resulting in stronger feedback to OB local interneurons. This additional input to the OB creates stronger dynamics and improves signal-to-noise ratio of odor responses in the OB proper. As a consequence, mouse social olfactory memories are more strongly encoded and their duration is modulated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Postinjury Inhibition of miR-181a Promotes Restoration of Hippocampal CA1 Neurons after Transient Forebrain Ischemia in Rats</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/4/ENEURO.0002-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating postinjury neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus remain undefined. We have previously demonstrated that preinjury treatment with anti-microRNA (miR)-181a preserved neurons and prevented astrocyte dysfunction in the hippocampal cornu ammonis-1 (CA1) following transient forebrain ischemia. In the present study, we assessed postinjury treatment with anti-miR-181a on recovery of CA1 neurons following transient forebrain ischemia in rats. Stereotactic CA1 injection of miR-181a antagomir at either 2 h or 7 d postinjury resulted in improved restoration of CA1 measured at 28 d postinjury. Treatment with antagomir was associated with overexpression of the mir-181a target cell adhesion-associated, oncogene-related protein and enhanced expression of the neuroprogenitor cell marker doublecortin (DCX) in the CA1. Assessment of GFAP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cell fate by Cre/Lox-mediated deletion demonstrated that some GFAP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells in CA1 exhibited &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; DCX expression in response to injury. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments using primary neuronal stem cells confirmed that miR-181a inhibition augmented the expression of DCX and directed cellular differentiation toward a neuronal fate. These results suggest that miR-181a inhibition plays a central role in the restoration of CA1 neurons via augmentation of early latent neurogenic gene activation in neural progenitor cells, including some reactive astrocytes. Therapeutic interventions targeting this restorative process may represent a novel postinjury approach to improve clinical outcomes in survivors of forebrain ischemia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine whether cerebrovascular risk factors are associated with subsequent diagnoses of Parkinson disease, and whether these associations are similar in magnitude to those with subsequent diagnoses of Alzheimer disease.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a retrospective cohort study using claims data from a 5% random sample of Medicare beneficiaries from 2008 to 2015. The exposures were stroke, atrial fibrillation, coronary disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, valvular heart disease, tobacco use, and alcohol abuse. The primary outcome was a new diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson disease. The secondary outcome was a new diagnosis of Alzheimer disease. Marginal structural Cox models adjusting for time‐dependent confounding were used to characterize the association between exposures and outcomes. We also evaluated the association between cerebrovascular risk factors and subsequent renal colic (negative control).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among 1,035,536 Medicare beneficiaries followed for a mean of 5.2 years, 15,531 (1.5%) participants were diagnosed with Parkinson disease and 81,974 (7.9%) were diagnosed with Alzheimer disease. Most evaluated cerebrovascular risk factors, including prior stroke (hazard ratio = 1.55; 95% confidence interval = 1.39–1.72), were associated with the subsequent diagnosis of Parkinson disease. The magnitudes of these associations were similar, but attenuated, to the associations between cerebrovascular risk factors and Alzheimer disease. Confirming the validity of our analytical model, most cerebrovascular risk factors were not associated with the subsequent diagnosis of renal colic.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cerebrovascular risk factors are associated with Parkinson disease, an effect comparable to their association with Alzheimer disease. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Depalmitoylation by Palmitoyl-Protein Thioesterase 1 in Neuronal Health and Degeneration</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2019.00025</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Protein palmitoylation is the post-translational, reversible addition of a 16-carbon fatty acid, palmitate, to proteins. Protein palmitoylation has recently garnered much attention, as it robustly modifies the localization and function of canonical signaling molecules and receptors. Protein depalmitoylation, on the other hand, is the process by which palmitic acid is removed from modified proteins and contributes, therefore, comparably to palmitoylated-protein dynamics. Palmitoylated proteins also require depalmitoylation prior to lysosomal degradation, demonstrating the significance of this process in protein sorting and turnover. Palmitoylation and depalmitoylation serve as particularly crucial regulators of protein function in neurons, where a specialized molecular architecture and cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains contribute to synaptic transmission. Three classes of depalmitoylating enzymes are currently recognized, the acyl protein thioesterases, α/β hydrolase domain-containing 17 proteins (ABHD17s), and the palmitoyl-protein thioesterases (PPTs). However, a clear picture of depalmitoylation has not yet emerged, in part because the enzyme-substrate relationships and specific functions of depalmitoylation are only beginning to be uncovered. Further, despite the finding that loss-of-function mutations affecting palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1) function cause a severe pediatric neurodegenerative disease, the role of PPT1 as a depalmitoylase has attracted relatively little attention. Understanding the role of depalmitoylation by PPT1 in neuronal function is a fertile area for ongoing basic science and translational research that may have broader therapeutic implications for neurodegeneration. Here, we will briefly introduce the rapidly growing field surrounding protein palmitoylation and depalmitoylation, then will focus on the role of PPT1 in development, health, and neurological disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Glucocorticoid-Driven NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation in Hippocampal Microglia Mediates Chronic Stress-Induced Depressive-Like Behaviors</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00210</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chronic stress is a key risk factor for depression, and microglia have been implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease. Recent studies show that the Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is expressed in microglia and may play a crucial role in depression. However, the mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in hippocampal microglia and its role in depressive-like behaviors remain poorly understood. In this study, rats were subjected to 6 h of restraint stress per day for 21 days to produce a model of stress-induced depression. Behavioral tests and serum corticosterone were used to assess the success of the model. Furthermore, HAPI cells were pretreated with dexamethasone (5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;–7&lt;/sup&gt; M) to assess stress-induced changes in microglial cells in culture. The microglial marker Iba-1, reactive oxygen species (ROS), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and key components of the NLRP3 inflammasome and its downstream inflammatory effectors (IL-1β and IL-18) were measured. Chronic stress induced depressive-like behavior, increased serum corticosterone levels and produced hippocampal structural changes. Chronic stress and dexamethasone both increased Iba-1 expression and ROS formation and also elevated levels of NF-κB, NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1, IL-1β and IL-18. After use of the NF-κB inhibitor BAY 117082 and knocked out NLRP3 in vitro decreased ROS formation and the expression of Iba-1, NF-κB and NLRP3 as well as levels of cleaved caspase-1, IL-1β and IL-18. These findings suggest that activation of the glucocorticoid receptor-NF-κB-NLRP3 pathway in hippocampal microglia mediates chronic stress-induced hippocampal neuroinflammation and depression-like behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: EK7 Regulates NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation and Neuroinflammation Post-traumatic Brain Injury</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00202</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As one of the most common causes of mortality and disability, traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a huge psychological and economic burden to patients, families, and societies worldwide. Neuroinflammation reduction may be a favorable option to alleviate secondary brain injuries and ameliorate the outcome of TBI. The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, has been shown to be involved in TBI. NIMA-related kinase 7 (NEK7) has been verified as an essential mediator of NLRP3 inflammasome activation that is recruited upstream of the formation of inflammasomes in response to NLRP3 activators. However, the underlying mechanism by which NEK7 operates post-TBI remains undefined. In this study, we performed both in vivo and in vitro experiments. Using an in vivo mouse TBI model, mice were administered an intracerebroventricular injection of NEK7-shRNA virus. For the in vitro analysis, primary cortical neurons with NEK7-shRNA were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/ATP or potassium (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). We evaluated the effects of NEK7 knock-down on neurological deficits, NLRP3 inflammasomes, caspase-1 activation, and neuronal injury. During the 0–168 h post-TBI period in vivo, NEK7 and NLRP3 inflammasome activation increased in what appeared to be a time-dependent manner. As well as pyroptosis-related markers, caspase-1 activation (p20) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) activation (p17) were up-regulated. NEK7 down-regulation attenuated neurological deficits, NLRP3 inflammasomes, caspase-1 activation, and neuronal injury. The same phenomena were observed during the in vitro experiments. Furthermore, NEK7 knock-down suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome activation and pyroptosis, which were triggered by K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; efflux, and the LPS + ATP-triggered NEK7–NLRP3 complex was reversed in primary cortical neurons placed in 50 mM K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; medium. Collectively, the data demonstrated that NEK7, as a modulator, regulates NLRP3 inflammasomes and downstream neuroinflammation in response to K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; efflux, through NEK7–NLRP3 assembly, pro-caspase-1 recruitment, caspase-1 activation, and pyroptosis in nerve injuries, post-TBI. NEK7 may be a potential therapeutic target for attenuating neuroinflammation and nerve injury post-TBI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;These are exciting times for research on adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). Debate and controversy regarding the existence of generation of new neurons in the adult, and even diseased human brain flourishes as articles against and in favor accumulate. Adult neurogenesis in the human brain is a phenomenon that does not share the qualities of quantum mechanics. The scientific community should agree that human AHN exists or does not, but not both at the same time. In this commentary, we discuss the latest research articles about hAHN and what their findings imply for the neurogenesis field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00912</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The excitatory neurons in the visual cortex are of great significance for us in understanding brain functions. However, the diverse neuron types and their morphological properties have not been fully deciphered. In this paper, we applied the brain-wide positioning system (BPS) to image the entire brain of two Thy1-eYFP H-line male mice at 0.2 μm × 0.2 μm × 1 μm voxel resolution. A total of 103 neurons were reconstructed in layers 5 and 6 of the visual cortex with single-axon-level resolution. Based on the complete topology of neurons and the inherent positioning function of the imaging method, we classified the observed neurons into six types according to their apical dendrites and somata location: star pyramidal cells in layer 5 (L5-sp), slender-tufted pyramidal cells in layer 5 (L5-st), tufted pyramidal cells in layer 5 (L5-tt), spiny stellate-like cells in layer 6 (L6-ss), star pyramidal cells in layer 6 (L6-sp), and slender-tufted pyramidal cells in layer 6 (L6-st). By examining the axonal projection patterns of individual neurons, they can be categorized into three modes: ipsilateral circuit connection neurons, callosal projection neurons and corticofugal projection neurons. Correlating the two types of classifications, we have found that there are at least two projection modes comprised in the former defined neuron types except for L5-tt. On the other hand, each projection mode may consist of four dendritic types defined in this study. The axon projection mode only partially correlates with the apical dendrite feature. This work has demonstrated a paradigm for resolving the visual cortex through single-neuron-level quantification and has shown potential to be extended to reveal the connectome of other defined sensory and motor systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00906</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There are increased risks for deglutition disorders in people with Down syndrome (DS). Although mouse models have been used to study the biological underpinnings of DS in other areas, relatively little is known about swallowing phenotypes in these models. We hypothesized that swallowing performance would be affected in adult mouse models of DS, relative to typical control mice. Videofluoroscopic swallow studies (VFSS) were conducted on adults of two mouse models of DS: Ts65Dn and Dp(16)1Yey, and evaluated in comparison with age-matched controls. Relative to other groups, adult Ts65Dn showed significantly slower swallow rates, longer inter-swallow intervals (ISI), and greater numbers of jaw excursion cycles preceding each swallow. In contrast, adult Dp(16)1Yey mice showed swallowing performance similar to control mice. Exploratory quantitative analyses of the intrinsic tongue (transverse muscle), and extrinsic tongue muscles [genioglossus (GG), styloglossus (SG), and hyoglossus (HG)] showed no significant differences between genotype groups in myosin heavy chain isoform profiles. Collectively, these findings suggest that while swallowing is typical in adult Dp(16)1Yey, swallowing in adult Ts65Dn is atypical due to unknown causes. The finding that adult Ts65Dn may have utility as a model of dysphagia provides new opportunities to elucidate biological underpinnings of dysphagia associated with DS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 Is Associated With Activation of the Paraventricular Nucleus of the Hypothalamus and Stress-Related Gastrointestinal Dysmotility</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00905</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is a molecule associated with familial and sporadic Parkinson’s disease. It regulates many central neuronal functions, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy, and axonal extension. Recently, it has been revealed that LRRK2 is related to anxiety/depression-like behavior, implying an association between LRRK2 and stress. In the present study, we investigated for the first time the stress pathway and its relationship to gastrointestinal motility in LRRK2-knockout (KO) mice. The mice were subjected to acute restraint stress, and analyzed for activation of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) using an immunohistochemical approach. Phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) was assessed by Western blotting. The KO mice showed a lower number of c-Fos-positive cells and disruption of the ERK signaling pathway in the PVN in the presence of restraint stress. Stress responses in terms of both upper and lower gastrointestinal motility were alleviated in the mice, accompanied by lower c-Fos immunoreactivity in enteric excitatory neurons. Our present findings suggest that LRRK2 is a newly recognized molecule regulating the stress pathway in the PVN, playing a role in stress-related gastrointestinal dysmotility.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Intracranial Atherosclerotic Disease-Related Acute Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion Can Be Predicted by Diffusion-Weighted Imaging</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00903</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: The differentiation of large vessel occlusion caused by intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS) or intracranial embolism significantly impacts the course of treatment (i.e., intravenous thrombolysis versus mechanical thrombectomy) for acute cerebral infarction. Currently, there is no objective evidence to indicate ICAS-related middle cerebral artery M1 segment occlusion before treatment. In cases of ICAS, it is often observed that the infarct core caused by ICAS-related M1 segment middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) is located in deeper parts of the brain (basal ganglia or semiovoid region).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: To evaluate whether the location of the infarct core, identified using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), can be used to differentiate ICAS from intracranial embolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Thirty-one consecutive patients diagnosed with acute cerebral infarction caused by middle cerebral artery M1 segment occlusion were retrospectively included based on angiographic findings to distinguish ICAS from embolic occlusion. Patients were divided into two groups based on the location of the infarct core on DWI: in the deep part of the brain (basal ganglia or semiovoid region) or more superficially (i.e., cortex).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In 16 patients, the infarct core was mainly in the deep part of the brain on DWI [14 of 16 patients in the ICAS group and only 2 in the non-ICAS group (93.3 vs. 6.7%, respectively; P &amp;lt; 0.001)]. The diagnostic sensitivity of DWI for ICAS was 93.3%, with a specificity of 87.5%, a Positive predictive value (PPV) of 87.5%, and an Negative predictive value (NPV) of 93.3%, the accuracy was 88.5%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Intracranial atherosclerotic disease-related acute MCAO can be predicted using DWI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Distinct Mechanism of Audiovisual Integration With Informative and Uninformative Sound in a Visual Detection Task: A DCM Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00059</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have shown that task-irrelevant auditory information can provide temporal clues for the detection of visual targets and improve visual perception; such sounds are called informative sounds. The neural mechanism of the integration of informative sound and visual stimulus has been investigated extensively, using behavioral measurement or neuroimaging methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and event-related potential (ERP), but the dynamic processes of audiovisual integration cannot be characterized formally in terms of directed neuronal coupling. The present study adopts dynamic causal modeling (DCM) of fMRI data to identify changes in effective connectivity in the hierarchical brain networks that underwrite audiovisual integration and memory. This allows us to characterize context-sensitive changes in neuronal coupling and show how visual processing is contextualized by the processing of informative and uninformative sounds. Our results show that audiovisual integration with informative and uninformative sounds conforms to different optimal models in the two conditions, indicating distinct neural mechanisms of audiovisual integration. The findings also reveal that a sound is uninformative owing to low-level automatic audiovisual integration and informative owing to integration in high-level cognitive processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Cortical Plasticity Induced by Anodal Transcranial Pulsed Current Stimulation Investigated by Combining Two-Photon Imaging and Electrophysiological Recording</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00400</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Anodal-transcranial pulsed current stimulation (a-tPCS) has been used in human studies to modulate cortical excitability or improve behavioral performance in recent years. Multiple studies show crucial roles of astrocytes in cortical plasticity. The calcium activity in astrocytes could regulate synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity. Whether the astrocytic activity is involved in a-tPCS-induced cortical plasticity is presently unknown. The purpose of this study is to investigate the calcium responses in neurons and astrocytes evoked by a-tPCS with different current intensities, and thereby provides some indication of the mechanisms underlying a-tPCS-induced cortical plasticity. Two-photon calcium imaging was used to record the calcium responses of neurons and astrocytes in mouse somatosensory cortex. Local field potential (LFP) evoked by sensory stimulation was used to assess the effects of a-tPCS on plasticity. We found that long-duration a-tPCS with high-intensity current could evoke large-amplitude calcium responses in both neurons and astrocytes, whereas long-duration a-tPCS with low-intensity current evoked large-amplitude calcium responses only in astrocytes. The astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; elevations are driven by noradrenergic-dependent activation of the alpha-1 adrenergic receptors (A1ARs), while the intense Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; responses of neurons are driven by action potentials. LFP recordings demonstrated that low-intensity a-tPCS led to enhancement of cortical excitability while high-intensity a-tPCS resulted in diminution of cortical excitability. The results provide some evidence that the enhancement of a-tPCS-induced cortical excitability might be partly associated with calcium elevation in astrocytes, whereas the diminution of a-tPCS-induced cortical excitability might be caused by excessive calcium activity in neurons. These findings indicate that the appropriate current intensity should be used in the application of a-tPCS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this study, we aimed to provide a neuroanatomy atlas derived from cross-sectional and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the encephalon of the brown bear (Ursus arctos). A postmortem brain analysis using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI – 1,5T; a high-resolution submillimeter three-dimensional T1-3D FFE) and cross-sectional macroscopic anatomy methods revealed major embryological and anatomical subdivisions of the encephalon, including the ventricular system. Most of the internal structures were comparably identifiable in both methods. The tractus olfactorius medialis, corpus subthalamicum, brachium colliculi rostralis, fasciculus longitudinalis medialis, nuclei vestibulares, velum medullare rostrale, nucleus fastigii, fasciculi cuneatus et gracilis were identified entirely by cross-sectional macroscopic analysis. However, the glandula pinealis, lemniscus lateralis and nuclei rhaphe were visualized only with MRI. Gross neuroanatomic analysis provided information about sulci and gyri of the cerebral hemispheres, components of the vermis and cerebellar hemispheres, and relative size and morphology of constituents of the rhinencephalon and cerebellum constituents. Similarities and discrepancies in identification of structures provided by both methods, as well as hallmarks of the structures facilitating identification using these methods are discussed. Finally, we compare the brown bear encephalon with other carnivores and discuss most of the identified structures compared to those of the domestic dog, the domestic cat, Ursidae and Mustelidae families and Pinnipedia clade.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Numerous observational studies have shown that physical exercise promotes cognition in the elderly, however, the results from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are ambiguous. In addition, potential benefits of exercise in an elderly Chinese population have not been comprehensively addressed. In this study, an investigation was launched which focused on the relationship between physical exercise and cognitive function, blood lipid profiles and brain anatomy in a non-dementia aging Chinese population. A total of 2074 non-dementia elderly subjects were included (self-selected exercise n = 1372; self-selected non-exercise n = 702). Amongst the subjects, 689 volunteered to receive blood lipid tests, 141 undergo brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and 1399 receive a 1 year cognitive evaluation follow-up. The Beijing version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Mini-Mental States Examination (MMSE) were used to assess cognitive function. A significant difference in cognitive function was observed at the baseline and during the 1-year follow-up between the self-selected exercise and self-selected non-exercise groups, however, no significant differences in blood lipids and brain anatomy was evident. Physical exercise has a beneficial effect on cognition, particularly visuospatial function, and decreases the risk of dementia in a Chinese aging cohort.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Right Structural and Functional Reorganization in Four-Year-Old Children with Perinatal Arterial Ischemic Stroke Predict Language Production</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/4/ENEURO.0447-18.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Brain imaging methods have contributed to shed light on the mechanisms of recovery after early brain insult. The assumption that the unaffected right hemisphere can take over language functions after left perinatal stroke is still under debate. Here, we report how patterns of brain structural and functional reorganization were associated with language outcomes in a group of four-year-old children with left perinatal arterial ischemic stroke (PAIS). Specifically, we gathered specific fine-grained developmental measures of receptive and productive aspects of language as well as standardized measures of cognitive development. We also collected structural neuroimaging data as well as functional activations during a passive listening story-telling fMRI task and a resting state session (rs-fMRI). Children with a left perinatal stroke showed larger lateralization indices of both structural and functional connectivity of the dorsal language pathway towards the right hemisphere that, in turn, were associated with better language outcomes. Importantly, the pattern of structural asymmetry was significantly more right-lateralized in children with a left perinatal brain insult than in a group of matched healthy controls. These results strongly suggest that early lesions of the left dorsal pathway and the associated perisylvian regions can induce the interhemispheric transfer of language functions to right homolog regions. This study provides combined evidence of structural and functional brain reorganization of language networks after early stroke with strong implications for neurobiological models of language development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Exogenous Galactosylceramide as Potential Treatment for CLN3 Disease</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25573?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CLN3 disease is the commonest of the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, a group of pediatric neurodegenerative disorders. Functions of the CLN3 protein include antiapoptotic properties and facilitating anterograde transport of galactosylceramide from Golgi to lipid rafts. This study confirms the beneficial effects of long‐term exogenous galactosylceramide supplementation on longevity, neurobehavioral parameters, neuronal cell counts, astrogliosis, and diminution in brain and serum ceramide levels in &lt;i&gt;Cln3&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;Δex7/8&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; knock‐in mice. Additionally, the impact of galactosylceramide on ceramide synthesis enzymes is documented.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of 72 mice received galactosylceramide or vehicle for 40 weeks. The effect of galactosylceramide supplementation on &lt;i&gt;Cln3&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;Δex7/8&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; mice was determined by performing behavioral tests, measuring ceramide in brains and serum, and assessing impact on longevity, subunit C storage, astrogliosis, and neuronal cell counts.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galactosylceramide resulted in enhanced grip strength of forelimbs in male and female mice, better balance on the accelerating rotarod in females, and improved motor coordination during pole climbing in male mice. Brain and serum ceramide levels as well as apoptosis rates were lower in galactosylceramide‐treated &lt;i&gt;Cln3&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;Δex7/8&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Galactosylceramide also increased neuronal cell counts significantly in male and female mice and tended to decrease subunit C storage in specific brain regions. Astrogliosis dropped in females compared to a slight increase in males after galactosylceramide. Galactosylceramide increased the lifespan of affected mice.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galactosylceramide improved behavioral, neuropathological, and biochemical parameters in &lt;i&gt;Cln3&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;Δex7/8&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; mice, paving the way for effective therapy for CLN3 disease and use of serum ceramide as a potential biomarker to track impact of therapies. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00211</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels carry a non-selective cationic conductance, I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;, which is important for modulating neuron excitability. Four genes (HCN1-4) encode HCN channels, with each gene having distinct expression and biophysical profiles. Here we use multiplex nucleic acid in situ hybridization to determine HCN4 mRNA expression within the adult mouse brain. We take advantage of this approach to detect HCN4 mRNA simultaneously with either HCN1 or HCN2 mRNA and markers of excitatory (VGlut-positive) and inhibitory (VGat-positive) neurons, which was not previously reported. We have developed a Fiji-based analysis code that enables quantification of mRNA expression within identified cell bodies. The highest HCN4 mRNA expression was found in the habenula (medial and lateral) and the thalamus. HCN4 mRNA was particularly high in the medial habenula with essentially no co-expression of HCN1 or HCN2 mRNA. An absence of I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated “sag” in neurons recorded from the medial habenula of knockout mice confirmed that HCN4 channels are the predominant subtype in this region. Analysis in the thalamus revealed HCN4 mRNA in VGlut2-positive excitatory neurons that was always co-expressed with HCN2 mRNA. In contrast, HCN4 mRNA was undetectable in the nucleus reticularis. HCN4 mRNA expression was high in a subset of VGat-positive cells in the globus pallidus external. The majority of these neurons co-expressed HCN2 mRNA while a smaller subset also co-expressed HCN1 mRNA. In the striatum, a small subset of large cells which are likely to be giant cholinergic interneurons co-expressed high levels of HCN4 and HCN2 mRNA. The amygdala, cortex and hippocampus expressed low levels of HCN4 mRNA. This study highlights the heterogeneity of HCN4 mRNA expression in the brain and provides a morphological framework on which to better investigate the functional roles of HCN4 channels.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Localization of Retinal Ca2+/Calmodulin-Dependent Kinase II-β (CaMKII-β) at Bipolar Cell Gap Junctions and Cross-Reactivity of a Monoclonal Anti-CaMKII-β Antibody With Connexin36</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00206</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal gap junctions formed by connexin36 (Cx36) and chemical synapses share striking similarities in terms of plasticity. Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), an enzyme known to induce memory formation at chemical synapses, has recently been described to potentiate electrical coupling in the retina and several other brain areas via phosphorylation of Cx36. The contribution of individual CaMKII isoforms to this process, however, remains unknown. We recently identified CaMKII-β at electrical synapses in the mouse retina. Now, we set out to identify cell types containing Cx36 gap junctions that also express CaMKII-β. To ensure precise description, we first tested the specificity of two commercially available antibodies on CaMKII-β-deficient retinas. We found that a polyclonal antibody was highly specific for CaMKII-β. However, a monoclonal antibody (CB-β-1) recognized CaMKII-β but also cross-reacted with the C-terminal tail of Cx36, making localization analyses with this antibody inaccurate. Using the polyclonal antibody, we identified strong CaMKII-β expression in bipolar cell terminals that were secretagogin- and HCN1-positive and thus represent terminals of type 5 bipolar cells. In these terminals, a small fraction of CaMKII-β also colocalized with Cx36. A similar pattern was observed in putative type 6 bipolar cells although there, CaMKII expression seemed less pronounced. Next, we tested whether CaMKII-β influenced the Cx36 expression in bipolar cell terminals by quantifying the number and size of Cx36-immunoreactive puncta in CaMKII-β-deficient retinas. However, we found no significant differences between the genotypes, indicating that CaMKII-β is not necessary for the formation and maintenance of Cx36-containing gap junctions in the retina. In addition, in wild-type retinas, we observed frequent association of Cx36 and CaMKII-β with synaptic ribbons, i.e., chemical synapses, in bipolar cell terminals. This arrangement resembled the composition of mixed synapses found for example in Mauthner cells, in which electrical coupling is regulated by glutamatergic activity. Taken together, our data imply that CaMKII-β may fulfill several functions in bipolar cell terminals, regulating both Cx36-containing gap junctions and ribbon synapses and potentially also mediating cross-talk between these two types of bipolar cell outputs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Inhibition of nSMase2 Reduces the Transfer of Oligomeric α-Synuclein Irrespective of Hypoxia</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00200</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recently, extracellular vesicles (EVs), such as exosomes, have been proposed to play an influential role in the cell-to-cell spread of neurodegenerative diseases, including the intercellular transmission of α-synuclein (α-syn). However, the regulation of EV biogenesis and its relation to Parkinson’s disease (PD) is only partially understood. The generation of EVs through the ESCRT-independent pathway depends on the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin by neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2) to produce ceramide, which causes the membrane of endosomal multivesicular bodies to bud inward. nSMase2 is sensitive to oxidative stress, a common process in PD brains; however, little is known about the role of sphingomyelin metabolism in the pathogenesis of PD. This is the first study to show that inhibiting nSMase2 decreases the transfer of oligomeric aggregates of α-syn between neuron-like cells. Furthermore, it reduced the accumulation and aggregation of high-molecular-weight α-syn. Hypoxia, as a model of oxidative stress, reduced the levels of nSMase2, but not its enzymatic activity, and significantly altered the lipid composition of cells without affecting EV abundance or the transfer of α-syn. These data show that altering sphingolipids can mitigate the spread of α-syn, even under hypoxic conditions, potentially suppressing PD progression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Modeling Interval Timing by Recurrent Neural Nets</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00046</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to take a new approach in showing how the central nervous system might encode time at the supra-second level using recurrent neural nets (RNNs). This approach utilizes units with a delayed feedback, whose feedback weight determines the temporal properties of specific neurons in the network architecture. When these feedback neurons are coupled, they form a multilayered dynamical system that can be used to model temporal responses to steps of input in multidimensional systems. The timing network was implemented using separate recurrent “Go” and “No-Go” neural processing units to process an individual stimulus indicating the time of reward availability. Outputs from these distinct units on each time step are converted to a pulse reflecting a weighted sum of the separate Go and No-Go signals. This output pulse then drives an integrator unit, whose feedback weight and input weights shape the pulse distribution. This system was used to model empirical data from rodents performing in an instrumental “peak interval timing” task for two stimuli, Tone and Flash. For each of these stimuli, reward availability was signaled after different times from stimulus onset during training. Rodent performance was assessed on non-rewarded trials, following training, with each stimulus tested individually and simultaneously in a stimulus compound. The associated weights in the Go/No-Go network were trained using experimental data showing the mean distribution of bar press rates across an 80 s period in which a tone stimulus signaled reward after 5 s and a flash stimulus after 30 s from stimulus onset. Different Go/No-Go systems were used for each stimulus, but the weighted output of each fed into a final recurrent integrator unit, whose weights were unmodifiable. The recurrent neural net (RNN) model was implemented using Matlab and Matlab’s machine learning tools were utilized to train the network using the data from non-rewarded trials. The neural net output accurately fit the temporal distribution of tone and flash-initiated bar press data. Furthermore, a “Temporal Averaging” effect was also obtained when the flash and tone stimuli were combined. These results indicated that the system combining tone and flash responses were not superposed as in a linear system, but that there was a non-linearity, which interacted between tone and flash. In order to achieve an accurate fit to the empirical averaging data it was necessary to implement non-linear “saliency functions” that limited the output signal of each stimulus to the final integrator when the other was co-present. The model suggests that the central nervous system encodes timing generation as a dynamical system whose timing properties are embedded in the connection weights of the system. In this way, event timing is coded similar to the way other sensory-motor systems, such as the vestibulo-ocular and optokinetic systems, which combine sensory inputs from the vestibular and visual systems to generate the temporal aspects of compensatory eye movements.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Type-2-Diabetes Alters CSF but Not Plasma Metabolomic and AD Risk Profiles in Vervet Monkeys</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00843</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Epidemiological studies suggest that individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) have a twofold to fourfold increased risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD), however, the exact mechanisms linking the two diseases are unknown. In both conditions, the majority of pathophysiological changes, including glucose and insulin dysregulation, insulin resistance, and AD-related changes in Aβ and tau, occur decades before the onset of clinical symptoms and diagnosis. In this study, we investigated the relationship between metabolic biomarkers associated with T2D and amyloid pathology including Aβ levels, from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and fasting plasma of healthy, pre-diabetic (PreD), and T2D vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus aethiops sabaeus). Consistent with the human disease, T2D monkeys have increased plasma and CSF glucose levels as they transition from normoglycemia to PreD and diabetic states. Although plasma levels of acylcarnitines and amino acids remained largely unchanged, peripheral hyperglycemia correlated with decreased CSF acylcarnitines and CSF amino acids, including branched chain amino acid (BCAA) concentrations, suggesting profound changes in cerebral metabolism coincident with systemic glucose dysregulation. Moreover, CSF Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; and CSF Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; levels decreased in T2D monkeys, a phenomenon observed in the human course of AD which coincides with increased amyloid deposition within the brain. In agreement with previous studies in mice, CSF Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; and CSF Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; were highly correlated with CSF glucose levels, suggesting that glucose levels in the brain are associated with changes in Aβ metabolism. Interestingly, CSF Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; and CSF Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; levels were also highly correlated with plasma but not CSF lactate levels, suggesting that plasma lactate might serve as a potential biomarker of disease progression in AD. Moreover, CSF glucose and plasma lactate levels were correlated with CSF amino acid and acylcarnitine levels, demonstrating alterations in cerebral metabolism occurring with the onset of T2D. Together, these data suggest that peripheral metabolic changes associated with the development of T2D produce alterations in brain metabolism that lead to early changes in the amyloid cascade, similar to those observed in pre-symptomatic AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2019.00060</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Quantifying, controlling, and monitoring image quality is an essential prerequisite for ensuring the validity and reproducibility of many types of neuroimaging data analyses. Implementation of quality control (QC) procedures is the key to ensuring that neuroimaging data are of high-quality and their validity in the subsequent analyses. We introduce the QC system of the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging (LONI): a web-based system featuring a workflow for the assessment of various modality and contrast brain imaging data. The design allows users to anonymously upload imaging data to the LONI-QC system. It then computes an exhaustive set of QC metrics which aids users to perform a standardized QC by generating a range of scalar and vector statistics. These procedures are performed in parallel using a large compute cluster. Finally, the system offers an automated QC procedure for structural MRI, which can flag each QC metric as being ‘good’ or ‘bad.’ Validation using various sets of data acquired from a single scanner and from multiple sites demonstrated the reproducibility of our QC metrics, and the sensitivity and specificity of the proposed Auto QC to ‘bad’ quality images in comparison to visual inspection. To the best of our knowledge, LONI-QC is the first online QC system that uniquely supports the variety of functionality where we compute numerous QC metrics and perform visual/automated image QC of multi-contrast and multi-modal brain imaging data. The LONI-QC system has been used to assess the quality of large neuroimaging datasets acquired as part of various multi-site studies such as the Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) Study and the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). LONI-QC’s functionality is freely available to users worldwide and its adoption by imaging researchers is likely to contribute substantially to upholding high standards of brain image data quality and to implementing these standards across the neuroimaging community.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Head Anticipation During Locomotion With Auditory Instruction in the Presence and Absence of Visual Input</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00293</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Head direction has been identified to anticipate trajectory direction during human locomotion. Head anticipation has also been shown to persist in darkness. Arguably, the purpose for this anticipatory behavior is related to motor control and trajectory planning, independently of the visual condition. This implies that anticipation remains in the absence of visual input. However, experiments so far have only explored this phenomenon with visual instructions which intrinsically primes a visual representation to follow. The primary objective of this study is to describe head anticipation in auditory instructed locomotion, in the presence and absence of visual input. Auditory instructed locomotion trajectories were performed in two visual conditions: eyes open and eyes closed. First, 10 sighted participants localized static sound sources to ensure they could understand the sound cues provided. Afterwards, they listened to a moving sound source while actively following it. Later, participants were asked to reproduce the trajectory of the moving sound source without sound. Anticipatory head behavior was observed during trajectory reproduction in both eyes open and closed conditions. The results suggest that head anticipation is related to motor anticipation rather than mental simulation of the trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Microglia Regulate Pruning of Specialized Synapses in the Auditory Brainstem</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00055</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The assembly of uniquely organized sound localization circuits in the brainstem requires precise developmental mechanisms. Glial cells have been shown to shape synaptic connections in the retinogeniculate system during development, but their contributions to specialized auditory synapses have not been identified. Here we investigated the role of microglia in auditory brainstem circuit assembly, focusing on the formation and pruning of the calyx of Held in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB). Microglia were pharmacologically depleted in mice early in development using subcutaneous injections of an inhibitor of colony stimulating factor 1 receptor, which is essential for microglia survival. Brainstems were examined prior to and just after hearing onset, at postnatal days (P) 8 and P13, respectively. We found that at P13 there were significantly more polyinnervated MNTB neurons when microglia were depleted, consistent with a defect in pruning. Expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a mature astrocyte marker that normally appears in the MNTB late in development, was significantly decreased in microglia-depleted mice at P13, suggesting a delay in astrocyte maturation. Our results demonstrate that monoinnervation of MNTB neurons by the calyx of Held is significantly disrupted or delayed in the absence of microglia. This finding may reflect a direct role for microglia in synaptic pruning. A secondary role for microglia may be in the maturation of astrocytes in MNTB. These findings highlight the significant function of glia in pruning during calyx of Held development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00396</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;While there are murine and rat choroid plexus epithelial cell cultures, a translationally relevant model for choroid plexus activation and function is still lacking. The rhesus macaque is the gold standard for modeling viral infection and activation of CNS, including HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders. We have developed a rhesus macaque choroid plexus epithelial cell culture model which we believe to be suitable for studies of inflammation associated with viral infection of the CNS. Epithelial morphology and function were assessed using vimentin, phalloidin, the tight junction protein zonula-occludens-1 (ZO-1), and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Choroid plexus epithelial cell type was confirmed using immunofluorescence with two proteins highly expressed in the choroid plexus: transthyretin and α-klotho. Finally, barrier properties of the model were monitored using pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, the TLR2 agonist PamCys3K, and dexamethasone). When pro-inflammatory TNF-α was added to the xCelligence wells, there was a decrease in barrier function, which decreased in a step-wise fashion with each additional administration. This barrier function was repaired upon addition of the steroid dexamethasone. The TLR2 agonist PAM3CysK increased barrier functions in TNF-α treated wells. We have presented a model of the blood-CSF barrier that will allow study into pro- and anti-inflammatory conditions in the brain, while simultaneously measuring real time changes to epithelial cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25578?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To evaluate the effect of a decrease in blood pressure (BP) fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for orthostatic hypotension (OH) on performance in each domain of cognitive function in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using a cross‐sectional and within‐group design.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subjects were individuals without dementia and with type 2 diabetes mellitus, including 107 individuals without OH and 94 with OH (DMOH); 95 control participants were also included. BP was assessed in both the supine and standing positions. A detailed neuropsychological assessment was made in each posture for all subjects.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were statistically significant differences between the patients without OH and the DMOH group with regard to some cognitive measures while supine. Standing posture exacerbated and broadened cognitive deficits in the DMOH group for all measures in the different domains of cognition including executive functioning, memory, visuospatial skills, information processing speed, and attention. When group‐specific supine scores were used as baseline anchors, both the patients without OH and the DMOH group showed cognitive changes when transitioning from a supine to a standing, upright position, with the DMOH group exhibiting a wider range of neuropsychological deficits in memory, visuospatial skills, executive function, and sustained attention, as well as significant changes in information processing speed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These data demonstrate that type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with OH had transient, posture‐mediated cognitive deficits in excess of those found in diabetes mellitus without OH. Understanding the effects of OH on cognition due to autonomic failure is important, particularly as clinical assessments and neuroimaging collect data only in the seated or supine positions.

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25572?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To establish the effects induced by long‐term, unilateral stimulation of parvalbumin (PV)‐positive interneurons on seizures, interictal spikes, and high‐frequency oscillations (80–500Hz) occurring after pilocarpine‐induced status epilepticus (SE)—a proven model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE)—in transgenic mice expressing or not expressing ChR2.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PV‐ChR2 (n = 6) and PV‐Cre (n = 6) mice were treated with pilocarpine to induce SE. Three hours after SE onset, unilateral optogenetic stimulation (450nm, 25mW, 20‐millisecond pulses delivered at 8Hz for 30 seconds every 2 minutes) of CA3 PV‐positive interneurons was implemented for 14 continuous days in both groups.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rates of seizures (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01), interictal spikes (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), and interictal spikes with fast ripples (250–500Hz) (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) were lower in PV‐ChR2 than in PV‐Cre mice. Ripples (80–200Hz) occurring outside of interictal spikes had higher rates in the PV‐ChR2 group (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01), whereas isolated fast ripples had lower rates (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). However, seizure probability was higher during optogenetic stimulation in PV‐ChR2 compared to PV‐Cre animals (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings show that the unilateral activation of CA3 PV‐positive interneurons exerts anti‐ictogenic effects associated with decreased rates of interictal spikes and fast ripples in this MTLE model. However, PV‐positive interneuron stimulation can paradoxically trigger seizures in epileptic animals, supporting the notion that γ‐aminobutyric acid type A signaling can also initiate ictogenesis.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Connectomic Profiling Identifies Responders to Vagus Nerve Stimulation</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25574?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a common treatment for medically intractable epilepsy, but response rates are highly variable, with no preoperative means of identifying good candidates. This study aimed to predict VNS response using structural and functional connectomic profiling.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifty‐six children, comprising discovery (n = 38) and validation (n = 18) cohorts, were recruited from 3 separate institutions. Diffusion tensor imaging was used to identify group differences in white matter microstructure, which in turn informed beamforming of resting‐state magnetoencephalography recordings. The results were used to generate a support vector machine learning classifier, which was independently validated. This algorithm was compared to a second classifier generated using 31 clinical covariates.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treatment responders demonstrated greater fractional anisotropy in left thalamocortical, limbic, and association fibers, as well as greater connectivity in a functional network encompassing left thalamic, insular, and temporal nodes (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). The resulting classifier demonstrated 89.5% accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.93 on 10‐fold cross‐validation. In the external validation cohort, this model demonstrated an accuracy of 83.3%, with a sensitivity of 85.7% and specificity of 75.0%. This was significantly superior to predictions using clinical covariates alone, which exhibited an area under the ROC curve of 0.57 (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.008).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study provides the first multi‐institutional, multimodal connectomic prediction algorithm for VNS, and provides new insights into its mechanism of action. Reliable identification of VNS responders is critical to mitigate surgical risks for children who may not benefit, and to ensure cost‐effective allocation of health care resources.

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00037</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microglial cells, which are highly plastic, immediately respond to any change in the microenvironment by becoming activated and shifting the phenotype toward neurotoxicity or neuroprotection. The polarization of microglia/macrophages after spinal cord injury (SCI) seems to be a dynamic process and can change depending on the microenvironment, stage, course, and severity of the posttraumatic process. Effective methods to modulate microglia toward a neuroprotective phenotype in order to stimulate neuroregeneration are actively sought for. In this context, available approaches that can selectively impact the polarization of microglia/macrophages regulate synthesis of trophic factors and cytokines/chemokines in them, and their phagocytic function and effects on the course and outcome of SCI are discussed in this review.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: TrkB Agonist LM22A-4 Increases Oligodendroglial Populations During Myelin Repair in the Corpus Callosum</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00205</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The neurotrophin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) promotes central nervous system (CNS) myelination during development and after injury. This is achieved via activation of oligodendrocyte-expressed tropomyosin-related kinase (Trk) B receptors. However, while administration of BDNF has shown beneficial effects, BDNF itself has a poor pharmacokinetic profile. Here, we compare two TrkB-targeted BDNF-mimetics, the structural-mimetic, tricyclic dimeric peptide-6 (TDP6) and the non-peptide small molecule TrkB agonist LM22A-4 in a cuprizone model of central demyelination in female mice. Both mimetics promoted remyelination, increasing myelin sheath thickness and oligodendrocyte densities after 1-week recovery. Importantly, LM22A-4 exerts these effects in an oligodendroglial TrkB-dependent manner. However, analysis of TrkB signaling by LM22A-4 suggests rather than direct activation of TrkB, LM22A-4 exerts its effects via indirect transactivation of Trk receptors. Overall, these studies support the therapeutic strategy to selectively targeting TrkB activation to promote remyelination in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00204</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cholinergic neurons comprise a small population of cells in the striatum but have fundamental roles in fine tuning brain function, and in the etiology of neurological and psychiatric disorders such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) or schizophrenia. The process of developmental cell specification underlying neuronal identity and function is an area of great current interest. There has been significant progress in identifying the developmental origins, commonalities in molecular markers, and physiological properties of the cholinergic neurons. Currently, we are aware of a number of key factors that promote cholinergic fate during development. However, the extent of cholinergic cell diversity is still largely underestimated. New insights into the biological basis of their specification indicate that cholinergic neurons may be far more diverse than previously thought. This review article, highlights the physiological features and the synaptic properties that segregate cholinergic cell subtypes. It provides an accurate picture of cholinergic cell diversity underlying their organization and function in neuronal networks. This review article, also discusses current challenges in deciphering the logic of the cholinergic cell heterogeneity that plays a fundamental role in the control of neural processes in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Transcript Analysis of Zebrafish GLUT3 Genes, slc2a3a and slc2a3b, Define Overlapping as Well as Distinct Expression Domains in the Zebrafish (Danio rerio) Central Nervous System</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00199</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The transport of glucose across the cell plasma membrane is vital to most mammalian cells. The glucose transporter (GLUT; also called SLC2A) family of transmembrane solute carriers is responsible for this function in vivo. GLUT proteins encompass 14 different isoforms in humans with different cell type-specific expression patterns and activities. Central to glucose utilization and delivery in the brain is the neuronally expressed GLUT3. Recent research has shown an involvement of GLUT3 genetic variation or altered expression in several different brain disorders, including Huntington’s and Alzheimer’s diseases. Furthermore, GLUT3 was identified as a potential risk gene for multiple psychiatric disorders. To study the role of GLUT3 in brain function and disease a more detailed knowledge of its expression in model organisms is needed. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) has in recent years gained popularity as a model organism for brain research and is now well-established for modeling psychiatric disorders. Here, we have analyzed the sequence of GLUT3 orthologs and identified two paralogous genes in the zebrafish, slc2a3a and slc2a3b. Interestingly, the Glut3b protein sequence contains a unique stretch of amino acids, which may be important for functional regulation. The slc2a3a transcript is detectable in the central nervous system including distinct cellular populations in telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon and rhombencephalon at embryonic and larval stages. Conversely, the slc2a3b transcript shows a rather diffuse expression pattern at different embryonic stages and brain regions. Expression of slc2a3a is maintained in the adult brain and is found in the telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon, cerebellum and medulla oblongata. The slc2a3b transcripts are present in overlapping as well as distinct regions compared to slc2a3a. Double in situ hybridizations were used to demonstrate that slc2a3a is expressed by some GABAergic neurons at embryonic stages. This detailed description of zebrafish slc2a3a and slc2a3b expression at developmental and adult stages paves the way for further investigations of normal GLUT3 function and its role in brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Mucosal Administration of E-selectin Limits Disability in Models of Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00190</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;E-selectin plays an important role in mediating the rolling of leukocytes along and thus, the subsequent extravasation across activated endothelial cells comprising the microvasculature of the blood brain barrier (BBB). In multiple sclerosis (MS) and other inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system (CNS), the microvasculature is altered and immune cells infiltrate the brain and spinal cord contributing to damage, demyelination and ultimately disability. While mucosal administration is typically used to affect lymphocyte hyporesponsiveness or tolerance to suspect autoantigens, intranasal administration to E-selectin has previously been shown to protect against CNS inflammatory insults. We characterized the potential for mucosal administration of E-selectin to modulate CNS autoimmunity in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS. Intranasally administered E-selectin reduced swelling by as much as 50% in delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions compared to ovalbumin-tolerized controls. Intranasal E-selectin delivery prior to disease induction with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)&lt;sub&gt;35–55&lt;/sub&gt; reduced disease severity and total disease burden by more than 50% compared to PBS-tolerized animals; this protection was not associated with differences in the magnitude of the autoimmune response. Examination after the onset of disease showed that protection was associated with significant reductions in inflammatory infiltrates throughout the spinal cord. Tolerization to E-selectin did not influence encephalitogenic characteristics of autoreactive T cells such as IFN-gamma or IL-17 production. Clinical disease was also significantly reduced when E-selectin was first delivered after the onset of clinical symptoms. Splenic and lymph node (LN) populations from E-selectin-tolerized animals showed E-selectin-specific T cell responses and production of the immunomodulatory cytokine IL-10. Transfer of enriched CD4+ T cells from E-selectin tolerized mice limited disability in the passive SJL model of relapsing remitting MS. These results suggest a role for influencing E-selectin specific responses to limit neuroinflammation that warrants further exploration and characterization to better understand its potential to mitigate neurodegeneration in disorders such as MS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Comparing the Effects of Rhythm-Based Music Training and Pitch-Based Music Training on Executive Functions in Preschoolers</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00041</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Previous research has indicated the beneficial effects of music training on executive functions (EFs) in children. However, researchers have not clearly determined which component of music training produces these beneficial effects or whether different components exert different effects on EFs. In the present study, we examined the impact of rhythm-based music training compared to pitch-based music training and sports training as a control on EFs in preschoolers. Children aged between 5 and 6 years (N = 76) were randomly assigned to one of the three training groups and received training in small groups three times a week for 20 min in German kindergartens. Before and after training, children completed tests designed to assess inhibition, set-shifting, and visuospatial working memory. Parental education, family income, personality, and IQ served as control variables. We observed a significant training group × time interaction for the measure of inhibition. Children from the rhythm group exhibited significant improvements in inhibition from pre- to post-tests (d&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.56), whereas children from the other groups did not. Furthermore, children from the rhythm group significantly differed from the sports control group at post-test (d&lt;sub&gt;corr&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.82). Concerning the measures of set-shifting and visuospatial working memory, the descriptive data revealed similar results; however, we did not observe significant training group × time interactions. Based on our findings, rhythm-based music training specifically enhances inhibition in preschoolers and might affect other EFs, such as set-shifting and visuospatial working memory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00895</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Non-invasive neuromodulatory interventions have the potential to influence neural plasticity and augment motor rehabilitation in people with stroke. Paired associative stimulation (PAS) involves the repeated pairing of single pulses of electrical stimulation to a peripheral nerve and single pulses of transcranial magnetic stimulation over the contralateral primary motor cortex. Efficacy of PAS in the lower limb of healthy and stroke populations has not been systematically appraised. Optimal protocols including stimulation parameter settings have yet to be determined. This systematic review (a) examines the efficacy of PAS on lower limb corticomotor excitability in healthy and stroke populations and (b) evaluates the stimulation parameters employed. Five databases were searched for randomized, non-randomized, and pre-post experimental studies evaluating lower limb PAS in healthy and stroke populations. Two independent reviewers identified eligible studies and assessed methodological quality using a modified Downs and Blacks Tool and the TMS Checklist. Intervention stimulation parameters and TMS measurement details were also extracted and compared. Twelve articles, comprising 24 experiments, met the inclusion criteria. Four articles evaluated PAS in people with stroke. Following a single session of PAS, 21 experiments reported modulation of corticomotor excitability, lasting up to 60 min; however, the research lacked methodological rigor. Intervention stimulation parameters were highly variable across experiments, and whilst these appeared to influence efficacy, variations in the intervention and outcome assessment methods hindered the ability to draw conclusions about optimal parameters. Lower limb PAS research requires further investigation before considering its translation into clinical practice. Eight key recommendations serve as guide for enhancing future research in the field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00884</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A certain degree of age-related cognitive decline is normal; however, some people retain more cognitive function than others. Cognitive impairment is associated with an increased risk of dementia. Thus, understanding the factors that contribute to cognitive reserve is crucial, so effective strategies for the prevention of dementia can be developed. Engaging in physical activity can delay cognitive decline and reduce the risk of dementia and a number of early life conditions have been shown to have long-lasting effects on cognition. This mini-review combines these two observations to evaluate the evidence from both animal models and epidemiological studies for physical activity in early life (≤30 years) delaying cognitive decline in later life (cognition tested ≥60 years). Three epidemiological studies were found; two showed a positive association and one found none. The latter was deemed to have an unreliable method. A review of animal studies found none that analyzed the effect of physical activity in early life on cognition in later life. However, in rodent models that analyzed mid-life cognition, runners showed improved cognition and enhanced adult hippocampal neurogenesis, changes which were preserved across the life span. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to conclude whether physical activity in early life may delay cognitive decline in later life, but these results indicate that further studies are warranted. Future human research should be in the form of longitudinal studies that begin below ≤15 years and assess sex differences. Crucially, the physical activity data must define type, quantity and intensity of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural reflexes regulate inflammation and electrical activation of the vagus nerve reduces inflammation in models of inflammatory disease. These discoveries have generated an increasing interest in targeted neurostimulation as treatment for chronic inflammatory diseases. Data from the first clinical trials that use vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) in treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease suggest that there is a therapeutic potential of electrical VNS in diseases characterized by excessive inflammation. Accordingly, there is an interest to further explore the molecular mechanisms and therapeutic potential of electrical VNS in a range of experimental settings and available genetic mouse models of disease. Here, we describe a method for electrical VNS in experimental inflammation in mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: The Impact of Self-Reported Hearing Difficulties on Memory Collaboration in Older Adults</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00870</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cognitive scientists and philosophers recently have highlighted the value of thinking about people at risk of or living with dementia as intertwined parts of broader cognitive systems that involve their spouse, family, friends, or carers. By this view, we rely on people and things around us to “scaffold” mental processes such as memory. In the current study, we identified 39 long-married, older adult couples who are part of the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) Study of Ageing; all were cognitively healthy but half were subjective memory complainers. During two visits to their homes 1 week apart, we assessed husbands’ and wives’ cognitive performance across a range of everyday memory tasks working alone (Week 1) versus together (Week 2), including a Friends Task where they provided first and last names of their friends and acquaintances. As reported elsewhere, elderly couples recalled many more friends’ names working together compared to alone. Couples who remembered successfully together used well-developed, rich, sensitive, and dynamic communication strategies to boost each other’s recall. However, if one or both spouses self-reported mild-to-moderate or severe hearing difficulties (56% of husbands, 31% of wives), couples received less benefit from collaboration. Our findings imply that hearing loss may disrupt collaborative support structures that couples (and other intimate communicative partners) hone over decades together. We discuss the possibility that, cut off from the social world that scaffolds them, hearing loss may place older adults at greater risk of cognitive decline and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Purpose: Predicting patients' survival outcomes is recognized of key importance to clinicians in oncology toward determining an ideal course of treatment and patient management. This study applies radiomics analysis on pre-operative multi-parametric MRI of patients with glioblastoma from multiple institutions to identify a signature and a practical machine learning model for stratifying patients into groups based on overall survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: This study included 163 patients' data with glioblastoma, collected by BRATS 2018 Challenge from multiple institutions. In this proposed method, a set of 147 radiomics image features were extracted locally from three tumor sub-regions on standardized pre-operative multi-parametric MR images. LASSO regression was applied for identifying an informative subset of chosen features whereas a Cox model used to obtain the coefficients of those selected features. Then, a radiomics signature model of 9 features was constructed on the discovery set and it performance was evaluated for patients stratification into short- (&amp;lt;10 months), medium- (10–15 months), and long-survivors (&amp;gt;15 months) groups. Eight ML classification models, trained and then cross-validated, were tested to assess a range of survival prediction performance as a function of the choice of features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The proposed mpMRI radiomics signature model had a statistically significant association with survival (P &amp;lt; 0.001) in the training set, but was not confirmed (P = 0.110) in the validation cohort. Its performance in the validation set had a sensitivity of 0.476 (short-), 0.231 (medium-), and 0.600 (long-survivors), and specificity of 0.667 (short-), 0.732 (medium-), and 0.794 (long-survivors). Among the tested ML classifiers, the ensemble learning model's results showed superior performance in predicting the survival classes, with an overall accuracy of 57.8% and AUC of 0.81 for short-, 0.47 for medium-, and 0.72 for long-survivors using the LASSO selected features combined with clinical factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: A derived GLCM feature, representing intra-tumoral inhomogeneity, was found to have a high association with survival. Clinical factors, when added to the radiomics image features, boosted the performance of the ML classification model in predicting individual glioblastoma patient's survival prognosis, which can improve prognostic quality a further step toward precision oncology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Cellular and Network Mechanisms for Temporal Signal Propagation in a Cortical Network Model</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00057</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The mechanisms underlying an effective propagation of high intensity information over a background of irregular firing and response latency in cognitive processes remain unclear. Here we propose a SSCCPI circuit to address this issue. We hypothesize that when a high-intensity thalamic input triggers synchronous spike events (SSEs), dense spikes are scattered to many receiving neurons within a cortical column in layer IV, many sparse spike trains are propagated in parallel along minicolumns at a substantially high speed and finally integrated into an output spike train toward or in layer Va. We derive the sufficient conditions for an effective (fast, reliable, and precise) SSCCPI circuit: (i) SSEs are asynchronous (near synchronous); (ii) cortical columns prevent both repeatedly triggering SSEs and incorrectly synaptic connections between adjacent columns; and (iii) the propagator in interneurons is temporally complete fidelity and reliable. We encode the membrane potential responses to stimuli using the non-linear autoregressive integrated process derived by applying Newton's second law to stochastic resilience systems. We introduce a multithreshold decoder to correct encoding errors. Evidence supporting an effective SSCCPI circuit includes that for the condition, (i) time delay enhances SSEs, suggesting that response latency induces SSEs in high-intensity stimuli; irregular firing causes asynchronous SSEs; asynchronous SSEs relate to healthy neurons; and rigorous SSEs relate to brain disorders. For the condition (ii) neurons within a given minicolumn are stereotypically interconnected in the vertical dimension, which prevents repeated triggering SSEs and ensures signal parallel propagation; columnar segregation avoids incorrect synaptic connections between adjacent columns; and signal propagation across layers overwhelmingly prefers columnar direction. For the condition (iii), accumulating experimental evidence supports temporal transfer precision with millisecond fidelity and reliability in interneurons; homeostasis supports a stable fixed-point encoder by regulating changes to synaptic size, synaptic strength, and ion channel function in the membrane; together all-or-none modulation, active backpropagation, additive effects of graded potentials, and response variability functionally support the multithreshold decoder; our simulations demonstrate that the encoder-decoder is temporally complete fidelity and reliable in special intervals contained within the stable fixed-point range. Hence, the SSCCPI circuit provides a possible mechanism of effective signal propagation in cortical networks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: The Concept of Transmission Coefficient Among Different Cerebellar Layers: A Computational Tool for Analyzing Motor Learning</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00054</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;High-fidelity regulation of information transmission among cerebellar layers is mainly provided by synaptic plasticity. Therefore, determining the regulatory foundations of synaptic plasticity in the cerebellum and translating them to behavioral output are of great importance. To date, many experimental studies have been carried out in order to clarify the effect of synaptic defects, while targeting a specific signaling pathway in the cerebellar function. However, the contradictory results of these studies at the behavioral level further add to the ambiguity of the problem. Information transmission through firing rate changes in populations of interconnected neurons is one of the most widely accepted principles of neural coding. In this study, while considering the efficacy of synaptic interactions among the cerebellar layers, we propose a firing rate model to realize the concept of transmission coefficient. Thereafter, using a computational approach, we test the effect of different values of transmission coefficient on the gain adaptation of a cerebellar-dependent motor learning task. In conformity with the behavioral data, the proposed model can accurately predict that disruption in different forms of synaptic plasticity does not have the same effect on motor learning. Specifically, impairment in training mechanisms, like in the train-induced LTD in parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses, has a significant negative impact on all aspects of learning, including memory formation, transfer, and consolidation, although it does not disrupt basic motor performance. In this regard, the overinduction of parallel fiber-molecular layer interneuron LTP could not prevent motor learning impairment, despite its vital role in preserving the robustness of basic motor performance. In contrast, impairment in plasticity induced by interneurons and background activity of climbing fibers is partly compensable through overinduction of train-induced parallel fiber-Purkinje cell LTD. Additionally, blockade of climbing fiber signaling to the cerebellar cortex, referred to as olivary system lesion, shows the most destructive effect on both motor learning and basic motor performance. Overall, the obtained results from the proposed computational framework are used to provide a map from procedural motor memory formation in the cerebellum. Certainly, the generalization of this concept to other multi-layered networks of the brain requires more physiological and computational researches.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Zika Virus-Mediated Death of Hippocampal Neurons Is Independent From Maturation State</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00389</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Zika virus (ZIKV) infection of pregnant women and diaplazental transmission to the fetus is linked to the congenital syndrome of microcephaly in newborns. This neuropathology is believed to result from significant death of neuronal progenitor cells (NPC). Here, we examined the fate of neurons in the developing hippocampus, a brain structure which houses neuronal populations of different maturation states. For this purpose, we infected hippocampal slice cultures from immunocompetent newborn mice with ZIKV and monitored changes in hippocampal architecture. In neurons of all hippocampal subfields ZIKV was detected by immunofluorescence labeling and electron microscopy. This includes pyramidal neurons that maturate during the embryonic phase. In the dentate gyrus, ZIKV could be found in the Cajal–Retzius (CR) cells which belong to the earliest born cortical neurons, but also in granule cells that are predominantly generated postnatally. Intriguingly, virus particles were also present in the correctly outgrowing mossy fiber axons of juvenile granule cells, suggesting that viral infection does not impair region- and layer-specific formation of this projection. ZIKV infection of hippocampal tissue was accompanied by both a profound astrocyte reaction indicating tissue injury and a microglia response suggesting phagocytotic activity. Furthermore, depending on the viral load and incubation time, we observed extensive overall neuronal loss in the cultured hippocampal slice cultures. Thus, we conclude ZIKV can replicate in various neuronal populations and trigger neuronal death independent of the maturation state of infected cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Detrimental Effects of HMGB-1 Require Microglial-Astroglial Interaction: Implications for the Status Epilepticus -Induced Neuroinflammation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00380</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of human epilepsy and available treatments with antiepileptic drugs are not disease-modifying therapies. The neuroinflammation, neuronal death and exacerbated plasticity that occur during the silent period, following the initial precipitating event (IPE), seem to be crucial for epileptogenesis. Damage Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMP) such as HMGB-1, are released early during this period concomitantly with a phenomenon of reactive gliosis and neurodegeneration. Here, using a combination of primary neuronal and glial cell cultures, we show that exposure to HMGB-1 induces dendrite loss and neurodegeneration in a glial-dependent manner. In glial cells, loss of function studies showed that HMGB-1 exposure induces NF-κB activation by engaging a signaling pathway that involves TLR2, TLR4, and RAGE. In the absence of glial cells, HMGB-1 failed to induce neurodegeneration of primary cultured cortical neurons. Moreover, purified astrocytes were unable to fully respond to HMGB-1 with NF-κB activation and required microglial cooperation. In agreement, in vivo HMGB-1 blockage with glycyrrhizin, immediately after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE), reduced neuronal degeneration, reactive astrogliosis and microgliosis in the long term. We conclude that microglial-astroglial cooperation is required for astrocytes to respond to HMGB-1 and to induce neurodegeneration. Disruption of this HMGB-1 mediated signaling pathway shows beneficial effects by reducing neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration after SE. Thus, early treatment strategies during the latency period aimed at blocking downstream signaling pathways activated by HMGB-1 are likely to have a significant effect in the neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration that are proposed as key factors in epileptogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microglia are specialized brain-resident macrophages with important functions in health and disease. To improve our understanding of these cells, the research community needs genetic tools to identify and control them in a manner that distinguishes them from closely related cell types. We have targeted the recently discovered microglia-specific &lt;i&gt;Tmem119&lt;/i&gt; gene to generate knock-in mice expressing EGFP (JAX#031823) or CreERT2 (JAX#031820) for the identification and manipulation of microglia, respectively. Genetic characterization of the locus and qPCR-based analysis demonstrate correct positioning of the transgenes and intact expression of endogenous &lt;i&gt;Tmem119&lt;/i&gt; in the knock-in mouse models. Immunofluorescence analysis further shows that parenchymal microglia, but not other brain macrophages, are completely and faithfully labeled in the EGFP-line at different time points of development. Flow cytometry indicates highly selective expression of EGFP in CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD45lo microglia. Similarly, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry analyses using a Cre-dependent reporter mouse line demonstrate activity of CreERT2 primarily in microglia upon tamoxifen administration with the caveat of activity in leptomeningeal cells. Finally, flow cytometric analyses reveal absence of EGFP expression and minimal activity of CreERT2 in blood monocytes of the &lt;i&gt;Tmem119-EGFP&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Tmem119-CreERT2&lt;/i&gt; lines, respectively. These new transgenic lines extend the microglia toolbox by providing the currently most specific genetic labeling and control over these cells in the myeloid compartment of mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Encoding of the Intent to Drink Alcohol by the Prefrontal Cortex Is Blunted in Rats with a Family History of Excessive Drinking</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/4/ENEURO.0489-18.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a central role in guiding decision making, and its function is altered by alcohol use and an individual’s innate risk for excessive alcohol drinking. The primary goal of this work was to determine how neural activity in the PFC guides the decision to drink. Towards this goal, the within-session changes in neural activity were measured from medial PFC (mPFC) of rats performing a drinking procedure that allowed them to consume or abstain from alcohol in a self-paced manner. Recordings were obtained from rats that either lacked or expressed an innate risk for excessive alcohol intake, Wistar or alcohol-preferring (P) rats, respectively. Wistar rats exhibited patterns of neural activity consistent with the intention to drink or abstain from drinking, whereas these patterns were blunted or absent in P rats. Collectively, these data indicate that neural activity patterns in mPFC associated with the intention to drink alcohol are influenced by innate risk for excessive alcohol drinking. This observation may indicate a lack of control over the decision to drink by this otherwise well-validated supervisory brain region.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Transcriptomic Signatures of Postnatal and Adult Intrinsically Photosensitive Ganglion Cells</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/4/ENEURO.0022-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) are rare mammalian photoreceptors essential for non-image-forming vision functions, such as circadian photoentrainment and the pupillary light reflex. They comprise multiple subtypes distinguishable by morphology, physiology, projections, and levels of expression of melanopsin (Opn4), their photopigment. The molecular programs that distinguish ipRGCs from other ganglion cells and ipRGC subtypes from one another remain elusive. Here, we present comprehensive gene expression profiles of early postnatal and adult mouse ipRGCs purified from two lines of reporter mice that mark different sets of ipRGC subtypes. We find dozens of novel genes highly enriched in ipRGCs. We reveal that &lt;i&gt;Rasgrp1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Tbx20&lt;/i&gt; are selectively expressed in subsets of ipRGCs, though these molecularly defined groups imperfectly match established ipRGC subtypes. We demonstrate that the ipRGCs regulating circadian photoentrainment are diverse at the molecular level. Our findings reveal unexpected complexity in gene expression patterns across mammalian ipRGC subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2019.00023</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Synaptic transmission has been studied for decades, as a fundamental step in brain function. The structure of the synapse, and its changes during activity, turned out to be key aspects not only in the transfer of information between neurons, but also in cognitive processes such as learning and memory. The overall synaptic morphology has traditionally been studied by electron microscopy, which enables the visualization of synaptic structure in great detail. The changes in the organization of easily identified structures, such as the presynaptic active zone, or the postsynaptic density, are optimally studied via electron microscopy. However, few reliable methods are available for labeling individual organelles or protein complexes in electron microscopy. For such targets one typically relies either on combination of electron and fluorescence microscopy, or on super-resolution fluorescence microscopy. This review focuses on approaches and techniques used to specifically reveal synaptic organelles and protein complexes, such as cytoskeletal assemblies. We place the strongest emphasis on methods detecting the targets of interest by affinity binding, and we discuss the advantages and limitations of each method.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Phosphoinositides, the seven phosphorylated derivatives of phosphatidylinositol have emerged as regulators of key sub-cellular processes such as membrane transport, cytoskeletal function and plasma membrane signaling in eukaryotic cells. All of these processes are also present in the cells that constitute the nervous system of animals and in this setting too, these are likely to tune key aspects of cell biology in relation to the unique structure and function of neurons. Phosphoinositides metabolism and function are mediated by enzymes and proteins that are conserved in evolution, and analysis of knockouts of these in animal models implicate this signaling system in neural function. Most recently, with the advent of human genome analysis, mutations in genes encoding components of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway have been implicated in human diseases although the cell biological basis of disease phenotypes in many cases remains unclear. In this review we evaluate existing evidence for the involvement of phosphoinositide signaling in human nervous system diseases and discuss ways of enhancing our understanding of the role of this pathway in the human nervous system’s function in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

This research is expected to expedite the discovery of medications for opioid overdose and opioid use disorders, leading toward a safer and more effective treatment of pain. Here, we review mechanistic insights from recent all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of a specific subset of GPCRs for which high-resolution experimental structures are available, including opioid, cannabinoid, orexin, metabotropic glutamate, and dopamine receptor subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00899</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Early exposure to nociceptive events may cause brain structural alterations in preterm neonates, with long-lasting consequences on neurodevelopmental outcome. Little is known on the extent to which early pain may affect brain connectivity. We aim to evaluate brain functional connectivity changes in preterm neonate that underwent multiple invasive procedures during the postnatal period, and to correlate them with the neurodevelopmental outcome at 24 months.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;In this prospective case-control study, we collected information about exposure to painful events during the early postnatal period and resting-state BOLD-fMRI data at term equivalent age from two groups of preterm neonate: 33 subjected to painful procedures during the neonatal intensive care (mean gestational age 27.9 ± 1.8 weeks) and 13 who did not require invasive procedures (average gestational age 31.2 ± 2.1 weeks). A data-driven principal-component-based multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) was used to investigate the effect of early pain exposure on brain functional connectivity, and the relationship between connectivity changes and neurodevelopmental outcome at 24 months, assessed with Griffiths, Developmental Scale-Revised: 0–2.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Early pain was associated with decreased functional connectivity between thalami and bilateral somatosensory cortex, and between the right insular cortex and ipsilateral amygdala and hippocampal regions, with a more evident effect in preterm neonate undergoing more invasive procedures. Functional connectivity of the right thalamocortical pathway was related to neuromotor outcome at 24 months (P = 0.003).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Early exposure to pain is associated with abnormal functional connectivity of developing networks involved in the modulation of noxious stimuli in preterm neonate, contributing to the neurodevelopmental consequence of preterm birth.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Inferior Longitudinal Fasciculus’ Role in Visual Processing and Language Comprehension: A Combined MEG-DTI Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00875</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) is a white matter tract that connects the occipital and the temporal lobes. ILF abnormalities have been associated with deficits in visual processing and language comprehension in dementia patients, thus suggesting that its integrity is important for semantic processing. However, it remains elusive whether ILF microstructural organization per se impacts the visual semantic processing efficiency in the healthy brain. The present study aims to investigate whether there is an association between ILF’s microstructural organization and visual semantic processing at the individual level. We hypothesized that the efficiency of visual semantic processing positively correlates with the degree of anisotropy of the ILF. We studied 10 healthy right-handed subjects. We determined fractional anisotropy (FA) of the ILF using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We extracted N400m latency and amplitude from magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals during a visual semantic decision task. N400m and mean FA of the ILF were left lateralized with the higher FA value in the left hemisphere. Inter-individual analysis showed that FA of the ILF negatively correlated with the N400m latency and amplitude, which suggests that high ILF anisotropy is associated with more efficient semantic processing. In summary, our findings provide supporting evidence for a role of the ILF in language comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a prevalent long-term neurodegenerative disease. Though the criteria of PD diagnosis are relatively well defined, current diagnostic procedures using medical images are labor-intensive and expertise-demanding. Hence, highly integrated automatic diagnostic algorithms are desirable.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;In this work, we propose an end-to-end multi-modality diagnostic framework, including segmentation, registration, feature extraction and machine learning, to analyze the features of striatum for PD diagnosis. Multi-modality images, including T1-weighted MRI and &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C-CFT PET, are integrated into the proposed framework. The reliability of this method is validated on a dataset with the paired images from 49 PD subjects and 18 Normal (NL) subjects.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;We obtained a promising diagnostic accuracy in the PD/NL classification task. Meanwhile, several comparative experiments were conducted to validate the performance of the proposed framework.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;We demonstrated that (1) the automatic segmentation provides accurate results for the diagnostic framework, (2) the method combining multi-modality images generates a better prediction accuracy than the method with single-modality PET images, and (3) the volume of the striatum is proved to be irrelevant to PD diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00803</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain functioning relies on various segregated/specialized neural regions functioning as an integrated-interconnected network (i.e., metastability). Various psychiatric and neurologic disorders are associated with aberrant functioning of these brain networks. In this study, we present a novel framework integrating the strength and temporal variability of metastability in brain networks. We demonstrate that this approach provides novel mechanistic insights which enables better imaging-based predictions. Using whole-brain resting-state fMRI and a graph-theoretic framework, we integrated strength and temporal-variability of complex-network properties derived from effective connectivity networks, obtained from 87 U.S. Army soldiers consisting of healthy combat controls (n = 28), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; n = 17), and PTSD with comorbid mild-traumatic brain injury (mTBI; n = 42). We identified prefrontal dysregulation of key subcortical and visual regions in PTSD/mTBI, with all network properties exhibiting lower variability over time, indicative of poorer flexibility. Larger impairment in the prefrontal-subcortical pathway but not prefrontal-visual pathway differentiated comorbid PTSD/mTBI from the PTSD group. Network properties of the prefrontal-subcortical pathway also had significant association (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.56) with symptom severity and neurocognitive performance; and were also found to possess high predictive ability (81.4% accuracy in classifying the disorders, explaining 66–72% variance in symptoms), identified through machine learning. Our framework explained 13% more variance in behaviors compared to the conventional framework. These novel insights and better predictions were made possible by our novel framework using static and time-varying network properties in our three-group scenario, advancing the mechanistic understanding of PTSD and comorbid mTBI. Our contribution has wide-ranging applications for network-level characterization of healthy brains as well as mental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00056</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Conscious memories are critically dependent upon bilateral hippocampal formation, and interhemispheric commissural projections made by mossy cells and CA3 pyramidal cells. GABAergic interneurons also make long-range axonal projections, but little is known regarding their commissural, inter-hippocampal connections. We used retrograde and adeno-associated viral tracing, immunofluorescence and electron microscopy, and in vitro optogenetics to assess contralateral projections of neurochemically defined interneuron classes. We found that contralateral-projecting interneurons were 24-fold less common compared to hilar mossy cells, and mostly consisted of somatostatin- and parvalbumin-expressing types. Somatostatin-expressing cells made denser contralateral axonal projections than parvalbumin-expressing cells, although this was typically 10-fold less than the ipsilateral projection density. Somatostatin-expressing cells displayed a topographic-like innervation according to the location of their somata, whereas parvalbumin-expressing cells mostly innervated CA1. In the dentate gyrus molecular layer, commissural interneuron post-synaptic targets were predominantly putative granule cell apical dendrites. In the hilus, varicosities in close vicinity to various interneuron subtypes, as well as mossy cells, were observed, but most contralateral axon varicosities had no adjacent immunolabeled structure. Due to the relative sparsity of the connection and the likely distal dendritic location of their synapses, commissural projections made by interneurons were found to be weak. We postulate that these projections may become functionally active upon intense network activity during tasks requiring increased memory processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Temporal Control of Axonal Transport: The Extreme Case of Organismal Ageing</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00393</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A fundamental question in cell biology is how cellular components are delivered to their destination with spatial and temporal precision within the crowded cytoplasmic environment. The long processes of neurons represent a significant spatial challenge and make these cells particularly dependent on mechanisms for long-range cytoskeletal transport of proteins, RNA and organelles. Although many studies have substantiated a role for defective transport of axonal cargoes in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases, remarkably little is known about how transport is regulated throughout ageing. The scale of the challenge posed by ageing is considerable because, in this case, the temporal regulation of transport is ultimately dictated by the length of organismal lifespan, which can extend to days, years or decades. Recent methodological advances to study live axonal transport during ageing in situ have provided new tools to scratch beneath the surface of this complex problem and revealed that age-dependent decline in the transport of mitochondria is a common feature across different neuronal populations of several model organisms. In certain instances, the molecular pathways that affect transport in ageing animals have begun to emerge. However, the functional implications of these observations are still not fully understood. Whether transport decline is a significant determinant of neuronal ageing or a mere consequence of decreased cellular fitness remains an open question. In this review, we discuss the latest developments in axonal trafficking in the ageing nervous system, along with the early studies that inaugurated this new area of research. We explore the possibility that the interplay between mitochondrial function and motility represents a crucial driver of ageing in neurons and put forward the hypothesis that declining axonal transport may be legitimately considered a hallmark of neuronal ageing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00203</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia which characterized by a progressive loss of memory and cognitive function due to degeneration of synapses and axons. Currently, there is no cure for AD. Deposition of extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and intracellular tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are two hallmark pathologic changes in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients. Autophagy is the major mechanism in cells responsible for removing protein aggregates. Accumulation of immature autophagic vacuoles (AVs) in dystrophic neurites of Alzheimer patients’ brains suggests that autophagy process is disrupted. Till now, it is far from clear what role autophagy plays in AD, a causative role, a protective role, or just a consequence of the disease process itself. To design more effective therapeutic strategies towards this devastating disorder, it is essential to understand the exact role of autophagy played during different stages of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Systems Biology section | New and Recent Articles: Structural Insights Into the Dynamic Evolution of Neuronal Networks as Synaptic Density Decreases</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00892</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The human brain is thought to be an extremely complex but efficient computing engine, processing vast amounts of information from a changing world. The decline in the synaptic density of neuronal networks is one of the most important characteristics of brain development, which is closely related to synaptic pruning, synaptic growth, synaptic plasticity, and energy metabolism. However, because of technical limitations in observing large-scale neuronal networks dynamically connected through synapses, how neuronal networks are organized and evolve as their synaptic density declines remains unclear. Here, by establishing a biologically reasonable neuronal network model, we show that despite a decline in the synaptic density, the connectivity, and efficiency of neuronal networks can be improved. Importantly, by analyzing the degree distribution, we also find that both the scale-free characteristic of neuronal networks and the emergence of hub neurons rely on the spatial distance between neurons. These findings may promote our understanding of neuronal networks in the brain and have guiding significance for the design of neuronal network models.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Accumulation and aggregation of misfolded alpha-synuclein is believed to be a cause of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein at S129 is known to be associated with the pathological misfolding process, but efforts to investigate the relevance of this post-translational modification for pathology have been frustrated by difficulties in detecting and quantifying it in relevant samples. We report novel, ultrasensitive immunoassays based on single-molecule counting technology, useful for detecting alpha-synuclein and its S129 phosphorylated form in clinical samples in the low pg/ml range. Using human CSF and plasma samples, we find levels of alpha-synuclein comparable to those previously reported. However, while alpha-synuclein phosphorylated on S129 could easily be detected in human plasma, where its detection is extremely sensitive to protein phosphatases, its levels in CSF were undetectable, with a possible influence of a matrix effect. In plasma samples from a small test cohort comprising 5 PD individuals and five age-matched control individuals we find that pS129 alpha-synuclein levels are increased in PD plasma samples, in line with previous reports. We conclude that pS129 alpha-synuclein is not detectable in CSF and recommend the addition of phosphatase inhibitors to plasma samples at the time of collection. Moreover, the findings obtained on the small cohort of clinical plasma samples point to plasma pS129 alpha-synuclein levels as a candidate diagnostic biomarker in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00873</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The study of dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) has been important to understand the healthy and diseased brain. Recent developments model groups of functionally related brain structures (defined as functional domains) as entities that can send and receive information. A domain analysis starts by detecting a finite set of connectivity patterns known as domain states within each functional domain. Dynamic functional domain connectivity (DFDC) is a novel information theoretic framework for studying the temporal sequence of the domain states and the amount of information shared among domains. In this setting, the information flow among functional domains can be compared to the flow of bits among entities in a digital network. Schizophrenia is a chronic psychiatric disorder which is associated with how the brain processes information. Here, we employed the DFDC framework to analyze a dataset containing resting-state fMRI scans from 163 healthy controls (HCs) and 151 schizophrenia patients (SZs). As in other information theory methods, this study measured domain state probabilities, entropy within each DFDC and the cross-domain mutual information (CDMI) between pairs of DFDC. Results indicate that SZs show significantly higher (transformed) entropy than HCs in subcortical (SC)-SC; default mode network (DMN)-visual (VIS) and frontoparietal (FRN)-VIS DFDCs. SZs also show lower (transformed) CDMI between SC-VIS vs. SC-sensorimotor (SM), attention (ATTN)-VIS vs. ATTN-SM and ATTN-SM vs. ATTN-ATTN DFDC pairs after correcting for multiple comparisons. These results imply that different DFDC pairs function in a more independent manner in SZs compared to HCs. Our findings present evidence of higher uncertainty and randomness in SZ brain function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Exploring the Phase-Locking Mechanisms Yielding Delayed and Anticipated Synchronization in Neuronal Circuits</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00041</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Synchronization is one of the brain mechanisms allowing the coordination of neuronal activity required in many cognitive tasks. Anticipated Synchronization (AS) is a specific type of out-of-phase synchronization that occurs when two systems are unidirectionally coupled and, consequently, the information is transmitted from the sender to the receiver, but the receiver leads the sender in time. It has been shown that the primate cortex could operate in a regime of AS as part of normal neurocognitive function. However it is still unclear what is the mechanism that gives rise to anticipated synchronization in neuronal motifs. Here, we investigate the synchronization properties of cortical motifs on multiple scales and show that the internal dynamics of the receiver, which is related to its free running frequency in the uncoupled situation, is the main ingredient for AS to occur. For biologically plausible parameters, including excitation/inhibition balance, we found that the phase difference between the sender and the receiver decreases when the free running frequency of the receiver increases. As a consequence, the system switches from the usual delayed synchronization (DS) regime to an AS regime. We show that at three different scales, neuronal microcircuits, spiking neuronal populations and neural mass models, both the inhibitory loop and the external current acting on the receiver mediate the DS-AS transition for the sender-receiver configuration by changing the free running frequency of the receiver. Therefore, we propose that a faster internal dynamics of the receiver system is the main mechanism underlying anticipated synchronization in brain circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00040</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A key question in systems neuroscience is to identify how sensory stimuli are represented in neuronal activity, and how the activity of sensory neurons in turn is “read out” by downstream neurons and give rise to behavior. The choice of a proper model system to address these questions, is therefore a crucial step. Over the past decade, the increasingly powerful array of experimental approaches that has become available in non-primate models (e.g., optogenetics and two-photon imaging) has spurred a renewed interest for the use of rodent models in systems neuroscience research. Here, I introduce the rodent whisker-mediated touch system as a structurally well-established and well-organized model system which, despite its simplicity, gives rise to complex behaviors. This system serves as a behaviorally efficient model system; known as nocturnal animals, along with their olfaction, rodents rely on their whisker-mediated touch system to collect information about their surrounding environment. Moreover, this system represents a well-studied circuitry with a somatotopic organization. At every stage of processing, one can identify anatomical and functional topographic maps of whiskers; “barrelettes” in the brainstem nuclei, “barreloids” in the sensory thalamus, and “barrels” in the cortex. This article provides a brief review on the basic anatomy and function of the whisker system in rodents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Physiological studies documented highly specific corticofugal modulations making subcortical centers focus processing on sounds that the auditory cortex (AC) has experienced to be important. Here, we show the effects of focal conditioning (FC) of the primary auditory cortex (FC&lt;sub&gt;AI&lt;/sub&gt;) on auditory brainstem response (ABR) amplitudes and latencies in house mice. FC&lt;sub&gt;AI&lt;/sub&gt; significantly increased ABR peak amplitudes (peaks I–V), decreased thresholds, and shortened peak latencies in responses to the frequency tuned by conditioned cortical neurons. The amounts of peak amplitude increases and latency decreases were specific for each processing level up to the auditory midbrain. The data provide new insights into possible corticofugal modulation of inner hair cell synapses and new corticofugal effects as neuronal enhancement of processing in the superior olivary complex (SOC) and lateral lemniscus (LL). Thus, our comprehensive ABR approach confirms the role of the AC as instructor of lower auditory levels and extends this role specifically to the cochlea, SOC, and LL. The whole pathway from the cochlea to the inferior colliculus appears, in a common mode, instructed in a very similar way.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00038</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent investigations of the rat posterior parietal cortex (PPC) suggest that this region plays a central role in action control together with the frontal cortical areas. Posterior parietal-frontal cortical connections have been described in rats, but little is known about whether these connections are topographically organized as in the primate. Here, we injected retrograde and anterograde tracers into subdivisions of PPC as well as the frontal midline and orbital cortical areas to explore possible topographies within their connections. We found that PPC projects to several frontal cortical areas, largely reciprocating the densest input received from the same areas. All PPC subdivisions are strongly connected with the secondary motor cortex (M2) in a topographically organized manner. The medial subdivision (medial posterior parietal cortex, mPPC) has a dense reciprocal connection with the most caudal portion of M2 (cM2), whereas the lateral subdivision (lateral posterior parietal cortex, lPPC) and the caudolateral subdivision (PtP) are reciprocally connected with the intermediate rostrocaudal portion of M2 (iM2). Sparser reciprocal connections were seen with anterior cingulate area 24b. mPPC connects with rostral, and lPPC and PtP connect with caudal parts of 24b, respectively. There are virtually no connections with area 24a, nor with prelimbic or infralimbic cortex. PPC and orbitofrontal cortices are also connected, showing a gradient such that mPPC entertains reciprocal connections mainly with the ventral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), whereas lPPC and PtP are preferentially connected with medial and central portions of ventrolateral OFC, respectively. Our results thus indicate that the connections of PPC with frontal cortices are organized in a topographical fashion, supporting functional heterogeneity within PPC and frontal cortices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Speeding drug discovery may result from the judicious development and application of biomarker measures of brain function to select patients for clinical trials, to confirm target engagement and to optimize drug dose. For neurodevelopmental disorders, electrophysiology (EEG) offers considerable promise because of its ability to monitor brain activity with high temporal resolution and its more ready application for pediatric populations relative to MRI. Here, we discuss conceptual/definitional issues related to biomarker development, discuss practical implementation issues, and suggest preliminary guidelines for validating EEG approaches as biomarkers with a context of use in neurodevelopmental disorder drug development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Involvement of Descending Pain Inhibitory System in Electroacupuncture-Induced Analgesia</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00038</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chronic pain is a major health problem, which can impair quality of life and reduce productivity. Electroacupuncture (EA), a modality of medicine based on the theories of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), presents great therapeutic effects on chronic pain. Its clinical application has gained increasing popularity, and in parallel, more research has been performed on the mechanisms of EA-induced analgesia. The past decades have seen enormous advances both in neuronal circuitry of needle-insertion and in its molecular mechanism. EA may block pain by activating the descending pain inhibitory system, which originates in the brainstem and terminates at the spinal cord. This review article synthesizes corresponding studies to elucidate how EA alleviate pain via the mediation of this descending system. Much emphasis has been put on the implication of descending serotonergic and noradrenergic pathways in the process of pain modulation. Also, other important transmitters and supraspinal regions related to analgesic effects of EA have been demonstrated. Finally, it should be noticed that there exist some shortcomings involved in the animal experimental designed for EA, which account for conflicting results obtained by different studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Serial Metabolic Evaluation of Perihematomal Tissues in the Intracerebral Hemorrhage Pig Model</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00888</link>
	<content:encoded>Purpose&lt;p&gt;Perihematomal edema (PHE) occurs in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and is often used as surrogate of secondary brain injury. PHE resolves over time, but little is known about the functional integrity of the tissues that recover from edema. In a pig ICH model, we aimed to assess metabolic integrity of perihematoma tissues by using non-invasive magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).&lt;/p&gt;Materials and Methods&lt;p&gt;Fourteen male Yorkshire pigs with an average age of 8 weeks were intracerebrally injected with autologous blood to produce ICH. Proton MRS data were obtained at 1, 7, and 14 days after ICH using a whole-body 3.0T MRI system. Point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS)-localized 2D chemical shift imaging (CSI) was acquired. The concentration of N-Acetylaspartate (NAA), Choline (Cho), and Creatine (Cr) were measured within the area of PHE, tissues adjacent to the injury with no or negligible edema (ATNE), and contralesional brain tissue. A linear mixed model was used to analyze the evolution of metabolites in perihematomal tissues, with p-value &amp;lt; 0.05 indicating statistical significance.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The perihematoma volume gradually decreased from 2.38 ± 1.23 ml to 0.41 ± 0.780 ml (p &amp;lt; 0.001) over 2 weeks. Significant (p &amp;lt; 0.001) reductions in NAA, Cr, and Cho concentrations were found in the PHE and ATNE regions compared to the contralesional hemisphere at day 1 and 7 after ICH. All three metabolites were significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.001) restored in the PHE tissue on day 14, but remained persistently low in the ATNE area, and unaltered in the contralesional voxel.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This study highlights the potential of MRS to probe salvageable tissues within the perihematoma in the sub-acute phase of ICH. Altered metabolites within the PHE and ATNE regions in addition to edema and hematoma volumes were explored as possible markers for tissue recovery. Perihematomal tissue with PHE demonstrated a more reversible injury compared to the tissue adjacent to the injury without edema, suggesting a potentially beneficial role of edema.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00871</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The profile of 122 metabolites in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients suffering from Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and controls was studied. Among the 122 metabolites analyzed, 61 could be detected. Statistically significant differences between the AD and control group were only detected for metabolites of the glycolysis. Thus, accurate quantification of 11 glycolytic metabolites was done. We detected a significant reduction of five of them, namely phosphoenolpyruvate, 2-phosphoglycerate, 3-phosphoglycerate, pyruvate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate in the AD CSF compared to controls. These results correlate with the known reduction of glucose metabolism in the brain of patients with AD and indicate that metabolic analysis of the central carbon metabolism can be a potential tool in AD diagnostic. Although the Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses of the metabolites do not reach the level of the diagnostic informativity of AD biomarkers, the combination of specific glycolysis metabolites with the established biomarkers may lead to an improvement in sensitivity and specificity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Synaptic computation is believed to underlie many forms of animal behavior. A correct identification of synaptic transmission properties is thus crucial for a better understanding of how the brain processes information, stores memories and learns. Recently, a number of new statistical methods for inferring synaptic transmission parameters have been introduced. Here we review and contrast these developments, with a focus on methods aimed at inferring both synaptic release statistics and synaptic dynamics. Furthermore, based on recent proposals we discuss how such methods can be applied to data across different levels of investigation: from intracellular paired experiments to in vivo network-wide recordings. Overall, these developments open the window to reliably estimating synaptic parameters in behaving animals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Development of Efficient AAV2/DJ-Based Viral Vectors to Selectively Downregulate the Expression of Neuronal or Astrocytic Target Proteins in the Rat Central Nervous System</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00201</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Viral vectors have become very popular to overexpress or downregulate proteins of interest in different cell types. They conveniently allow the precise targeting of well-defined tissue areas, which is particularly useful in complex organs like the brain. In theory, each vector should have its own cell specificity that can be obtained by using different strategies (e.g., using a cell-specific promoter). For the moment, there is few vectors that have been developed to alternatively target, using the same capsid, neurons and astrocytes in the central nervous system. There is even fewer examples of adeno-associated viral vectors able to efficiently transduce cells both in vitro and in vivo. The development of viral vectors allowing the cell-specific downregulation of a protein in cultured cells of the central nervous system as well as in vivo within a large brain area would be highly desirable to address several important questions in neurobiology. Here we report that the use of the AAV2/DJ viral vector associated to an hybrid CMV/chicken β-actin promoter (CBA) or to a modified form of the glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter (G1B3) allows a specific transduction of neurons or astrocytes in more than half of the barrel field within the rat somatosensory cortex. Moreover, the use of the miR30E-shRNA technology led to an efficient downregulation of two proteins of interest related to metabolism both in vitro and in vivo. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to downregulate the expression of different protein isoforms in a cell-specific manner using a common serotype. It is proposed that such an approach could be extended to other cell types and used to target several proteins of interest within the same brain area.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Hydrogen Sulfide Inhibits High Glucose-Induced Neuronal Senescence by Improving Autophagic Flux via Up-regulation of SIRT1</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00194</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hyperglycemia, a key characteristic and risk factor for diabetes mellitus (DM), causes neuronal senescence. Hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) is a novel neuroprotectant. The present work was to investigate the potential effect of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S on hyperglycemia-induced neuronal senescence and the underlying mechanisms. We found that NaHS, a donor of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, inhibited high glucose (HG)-induced cellular senescence in HT22 cells (an immortalized mouse hippocampal cell line), as evidenced by a decrease in the number of senescence associated-β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) positive cells, increase in the growth of cells, and down-regulations of senescence mark proteins, p16&lt;sup&gt;INK4a&lt;/sup&gt; and p21&lt;sup&gt;CIP1&lt;/sup&gt;. NaHS improved the autophagic flux, which is judged by a decrease in the amount of intracellular autophagosome as well as up-regulations of LC3II/I and P62 in HG-exposed HT22 cells. Furthermore, blocked autophagic flux by chloroquine (CQ) significantly abolished NaHS-exerted improvement in the autophagic flux and suppression in the cellular senescence of GH-exposed HT22 cells, which indicated that H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S antagonizes HG-induced neuronal senescence by promoting autophagic flux. We also found that NaHS up-regulated the expression of silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1), an important anti-aging protein, in HG-exposed HT22 cells. Furthermore, inhibition of SIRT1 by sirtinol reversed the protection of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S against HG-induced autophagic flux blockade and cellular senescence in HT22 cells. These data indicated that H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S protects HT22 cells against HG-induced neuronal senescence by improving autophagic flux via up-regulation of SIRT1, suggesting H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S as a potential treatment strategy for hyperglycemia-induced neuronal senescence and neurotoxicity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00044</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Blindness is an ideal condition to study the role of visual input on the development of spatial representation, as studies have shown how audio space representation reorganizes in blindness. However, how spatial reorganization works is still unclear. A limitation of the study on blindness is that it is a “stable” system and it does not allow for studying the mechanisms that subtend the progress of this reorganization. To overcome this problem here we study, for the first time, audio spatial reorganization in 18 adults with macular degeneration (MD) for which the loss of vision due to scotoma is an ongoing progressive process. Our results show that the loss of vision produces immediate changes in the processing of spatial audio signals. In individuals with MD, the lateral sounds are “attracted” toward the central scotoma position resulting in a strong bias in the spatial auditory percept. This result suggests that the reorganization of audio space representation is a fast and plastic process occurring also later in life, after vision loss.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Learning and memorizing sequences of events is an important function of the human brain and the basis for forming expectations and making predictions. Learning is facilitated by repeating a sequence several times, causing rhythmic appearance of the individual sequence elements. This observation invites to consider the resulting multitude of rhythms as a spectral “fingerprint” which characterizes the respective sequence. Here we explore the implications of this perspective by developing a neurobiologically plausible computational model which captures this “fingerprint” by attuning an ensemble of neural oscillators. In our model, this attuning process is based on a number of oscillatory phenomena that have been observed in electrophysiological recordings of brain activity like synchronization, phase locking, and reset as well as cross-frequency coupling. We compare the learning properties of the model with behavioral results from a study in human participants and observe good agreement of the errors for different levels of complexity of the sequence to be memorized. Finally, we suggest an extension of the model for processing sequences that extend over several sensory modalities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00039</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Animal communication plays an essential role in triggering diverse behaviors. It is believed in this regard that signal production by a sender and its perception by a receiver is co-evolving in order to have beneficial effects such as to ensure that conspecifics remain sensitive to these signals. However, in order to give appropriate responses to a communication signal, the receiver has to first detect and interpret it in a meaningful way. The detection of communication signals can be limited under some circumstances, for example when the signal is masked by the background noise in which it occurs (e.g., the cocktail-party problem). Moreover, some signals are very alike despite having different meanings making it hard to discriminate between them. How the central nervous system copes with these tasks and problems is a central question in systems neuroscience. Gymnotiform weakly electric fish pose an interesting system to answer these questions for various reasons: (1) they use a variety of communication signals called “chirps” during different behavioral encounters; (2) the central physiology of the electrosensory system is well known; and (3) most importantly, these fish give reliable behavioral responses to artificial stimuli that resemble natural communication signals, making it possible to uncover the neural mechanisms that lead to the observed behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Humans and animals can learn to order a list of items without relying on explicit spatial or temporal cues. To do so, they appear to make use of transitivity, a property of all ordered sets. Here, we summarize relevant research on the transitive inference (TI) paradigm and its relationship to learning the underlying order of an arbitrary set of items. We compare six computational models of TI performance, three of which are model-free (Q-learning, Value Transfer, and REMERGE) and three of which are model-based (RL-Elo, Sequential Monte Carlo, and Betasort). Our goal is to assess the ability of these models to produce empirically observed features of TI behavior. Model-based approaches perform better under a wider range of scenarios, but no single model explains the full scope of behaviors reported in the TI literature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator that mainly exists in the nervous system. It plays a neuroprotective role in organisms and widely participates in the regulation of various physiological processes in vivo. Studies in both humans and animal models have been revealed that NPY levels are altered in some neurodegenerative and neuroimmune disorders. NPY plays various roles in these diseases, such as exerting a neuroprotective effect, increasing trophic support, decreasing excitotoxicity, regulating calcium homeostasis, and attenuating neuroinflammation. In this review, we will focus on the roles of NPY in the pathological mechanisms of neurodegenerative and neuroimmune diseases, highlighting NPY as a potential therapeutic target in these diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00864</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cessation of blood flow leads to a complex cascade of pathophysiological events at the blood-vascular-parenchymal interface which evolves over time and space, and results in damage to neural cells and edema formation. Cerebral ischemic injury evokes a profound and deleterious upregulation in inflammation and triggers multiple cell death pathways, but it also induces a series of the events associated with regenerative responses, including vascular remodeling, angiogenesis, and neurogenesis. Emerging evidence suggests that epigenetic reprograming could play a pivotal role in ongoing post-stroke neurovascular unit (NVU) changes and recovery. This review summarizes current knowledge about post-stroke recovery processes at the NVU, as well as epigenetic mechanisms and modifiers (e.g., DNA methylation, histone modifying enzymes and microRNAs) associated with stroke injury, and NVU repair. It also discusses novel drug targets and therapeutic strategies for enhancing post-stroke recovery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: The Benefit of Slice Timing Correction in Common fMRI Preprocessing Pipelines</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00821</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Due to the nature of fMRI acquisition protocols, slices cannot be acquired simultaneously, and as a result, are temporally misaligned from each other. To correct from this misalignment, preprocessing pipelines often incorporate slice timing correction (STC). However, evaluating the benefits of STC is challenging because it (1) is dependent on slice acquisition parameters, (2) interacts with head movement in a non-linear fashion, and (3) significantly changes with other preprocessing steps, fMRI experimental design, and fMRI acquisition parameters. Presently, the interaction of STC with various scan conditions has not been extensively examined. Here, we examine the effect of STC when it is applied with various other preprocessing steps such as motion correction (MC), motion parameter residualization (MPR), and spatial smoothing. Using 180 simulated and 30 real fMRI data, we quantitatively demonstrate that the optimal order in which STC should be applied depends on interleave parameters and motion level. We also demonstrate the benefit STC on sub-second-TR scans and for functional connectivity analysis. We conclude that STC is a critical part of the preprocessing pipeline that can be extremely beneficial for fMRI processing. However, its effectiveness interacts with other preprocessing steps and with other scan parameters and conditions which may obscure its significant importance in the fMRI processing pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00820</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has shown great promise as a medical treatment of depression. The effectiveness of TMS treatment at high frequency has been well investigated; however, low-frequency TMS in depression treatment has rarely been investigated in depression-induced cognitive deficits. Herein, this study was carried out to assess the possible modulatory role of low-frequency pulsed magnetic field (LFPMF) on reversing cognitive impairment in a model of depression induced by chronic unpredictable stress (CUS). Wistar rats were randomly allocated into four groups as follows: a control group (CON), a control applied with LFPMF (CON + LFPMF), a CUS group, and a CUS treated with LFPMF (CUS + LFPMF) group. During 8 weeks of CUS, compared to those in the CON group, animals not only gained less weight but also exhibited anhedonia, anxiety, and cognitive decline in behavioral tests. After 2-week treatment of LFPMF, a 20 mT, 1 Hz magnetic stimulation, it reversed the impairment of spatial cognition as well as hippocampal synaptic function including long-term potentiation and related protein expression. Thus, LFPMF has shown effectively improvements on depressant behavior and cognitive dysfunction in CUS rats, possibly via regulating synaptic function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00808</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Closed-loop or intelligent neuromodulation allows adjustable, personalized neuromodulation which usually incorporates the recording of a biomarker, followed by implementation of an algorithm which decides the timing (when?) and strength (how much?) of stimulation. Closed-loop neuromodulation has been shown to have greater benefits compared to open-loop neuromodulation, particularly for therapeutic applications such as pharmacoresistant epilepsy, movement disorders and potentially for psychological disorders such as depression or drug addiction. However, an important aspect of the technique is selection of an appropriate, preferably neural biomarker. Neurochemical sensing can provide high resolution biomarker monitoring for various neurological disorders as well as offer deeper insight into neurological mechanisms. The chemicals of interest being measured, could be ions such as potassium (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), sodium (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), chloride (Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), hydrogen (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) or neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin and glutamate. This review focusses on the different building blocks necessary for a neurochemical, closed-loop neuromodulation system including biomarkers, sensors and data processing algorithms. Furthermore, it also highlights the merits and drawbacks of using this biomarker modality.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00785</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is associated with the processing of negative emotions. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) metabolism plays an important role in the pathogenesis of mental disorders. We aimed to determine the changes in GABA levels in the ACC of perimenopausal women with depression.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We recruited 120 perimenopausal women, who were followed up for 18–24 months. After reaching menopause, the participants were divided into a control group (n = 71), an anxiety group (n = 30), and a depression group (n = 19). The participants were examined using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). TARQUIN software was used to calculate the GABA concentrations in the ACC before and after menopause. The relationship of the GABA levels with the patients’ scores on the 14-item Hamilton Anxiety Scale and 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale was determined.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;GABA decreased with time. The postmenopausal GABA levels were significantly lower in the depression group than in the anxiety group and were significantly lower in both these groups than in the normal group. The postmenopausal GABA levels were significantly lower than the premenopausal levels in the normal, anxiety, and depression groups (P = 0.014, &amp;lt;0.001, and &amp;lt;0.001, respectively). The premenopausal GABA levels did not significantly differ between the normal vs. anxiety group (P = 0.907), normal vs. depression group (P = 0.495), and anxiety vs. depression group. The postmenopausal GABA levels were significantly lower in the depression group than in the anxiety group and were significantly lower in both these groups than in the normal group, normal vs. anxiety group (P = 0.022), normal vs. depression group (P &amp;lt; 0.001), and anxiety vs. depression group (P = 0.047).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Changes in GABA concentrations in the anterior cingulate cortex are related with the pathophysiological mechanism and symptoms of perimenopausal depression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Multi-method Fusion of Cross-Subject Emotion Recognition Based on High-Dimensional EEG Features</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00053</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Emotion recognition using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals has attracted significant research attention. However, it is difficult to improve the emotional recognition effect across subjects. In response to this difficulty, in this study, multiple features were extracted for the formation of high-dimensional features. Based on the high-dimensional features, an effective method for cross-subject emotion recognition was then developed, which integrated the significance test/sequential backward selection and the support vector machine (ST-SBSSVM). The effectiveness of the ST-SBSSVM was validated on a dataset for emotion analysis using physiological signals (DEAP) and the SJTU Emotion EEG Dataset (SEED). With respect to high-dimensional features, the ST-SBSSVM average improved the accuracy of cross-subject emotion recognition by 12.4% on the DEAP and 26.5% on the SEED when compared with common emotion recognition methods. The recognition accuracy obtained using ST-SBSSVM was as high as that obtained using sequential backward selection (SBS) on the DEAP dataset. However, on the SEED dataset, the recognition accuracy increased by ~6% using ST-SBSSVM from that using the SBS. Using the ST-SBSSVM, ~97% (DEAP) and 91% (SEED) of the program runtime was eliminated when compared with the SBS. Compared with recent similar works, the method developed in this study for emotion recognition across all subjects was found to be effective, and its accuracy was 72% (DEAP) and 89% (SEED).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: Three-Dimensional Segmentation and Reconstruction of Neuronal Nuclei in Confocal Microscopic Images</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2019.00081</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The detailed architectural examination of the neuronal nuclei in any brain region, using confocal microscopy, requires quantification of fluorescent signals in three-dimensional stacks of confocal images. An essential prerequisite to any quantification is the segmentation of the nuclei which are typically tightly packed in the tissue, the extreme being the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), in which nuclei frequently appear to overlap due to limitations in microscope resolution. Segmentation in DG is a challenging task due to the presence of a significant amount of image artifacts and densely packed nuclei. Accordingly, we established an algorithm based on continuous boundary tracing criterion aiming to reconstruct the nucleus surface and to separate the adjacent nuclei. The presented algorithm neither uses a pre-built nucleus model, nor performs image thresholding, which makes it robust against variations in image intensity and poor contrast. Further, the reconstructed surface is used to study morphology and spatial arrangement of the nuclear interior. The presented method is generally dedicated to segmentation of crowded, overlapping objects in 3D space. In particular, it allows us to study quantitatively the architecture of the neuronal nucleus using confocal-microscopic approach.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: Fast 3-D Imaging of Brain Organoids With a New Single-Objective Planar-Illumination Two-Photon Microscope</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2019.00077</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human inducible pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) hold a large potential for disease modeling. hiPSC-derived human astrocyte and neuronal cultures permit investigations of neural signaling pathways with subcellular resolution. Combinatorial cultures, and three-dimensional (3-D) embryonic bodies (EBs) enlarge the scope of investigations to multi-cellular phenomena. The highest level of complexity, brain organoids that—in many aspects—recapitulate anatomical and functional features of the developing brain permit the study of developmental and morphological aspects of human disease. An ideal microscope for 3-D tissue imaging at these different scales would combine features from both confocal laser-scanning and light-sheet microscopes: a micrometric optical sectioning capacity and sub-micrometric spatial resolution, a large field of view and high frame rate, and a low degree of invasiveness, i.e., ideally, a better photon efficiency than that of a confocal microscope. In the present work, we describe such an instrument that uses planar two-photon (2P) excitation. Its particularity is that—unlike two- or three-lens light-sheet microscopes—it uses a single, low-magnification, high-numerical aperture objective for the generation and scanning of a virtual light sheet. The microscope builds on a modified Nipkow-Petráň spinning-disk scheme for achieving wide-field excitation. However, unlike the Yokogawa design that uses a tandem disk, our concept combines micro lenses, dichroic mirrors and detection pinholes on a single disk. This new design, advantageous for 2P excitation, circumvents problems arising with the tandem disk from the large wavelength difference between the infrared excitation light and visible fluorescence. 2P fluorescence excited by the light sheet is collected with the same objective and imaged onto a fast sCMOS camera. We demonstrate 3-D imaging of TO-PRO3-stained EBs and of brain organoids, uncleared and after rapid partial transparisation with triethanolamine formamide (RTF) and we compare the performance of our instrument to that of a confocal laser-scanning microscope (CLSM) having a similar numerical aperture. Our large-field 2P-spinning disk microscope permits one order of magnitude faster imaging, affords less photobleaching and permits better depth penetration than a confocal microscope with similar spatial resolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Inhibitory control matures through adolescence and into early adulthood, impacting decision-making. Impairments in inhibitory control are associated with various psychopathologies, many of which emerge during adolescence. In this review, we examine the neural basis of developmental improvements in inhibitory control by integrating findings from humans and non-human primates, identifying the structural and functional specialization of executive brain systems that mediates cognitive maturation. Behavioral manifestations of response inhibition suggest that adolescents are capable of producing adult level responses on occasion, but lack the ability to engage systems mediating response inhibition in a consistent fashion.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: To assist clinicians to operate repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) precisely based on the coil magnetic field spatial distribution with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Navigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A fast method for calculating electromagnetic fields in layered brain structures in frequency domain was proposed. By approaching Bessel function in different intervals, the integral with a highly oscillatory kernel was transformed into two parts: a definite integral and a weakened oscillatory one. The distribution of induced current density and magnetic field intensity of rTMS stimulation effect on brain was quantitatively calculated, so that clinicians could intuitively grasp the safe range of coil stimulation on the brain. Then, the crucial factor of the stimulation effect of rTMS was determined, and an accurate coil positioning of the rTMS efficiently was completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Result: The maximal attenuation of induced electric field and magnetic induction intensity was 72.20 and 86.867% at 3 cm away from the skin in the brain layered model. The clinical examination results of electric field intensity distribution, magnetic field intensity distribution, current density distribution, layered brain modeling, and coil location speed in the brain model teaching group were significantly higher than those in the traditional teaching group (P &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: It is suitable for clinicians to quickly complete the precise positioning of rTMS, master the adjustment of coil stimulation therapeutic parameters, and realize the precise positioning operation of rTMS with MRI navigation in intracranial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR1800018616); Registered on 30th September 2018&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Preparing for the Worst: Evidence that Older Adults Proactively Downregulate Negative Affect</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Previous studies have only investigated age-related differences in emotional processing and encoding in response to, not in anticipation of, emotional stimuli. In the current study, we investigated age-related differences in the impact of emotional anticipation on affective responses and episodic memory for emotional images. Young and older adults were scanned while encoding negative and neutral images preceded by cues that were either valid or invalid predictors of image valence. Participants were asked to rate the emotional intensity of the images and to complete a recognition task. Using multivariate behavioral partial least squares (PLS) analysis, we found that greater anticipatory recruitment of the amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), and hippocampus in older adults predicted reduced memory for negative than neutral images and the opposite for young adults. Seed PLS analysis further showed that following negative cues older adults, but not young adults, exhibited greater activation of vmPFC, reduced activation of amygdala, and worse memory for negative compared with neutral images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide evidence that the “positivity effect” seen in older adults’ memory performance may be related to the spontaneous emotional suppression of negative affect in anticipation of, not just in response to, negative stimuli.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Understanding the molecular function of MeCP2 will not only provide insights into the pathogenesis of MeCP2-related disorders, but will also shed light on the epigenetic regulation of neuronal function. In the past few years, a number of studies have provided mechanistic evidence that MeCP2 recruits co-repressor complexes to particular sequences of methylated DNA. Additionally, innovative design and high-throughput sequencing technologies have provided opportunities to study the effects of MeCP2 on the neuronal transcriptome at an unprecedented level of detail, demonstrating that MeCP2 modulates gene expression in a context-specific manner. These findings have raised new questions and challenged current models of MeCP2 function. In this review, we describe several recent developments, highlight future challenges, and articulate a model by which MeCP2 functions as an organizer of chromatin architecture to modulate global gene expression in the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

Recent developments in neural recording technologies are providing unprecedented access to the activity of such populations during increasingly complex experimental contexts; however, extracting scientific insights from such recordings requires the concurrent development of analytical tools that relate this population activity to system-level function. This is a primary motivation for latent variable models, which seek to provide a low-dimensional description of population activity that can be related to experimentally controlled variables, as well as uncontrolled variables such as internal states (e.g. attention and arousal) and elements of behavior. While deriving an understanding of function from traditional latent variable methods relies on low-dimensional visualizations, new approaches are targeting more interpretable descriptions of the components underlying system-level function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Gliomas are the most common primary brain malignancies. Accurate and robust tumor segmentation and prediction of patients' overall survival are important for diagnosis, treatment planning and risk factor identification. Here we present a deep learning-based framework for brain tumor segmentation and survival prediction in glioma, using multimodal MRI scans. For tumor segmentation, we use ensembles of three different 3D CNN architectures for robust performance through a majority rule. This approach can effectively reduce model bias and boost performance. For survival prediction, we extract 4,524 radiomic features from segmented tumor regions, then, a decision tree and cross validation are used to select potent features. Finally, a random forest model is trained to predict the overall survival of patients. The 2018 MICCAI Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BraTS), ranks our method at 2nd and 5th place out of 60+ participating teams for survival prediction tasks and segmentation tasks respectively, achieving a promising 61.0% accuracy on the classification of short-survivors, mid-survivors and long-survivors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: October 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 58&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Alexandre Payeur, Jean-Claude Béïque, Richard Naud&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dendrites are much more than passive neuronal components. Mounting experimental evidence and decades of computational work have decisively shown that dendrites leverage a host of nonlinear biophysical phenomena and actively participate in sophisticated computations, at the level of the single neuron and at the level of the network. However, a coherent view of their processing power is still lacking and dendrites are largely neglected in neural network models. Here, we describe four classes of dendritic information processing and delineate their implications at the algorithmic level. We propose that beyond the well-known spatiotemporal filtering of their inputs, dendrites are capable of selecting, routing and multiplexing information. By separating dendritic processing from axonal outputs, neuron networks gain a degree of freedom with implications for perception and learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>
