	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Testing display suitability for presenting mean-modulated flicker in clinical assessment and experimental studies of visual systems. (arXiv:2007.11151v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11151</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mean-modulated flicker -- wherein luminance increments and decrements of
equal magnitude are applied, over time, to a test field -- is commonly used in
both clinical assessment of vision and experimental studies of visual systems.
However, presenting mean-modulated flicker on computer-controlled displays is
problematic; displays typically introduce luminance artifacts to flickering
stimuli, especially at high flicker frequency or contrast, potentially
interfering with the validity of findings. Here, we present a battery of tests
that we used to judge the suitability of displays for presenting mean-modulated
flicker. These tests revealed marked differences between a new high-performance
liquid-crystal display (LCD; EIZO ColorEdge CG247X) and a new consumer-grade
LCD (Dell U2415b), despite the displays' vendor-supplied specifications being
almost identical. We measured displayed luminance using a spot meter, and a
linearized photodiode device to record displayed luminance waveforms. We
derived spatial uniformity, response times, Fourier amplitude spectra,
cycle-averaged luminance, and root-mean-squared luminance. We presented paired
luminance pulses to quantify the displays' nonlinear dynamics. The CG247X
showed relatively good spatial uniformity. Fourier transformation of nominally
static test patches revealed spectra free of artifacts, with the exception of a
frame response (artifactual flicker related to the display refresh). The
CG247X's response times depended on both source and destination luminance.
Despite this nonlinear behaviour, we were able to define a contrast and
frequency range wherein the CG247X was artifact-free, that is, the relationship
between nominal luminance and displayed luminance was accurately modelled using
a causal, linear time-invariant system. This range included contrasts up to
80%, and flicker frequencies up to 30 Hz.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Bounding the expected run-time of nonconvex optimization with early stopping. (arXiv:2002.08856v4 [math.OC] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08856</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This work examines the convergence of stochastic gradient-based optimization
algorithms that use early stopping based on a validation function. The form of
early stopping we consider is that optimization terminates when the norm of the
gradient of a validation function falls below a threshold. We derive conditions
that guarantee this stopping rule is well-defined, and provide bounds on the
expected number of iterations and gradient evaluations needed to meet this
criterion. The guarantee accounts for the distance between the training and
validation sets, measured with the Wasserstein distance. We develop the
approach in the general setting of a first-order optimization algorithm, with
possibly biased update directions subject to a geometric drift condition. We
then derive bounds on the expected running time for early stopping variants of
several algorithms, including stochastic gradient descent (SGD), decentralized
SGD (DSGD), and the stochastic variance reduced gradient (SVRG) algorithm.
Finally, we consider the generalization properties of the iterate returned by
early stopping.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Biologically Inspired Visual System Architecture for Object Recognition in Autonomous Systems. (arXiv:2002.03472v2 [eess.IV] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03472</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Findings in recent years on the sensitivity of convolutional neural networks
to additive noise, light conditions and to the wholeness of the training
dataset, indicate that this technology still lacks the robustness needed for
the autonomous robotic industry. In an attempt to bring computer vision
algorithms closer to the capabilities of a human operator, the mechanisms of
the human visual system was analyzed in this work. Recent studies show that the
mechanisms behind the recognition process in the human brain include continuous
generation of predictions based on prior knowledge of the world. These
predictions enable rapid generation of contextual hypotheses that bias the
outcome of the recognition process. This mechanism is especially advantageous
in situations of uncertainty, when visual input is ambiguous. In addition, the
human visual system continuously updates its knowledge about the world based on
the gaps between its prediction and the visual feedback. Convolutional neural
networks are feed forward in nature and lack such top-down contextual
attenuation mechanisms. As a result, although they process massive amounts of
visual information during their operation, the information is not transformed
into knowledge that can be used to generate contextual predictions and improve
their performance. In this work, an architecture was designed that aims to
integrate the concepts behind the top-down prediction and learning processes of
the human visual system with the state of the art bottom-up object recognition
models, e.g., deep convolutional neural networks. The work focuses on two
mechanisms of the human visual system: anticipation-driven perception and
reinforcement-driven learning. Imitating these top-down mechanisms, together
with the state of the art bottom-up feed-forward algorithms, resulted in an
accurate, robust, and continuously improving target recognition model.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Essential Motor Cortex Signal Processing: an ERP and functional connectivity MATLAB toolbox -- user guide version 2.0. (arXiv:1907.02862v2 [eess.SP] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02862</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this document is to help individuals use the &quot;Essential Motor
Cortex Signal Processing MATLAB Toolbox&quot;. The toolbox implements various
methods for three major aspects of investigating human motor cortex from
Neuroscience view point: (1) ERP estimation and quantification, (2) Cortical
Functional Connectivity analysis and (3) EMG quantification. The toolbox --
which is distributed under the terms of the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE as a set
of MATLAB R routines -- can be downloaded directly at the address:
&lt;a href=&quot;http://oset.ir/category.php?dir=Tools&quot;&gt;this http URL&lt;/a&gt; or from the public repository on GitHub,
at address below: https://github.com/EsiSeraj/ERP Connectivity EMG Analysis
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this toolbox is threefold: 1. Extract the
event-related-potential (ERP) from preprocessed cerebral signals (i.e. EEG,
MEG, etc.), identify and then quantify the event-related

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Altered Pallidocortical Low-Beta Oscillations During Self-Initiated Movements in Parkinson Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00054</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Parkinson disease (PD) patients have difficulty with self-initiated (SI) movements, presumably related to basal ganglia thalamocortical (BGTC) circuit dysfunction, while showing less impairment with externally cued (EC) movements.&lt;/p&gt;Objectives&lt;p&gt;We investigate the role of BGTC in movement initiation and the neural underpinning of impaired SI compared to EC movements in PD using multifocal intracranial recordings and correlating signals with symptom severity.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We compared time-resolved neural activities within and between globus pallidus internus (GPi) and motor cortex during between SI and EC movements recorded invasively in 13 PD patients undergoing deep brain stimulation implantation. We compared cortical (but not subcortical) dynamics with those recorded in 10 essential tremor (ET) patients, who do not have impairments in movement initiation.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;SI movements in PD are associated with greater low-beta (13–20 Hz) power suppression during pre-movement period in GPi and motor cortex compared to EC movements in PD and compared to SI movements in ET (motor cortex only). SI movements in PD are uniquely associated with significant low-beta pallidocortical coherence suppression during movement execution that correlates with bradykinesia severity. In ET, motor cortex neural dynamics during EC movements do not significantly differ from that observed in PD and do not significantly differ between SI and EC movements.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These findings implicate low beta BGTC oscillations in impaired SI movements in PD. These results provide a physiological basis for the strategy of using EC movements in PD, circumventing diseased neural circuits associated with SI movements and instead engaging circuits that function similarly to those without PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00118</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Laminin α2 gene (LAMA2)-related Congenital Muscular Dystrophy (CMD) was distinguished by a defining central nervous system (CNS) abnormality—aberrant white matter signals by MRI—when first described in the 1990s. In the past 25 years, researchers and clinicians have expanded our knowledge of brain involvement in LAMA2-related CMD, also known as Congenital Muscular Dystrophy Type 1A (MDC1A). Neurological changes in MDC1A can be structural, including lissencephaly and agyria, as well as functional, including epilepsy and intellectual disability. Mouse models of MDC1A include both spontaneous and targeted LAMA2 mutations and range from a partial loss of LAMA2 function (e.g., dy&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;/dy&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;), to a complete loss of LAMA2 expression (dy&lt;sup&gt;3K&lt;/sup&gt;/dy&lt;sup&gt;3K&lt;/sup&gt;). Diverse cellular and molecular changes have been reported in the brains of MDC1A mouse models, including blood-brain barrier dysfunction, altered neuro- and gliogenesis, changes in synaptic plasticity, and decreased myelination, providing mechanistic insight into potential neurological dysfunction in MDC1A. In this review article, we discuss selected studies that illustrate the potential scope and complexity of disturbances in brain development in MDC1A, and as well as highlight mechanistic insights that are emerging from mouse models.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00069</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Perspective taking is the ability to take into account what the other agent knows. This skill is not unique to humans as it is also displayed by other animals like chimpanzees. It is an essential ability for social interactions, including efficient cooperation, competition, and communication. Here we present our progress toward building artificial agents with such abilities. We implemented a perspective taking task inspired by experiments done with chimpanzees. We show that agents controlled by artificial neural networks can learn via reinforcement learning to pass simple tests that require some aspects of perspective taking capabilities. We studied whether this ability is more readily learned by agents with information encoded in allocentric or egocentric form for both their visual perception and motor actions. We believe that, in the long run, building artificial agents with perspective taking ability can help us develop artificial intelligence that is more human-like and easier to communicate with.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00045</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have shown that cortico-striatal pathways link auditory signals to action-selection and reward-learning behavior through excitatory projections. Only recently it has been demonstrated that long-range GABAergic cortico-striatal somatostatin-expressing neurons in the auditory cortex project to the dorsal striatum, and functionally inhibit the main projecting neuronal population, the spiny projecting neuron. Here we tested the hypothesis that parvalbumin-expressing neurons of the auditory cortex can also send long-range projections to the auditory striatum. To address this fundamental question, we took advantage of viral and non-viral anatomical tracing approaches to identify cortico-striatal parvalbumin neurons (CS-Parv inhibitory projections → auditory striatum). Here, we describe their anatomical distribution in the auditory cortex and determine the anatomical and electrophysiological properties of layer 5 CS-Parv neurons. We also analyzed their characteristic voltage-dependent membrane potential gamma oscillation, showing that intrinsic membrane mechanisms generate them. The inherent membrane mechanisms can also trigger intermittent and irregular bursts (stuttering) of the action potential in response to steps of depolarizing current pulses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Following an injury to the central nervous system (CNS), spontaneous plasticity is observed throughout the neuraxis and affects multiple key circuits. Much of this spontaneous plasticity can elicit beneficial and deleterious functional outcomes, depending on the context of plasticity and circuit affected. Injury-induced activation of the neuroimmune system has been proposed to be a major factor in driving this plasticity, as neuroimmune and inflammatory factors have been shown to influence cellular, synaptic, structural, and anatomical plasticity. Here, we will review the mechanisms through which the neuroimmune system mediates plasticity after CNS injury. Understanding the role of specific neuroimmune factors in driving adaptive and maladaptive plasticity may offer valuable therapeutic insight into how to promote adaptive plasticity and/or diminish maladaptive plasticity, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Strawberry Leaf Extract Treatment Alleviates Cognitive Impairment by Activating Nrf2/HO-1 Signaling in Rats With Streptozotocin-Induced Diabetes</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00201</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Diabetes-associated cognitive impairment (DACI) is a common complication of diabetes mellitus (DM) that affects the central nervous system. Cognitive impairment, such as learning and memory impairment, and even dementia, is the main clinical manifestation of DACI. Unfortunately, there is no effective means by which to delay the cognitive symptoms of DM. Evidence has shown that strawberry leaf extract could alleviate cognitive decline, suppress oxidative stress, and reduce inflammatory responses in rats. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of strawberry leaf extract on cognitive function in a rat model of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes. After the continuous administration of strawberry leaf extract for 4 weeks, the Morris Water Maze (MWM) test results showed that the cognitive impairment of the rats was alleviated. Moreover, strawberry leaf extract significantly reduced the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), decreased the level of malondialdehyde (MDA), improved the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), decreased the mRNA expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and decreased the protein expression of caspase-3 and caspase-9 in the hippocampus of DM rats. Also, transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2 (NF-E2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/hemeoxygenase-1(HO-1) signaling was activated by the administration of strawberry leaf extract. Our findings indicate that strawberry leaf extract may be a potential drug candidate for the treatment of DACI and may be used as a basis for further research on the development of drugs for cognitive impairment in diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Maintenance vs. Manipulation in Auditory Verbal Working Memory in the Elderly: New Insights Based on Temporal Dynamics of Information Processing in the Millisecond Time Range</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00194</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Working memory (WM) is a limited-capacity cognitive system that allows the storage and use of a limited amount of information for a short period of time. Two WM processes can be distinguished: maintenance (i.e., storing, monitoring, and matching information) and manipulation (i.e., reordering and updating information). A number of studies have reported an age-related decline in WM, but the mechanisms underlying this deterioration need to be investigated. Previous research, including studies conducted in our laboratory, revealed that age-related cognitive deficits are related to decreased millisecond timing, i.e., the ability to perceive and organize incoming events in time. The aim of the current study was: (1) to identify in the elderly the brain network involved in the maintenance and manipulation WM processes; and (2) to use an fMRI task to investigate the relation between the brain activity associated with these two processes and the efficiency of temporal information processing (TIP) on a millisecond level reflected by psychophysical indices. Subjects were 41 normal healthy elderly people aged from 62 to 78 years. They performed: (1) an auditory verbal n-back task for assessing WM efficiency in an MRI scanner; and (2) a psychophysical auditory temporal-order judgment (TOJ) task for assessing temporal resolution in the millisecond domain outside the scanner. The n-back task comprised three conditions (0-, 1-, and 2-back), which allowed maintenance (1- vs. 0-back comparisons) and manipulation (2- vs. 1-back comparisons) processes to be distinguished. Results revealed the involvement of a similar brain network in the elderly to that found in previous studies. However, during maintenance processes, we found relatively limited and focused activations, which were significantly extended during manipulation. A novel result of our study, never reported before, is an indication of significant moderate correlations between the efficiency of WM and TIP. These correlations were found only for manipulation but not for maintenance. Our results confirmed the hypothesis that manipulation in the elderly is a dynamic process requiring skilled millisecond timing with high temporal resolution. We conclude that millisecond timing contributes to WM manipulation in the elderly, but not to maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Odd-paired is a pioneer-like factor that coordinates with Zelda to control gene expression in embryos</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59610</link>
	<content:encoded>Pioneer factors such as Zelda (Zld) help initiate zygotic transcription in Drosophila early embryos, but whether other factors support this dynamic process is unclear. Odd-paired (Opa), a zinc-finger transcription factor expressed at cellularization, controls the transition of genes from pair-rule to segmental patterns along the anterior-posterior axis. Finding that Opa also regulates expression through enhancer sog_Distal along the dorso-ventral axis, we hypothesized Opa’s role is more general. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) confirmed its in vivo binding to sog_Distal but also identified widespread binding throughout the genome, comparable to Zld. Furthermore, chromatin assays (ATAC-seq) demonstrate that Opa, like Zld, influences chromatin accessibility genome-wide at cellularization, suggesting both are pioneer factors with common as well as distinct targets. Lastly, embryos lacking opa exhibit widespread, late patterning defects spanning both axes. Collectively, these data suggest Opa is a general timing factor and likely late-acting pioneer factor that drives a secondary wave of zygotic gene expression.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Chronic ethanol consumption compromises neutrophil function in acute pulmonary Aspergillus fumigatus infection</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58855</link>
	<content:encoded>Chronic ethanol consumption is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, with higher risks to develop pulmonary infections, including Aspergillus infections. Mechanisms underlying increased susceptibility to infections are poorly understood. Chronic ethanol consumption induced increased mortality rates, higher &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus fumigatus&lt;/i&gt; burden and reduced neutrophil recruitment into the airways. Intravital microscopy showed decrease in leukocyte adhesion and rolling after ethanol consumption. Moreover, downregulated neutrophil activation and increased levels of serum CXCL1 in ethanol-fed mice induced internalization of CXCR2 receptors in circulating neutrophils. Bone marrow-derived neutrophils from ethanol-fed mice showed lower fungal clearance and defective reactive oxygen species production. Taken together, results showed that ethanol affects activation, recruitment, phagocytosis and killing functions of neutrophils, causing susceptibility to pulmonary &lt;i&gt;A. fumigatus&lt;/i&gt; infection. This study establishes a new paradigm in innate immune response in chronic ethanol consumers.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58571</link>
	<content:encoded>Eukaryotic replication origins are licensed by the loading of the replicative DNA helicase, Mcm2-7, in inactive double hexameric form around DNA. Subsequent origin activation is under control of multiple protein kinases that either promote or inhibit origin activation, which is important for genome maintenance. Using the reconstituted budding yeast DNA replication system, we find that the flexible N-terminal extension (NTE) of Mcm2 promotes the stable recruitment of Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) to Mcm2-7 double hexamers, which in turn promotes DDK phosphorylation of Mcm4 and -6 and subsequent origin activation. Conversely, we demonstrate that the checkpoint kinase, Rad53, inhibits DDK binding to Mcm2-7 double hexamers. Unexpectedly, this function is not dependent on Rad53 kinase activity, suggesting steric inhibition of DDK by activated Rad53. These findings identify critical determinants of the origin activation reaction and uncover a novel mechanism for checkpoint-dependent origin inhibition.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58509</link>
	<content:encoded>Modifications of synaptic inputs and cell-intrinsic properties both contribute to neuronal plasticity and development. To better understand these mechanisms, we undertook an intracellular analysis of the development of direction selectivity in the ferret visual cortex, which occurs rapidly over a few days after eye opening. We found strong evidence of developmental changes in linear spatiotemporal receptive fields of simple cells, implying alterations in circuit inputs. Further, this receptive field plasticity was accompanied by increases in near-spike-threshold excitability and input-output gain that resulted in dramatically increased spiking responses in the experienced state. Increases in subthreshold membrane responses induced by the receptive field plasticity and the increased input-output spiking gain were both necessary to explain the elevated firing rates in experienced ferrets. These results demonstrate that cortical direction selectivity develops through a combination of plasticity in inputs and in cell-intrinsic properties.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The complexity of coral-reef ecosystems makes it challenging to predict their dynamics and resilience under future disturbance regimes. Models for coral-reef dynamics do not adequately account for the high functional diversity exhibited by corals. Models that are ecologically and mechanistically detailed are therefore required to simulate the ecological processes driving coral reef dynamics. Here we describe a novel model that includes processes at different spatial scales, and the contribution of species’ functional diversity to benthic-community dynamics. We calibrated and validated the model to reproduce observed dynamics using empirical data from Caribbean reefs. The model exhibits realistic community dynamics, and individual population dynamics are ecologically plausible. A global sensitivity analysis revealed that the number of larvae produced locally, and interaction-induced reductions in growth rate are the parameters with the largest influence on community dynamics. The model provides a platform for virtual experiments to explore diversity-functioning relationships in coral reefs.</content:encoded>

By delivering INTRSECT viral vectors into VTA of double vglut2-Cre/vgat-Flp transgenic mice, we targeted specific VTA cell populations for ex vivo recordings. We found that VGluT2+ VGaT- and VGluT2+ VGaT+ neurons on average had relatively hyperpolarized resting membrane voltage, greater rheobase, and lower spontaneous firing frequency compared to VGluT2- VGaT+ neurons, suggesting that VTA glutamate-releasing and glutamate-GABA co-releasing neurons require stronger excitatory drive to fire than GABA-releasing neurons. In addition, we detected expression of Oprm1mRNA (encoding Mu opioid receptors, MOR) in VGluT2+ VGaT- and VGluT2- VGaT+ neurons, and their hyperpolarization by the MOR agonist DAMGO. Collectively, we demonstrate the utility of the double transgenic mouse to access VTA glutamate, glutamate-GABA and GABA neurons, and show some electrophysiological heterogeneity among them.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.22.215517v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Our mental representation of the egocentric space is influenced by the disproportionate sensory perception along the ventral-dorsal (i.e., front-back) axis of the body. Previous studies typically investigated the neural architectures involved in the egocentric representations within the visual field and revealed a crucial involvement of the parietal cortex and its interaction with the frontal lobe. However, neural architectures involved in the space representation behind self-body are still unclear. To address this problem, we applied both functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) to a 3D spatial-memory paradigm for human participants, in which the participants remembered a target location within (left or right) or outside (back) their visual field. Both fMRI and MEG experiments showed that the involvements of the fronto-parietal network including the frontal eye field and supplementary motor area were larger in the representations of retrieved target object within the visual field than outside. Conversely, the medial temporal lobe (MTL)-parietal network, including the right entorhinal cortex, was more involved in the target representation when the target was outside the visual field in both the experiments. In the MEG experiment, the connectivity increased in alpha-band frequency (8-13 Hz) in both fronto-parietal and MTL-parietal networks, and the preferential enhancement of the MTL-parietal network for the back preceded that of the fronto-parietal network for left/right. These findings suggest that the parietal cortex may represent whole space around self-body by coordinating the two distinct brain networks to process the egocentric spatial representation inside and outside the visual field.</content:encoded>

FMRI results confirm a self-voice suppression effect in the right anterior superior temporal gyrus (aSTG) when self-voice attribution was unambiguous. Although the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) was more active during self-generated voice compared to when passively-heard, the putative role of this region in detecting unexpected self-voice changes was not confirmed. Further research on the link between right aSTG and IFG is required and may establish a threshold monitoring voice identity in action. The current results have implications for a better understanding of an altered experience of self-voice feedback leading to auditory verbal hallucinations.</content:encoded>

Identifying important nodes for disease spreading is a central topic in network epidemiology. We investigate how well the position of a node, characterized by standard network measures, can predict its epidemiological importance in any graph of a given number of nodes. This is in contrast to other studies that deal with the easier prediction problem of ranking nodes by their epidemic importance in given graphs. As a benchmark for epidemic importance, we calculate the exact expected outbreak size given a node as the source. We study exhaustively all graphs of a given size, so do not restrict ourselves to certain generative models for graphs, nor to graph data sets. Due to the large number of possible nonisomorphic graphs of a fixed size, we are limited to ten-node graphs. We find that combinations of two or more centralities are predictive (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; scores of 0.91 or higher) even for the most difficult parameter values of the epidemic simulation. Typically, these successful combinations include one normalized spectral centrality (such as PageRank or Katz centrality) and one measure that is sensitive to the number of edges in the graph.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tvShCCVi60c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Phylogenetic profiling is a computational method to predict genes involved in the same biological process by identifying protein families which tend to be jointly lost or retained across the tree of life. Phylogenetic profiling has customarily been more widely used with prokaryotes than eukaryotes, because the method is thought to require many diverse genomes. There are now many eukaryotic genomes available, but these are considerably larger, and typical phylogenetic profiling methods require at least quadratic time as a function of the number of genes. We introduce a fast, scalable phylogenetic profiling approach entitled HogProf, which leverages hierarchical orthologous groups for the construction of large profiles and locality-sensitive hashing for efficient retrieval of similar profiles. We show that the approach outperforms Enhanced Phylogenetic Tree, a phylogeny-based method, and use the tool to reconstruct networks and query for interactors of the kinetochore complex as well as conserved proteins involved in sexual reproduction: Hap2, Spo11 and Gex1. HogProf enables large-scale phylogenetic profiling across the three domains of life, and will be useful to predict biological pathways among the hundreds of thousands of eukaryotic species that will become available in the coming few years. HogProf is available at https://github.com/DessimozLab/HogProf.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/BTgwca9yPNs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Most fish swim with body undulations that result from fluid–structure interactions between the fish’s internal tissues and the surrounding water. Gaining insight into these complex fluid–structure interactions is essential to understand how fish swim. To this end, we developed a dedicated experimental–numerical inverse dynamics approach to calculate the lateral bending moment distributions for a large-amplitude undulatory swimmer that moves freely in three-dimensional space. We combined automated motion tracking from multiple synchronised high-speed video sequences, computation of fluid dynamic stresses on the swimmer’s body from computational fluid dynamics, and bending moment calculations using these stresses as input for a novel beam model of the body. The bending moment, which represent the system’s net actuation, varies over time and along the fish’s central axis due to muscle actions, passive tissues, inertia, and fluid dynamics. Our three-dimensional analysis of 113 swimming events of zebrafish larvae ranging in age from 3 to 12 days after fertilisation shows that these bending moment patterns are not only relatively simple but also strikingly similar throughout early development and from fast starts to periodic swimming. This suggests that fish larvae may produce and adjust swimming movements relatively simply, yet effectively, while restructuring their neuromuscular control system throughout their rapid development.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/xnSPEDauSUs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The No Free Lunch theorems prove that under a uniform distribution over
induction problems (search problems or learning problems), all induction
algorithms perform equally. As I discuss in this chapter, the importance of the
theorems arises by using them to analyze scenarios involving {non-uniform}
distributions, and to compare different algorithms, without any assumption
about the distribution over problems at all. In particular, the theorems prove
that {anti}-cross-validation (choosing among a set of candidate algorithms
based on which has {worst} out-of-sample behavior) performs as well as
cross-validation, unless one makes an assumption -- which has never been
formalized -- about how the distribution over induction problems, on the one
hand, is related to the set of algorithms one is choosing among using
(anti-)cross validation, on the other. In addition, they establish strong
caveats concerning the significance of the many results in the literature which
establish the strength of a particular algorithm without assuming a particular
distribution. They also motivate a ``dictionary'' between supervised learning
and improve blackbox optimization, which allows one to ``translate'' techniques
from supervised learning into the domain of blackbox optimization, thereby
strengthening blackbox optimization algorithms. In addition to these topics, I
also briefly discuss their implications for philosophy of science.

expressive power of neural networks. However, this comes at the cost of
complex, black-boxed models that are unable to extrapolate beyond the domain of

neural network model that can find interpretable, compact and sparse solutions
for fitting data, \`{a} la Occam's razor. Our model defines a probability
distribution over a non-differentiable function space, and we introduce an
optimization method that samples functions and updates the weights based on
cross-entropy matching in an evolutionary strategy: we train by biasing the
probability mass towards better fitting solutions. We demonstrate that we can
fit a variety of algorithms, ranging from simple analytic functions through
recursive programs to even simple image classification. Our method takes
minimal memory footprint, does not require AI accelerators for efficient
training, fits complicated functions in minutes of training on a single CPU,
and demonstrates significant performance gains when scaled on GPU. Our

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A differentiable neural computer (DNC) is a memory augmented neural network
devised to solve a wide range of algorithmic and question answering tasks and
it showed promising performance in a variety of domains. However, its single
memory-based operations are not enough to store and retrieve diverse
informative representations existing in many tasks. Furthermore, DNC does not
explicitly consider the memorization itself as a target objective, which
inevitably leads to a very slow learning speed of the model. To address those
issues, we propose a novel distributed memory-based self-supervised DNC
architecture for enhanced memory augmented neural network performance. We
introduce (i) a multiple distributed memory block mechanism that stores
information independently to each memory block and uses stored information in a
cooperative way for diverse representation and (ii) a self-supervised memory
loss term which ensures how well a given input is written to the memory. Our
experiments on algorithmic and question answering tasks show that the proposed
model outperforms all other variations of DNC in a large margin, and also
matches the performance of other state-of-the-art memory-based network models.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a pandemic. Due to its highly
contagious nature, it has spread rapidly, resulting in major disruption to
public health. In addition, it has also had a severe negative impact on the
world economy. As a result, it is widely recognized now that widespread testing
is key to containing the spread of the disease and opening up the economy.
However, the current testing regime has been unable to keep up with testing
demands. Hence, there is a need for an alternative approach for repeated
large-scale testing of COVID-19. The emergence of wearable medical sensors
(WMSs) and novel machine learning methods, such as deep neural networks (DNNs),
points to a promising approach to address this challenge. WMSs enable
continuous and user-transparent monitoring of the physiological signals.
However, disease detection based on WMSs/DNNs and their deployment on
resource-constrained edge devices remain challenging problems. In this work, we
propose CovidDeep, a framework that combines efficient DNNs with commercially
available WMSs for pervasive testing of the coronavirus. We collected data from
87 individuals, spanning four cohorts including healthy, asymptomatic (but
SARS-CoV-2-positive) as well as moderately and severely symptomatic COVID-19
patients. We trained DNNs on various subsets of the features extracted from six
WMS and questionnaire categories to perform ablation studies to determine which
subsets are most efficacious in terms of test accuracy for a four-way
classification. The highest test accuracy obtained was 99.6%. Since different
WMS subsets may be more accessible (in terms of cost, availability, etc.) to
different sets of people, we hope these DNN models will provide users with
ample flexibility. The resultant DNNs can be easily deployed on edge devices,
e.g., smartwatch or smartphone, which also has the benefit of preserving
patient privacy.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10396</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we propose an efficient NAS algorithm for generating
task-specific models that are competitive under multiple competing objectives.
It comprises of two surrogates, one at the architecture level to improve sample
efficiency and one at the weights level, through a supernet, to improve
gradient descent training efficiency. On standard benchmark datasets (C10,
C100, ImageNet), the resulting models, dubbed NSGANetV2, either match or
outperform models from existing approaches with the search being orders of
magnitude more sample efficient. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness
and versatility of the proposed method on six diverse non-standard datasets,
e.g. STL-10, Flowers102, Oxford Pets, FGVC Aircrafts etc. In all cases,
NSGANetV2s improve the state-of-the-art (under mobile setting), suggesting that
NAS can be a viable alternative to conventional transfer learning approaches in
handling diverse scenarios such as small-scale or fine-grained datasets. Code

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Improving Memory Utilization in Convolutional Neural Network Accelerators. (arXiv:2007.09963v1 [eess.IV] CROSS LISTED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09963</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;While the accuracy of convolutional neural networks has achieved vast
improvements by introducing larger and deeper network architectures, also the
memory footprint for storing their parameters and activations has increased.
This trend especially challenges power- and resource-limited accelerator
designs, which are often restricted to store all network data in on-chip memory
to avoid interfacing energy-hungry external memories. Maximizing the network
size that fits on a given accelerator thus requires to maximize its memory
utilization. While the traditionally used ping-pong buffering technique is
mapping subsequent activation layers to disjunctive memory regions, we propose
a mapping method that allows these regions to overlap and thus utilize the
memory more efficiently. This work presents the mathematical model to compute
the maximum activations memory overlap and thus the lower bound of on-chip
memory needed to perform layer-by-layer processing of convolutional neural
networks on memory-limited accelerators. Our experiments with various
real-world object detector networks show that the proposed mapping technique
can decrease the activations memory by up to 32.9%, reducing the overall memory
for the entire network by up to 23.9% compared to traditional ping-pong
buffering. For higher resolution de-noising networks, we achieve activation
memory savings of 48.8%. Additionally, we implement a face detector network on
an FPGA-based camera to validate these memory savings on a complete end-to-end
system.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04756</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This paper proposes PuRL - a deep reinforcement learning (RL) based algorithm
for pruning neural networks. Unlike current RL based model compression
approaches where feedback is given only at the end of each episode to the
agent, PuRL provides rewards at every pruning step. This enables PuRL to
achieve sparsity and accuracy comparable to current state-of-the-art methods,
while having a much shorter training cycle. PuRL achieves more than 80%
sparsity on the ResNet-50 model while retaining a Top-1 accuracy of 75.37% on
the ImageNet dataset. Through our experiments we show that PuRL is also able to
sparsify already efficient architectures like MobileNet-V2. In addition to
performance characterisation experiments, we also provide a discussion and
analysis of the various RL design choices that went into the tuning of the
Markov Decision Process underlying PuRL. Lastly, we point out that PuRL is
simple to use and can be easily adapted for various architectures.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06696</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Event-based cameras display great potential for a variety of tasks such as
high-speed motion detection and navigation in low-light environments where
conventional frame-based cameras suffer critically. This is attributed to their
high temporal resolution, high dynamic range, and low-power consumption.
However, conventional computer vision methods as well as deep Analog Neural
Networks (ANNs) are not suited to work well with the asynchronous and discrete
nature of event camera outputs. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) serve as ideal
paradigms to handle event camera outputs, but deep SNNs suffer in terms of
performance due to the spike vanishing phenomenon. To overcome these issues, we
present Spike-FlowNet, a deep hybrid neural network architecture integrating
SNNs and ANNs for efficiently estimating optical flow from sparse event camera
outputs without sacrificing the performance. The network is end-to-end trained
with self-supervised learning on Multi-Vehicle Stereo Event Camera (MVSEC)
dataset. Spike-FlowNet outperforms its corresponding ANN-based method in terms
of the optical flow prediction capability while providing significant
computational efficiency.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Diffusion MRI simulation of realistic neurons with SpinDoctor and the Neuron Module. (arXiv:1910.07916v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07916</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this paper we present the Neuron Module that we implemented within the
Matlab-based diffusion MRI simulation toolbox SpinDoctor. SpinDoctor uses
finite element discretization and adaptive time integration to solve the
Bloch-Torrey partial differential equation for general diffusion-encoding
sequences, at multiple b-values and in multiple diffusion directions. In order
to facilitate the diffusion MRI simulation of realistic neurons by the research
community, we constructed finite element meshes for a group of 36 pyramidal
neurons and a group of 29 spindle neurons whose morphological descriptions were
found in the publicly available neuron repository NeuroMorpho. We also broke
the neurons into the soma and dendrite branches and created finite elements
meshes for these cell components. Through the Neuron Module, these neuron and
cell components finite element meshes can be seamlessly coupled with the
functionalities of SpinDoctor. To illustrate some potential uses of the Neuron
Module, we show numerical examples of the simulated diffusion MRI signals in
multiple diffusion directions from whole neurons as well as from the soma and
dendrite branches, and include a comparison of the high b-value behavior
between dendrite branches and whole neurons. In addition, we demonstrate that
the neuron meshes can be used to perform Monte-Carlo diffusion MRI simulations
as well. We show that at equivalent accuracy, if only one gradient direction
needs to be simulated, SpinDoctor is faster than a GPU implementation of
Monte-Carlo. Finally, we numerically compute the eigenfunctions and the
eigenvalues of the Bloch-Torrey and the Laplace operators on the neuron
geometries using a finite elements discretization, in order to give guidance in
the choice of the space and time discretization parameters for both finite
elements and Monte-Carlo approaches.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Site-Specific Neuromodulation of Detrusor and External Urethral Sphincter by Epidural Spinal Cord Stimulation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00047</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Impairments of the lower urinary tract function including urine storage and voiding are widely spread among patients with spinal cord injuries. The management of such patients includes bladder catheterization, surgical and pharmacological approaches, which reduce the morbidity from urinary tract-related complications. However, to date, there is no effective treatment of neurogenic bladder and restoration of urinary function. In the present study, we examined neuromodulation of detrusor (Detr) and external urethral sphincter by epidural electrical stimulation (EES) of lumbar and sacral regions of the spinal cord in chronic rats. To our knowledge, it is the first chronic study where detrusor and external urethral sphincter signals were recorded simultaneously to monitor their neuromodulation by site-specific spinal cord stimulation (SCS). The data obtained demonstrate that activation of detrusor muscle mainly occurs during the stimulation of the upper lumbar (L1) and lower lumbar (L5-L6) spinal segments whereas external urethral sphincter was activated predominantly by sacral stimulation. These findings can be used for the development of neurorehabilitation strategies based on spinal cord epidural stimulation for autonomic function recovery after severe spinal cord injury (SCI).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Taurine Promotes Neurite Outgrowth and Synapse Development of Both Vertebrate and Invertebrate Central Neurons</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00029</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Taurine is a sulfur-containing amino acid that is widely expressed throughout the human brain, heart, retina, and muscle tissues. Taurine deficiency is associated with cardiomyopathy, renal dysfunction, abnormalities of the developing nervous system, and epilepsy which suggests a role specific to excitable tissues. Like vertebrates, invertebrates maintain high levels of taurine during embryonic and larval development, which decline during aging, indicating a potential developmental role. Notwithstanding its extensive presence throughout, taurine’s precise role/s during early brain development, function, and repair remains largely unknown in both vertebrate and invertebrate. Here, we investigated whether taurine affects neurite outgrowth, synapse formation, and synaptic transmission between postnatal day 0 rat cortical neurons in vitro, whereas its synaptogenic role was tested more directly using the Lymnaea soma-soma synapse model. We provide direct evidence that when applied at physiological concentrations, taurine exerts a significant neurotrophic effect on neuritic outgrowth and thickness of neurites as well as the expression of synaptic puncta as revealed by immunostaining of presynaptic synaptophysin and postsynaptic PSD95 proteins in rat cortical neurons, indicating direct involvement in synapse development. To demonstrate taurine’s direct effects on neurons in the absence of glia and other confounding factors, we next exploited individually identified pre- and postsynaptic neurons from the mollusk Lymnaea stagnalis. We found that taurine increased both the incidence of synapse formation (percent of cells that form synapses) and the efficacy of synaptic transmission between the paired neurons. This effect was comparable, but not additive, to Lymnaea trophic factor-induced synaptogenesis. This study thus provides direct morphological and functional evidence that taurine plays an important role in neurite outgrowth, synaptogenesis, and synaptic transmission during the early stages of brain development and that this role is conserved across both vertebrate and invertebrate species.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sleep is a vital function of the nervous system that contributes to brain and bodily homeostasis, energy levels, cognitive ability, and other key functions of a variety of organisms. Dysfunctional sleep induces neural problems and is a key part of almost all human psychiatric disorders including substance abuse disorders. The hypnotic effects of cannabis have long been known and there is increasing use of phytocannabinoids and other formulations as sleep aids. Thus, it is crucial to gain a better understanding of the neurobiological basis of cannabis drug effects on sleep, as well as the role of the endogenous cannabinoid system in sleep physiology. In this review article, we summarize the current state of knowledge concerning sleep-related endogenous cannabinoid function derived from research on humans and rodent models. We also review information on acute and chronic cannabinoid drug effects on sleep in these organisms, and molecular mechanisms that may contribute to these effects. We point out the potential benefits of acute cannabinoids for sleep improvement, but also the potential sleep-disruptive effects of withdrawal following chronic cannabinoid drug use. Prescriptions for future research in this burgeoning field are also provided.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: The Role of Edge-Based and Surface-Based Information in Incidental Category Learning: Evidence From Behavior and Event-Related Potentials</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00036</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Although it has been demonstrated that edge-based information is more important than surface-based information in incidental category learning, it remains unclear how the two types of information play different roles in incidental category learning. To address this issue, the present study combined behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) techniques in an incidental category learning task in which the categories were defined by either edge- or surface-based features. The results from Experiment 1 showed that participants could simultaneously learn both edge- and surface-based information in incidental category learning, and importantly, there was a larger learning effect for the edge-based category than for the surface-based category. The behavioral results from Experiment 2 replicated those from Experiment 1, and the ERP results further revealed that the stimuli from the edge-based category elicited larger anterior and posterior P2 components than those from the surface-based category, whereas the stimuli from the surface-based category elicited larger anterior N1 and P3 components than those from the edge-based category. Taken together, the results suggest that, although surface-based information might attract more attention during feature detection, edge-based information plays more important roles in evaluating the relevance of information in making a decision in categorization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Adaptive Wavelet Based MRI Brain Image De-noising</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00728</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This paper presents a unique approach for wavelet-based MRI brain image de-noising. Adaptive soft and hard threshold functions are first proposed to improve the results of standard soft and hard threshold functions for image de-noising in the wavelet domain. Then, we applied the newly emerged improved adaptive generalized Gaussian distributed oriented threshold function (improved AGGD) on the MRI images to improve the results of the adaptive soft and hard threshold functions and also to display, this non-linear and data-driven function can work promisingly even in de-noising the medical images. The most important characteristic of this function is that it is dependent on the image since it is combined with an adaptive generalized Gaussian distribution function.Traditional thresholding neural network (TNN) and optimized based noise reduction have good results but fail to keep the visual quality and may blur some parts of an image. In TNN and optimized based image de-noising, it was required to use Least-mean-square (LMS) learning and optimization algorithms, respectively to find the optimum threshold value and parameters of the threshold functions which was time consuming. To address these issues, the improved AGGD based image de-noising approach is introduced to enhance the qualitative and quantitative performance of the above mentioned image de-noising techniques. De-noising using improved AGGD threshold function provides better results in terms of Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and also faster processing time since there is no need to use any Least-mean-square (LMS) learning and optimization algorithms for obtaining the optimum value and parameters of the thresholding functions. The experimental results indicate that image de-noising using improved AGGD threshold performs pretty well comparing with the adaptive threshold, standard threshold, improved wavelet threshold, and the optimized based noise reduction methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00283</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Premature ejaculation (PE) is the most common male sexual dysfunction. The brain disturbances that cause this disorder remain poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate how the morphology of cortical and subcortical brain structures differed in PE, how these morphologic differences were associated with severity measures of PE, such as intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT), and how these cortical and subcortical structures were causally connected through mediation analysis. Anatomical MRI scans were acquired from 39 male participants, 23 with PE (28.78 ± 4.32 years), and 16 without PE (27.88 ± 3.65 years). We used a subcortical analysis package within FSL to perform subcortical shape segmentation and statistical analysis. The PE group was compared with the normal control (NC) group in the shapes of 15 subcortical structures with general linear models [p &amp;lt; 0.05, family-wise error (FWE)-corrected]. We analyzed the cortical complexity revealed by the gyrification index using the Computational Anatomy Toolbox (CAT12). Vertex-wise shape analyses revealed outward shape deformations (expansions) in the left hippocampus and bilateral thalamus. Gyrification index analyses revealed that the right orbital frontal cortex and the right nucleus accumbens had greater complexity in PE patients. The shape deformations were positively correlated with the IELTs in the NC group, while this relationship was interrupted in the PE group. PE is associated with outward deformations of the subcortical surfaces and more complexity of the cortical structures. These morphological differences may be the basis of the brain functional alterations underlying PE.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Computational Characteristics of the Striatal Dopamine System Described by Reinforcement Learning With Fast Generalization</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00066</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Generalization is the ability to apply past experience to similar but non-identical situations. It not only affects stimulus-outcome relationships, as observed in conditioning experiments, but may also be essential for adaptive behaviors, which involve the interaction between individuals and their environment. Computational modeling could potentially clarify the effect of generalization on adaptive behaviors and how this effect emerges from the underlying computation. Recent neurobiological observation indicated that the striatal dopamine system achieves generalization and subsequent discrimination by updating the corticostriatal synaptic connections in differential response to reward and punishment. In this study, we analyzed how computational characteristics in this neurobiological system affects adaptive behaviors. We proposed a novel reinforcement learning model with multilayer neural networks in which the synaptic weights of only the last layer are updated according to the prediction error. We set fixed connections between the input and hidden layers to maintain the similarity of inputs in the hidden-layer representation. This network enabled fast generalization of reward and punishment learning, and thereby facilitated safe and efficient exploration of spatial navigation tasks. Notably, it demonstrated a quick reward approach and efficient punishment aversion in the early learning phase, compared to algorithms that do not show generalization. However, disturbance of the network that causes noisy generalization and impaired discrimination induced maladaptive valuation. These results suggested the advantage and potential drawback of computation by the striatal dopamine system with regard to adaptive behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Antioxidants and Vasodilators for the Treatment of Noise-Induced Hearing Loss: Are They Really Effective?</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00226</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We live in a world continuously immersed in noise, an environmental, recreational, and occupational factor present in almost every daily human activity. Exposure to high-level noise could affect the auditory function of individuals at any age, resulting in a condition called noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Given that by 2018, more than 400 million people worldwide were suffering from disabling hearing loss and that about one-third involved noise over-exposure, which represents more than 100 million people, this hearing impairment represents a serious health problem. As of today, there are no therapeutic measures available to treat NIHL. Conventional preventive measures, including public awareness and education and physical barriers to noise, do not seem to suffice, as the population is still being affected by damaging noise levels. Therefore, it is necessary to develop or test pharmacological agents that may prevent and/or diminish the impact of noise on hearing. Data availability about the pathophysiological processes involved in triggering NIHL has allowed researchers to use compounds, that could act as effective therapies, by targeting specific mechanisms such as the excess generation of free radicals and blood flow restriction to the cochlea. In this review, we summarize the advantages/disadvantages of these therapeutic agents, providing a critical view of whether they could be effective in the human clinic.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00041</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Comprehensive analysis of 3D angioarchitecture within the intact rat spinal cord remains technically challenging due to its sophisticated anatomical properties. In this study, we aim to present a framework for ultrahigh-resolution digitalized mapping of the normal rat spinal cord angioarchitecture and to determine the physiological parameters using synchrotron radiation micro-CT (SRμCT). Male SD rats were used in this ex vivo study. After a proportional mixture of contrast agents perfusion, the intact spinal cord covered the cervical spinal from the upper of the 1st cervical vertebra to the 5th lumbar vertebra was harvested and cut into proper lengths within three distinct regions: Cervical 3–5 levels, Thoracic 10–12 levels, Lumbar 3–5 levels spinal cord and examined using SRμCT. This method enabled the replication of the complicated microvasculature network of the normal rat spinal cord at the ultrahigh-resolution level, allowing for the precise quantitative analysis of the vascular morphological difference among cervical, thoracic and lumbar spinal cord in a 3D manner. Apart from a series of delicate 3D digital anatomical maps of the rat spinal cord angioarchitecture ranging from the cervical and thoracic to the lumbar spinal cord were presented, the 3D reconstruction data of SRμCT made the 3D printing of the spinal cord targeted selected microvasculature reality, that possibly provided deep insight into the nature and role of spinal cord intricate angioarchitecture. Our data proposed a new approach to outline systematic visual and quantitative evaluations on the 3D arrangement of the entire hierarchical microvasculature of the normal rat spinal cord at ultrahigh resolution. The technique may have great potential and become useful for future research on the poorly understood nature and function of the neurovascular interaction, particularly to investigate their pathology changes in various models of neurovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Blood-Based Biomarkers for Predictive Diagnosis of Cognitive Impairment in a Pakistani Population</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00223</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Numerous studies have identified an association between age-related cognitive impairment (CI) and oxidative damage, accumulation of metals, amyloid levels, tau, and deranged lipid profile. There is a concerted effort to establish the reliability of these blood-based biomarkers for predictive diagnosis of CI and its progression. We assessed the serum levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, total cholesterol, selected metals (Cu, Al, Zn, Pb, Mn, Cad), and total-tau and amyloid beta-42 protein in mild (n = 71), moderate (n = 86) and severe (n = 25) cognitively impaired patients and compared them with age-matched healthy controls (n = 90) from Pakistan. We found that a decrease in HDL cholesterol (correlation coefficient r = 0.467) and amyloid beta-42 (r = 0.451) were associated with increased severity of CI. On the other hand, an increase in cholesterol ratio (r = −0.562), LDL cholesterol (r = −0.428), triglycerides, and total-tau (r = −0.443) were associated with increased severity of CI. Increases in cholesterol ratio showed the strongest association and correlated with increases in tau concentration (r = 0.368), and increased triglycerides were associated with decreased amyloid beta-42 (r = −0.345). Increased Cu levels showed the strongest association with tau increase and increased Zn and Pb levels showed the strongest association with reduced amyloid beta-42 levels. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) showed the cutoff values of blood metals (Al, Pb, Cu, Cad, Zn, and Mn), total-tau, and amyloid beta-42 with sensitivity and specificity. Our data show for the first time that blood lipids, metals (particularly Cu, Zn, Pb, and Al), serum amyloid-beta-42/tau proteins modulate each other’s levels and can be collectively used as a predictive marker for CI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00217</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) place a significant burden on health care systems in the world and its aging populations. These diseases have long been regarded as separate entities; however, advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and the receptors for AGEs (RAGE) may be a link between diabetes and AD. In our study, mice injected with AGEs through stereotaxic surgery showed significant AD-like features: behavior showed decreased memory; immunofluorescence showed increased phosphorylated tau and APP. These results suggest links between diabetes and AD. Patients with diabetes are at a higher risk of developing AD, and the possible underlying molecular components of this association are now beginning to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Serum and CSF Metabolites in Stroke-Free Patients Are Associated With Vascular Risk Factors and Cognitive Performance</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00193</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background and purpose: The aggregation of vascular risk factors (VRFs) can aggravate cognitive impairment in stroke-free patients. Metabolites in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may irreversibly reflect early functional deterioration. This study evaluated small-molecule metabolites (&amp;lt;1,000 Da) in the serum and CSF of patients with different degrees of cerebrovascular burden and investigated the correlation between metabolism and cognitive performance associated with VRFs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: The subjects were divided into a low-risk group (10-year stroke risk ≤ 5%), a middle-risk group (10-year stroke risk &amp;gt;5% and &amp;lt;15%), and a high-risk group (10 years stroke risk ≥ 15%) according to the Framingham stroke risk profile (FSRP) score, which was used to quantify VRFs. We assess the cognitive function of the participants. We semiquantitatively quantified the small molecules using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The correlation between the small molecules and cognitive function, along with VRFs, was investigated to identify key small molecules and possible underlying metabolic pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: When the FSRP scores increased, the cognitive performances of the subjects decreased, specifically the performance regarding the tasks of immediate memory, delayed recall, and executive function. Seven metabolites (2-aminobutyric acid, Asp Asp Ser, Asp Thr Arg, Ile Cys Arg, 1-methyluric acid, 3-tert-butyladipic acid, and 5α-dihydrotestosterone glucuronide) in serum and three metabolites [Asp His, 13-HOTrE(r), and 2,5-di-tert-Butylhydroquinone] in CSF were significantly increased, and one metabolite (arachidonoyl PAF C-16) in serum was significantly decreased in high-risk group subjects. Among these metabolites, 1-methyluric acid, 3-tert-butyladipic, acid and Ile Cys Arg in serum and 13-HOTrE(r), 2,5-di-tert-butylhydroquinone, and Asp His in CSF were found to be negatively related with cognitive performance in the high-risk group. Arachidonoyl PAF C-16 in serum was found to be associated with better cognitive performance. Caffeine metabolism and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) were identified as key pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: 1-Methyluric acid, 3-tert-butyladipic acid, arachidonoyl PAF C-16, and Ile Cys Arg in serum and 13-HOTrE(r), 2,5-di-tert-butylhydroquinone, and Asp His in CSF were identified as potential biomarkers of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) at the early stage. Caffeine metabolism and the TCA cycle may play important roles in the pathophysiology of VRF-associated cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Increased Cerebrospinal Fluid S100B and NSE Reflect Neuronal and Glial Damage in Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00156</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: The diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) mainly relies on clinical manifestation, but may be difficult to make in very early stages of the disease, especially in pre-motor PD. Thus, there is great interest in finding a biomarker for PD. Among diagnostic biomarkers, the most promising molecules are those which reflect the pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease. Until now, only α-synuclein, a classical CSF Alzheimer’s disease biomarker, and neurofilament light (NFL) chains have turned out to be helpful in differential diagnosis between PD and healthy control subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aim: To assess whether CSF molecules related to some pathological processes present in PD might be of interest in the diagnosis of PD and whether they correlate with disease severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: CSF levels of S100B and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) were measured in 58 PD patients and in 28 healthy control subjects. Correlations were determined between the levels of these CSF molecules and measures of disease severity (Hoehn–Yahr scale and UPDRS part III), as well as disease duration and levodopa dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: CSF S100B and CSF NSE were both significantly increased in PD subjects vs. healthy controls (p = 0.007 and p = 0.00035, respectively). CSF S100B was significantly positively correlated with measures of disease severity (H-Y score and UPDRS part III), as well as disease duration (p &amp;lt; 0.05). No correlation was found between CSF NSE levels and disease severity or disease duration (p &amp;gt; 0.05). CSF S100B levels alone provided a relatively high discrimination (AUC 0.77) between PD and healthy controls, with 60.7% sensitivity and 88.5% specificity (p &amp;lt; 0.001) at a cut-off value of 123.22 pg/ml. Similarly, CSF NSE levels alone provided a relatively high discrimination (AUC 0.775) between PD and healthy controls, with 78.6% sensitivity and 74.1% specificity at a cut-off value of 51.56 ng/ml (p &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Our results show that both CSF S100B and CSF NSE seem to be promising markers of the axonal and glial degeneration present in PD. Additionally CSF S100B may be a promising marker of PD progression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The critical role of blood lipids in a broad range of health and disease states is well recognised but less explored is the interplay of genetics and environment within the broader blood lipidome. We examined heritability of the plasma lipidome among healthy older-aged twins (75 monozygotic/55 dizygotic pairs) enrolled in the Older Australian Twins Study (OATS) and explored corresponding gene expression and DNA methylation associations. 27/209 lipids (13.3%) detected by liquid chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry (LC-MS) were significantly heritable under the classical ACE twin model (h&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=0.28-0.59), which included ceramides (Cer) and triglycerides (TG). Relative to non-significantly heritable TGs, heritable TGs had a greater number of associations with gene transcripts, not directly associated with lipid metabolism, but with immune function, signalling and transcriptional regulation. Genome-wide average DNA methylation (GWAM) levels accounted for variability in some non-heritable lipids. We reveal a complex interplay of genetic and environmental influences on the ageing plasma lipidome.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58411</link>
	<content:encoded>Fusion of HIV-1 with the membrane of its target cell, an obligate first step in virus infectivity, is mediated by binding of the viral envelope (Env) spike protein to its receptors, CD4 and CCR5/CXCR4, on the cell surface. The process of viral fusion appears to be fast compared with viral egress and has not been visualized by EM. To capture fusion events, the process must be curtailed by trapping Env-receptor binding at an intermediate stage. We have used fusion inhibitors to trap HIV-1 virions attached to target cells by Envs in an extended pre-hairpin intermediate state. Electron tomography revealed HIV-1 virions bound to TZM-bl cells by 2-4 narrow spokes, with slightly more spokes present when evaluated with mutant virions that lacked the Env cytoplasmic tail. These results represent the first direct visualization of the hypothesized pre-hairpin intermediate of HIV-1 Env and improve our understanding of Env-mediated HIV-1 fusion and infection of host cells.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Understanding T cell function in vivo is of key importance for basic and translational immunology alike. To study T cells in vivo, we developed a new knock-in mouse line, which expresses a fusion protein of granzyme B, a key component of cytotoxic granules involved in T cell-mediated target cell-killing, and monomeric teal fluorescent protein from the endogenous &lt;i&gt;Gzmb&lt;/i&gt; locus. Homozygous knock-ins, which are viable and fertile, have cytotoxic T lymphocytes with endogeneously fluorescent cytotoxic granules but wild-type-like killing capacity. Expression of the fluorescent fusion protein allows quantitative analyses of cytotoxic granule maturation, transport and fusion in vitro with super-resolution imaging techniques, and two-photon microscopy in living knock-ins enables the visualization of tissue rejection through individual target cell-killing events in vivo. Thus, the new mouse line is an ideal tool to study cytotoxic T lymphocyte biology and to optimize personalized immunotherapy in cancer treatment.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Inhibition of post-termination ribosome recycling at premature termination codons in UPF1 ATPase mutants</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57834</link>
	<content:encoded>Recognition and rapid degradation of mRNA harboring premature translation termination codons (PTCs) serves to protect cells from accumulating non-functional and potentially toxic truncated polypeptides. Targeting of PTC-containing transcripts is mediated by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway and requires a conserved set of proteins including UPF1, an RNA helicase whose ATPase activity is essential for NMD. Previously, we identified a functional interaction between the NMD machinery and terminating ribosomes based on 3’ RNA decay fragments that accrue in UPF1 ATPase mutants. Herein, we show that those decay intermediates originate downstream of the PTC and harbor 80S ribosomes that migrate into the mRNA 3’ UTR independent of canonical translation. Accumulation of 3’ RNA decay fragments is determined by both RNA sequence downstream of the PTC and the inactivating mutation within the active site of UPF1. Our data reveal a failure in post-termination ribosome recycling in UPF1 ATPase mutants.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Controlling protein function by fine-tuning conformational flexibility</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57180</link>
	<content:encoded>In a living cell, protein function is regulated in several ways, including post-translational modifications (PTMs), protein-protein interaction, or by the global environment (e.g. crowding or phase separation). While site-specific PTMs act very locally on the protein, specific protein interactions typically affect larger (sub-)domains, and global changes affect the whole protein non-specifically. Herein, we directly observe protein regulation under three different degrees of localization, and present the effects on the Hsp90 chaperone system at the levels of conformational steady states, kinetics and protein function. Interestingly using single-molecule FRET, we find that similar functional and conformational steady states are caused by completely different underlying kinetics. We disentangle specific and non-specific effects that control Hsp90’s ATPase function, which has remained a puzzle up to now. Lastly, we introduce a new mechanistic concept: functional stimulation through conformational confinement. Our results demonstrate how cellular protein regulation works by fine-tuning the conformational state space of proteins.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: High glucose levels increase influenza-associated damage to the pulmonary epithelial-endothelial barrier</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56907</link>
	<content:encoded>Diabetes mellitus is a known susceptibility factor for severe influenza virus infections. However, the mechanisms that underlie this susceptibility remain incompletely understood. Here, the effects of high glucose levels on influenza severity were investigated using an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; model of the pulmonary epithelial-endothelial barrier as well as an &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; murine model of type II diabetes. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; we show that high glucose conditions prior to IAV infection increased virus-induced barrier damage. This was associated with an increased pro-inflammatory response in endothelial cells and the subsequent damage of the epithelial junctional complex. These results were subsequently validated &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. This study provides the first evidence that hyperglycaemia may increase influenza severity by damaging the pulmonary epithelial-endothelial barrier and increasing pulmonary oedema. These data suggest that maintaining long-term glucose control in individuals with diabetes is paramount in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with influenza virus infections.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56825</link>
	<content:encoded>Abnormal α-synuclein aggregation has been implicated in several diseases and is known to spread in a prion-like manner. There is a relationship between protein aggregate structure (strain) and clinical phenotype in prion diseases, however, whether differences in the strains of α‑synuclein aggregates account for the different pathologies remained unclear. Here, we generated two types of α-synuclein fibrils from identical monomer and investigated their seeding and propagation ability in mice and primary-cultured neurons. One α-synuclein fibril induced marked accumulation of phosphorylated α-synuclein and ubiquitinated protein aggregates, while the other did not, indicating the formation of α-synuclein two strains. Notably, the former α‑synuclein strain inhibited proteasome activity and co-precipitated with 26S proteasome complex. Further examination indicated that structural differences in the C-terminal region of α‑synuclein strains lead to different effects on proteasome activity. These results provide a possible molecular mechanism to account for the different pathologies induced by different α‑synuclein strains.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Mtb&lt;/i&gt;) employs plethora of mechanisms to hijack the host defence machinery for its successful survival, proliferation and persistence. Here we show that &lt;i&gt;Mtb&lt;/i&gt; upregulates one of the key epigenetic modulators, NAD+ dependent histone deacetylase Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2), which upon infection translocate to the nucleus and deacetylates histone H3K18, thus modulating the host transcriptome leading to enhanced macrophage activation. Furthermore, in &lt;i&gt;Mtb&lt;/i&gt; specific T cells, SIRT2 deacetylates NFκB-p65 at K310 to modulate T helper cell differentiation. Pharmacological inhibition of SIRT2 restricts the intracellular growth of both drug-sensitive and resistant strains of &lt;i&gt;Mtb&lt;/i&gt; and enhances the efficacy of front line anti-TB drug Isoniazid in the murine model of infection. SIRT2 inhibitor-treated mice display reduced bacillary load, decreased disease pathology and increased &lt;i&gt;Mtb&lt;/i&gt; specific protective immune responses. Overall, this study provides a link between &lt;i&gt;Mtb&lt;/i&gt; infection, epigenetics and host immune response, which can be exploited to achieve therapeutic benefits.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.22.215616v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The accumulation of plaque in the brain leads to the onset and development of Alzheimers disease. The Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is usually cut by a-secretase, however an abnormal cleavage profile by {beta}-secretase (BACE1) leads to the accumulation of A{beta} peptides, which forms these plaques. Numerous APP gene mutations favor plaque accumulation, causing Familial Alzheimer Disease (FAD). However, a variant of the APP gene (A673T) in Icelanders reduces BACE1 cleavage by 40 %. A library of plasmids containing APP genes with 29 FAD mutations with or without the additional A673T mutation was generated and transfected in neuroblastomas to assess the effect of this mutation on A{beta} peptide production. In most cases the production of A{beta} peptides was decreased by the co-dominant A673T mutation. The reduction of A{beta} peptide concentrations for the London mutation (V717I) even reached the same level as A673T carriers. These results suggest that the insertion of A673T in the APP gene of genetically susceptible FAD patients may prevent the onset of, slow down, or stop the progression of the disease.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Canine neuropathic pain (NeuP) has been poorly investigated. This study aimed to evaluate the pain burden, sensory profile and inflammatory cytokines in dogs with naturally-occurring NeuP. Twenty-nine client-owned dogs with NeuP were included in a  p rospective, partially masked, randomized crossover clinical trial, and treated with gabapentin/placebo/gabapentin-meloxicam or gabapentin-meloxicam/placebo/gabapentin (each treatment block of 7 days; total 21 days). Pain scores, mechanical (MNT) and electrical (ENT) nociceptive thresholds and descending noxious inhibitory controls (DNIC) were assessed at baseline, days 7, 14, and 21. DNIC was evaluated using {Delta}MNT (after-before conditioning stimulus). Positive or negative {Delta}MNT corresponded to inhibitory or facilitatory pain profiles, respectively. Data from baseline were compared to those of sixteen healthy controls. {Delta}MNT, but not MNT and ENT, was significantly larger in controls (2.3 {+/-} 0.9 N) than in NeuP (-0.2 {+/-} 0.7 N). The percentage of dogs with facilitatory sensory profile was similar at baseline and after placebo (61.5-63%), and between controls and after gabapentin (33.3-34.6%). Pain scores were lower than baseline after gabapentin or gabapentin-meloxicam. Cytokine levels were not different between groups or treatments. Dogs with NeuP have deficient inhibitory pain mechanisms. Pain burden was reduced after gabapentin and gabapentin-meloxicam depending on the pain scoring instrument used.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.22.215418v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The deposition of amyloid {beta} (A {beta}) in blood vessels of the brain, known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), is observed in more than 90% of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients. The presence of such CAA pathology is not as evident, however, in most mouse models of AD, thereby making it difficult to examine the contribution of CAA to the pathogenesis of AD. Since blood levels of soluble amyloid precursor protein (sAPP) in rodents are less than 1% of those in humans, we hypothesized that endothelial APP expression would be markedly lower in rodents, thus providing a reason for the poorly expressed CAA pathology. Here we generated mice that specifically express human APP770 in endothelial cells. These mice exhibited an age-dependent robust deposition of A {beta} in brain blood vessels but not in the parenchyma. Crossing these animals with APP knock-in mice led to an expanded CAA pathology as evidenced by increased amounts of amyloid accumulated in the cortical blood vessels. These results show that both neuronal and endothelial APP contribute cooperatively to vascular A {beta} deposition, and suggest that this mouse model will be useful for studying disease mechanisms underlying CAA and for developing novel AD therapeutics.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Experience-dependent plasticity in an innate social behavior is mediated by hypothalamic LTP</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.21.214619v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>All animals can perform certain survival behaviors without prior experience, suggesting a &quot;hard wiring&quot; of underlying neural circuits. Experience, however, can alter the expression of innate behaviors. Where in the brain and how such plasticity occurs remains largely unknown. Previous studies have established the phenomenon of &quot;aggression training,&quot; in which the repeated experience of winning successive aggressive encounters across multiple days leads to increased aggressiveness. Here we show that this procedure also leads to long-term potentiation (LTP) at an excitatory synapse, derived from the Anterior Hippocampus/Posterior Medial amygdala (AHiPM), onto estrogen receptor 1-expressing (Esr1+) neurons in the ventrolateral subdivision of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl). We demonstrate further that the optogenetic induction of such LTP in vivo facilitates, while optogenetic long-term depression (LTD) diminishes, the behavioral effect of aggression training, implying a causal role for potentiation of the AHiPM to VMHvlEsr1 projection in mediating the effect of this training. Interestingly, ~25% of inbred C57BL/6 mice fail to respond to aggression training. We show that these individual differences are correlated both with lower levels of testosterone, relative to mice that respond to such training, and with a failure to exhibit LTP in vivo after aggression training. Administration of exogenous testosterone to such non-aggressive mice restores both behavioral and physiological plasticity in vivo. Together, these findings reveal that LTP at a hypothalamic circuit node mediates a form of experience-dependent plasticity in an innate social behavior, and a potential hormone-dependent basis for individual differences in such plasticity among genetically identical mice.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.21.214494v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Neurovascular-modulation is based on two principles that derive directly from brain vascular ultra-structure, namely an exceptionally dense capillary bed (BBB length density: 972 mm/mm3) and a blood-brain-barrier (BBB) resistivity ({rho} ~ 1x105 {Omega}.m) much higher than brain parenchyma/interstitial space ({rho} ~ 4 {Omega}.m) or blood ({rho} ~ 1 {Omega}.m).Principle 1: Electrical current crosses between the brain parenchyma (interstitial space) and vasculature, producing BBB electric fields (EBBB) that are &amp;gt; 400x of the parenchyma electric field ([E]BRAIN), which in turn modulates transport across the BBB. Specifically, for a BBB space constant ({lambda}BBB) and wall thickness (dth-BBB): analytical solution for maximum BBB electric field (EABBB) is given as:([E]BRAIN x {lambda}BBB) / dth-BBB. Direct vascular stimulation suggests novel therapeutic strategies such as boosting metabolic capacity or interstitial fluid clearance. Boosting metabolic capacity impacts all forms of neuromodulation, including those applying intensive stimulation or driving neuroplasticity. Boosting interstitial fluid clearance has broad implications as a treatment for neurodegenerative disease including Alzheimer's disease.Principle 2: Electrical current in the brain parenchyma is distorted around brain vasculature, amplifying neuronal polarization. Specifically, vascular ultra-structure produces ~50% modulation of the average [E]BRAIN over the ~40 m inter-capillary distance. The divergence of EBRAIN (activating function) is thus ~100 kV/m2 per unit average [E]BRAIN. This impacts all forms of neuromodulation, including Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS), Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS), Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), and transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) techniques such a transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS). Specifically, whereas spatial profile of EBRAIN along neurons is traditionally assumed to depend on macroscopic anatomy, it instead depends on local vascular ultra-structure.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.21.214486v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Mammals localize sounds using information from their two ears. Localization in real-world conditions is challenging, as echoes provide erroneous information, and noises mask parts of target sounds. To better understand real-world localization we equipped a deep neural network with human ears and trained it to localize sounds in a virtual environment. The resulting model localized accurately in realistic conditions with noise and reverberation, outperforming alternative systems that lacked human ears. In simulated experiments, the network exhibited many features of human spatial hearing: sensitivity to monaural spectral cues and interaural time and level differences, integration across frequency, and biases for sound onsets. But when trained in unnatural environments without either reverberation, noise, or natural sounds, these performance characteristics deviated from those of humans. The results show how biological hearing is adapted to the challenges of real-world environments and illustrate how artificial neural networks can extend traditional ideal observer models to real-world domains.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.21.214395v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Online experimental platforms can be used as an alternative, or complement, to lab-based research. However, when conducting auditory experiments via online methods, the researcher has limited control over the participants' listening environment. We offer a new method to probe one aspect of that environment, headphone use. Headphones not only provide better control of sound presentation but can also &quot;shield&quot; the listener from background noise. Here we present a rapid (&amp;lt; 3 minute) headphone screening test based on Huggins Pitch (HP), a perceptual phenomenon that can only be detected when stimuli are presented dichotically. We validate this test using a cohort of &quot;Trusted&quot; online participants who completed the test using both headphones and loudspeakers. The same participants also trialled a widely used headphone test (AP test; Woods et al., 2017). We demonstrate that compared to the AP test, the HP test has a higher selectively for headphone users, rendering it as a compelling alternative to the existing screening method. Overall, the new HP test correctly detects 80% of headphone users and has a false positive rate of 20%. Moreover, we demonstrate that there is little overlap between participants who pass both HP and AP tests over loudspeakers. Therefore, combining the two tests can lower the false positive rate to ~7% (but at the expense of an increased false negative rate). This should be useful in situations where headphone use is particularly critical (e.g. dichotic or spatial manipulations). An implementation of the new test is available with JavaScript and through Gorilla (gorilla.sc).</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: A primed immune transcriptional program is activated in oligodendroglia in multiple sclerosis</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.21.213876v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease characterized by a targeted immune attack on myelin in the central nervous system (CNS). We have previously shown that oligodendrocytes (OLs), myelin producing cells in the CNS, and their precursors (OPCs), acquire disease-specific transcriptional states in MS1,2. To understand how these alternative transcriptional programs are activated in disease, we performed single-cell assay for transposase accessible chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) on the OL lineage in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS. We identified regulatory regions with increased accessibility in oligodendroglia (OLG) in EAE, some of which in the proximity of immune genes. A similar remodeling of chromatin accessibility was observed upon treatment of postnatal OPCs with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), but not with dexamethasone. These changes in accessibility were not exclusive to distal enhancers, but also occurred at promoter regions, suggesting a role for promoters in mediating cell-state transitions. Notably, we found that a subset of immune genes already exhibited chromatin accessibility in OPCs ex vivo and in vivo, suggesting a primed chromatin state in OLG compatible with rapid transitions to an immune-competent state. Several primed genes presented bivalency of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 at promoters in OPCs, with loss of H3K27me3 upon IFN-gamma treatment. Inhibition of JMJD3/Kdm6b, mediating removal of H3K27me3, led to the inability to activate these genes upon IFN-gamma treatment. Importantly, OLGs from the adult human brain showed chromatin accessibility at immune gene loci, particularly at MHC-I pathway genes. A subset of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with MS susceptibility overlapped with these primed regulatory regions in OLG from both mouse and human CNS. Our data suggest that susceptibility for MS may involve activation of immune gene programs in OLG. These programs are under tight control at the chromatin level in OLG and may therefore constitute novel targets for immunological-based therapies for MS.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.21.213751v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Our sense of touch is unique in that our tactile receptors are spread across our body surface and constantly receive different inputs at the same time. These inputs vary in relevance according to our current goals, but there is little research on how simultaneous stimulation to different body sites affects the perception of touch. In this series of studies, we characterised how irrelevant tactile sensations across the body-midline affect tactile detection in a constantly-attended body site. Participants had to detect a target on their dominant index finger, while receiving irrelevant stimulation to another body site (homologous and non-homologous fingers, and the contralateral ankle). We document robust interference effects on all measured body-sites. Its impact on detection-performance was unaffected by body posture, exacerbated by the intensity of the irrelevant stimulation, and ameliorated by embedding a target-like signal in the irrelevant stimulation. In addition, we generalise our findings beyond the target stimulus (i.e., a vibration intensity decrement) and report similar effects when employing a target-increment. In light of our findings, we propose that tactile inputs may be pooled together early in the hierarchy of somatosensory processing, resulting in an integrated percept. The rules for integration across body sides are likely not described by a simple summation, but rather may be governed by more complex interactions between fingers and according to the corresponding perceived, as well as actual, intensities of the stimulation.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.21.213116v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Gut microbiota influence numerous aspects of host biology, including brain structure and function. Growing evidence implicates gut microbiota in aversive conditioning and anxiety-related behaviors, but research has focused almost exclusively on males. To investigate sex-specific effects of gut dysbiosis on aversive learning and memory, adult female and male C57BL/6N mice were orally administered a moderate dose of non-absorbable antimicrobial medications (ATMs; neomycin, bacitracin, pimaricin) or a control over 10 days. Changes in gut microbiome composition were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Open field behavior, cued aversive learning, context recall, and cued recall were assessed. Following behavioral testing, the morphology of basolateral amygdala (BLA) principal neuron dendrites and spines was characterized. Results revealed that ATMs induced distinct but overlapping patterns of gut dysbiosis across sex, with stronger effects in females. There were also sex-specific effects on behavior and neuroanatomy. Treated males but not females exhibited altered locomotor and anxiety-like behavior in the novel open field test. Treated females but not males showed impairments in aversive memory acquisition and cued recall. Context recall remained intact in both sexes, as did dendritic structure of BLA principal neurons. However, ATMs exerted sex-specific effects on spine density. A second experiment was conducted to isolate gut perturbation to cued recall. Results revealed no effect of ATMs on recall of a previously consolidated fear memory, suggesting that gut dysbiosis preferentially impacts aversive learning. These data shed new light on how gut microbiota interact with sex to influence aversive conditioning, anxiety-like behavior, and BLA dendritic spine architecture.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.21.211862v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Heart rate variability (HRV), the variation of the period between consecutive heartbeats, is an established tool for assessing physiological indicators such as stress and fatigue. In non-clinical settings, HRV is often computed from signals acquired using wearable devices that are susceptible to strong artifacts. In EEG (electroencephalography) experiments, these devices must be synchronized with the EEG and typically provide intermittent interbeat interval information based on proprietary artifact-removal algorithms. This paper describes an automated algorithm that uses the output of an EEG sensor mounted on a subject's chest to accurately detect interbeat intervals and to calculate time-varying metrics. The algorithm is designed for raw signals and is robust to artifacts, resulting in fine-grained capture of HRV that is synchronized with the EEG. An open-source MATLAB toolbox (EEG-Beats) is available to calculate interbeat intervals and many standard HRV time and frequency indicators. EEG-Beats is designed to run in a completely automated fashion on an entire study without manual intervention. The paper applies EEG-Beats to EKG signals measured with an EEG sensor in a large longitudinal study (17 subjects, 6 tasks, 854 datasets). The toolbox is available at https://github.com/VisLab/EEG-Beats.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Despite the use of shamanism as a healing practice for several millennia, few empirical studies of the shamanic state of consciousness exist. We investigated the neural correlates of shamanic trance using high-density electroencephalography (EEG) in 24 shamanic practitioners and 24 healthy controls during rest, shamanic drumming, and classical music listening, followed by a validated assessment of altered states of consciousness. EEG data were used to assess changes in absolute power, connectivity, signal diversity, and criticality, which were correlated with assessment measures. We also compared assessment scores to those of individuals under the influence of psychedelics in a separate study (Studerus et al., 2010). Shamanic practitioners were significantly different from controls in several domains of altered consciousness, with scores comparable to or exceeding that of healthy volunteers under the influence of psychedelics. Practitioners also displayed increased gamma power during drumming that positively correlated with elementary visual alterations. Further, shamanic practitioners had decreased low alpha and increased low beta connectivity during drumming and classical music, and decreased neural signal diversity in the gamma band during drumming that inversely correlated with insightfulness. Finally, criticality in practitioners was increased during drumming in the low and high beta and gamma bands, with increases in the low beta band correlating with complex imagery and elementary visual alterations. These findings suggest that psychedelic drug-induced and non-pharmacologic alterations in consciousness have overlapping phenomenological traits but are distinct states of consciousness, as reflected by the unique brain-related changes during shamanic trance compared to previous literature investigating the psychedelic state.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.20.212480v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Patients with a history of early life stress (ELS) exposure have an increased risk of developing chronic pain and mood disorders later in life. The severity of ELS in patients with urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome (UCPPS) is directly correlated with symptom severity and increased comorbidity, and is inversely related to likelihood of improvement. Voluntary exercise improves chronic pain symptoms and our group and others have shown that voluntary wheel running can improve outcomes in stress-induced UCPPS models, suggesting that exercise may negate some of the outcomes associated with ELS. Here we provide further evidence that voluntary wheel running can attenuate increased perigenital mechanical sensitivity, bladder output, and mast cell degranulation in the bladder and prostate in male mice that underwent neonatal maternal separation (NMS). Sedentary male NMS mice had reduced serum corticosterone, which was not impacted by voluntary wheel running, although stress-related regulatory gene expression in the hypothalamus and hippocampus was significantly increased following exercise. Neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus was diminished in sedentary NMS mice and significantly increased in both exercised naive and NMS mice. Sucrose consumption increased in exercised naive but not NMS mice, and anxiety behaviors measured on an elevated plus maze were increased following exercise. Together these data suggest that voluntary wheel running is sufficient to normalize many of the UCPPS-related outcomes resulting from NMS. Exercise also increased hippocampal neurogenesis and stress-related gene expression within the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, further supporting exercise as a non-pharmacological intervention for attenuating outcomes related to ELS exposure.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.20.212472v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Anesthetic drugs are widely used in medicine and research to mediate loss of consciousness (LOC). Despite the vast use of anesthesia, how LOC affects cortical sensory processing and the underlying neural circuitry, is not well understood. We measured neuronal population activity in the visual cortices of awake and isoflurane anesthetized mice and compared the visually evoked responses under different levels of consciousness. We used voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI) to characterize the temporal and spatial properties of cortical responses to visual stimuli over a range of states from wakefulness to deep anesthesia. VSDI enabled measuring the neuronal population responses at high spatial (meso-scale) and temporal resolution from several visual regions (V1, extrastiate-lateral (ESL) and extrastiate-medial (ESM)) simultaneously. We found that isoflurane has multiple effects on the population evoked response that augmented with anesthetic depth, where the largest changes occurred at LOC. Isoflurane reduced the response amplitude and prolonged the latency of response in all areas. In addition, the intra-areal spatial spread of the visually evoked activity decreased. During visual stimulation, intra-areal and inter-areal correlation between neuronal populations decreased with increasing doses of isoflurane. Finally, while in V1 the majority of changes occurred at higher doses of isoflurane, higher visual areas showed marked changes at lower doses of isoflurane. In conclusion, our results demonstrate a reverse hierarchy shutdown of the visual cortices regions: low-dose isoflurane diminishes the visually evoked activity in higher visual areas before lower order areas and cause a reduction in inter-areal connectivity leading to a disconnected network.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.20.212407v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>An increasing number of identified Parkinson's disease (PD) risk loci contain genes highly expressed in innate immune cells, yet their potential role in pathological mechanisms is not obvious. We have generated transcriptomic profiles of CD14+ monocytes from 230 individuals with sporadic PD and age-matched healthy subjects. We identified dysregulation of genes involved in mitochondrial and proteasomal function. We also generated transcriptomic profiles of primary microglia from autopsied brains of 55 PD and control subjects and observed discordant transcriptomic signatures of mitochondrial genes in PD monocytes and microglia. We further identified PD susceptibility genes, whose expression, relative to each risk allele, is altered in monocytes. These findings reveal that transcriptomic mitochondrial alterations are detectable in PD monocytes and are distinct from brain microglia, and facilitates efforts to understand the roles of myeloid cells in PD.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Chemogenetic silencing of hippocampus and amygdala reveals a double dissociation in periadolescent obesogenic diet-induced memory alterations</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.20.212258v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In addition to numerous metabolic comorbidities, obesity is associated with several adverse neurobiological outcomes, especially learning and memory alterations. Obesity prevalence is rising dramatically in youth and is persisting in adulthood. This is especially worrying since adolescence is a crucial period for the maturation of certain brain regions playing a central role in memory processes such as the hippocampus and the amygdala. We previously showed that periadolescent exposure to obesogenic high-fat diet (HFD) had opposite effects on hippocampus- and amygdala-dependent memory, impairing the former and enhancing the latter. However, the causal role of these two brain regions in periadolescent HFD-induced memory alterations remains unclear. Here, we first showed that periadolescent HFD induced long-term, but not short-term, object recognition memory deficits, specifically when rats were exposed to a novel context. Using chemogenetic approaches to inhibit targeted brain regions, we then demonstrated that recognition memory deficits are dependent on the activity of the ventral hippocampus, but not the basolateral amygdala. On the contrary, the HFD- induced enhancement of conditioned odor aversion requires specifically amygdala activity. Taken together, these findings suggest that HFD consumption throughout adolescence impairs long-term object recognition memory through the overactivation of the ventral hippocampus during memory acquisition. Moreover, these results further highlight the bidirectional effects of adolescent HFD on hippocampal and amygdala functions.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Neural correlates of imaging biomarkers for primary motor deficits after stroke - more than just the primary motor system?</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.20.212175v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Hemiparesis is a common consequence of stroke to the primary motor system. Brain mapping and post-stroke outcome prediction studies suggest that damage to additional brain areas plays a causal role in occurrence and severity of hemiparesis and its recovery. Objective: The study aimed to evaluate if damage to areas outside of the primary motor system can play a causal role in the occurrence of hemiparesis, or if such brain-deficit relations constitute a mere correlation. Methods: In a sample of 102 patients with unilateral stroke, the neural correlates of acute and chronic upper limb paresis were mapped by univariate and multivariate lesion behavior mapping. Following the same approach, CST lesion biomarkers were mapped, and resulting topographies of both analyses were compared. Results: All mapping analyses of acute or chronic upper limb paresis implicated areas outside of the primary motor system. Likewise, mapping CST lesion biomarkers - that, by definition, are only causally related to damage of the CST - implicated several areas outside of the CST with high correspondence to areas associated with upper limb paresis. Conclusions: Damage to areas outside of the primary motor system might not play a causal role in hemiparesis, while still providing predictive value. This finding suggests that simple theory-based biomarkers or qualitative rules to infer post-stroke outcome from imaging data might perform sub-optimally. Algorithms using theory-driven feature selection do not consider the complexity of lesion data, and could be improved by utilizing high-dimensional models with data-driven feature selection strategies.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Distributed Sampling-based Bayesian Inference in Coupled Neural Circuits</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.20.212126v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The brain performs probabilistic inference to interpret the external world, but the underlying neuronal mechanisms remain not well understood. The stimulus structure of natural scenes exists in a high-dimensional feature space, and how the brain represents and infers the joint posterior distribution in this rich, combinatorial space is a challenging problem. There is added difficulty when considering the neuronal mechanics of this representation, since many of these features are computed in parallel by distributed neural circuits. Here, we present a novel solution to this problem. We study continuous attractor neural networks (CANNs), each representing and inferring a stimulus attribute, where attractor coupling supports sampling-based inference on the multivariate posterior of the high-dimensional stimulus features. Using perturbative analysis, we show that the dynamics of coupled CANNs realizes Langevin sampling on the stimulus feature manifold embedded in neural population responses. In our framework, feedforward inputs convey the likelihood, reciprocal connections encode the stimulus correlational priors, and the internal Poisson variability of the neurons generate the correct random walks for sampling. Our model achieves high-dimensional joint probability representation and Bayesian inference in a distributed manner, where each attractor network infers the marginal posterior of the corresponding stimulus feature. The stimulus feature can be read out simply with a linear decoder based only on local activities of each network. Simulation experiments confirm our theoretical analysis. The study provides insight into the fundamental neural mechanisms for realizing efficient high-dimensional probabilistic inference.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: ALG-2 interacting protein-X (Alix) is required for activity-dependent bulk endocytosis at brain synapses</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.20.211854v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In chemical synapses undergoing high frequency stimulation, vesicle components can be retrieved from the plasma membrane via a clathrin-independent process called activity dependent bulk endocytosis (ADBE). Alix (ALG-2 interacting protein X)/ PDCD6IP) is an adaptor protein binding to ESCRT and endophilin-A proteins and thereby driving deformation and fission of endosomal and cell surface membranes. In fibroblasts, Alix is required for clathrin-independent endocytosis. Here, using electron microscopy, we show that synapses from mice lacking Alix have subtle defects in presynaptic compartments, translating into flawed synaptic plasticity. Using cultured neurons, we demonstrate that Alix is required for ADBE. We further demonstrate that in order to perform ADBE, Alix must be recruited to synapses by the calcium-binding protein ALG-2 and interact with endophilin-A. Finally, we show that mutant mice lacking Alix in the forebrain undergo less seizures during kainate-induced status epilepticus. Furthermore, propagation of the epileptiform activity to the contralateral side of kainate injection is reduced. These results thus highlight Alix ko mice as an invaluable model to study the exact role of ADBE at synapses undergoing physiological or pathological stimulations.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Diffusion tractography MRI can infer changes in network connectivity in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), but pathological substrates of disconnected tracts have not been well-defined due to a lack of high-resolution imaging with histopathological validation. We developed an ex vivo MRI protocol to analyze tract terminations at 750 micron resolution, followed by histopathologic evaluation of white matter pathology, and applied these methods to a 60-year-old man who died 26 days after TBI. Analysis of 74 cerebral hemispheric white matter regions revealed a heterogeneous distribution of tract disruptions. Associated histopathology identified variable white matter injury with patchy deposition of amyloid precursor protein and loss of neurofilament-positive axonal processes, myelin dissolution, astrogliosis, microgliosis, and perivascular hemosiderin-laden macrophages. Multiple linear regression revealed that tract disruption strongly correlated with neurofilament loss. Ex vivo diffusion MRI can detect tract disruptions in the human brain that reflect axonal injury.</content:encoded>

Classically, visual processing is described as a cascade of local feedforward computations. Feedforward Convolutional Neural Networks (ffCNNs) have shown how powerful such models can be. However, using visual crowding as a well-controlled challenge, we previously showed that no classic model of vision, including ffCNNs, can explain human global shape processing. Here, we show that Capsule Neural Networks (CapsNets), combining ffCNNs with recurrent grouping and segmentation, solve this challenge. We also show that ffCNNs and standard recurrent CNNs do not, suggesting that the grouping and segmentation capabilities of CapsNets are crucial. Furthermore, we provide psychophysical evidence that grouping and segmentation are implemented recurrently in humans, and show that CapsNets reproduce these results well. We discuss why recurrence seems needed to implement grouping and segmentation efficiently. Together, we provide mutually reinforcing psychophysical and computational evidence that a recurrent grouping and segmentation process is essential to understand the visual system and create better models that harness global shape computations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/eskchC4EIf8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Ageing affects a wide range of phenotypes at all scales, but an objective measure of ageing remains challenging, even in simple model organisms. To measure the ageing process, we characterized the sequence of alterations of multiple phenotypes at organismal scale. Hundreds of morphological, postural, and behavioral features were extracted from high-resolution videos. Out of the 1019 features extracted, 896 are ageing biomarkers, defined as those that show a significant correlation with relative age (age divided by lifespan). We used support vector regression to predict age, remaining life and lifespan of individual &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt;. The quality of these predictions (age R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.79; remaining life R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.77; lifespan R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.72) increased with the number of features added to the model, supporting the use of multiple features to quantify ageing. We quantified the rate of ageing as how quickly animals moved through a phenotypic space; we quantified health decline as the slope of the declining predicted remaining life. In both ageing dimensions, we found that short lived-animals aged faster than long-lived animals. In our conditions, for isogenic wild-type worms, the health decline of the individuals was scaled to their lifespan without significant deviation from the average for short- or long-lived animals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Xw3MR4g2MV8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Although there is increasing importance placed on the use of mathematical models for the effective design and management of long-term parasite elimination, it is becoming clear that transmission models are most useful when they reflect the processes pertaining to local infection dynamics as opposed to generalized dynamics. Such localized models must also be developed even when the data required for characterizing local transmission processes are limited or incomplete, as is often the case for neglected tropical diseases, including the disease system studied in this work, viz. lymphatic filariasis (LF). Here, we draw on progress made in the field of computational knowledge discovery to present a reconstructive simulation framework that addresses these challenges by facilitating the discovery of both data and models concurrently in areas where we have insufficient observational data. Using available data from eight sites from Nigeria and elsewhere, we demonstrate that our data-model discovery system is able to estimate local transmission models and missing pre-control infection information using generalized knowledge of filarial transmission dynamics, monitoring survey data, and details of historical interventions. Forecasts of the impacts of interventions carried out in each site made by the models estimated using the reconstructed baseline data matched temporal infection observations and provided useful information regarding when transmission interruption is likely to have occurred. Assessments of elimination and resurgence probabilities based on the models also suggest a protective effect of vector control against the reemergence of LF transmission after stopping drug treatments. The reconstructive computational framework for model and data discovery developed here highlights how coupling models with available data can generate new knowledge about complex, data-limited systems, and ultimately support the effective management of disease programs in the face of critical data gaps.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WnbH81XzJ8c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

NGS studies have uncovered an ever-growing catalog of human variation while leaving an enormous gap between observed variation and experimental characterization of variant function. High-throughput screens powered by NGS have greatly increased the rate of variant functionalization, but the development of comprehensive statistical methods to analyze screen data has lagged. In the massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA), short barcodes are counted by sequencing DNA libraries transfected into cells and the cell’s output RNA in order to simultaneously measure the shifts in transcription induced by thousands of genetic variants. These counts present many statistical challenges, including overdispersion, depth dependence, and uncertain DNA concentrations. So far, the statistical methods used have been rudimentary, employing transformations on count level data and disregarding experimental and technical structure while failing to quantify uncertainty in the statistical model. We have developed an extensive framework for the analysis of NGS functionalization screens available as an R package called malacoda (available from github.com/andrewGhazi/malacoda). Our software implements a probabilistic, fully Bayesian model of screen data. The model uses the negative binomial distribution with gamma priors to model sequencing counts while accounting for effects from input library preparation and sequencing depth. The method leverages the high-throughput nature of the assay to estimate the priors empirically. External annotations such as ENCODE data or DeepSea predictions can also be incorporated to obtain more informative priors–a transformative capability for data integration. The package also includes quality control and utility functions, including automated barcode counting and visualization methods. To validate our method, we analyzed several datasets using malacoda and alternative MPRA analysis methods. These data include experiments from the literature, simulated assays, and primary MPRA data. We also used luciferase assays to experimentally validate several hits from our primary data, as well as variants for which the various methods disagree and variants detectable only with the aid of external annotations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/g1qfmg-6GBM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Tight regulation of gene transcription and mRNA splicing is essential for plant growth and development. Here we demonstrate that a plant-specific protein, EMBRYO DEFECTIVE 1579 (EMB1579), controls multiple growth and developmental processes in &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;. We demonstrate that EMB1579 forms liquid-like condensates both in vitro and in vivo, and the formation of normal-sized EMB1579 condensates is crucial for its cellular functions. We found that some chromosomal and RNA-related proteins interact with EMB1579 compartments, and loss of function of &lt;i&gt;EMB1579&lt;/i&gt; affects global gene transcription and mRNA splicing. Using floral transition as a physiological process, we demonstrate that EMB1579 is involved in &lt;i&gt;FLOWERING LOCUS C&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;FLC&lt;/i&gt;)-mediated repression of flowering. Interestingly, we found that EMB1579 physically interacts with a homologue of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; nucleosome remodeling factor 55-kDa (p55) called MULTIPLE SUPPRESSOR OF IRA 4 (MSI4), which has been implicated in repressing the expression of &lt;i&gt;FLC&lt;/i&gt; by forming a complex with DNA Damage Binding Protein 1 (DDB1) and Cullin 4 (CUL4). This complex, named CUL4-DDB1&lt;sup&gt;MSI4&lt;/sup&gt;, physically associates with a CURLY LEAF (CLF)-containing Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (CLF-PRC2). We further demonstrate that EMB1579 interacts with CUL4 and DDB1, and EMB1579 condensates can recruit and condense MSI4 and DDB1. Furthermore, &lt;i&gt;emb1579&lt;/i&gt; phenocopies &lt;i&gt;msi4&lt;/i&gt; in terms of the level of H3K27 trimethylation on &lt;i&gt;FLC&lt;/i&gt;. This allows us to propose that EMB1579 condensates recruit and condense CUL4-DDB1&lt;sup&gt;MSI4&lt;/sup&gt; complex, which facilitates the interaction of CUL4-DDB1&lt;sup&gt;MSI4&lt;/sup&gt; with CLF-PRC2 and promotes the role of CLF-PRC2 in establishing and/or maintaining the level of H3K27 trimethylation on &lt;i&gt;FLC&lt;/i&gt;. Thus, we report a new mechanism for regulating plant gene transcription, mRNA splicing, and growth and development.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/kco-nDo3w0E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09704</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;At the inception of human brain mapping, two principles of functional anatomy
underwrote most conceptions - and analyses - of distributed brain responses:
namely functional segregation and integration. There are currently two main
approaches to characterising functional integration. The first is a mechanistic
modelling of connectomics in terms of directed effective connectivity that
mediates neuronal message passing and dynamics on neuronal circuits. The second
phenomenological approach usually characterises undirected functional
connectivity (i.e., measurable correlations), in terms of intrinsic brain
networks, self-organised criticality, dynamical instability, etc. This paper
describes a treatment of effective connectivity that speaks to the emergence of
intrinsic brain networks and critical dynamics. It is predicated on the notion
of Markov blankets that play a fundamental role in the self-organisation of far
from equilibrium systems. Using the apparatus of the renormalisation group, we
show that much of the phenomenology found in network neuroscience is an
emergent property of a particular partition of neuronal states, over
progressively larger scales. As such, it offers a way of linking dynamics on
directed graphs to the phenomenology of intrinsic brain networks.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: The Overfitted Brain: Dreams evolved to assist generalization. (arXiv:2007.09560v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09560</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Understanding of the evolved biological function of NREM and slow wave sleep
has advanced considerably in the past decade. However, no equivalent
understanding of REM sleep and dreams has emerged. Contemporary neuroscientific
theories generally view dreams as epiphenomena, and the few proposals for their
biological function are contradicted by the phenomenology of dreams themselves.
Now, the recent advent of deep neural networks (DNNs) has finally provided the
novel conceptual framework within which to understand the evolved function of
dreams. Notably, all DNNs face the issue of overfitting as they learn, which is
when performance on one data set increases but the network's performance fails
to generalize (often measured by the divergence of performance on training vs
testing data sets). This ubiquitous problem in DNNs is often solved by
experimenters via &quot;noise injections&quot; in the form of noisy or corrupted inputs.
The goal of this paper is to argue that the brain faces a similar challenge of
overfitting, and that nightly dreams evolved to combat the brain's overfitting
during its daily learning. That is, dreams are a biological mechanism for
increasing generalizability. Sleep loss, specifically dream loss, leads to an
overfitted brain that can still memorize and learn but fails to generalize
appropriately. Herein this &quot;overfitted brain hypothesis&quot; is explicitly
developed and then compared and contrasted with existing contemporary
neuroscientific theories of dreams. Existing evidence for the hypothesis is
surveyed within both neuroscience and deep learning, and a set of testable
predictions are put forward that can be pursued both in vivo and in silico.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Cyberattacks on Miniature Brain Implants to Disrupt Spontaneous Neural Signaling. (arXiv:2007.09466v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09466</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) arose as systems that merge computing systems
with the human brain to facilitate recording, stimulation, and inhibition of
neural activity. Over the years, the development of BCI technologies has
shifted towards miniaturization of devices that can be seamlessly embedded into
the brain and can target single neuron or small population sensing and control.
We present a motivating example highlighting vulnerabilities of two promising
micron-scale BCI technologies, demonstrating the lack of security and privacy
principles in existing solutions. This situation opens the door to a novel
family of cyberattacks, called neuronal cyberattacks, affecting neuronal
signaling. This paper defines the first two neural cyberattacks, Neuronal
Flooding (FLO) and Neuronal Scanning (SCA), where each threat can affect the
natural activity of neurons. This work implements these attacks in a neuronal
simulator to determine their impact over the spontaneous neuronal behavior,
defining three metrics: number of spikes, percentage of shifts, and dispersion
of spikes. Several experiments demonstrate that both cyberattacks produce a
reduction of spikes compared to spontaneous behavior, generating a rise in
temporal shifts and a dispersion increase. Mainly, SCA presents a higher impact
than FLO in the metrics focused on the number of spikes and dispersion, where
FLO is slightly more damaging, considering the percentage of shifts.
Nevertheless, the intrinsic behavior of each attack generates a differentiation
on how they alter neuronal signaling. FLO is adequate to generate an immediate
impact on the neuronal activity, whereas SCA presents higher effectiveness for
damages to the neural signaling in the long-term.

derived from a novel objective function suggested in our previous work. We
observed that these learning rules suffer from slow convergence for covariance
matrices where some principal eigenvalues are close to each other. Here we
describe a modified objective function with an additional term which mitigates
this convergence problem. We show that the learning rule derived from the
modified objective function inherits all fixed points from the original
learning rule (but may introduce additional ones). Also the stability of the
inherited fixed points remains unchanged. Only the steepness of the objective
function is increased in some directions. Simulations confirm that the
convergence speed can be noticeably improved, depending on the weight factor of
the additional term.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Neighbor-Joining algorithm is a popular distance-based phylogenetic
method that computes a tree metric from a dissimilarity map arising from
biological data. Realizing dissimilarity maps as points in Euclidean space, the
algorithm partitions the input space into polyhedral regions indexed by the
combinatorial type of the trees returned. A full combinatorial description of
these regions has not been found yet; different sequences of Neighbor-Joining
agglomeration events can produce the same combinatorial tree, therefore
associating multiple geometric regions to the same algorithmic output. We
resolve this confusion by defining agglomeration orders on trees, leading to a
bijection between distinct regions of the output space and weighted Motzkin
paths. As a result, we give a formula for the number of polyhedral regions
depending only on the number of taxa. We conclude with a computational
comparison between these polyhedral regions, to unveil biases introduced in any
implementation of the algorithm.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09341</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Applications of neuroimaging methods have substantially contributed to the
scientific understanding of human factors during driving by providing a deeper
insight into the neuro-cognitive aspects of driver brain. This has been
achieved by conducting simulated (and occasionally, field) driving experiments
while collecting driver brain signals of certain types. Here, this sector of
studies is comprehensively reviewed at both macro and micro scales. Different
themes of neuroimaging driving behaviour research are identified and the
findings within each theme are synthesised. The surveyed literature has
reported on applications of four major brain imaging methods. These include
Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), Electroencephalography (EEG),
Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) and Magnetoencephalography (MEG),
with the first two being the most common methods in this domain. While
collecting driver fMRI signal has been particularly instrumental in studying
neural correlates of intoxicated driving (e.g. alcohol or cannabis) or
distracted driving, the EEG method has been predominantly utilised in relation
to the efforts aiming at development of automatic fatigue/drowsiness detection
systems, a topic to which the literature on neuro-ergonomics of driving
particularly has shown a spike of interest within the last few years. The
survey also reveals that topics such as driver brain activity in semi-automated
settings or the brain activity of drivers with brain injuries or chronic
neurological conditions have by contrast been investigated to a very limited
extent. Further, potential topics in relation to driving behaviour are
identified that could benefit from the adoption of neuroimaging methods in
future studies.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We revisit the role of instrumental value as a driver of adaptive behavior.
In active inference, instrumental or extrinsic value is quantified by the
information-theoretic surprisal of a set of observations measuring the extent
to which those observations conform to prior beliefs or preferences. That is,
an agent is expected to seek the type of evidence that is consistent with its
own model of the world. For reinforcement learning tasks, the distribution of
preferences replaces the notion of reward. We explore a scenario in which the
agent learns this distribution in a self-supervised manner. In particular, we
highlight the distinction between observations induced by the environment and
those pertaining more directly to the continuity of an agent in time. We
evaluate our methodology in a dynamic environment with discrete time and
actions. First with a surprisal minimizing model-free agent (in the RL sense)
and then expanding to the model-based case to minimize the expected free
energy.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09291</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The aim of this paper is twofold: (1) to assess whether the construct of
neural representations plays an explanatory role under the variational
free-energy principle and its corollary process theory, active inference; and
(2) if so, to assess which philosophical stance - in relation to the
ontological and epistemological status of representations - is most
appropriate. We focus on non-realist (deflationary and
fictionalist-instrumentalist) approaches. We consider a deflationary account of
mental representation, according to which the explanatorily relevant contents
of neural representations are mathematical, rather than cognitive, and a
fictionalist or instrumentalist account, according to which representations are
scientifically useful fictions that serve explanatory (and other) aims. After
reviewing the free-energy principle and active inference, we argue that the
model of adaptive phenotypes under the free-energy principle can be used to
furnish a formal semantics, enabling us to assign semantic content to specific
phenotypic states (the internal states of a Markovian system that exists far
from equilibrium). We propose a modified fictionalist account: an
organism-centered fictionalism or instrumentalism. We argue that, under the
free-energy principle, pursuing even a deflationary account of the content of
neural representations licenses the appeal to the kind of semantic content
involved in the aboutness or intentionality of cognitive systems; our position
is thus coherent with, but rests on distinct assumptions from, the realist
position. We argue that the free-energy principle thereby explains the
aboutness or intentionality in living systems and hence their capacity to parse
their sensory stream using an ontology or set of semantic factors.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural networks are vulnerable to input perturbations such as additive noise
and adversarial attacks. In contrast, human perception is much more robust to
such perturbations. The Bayesian brain hypothesis states that human brains use
an internal generative model to update the posterior beliefs of the sensory
input. This mechanism can be interpreted as a form of self-consistency between
the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation of the internal generative model and
the external environmental. Inspired by this, we enforce consistency in neural
networks by incorporating generative recurrent feedback. We instantiate it on
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The proposed framework, termed
Convolutional Neural Networks with Feedback (CNN-F), introduces a generative
feedback with latent variables into existing CNN architectures, making
consistent predictions via alternating MAP inference under a Bayesian
framework. CNN-F shows considerably better adversarial robustness over regular
feedforward CNNs on standard benchmarks. In addition, With higher V4 and IT
neural predictivity, CNN-F produces object representations closer to primate
vision than conventional CNNs.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Wavelet Channel Attention Module with a Fusion Network for Single Image Deraining. (arXiv:2007.09163v1 [cs.CV])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09163</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Single image deraining is a crucial problem because rain severely degenerates
the visibility of images and affects the performance of computer vision tasks
like outdoor surveillance systems and intelligent vehicles. In this paper, we
propose the new convolutional neural network (CNN) called the wavelet channel
attention module with a fusion network. Wavelet transform and the inverse
wavelet transform are substituted for down-sampling and up-sampling so feature
maps from the wavelet transform and convolutions contain different frequencies
and scales. Furthermore, feature maps are integrated by channel attention. Our
proposed network learns confidence maps of four sub-band images derived from
the wavelet transform of the original images. Finally, the clear image can be
well restored via the wavelet reconstruction and fusion of the low-frequency
part and high-frequency parts. Several experimental results on synthetic and
real images present that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art
methods.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: A Generic Graph-based Neural Architecture Encoding Scheme for Predictor-based NAS. (arXiv:2004.01899v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01899</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This work proposes a novel Graph-based neural ArchiTecture Encoding Scheme,
a.k.a. GATES, to improve the predictor-based neural architecture search.
Specifically, different from existing graph-based schemes, GATES models the
operations as the transformation of the propagating information, which mimics
the actual data processing of neural architecture. GATES is a more reasonable
modeling of the neural architectures, and can encode architectures from both
the &quot;operation on node&quot; and &quot;operation on edge&quot; cell search spaces
consistently. Experimental results on various search spaces confirm GATES's
effectiveness in improving the performance predictor. Furthermore, equipped
with the improved performance predictor, the sample efficiency of the
predictor-based neural architecture search (NAS) flow is boosted.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Side-Tuning: A Baseline for Network Adaptation via Additive Side Networks. (arXiv:1912.13503v3 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.13503</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When training a neural network for a desired task, one may prefer to adapt a
pre-trained network rather than starting from randomly initialized weights.
Adaptation can be useful in cases when training data is scarce, when a single
learner needs to perform multiple tasks, or when one wishes to encode priors in
the network. The most commonly employed approaches for network adaptation are
fine-tuning and using the pre-trained network as a fixed feature extractor,
among others.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we propose a straightforward alternative: side-tuning.
Side-tuning adapts a pre-trained network by training a lightweight &quot;side&quot;
network that is fused with the (unchanged) pre-trained network via summation.
This simple method works as well as or better than existing solutions and it
resolves some of the basic issues with fine-tuning, fixed features, and other
common approaches. In particular, side-tuning is less prone to overfitting, is
asymptotically consistent, and does not suffer from catastrophic forgetting in
incremental learning. We demonstrate the performance of side-tuning under a
diverse set of scenarios, including incremental learning (iCIFAR, iTaskonomy),
reinforcement learning, imitation learning (visual navigation in Habitat), NLP
question-answering (SQuAD v2), and single-task transfer learning (Taskonomy),
with consistently promising results.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Evolutionary Optimisation of Real-Time Systems and Networks. (arXiv:1905.01888v3 [cs.PF] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01888</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The design space of networked embedded systems is very large, posing
challenges to the optimisation of such platforms when it comes to support
applications with real-time guarantees. Recent research has shown that a number
of inter-related optimisation problems have a critical influence over the
schedulability of a system, i.e. whether all its application components can
execute and communicate by their respective deadlines. Examples of such
optimization problems include task allocation and scheduling, communication
routing and arbitration, memory allocation, and voltage and frequency scaling.
In this paper, we advocate the use of evolutionary approaches to address such
optimization problems, aiming to evolve individuals of increased fitness over
multiple generations of potential solutions. We refer to plentiful evidence
that existing real-time schedulability tests can be used effectively to guide
evolutionary optimisation, either by themselves or in combination with other
metrics such as energy dissipation or hardware overheads. We then push that
concept one step further and consider the possibility of using evolutionary
techniques to evolve the schedulability tests themselves, aiming to support the
verification and optimisation of systems which are too complex for
state-of-the-art (manual) derivation of schedulability tests.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08249</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Currently available methods for extracting saliency maps identify parts of
the input which are the most important to a specific fixed classifier. We show
that this strong dependence on a given classifier hinders their performance. To
address this problem, we propose classifier-agnostic saliency map extraction,
which finds all parts of the image that any classifier could use, not just one
given in advance. We observe that the proposed approach extracts higher quality
saliency maps than prior work while being conceptually simple and easy to
implement. The method sets the new state of the art result for localization
task on the ImageNet data, outperforming all existing weakly-supervised
localization techniques, despite not using the ground truth labels at the
inference time. The code reproducing the results is available at

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00726</link>
	<content:encoded>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Deep brain stimulation is an established method for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders. To elicit the underlying mechanisms and explore new stimulation targets, rodent models are necessary. Cable bound external stimulation or portable devices limit movement of the animals and influence behavioral experiments. Therefore, implantable, individually programmed devices are required.&lt;/p&gt;Experimental procedure&lt;p&gt;The stimulator consists of an 8bit-microcontroller mounted on a square electrical board (10 × 10 mm). External control is enabled by a magnetic reed contact, as running control serves a white LED, running modes are displayed by flash codes. Stimulation parameters could be programmed in the range of pulse width: 60–500 μs, amplitude: up to 300 μA and frequency: 10–500 Hz. Power is supplied by two standard batteries. The device was implanted in 8–10 weeks old BALBc-mice. Functionality was examined by electrical stimulation of nucleus accumbens area with standard parameters for mice and determination of c-fos levels in vitro in brain slices.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The implanted microstimulators were well-tolerated by the mice, without impairment of free movement. Coating, external control, and monitoring of function with LED flash code proved to be fully adequate. Stimulation with standard stimulating parameters of nucleus accumbens elicited strong c-fos elevation on simulation site.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;We present a fully implantable stimulator for freely moving mice that meets the urgent need for further research on the effects of deep brain stimulation in rodent models. It offers the possibility to conduct behavioral experiments for up to 30 days of stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Identification of Alzheimer's EEG With a WVG Network-Based Fuzzy Learning Approach</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00641</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A novel analytical framework combined fuzzy learning and complex network approaches is proposed for the identification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with multichannel scalp-recorded electroencephalograph (EEG) signals. Weighted visibility graph (WVG) algorithm is first applied to transform each channel EEG into network and its topological parameters were further extracted. Statistical analysis indicates that AD and normal subjects show significant difference in the structure of WVG network and thus can be used to identify Alzheimer's disease. Taking network parameters as input features, a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy model is established to identify AD's EEG signal. Three feature sets—single parameter from multi-networks, multi-parameters from single network, and multi-parameters from multi-networks—are considered as input vectors. The number and order of input features in each set is optimized with various feature selection methods. Classification results demonstrate the ability of network-based TSK fuzzy classifiers and the feasibility of three input feature sets. The highest accuracy that can be achieved is 95.28% for single parameter from four networks, 93.41% for three parameters from single network. In particular, multi-parameters from the multi-networks set obtained the best result. The highest accuracy, 97.12%, is achieved with five features selected from four networks. The combination of network and fuzzy learning can highly improve the efficiency of AD's EEG identification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Automatic Reconstruction of Mitochondria and Endoplasmic Reticulum in Electron Microscopy Volumes by Deep Learning</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00599</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Together, mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) occupy more than 20% of a cell's volume, and morphological abnormality may lead to cellular function disorders. With the rapid development of large-scale electron microscopy (EM), manual contouring and three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of these organelles has previously been accomplished in biological studies. However, manual segmentation of mitochondria and ER from EM images is time consuming and thus unable to meet the demands of large data analysis. Here, we propose an automated pipeline for mitochondrial and ER reconstruction, including the mitochondrial and ER contact sites (MAMs). We propose a novel recurrent neural network to detect and segment mitochondria and a fully residual convolutional network to reconstruct the ER. Based on the sparse distribution of synapses, we use mitochondrial context information to rectify the local misleading results and obtain 3D mitochondrial reconstructions. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: The Potential of Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy-Based Neurofeedback—A Systematic Review and Recommendations for Best Practice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00594</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: The effects of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-neurofeedback on brain activation and behaviors have been studied extensively in the past. More recently, researchers have begun to investigate the effects of functional near-infrared spectroscopy-based neurofeedback (fNIRS-neurofeedback). FNIRS is a functional neuroimaging technique based on brain hemodynamics, which is easy to use, portable, inexpensive, and has reduced sensitivity to movement artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: We provide the first systematic review and database of fNIRS-neurofeedback studies, synthesizing findings from 22 peer-reviewed studies (including a total of N = 441 participants; 337 healthy, 104 patients). We (1) give a comprehensive overview of how fNIRS-neurofeedback training protocols were implemented, (2) review the online signal-processing methods used, (3) evaluate the quality of studies using pre-set methodological and reporting quality criteria and also present statistical sensitivity/power analyses, (4) investigate the effectiveness of fNIRS-neurofeedback in modulating brain activation, and (5) review its effectiveness in changing behavior in healthy and pathological populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results and discussion: (1–2) Published studies are heterogeneous (e.g., neurofeedback targets, investigated populations, applied training protocols, and methods). (3) Large randomized controlled trials are still lacking. In view of the novelty of the field, the quality of the published studies is moderate. We identified room for improvement in reporting important information and statistical power to detect realistic effects. (4) Several studies show that people can regulate hemodynamic signals from cortical brain regions with fNIRS-neurofeedback and (5) these studies indicate the feasibility of modulating motor control and prefrontal brain functioning in healthy participants and ameliorating symptoms in clinical populations (stroke, ADHD, autism, and social anxiety). However, valid conclusions about specificity or potential clinical utility are premature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Due to the advantages of practicability and relatively low cost, fNIRS-neurofeedback might provide a suitable and powerful alternative to EEG and fMRI neurofeedback and has great potential for clinical translation of neurofeedback. Together with more rigorous research and reporting practices, further methodological improvements may lead to a more solid understanding of fNIRS-neurofeedback. Future research will benefit from exploiting the advantages of fNIRS, which offers unique opportunities for neurofeedback research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Gender Differences Are Encoded Differently in the Structure and Function of the Human Brain Revealed by Multimodal MRI</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00244</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Despite widely reported gender differences in both brain structure and brain function, very few studies have examined the relationship between the structural differences and the functional differences between genders. Here, different imaging measures including both structural [i.e., gray matter volume (GMV)] and functional [i.e., regional homogeneity (ReHo) and functional connectivity (FC)] measures were employed to detect the gender differences in the human brain based on univariate and multivariate approaches with a sample of 290 healthy adults (155 females). The univariate analyses revealed that gender differences were detected in both structural (i.e., GMV) and functional (ReHo or FC) imaging measures, mainly manifested as greater values in females than in males in regions of the frontal, parietal, occipital lobes and cerebellum. Importantly, there was little overlap between the differences detected in GMV and those detected in ReHo and FC, and their differences between genders were not correlated with each other. The multivariate pattern analyses revealed that each of these measures had discriminative power to successfully distinguish between genders (classification accuracy: 94.3%, 90.73%, and 83.89% for GMV, ReHo, and FC, respectively) and their combination further improved the classification performance (96.6%). Our results suggest that gender differences are encoded in both brain structure and brain function, but in different manners. The finding of different and complementary information contained in structural and functional differences between genders highlights the complex relationship between brain structure and function, which may underlie the complex nature of gender differences in behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Directional Control Mechanisms in Multidirectional Step Initiating Tasks</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00178</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Typical anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) in forward gait or step initiation tasks to prepare for possible disturbances caused by prime voluntary movements and to accelerate the body forward have been previously reported. However, it is not clear how wide the variations in step directions are differentiated and controlled in non-forward step initiation tasks during the APA phase. The main goal of this study is to explain the directional control mechanisms by investigating the APA of step initiation tasks in forward, diagonal, lateral, and posterior directions. The center of pressure (COP) trajectories and related muscle (soleus, tibialis anterior, and gluteus medius of both lower limbs) activities during the APA of step initiation tasks in nine different directions were analyzed in six healthy young males. Posterior shifts of COP during APA decreased as the direction became more lateral (0° to 90°). For posterior step initiations, COP moved anteriorly from the initial position to accelerate the center of mass of the whole body (COM) backward. Lateral shifts of COP toward the stepping foot during APA decreased as the stepping direction became more lateral (from 0° to 45° and from 180° to 113°) while it plateaued to about zero in the direction from 45° to 113°. Both anteroposterior and lateral displacements of COP in APA were nonlinearly modulated to each direction, but they were linearly related to the anteroposterior and mediolateral component of the velocities of COM at the take-off of the stance foot. Thus, the scaling of APA, reflected in the anteroposterior and lateral displacements of COP and the temporal sequence of selected muscle activities, was based on the anteroposterior and mediolateral components of the take-off velocity of COM that ultimately controls the direction of steps.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Cancer Risk Analysis Based on Improved Probabilistic Neural Network</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00058</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The problem of cancer risk analysis is of great importance to health-service providers and medical researchers. In this study, we propose a novel Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm based on the probabilistic framework, which aims to investigate patient patterns associated with their disease development. Compared to the traditional ANN where input features are directly extracted from raw data, the proposed probabilistic ANN manipulates original inputs according to their probability distribution. More precisely, the Naïve Bayes and Markov chain models are used to approximate the posterior distribution of the raw inputs, which provides a useful estimation of subsequent disease development. Later, this distribution information is further leveraged as additional input to train ANN. Additionally, to reduce the training cost and to boost the generalization capability, a sparse training strategy is also introduced. Experimentally, one of the largest cancer-related datasets is employed in this study. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, the proposed algorithm achieves a much better outcome, in terms of the prediction accuracy of subsequent disease development. The result also reveals the potential impact of patients' disease sequence on their future risk management.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00223</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Evidences indicate that exosomes-mediated delivery of microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) is involved in the neurogenesis of stroke. This study was to investigate the role of exosomal miRNAs in non-drug therapy of electro-acupuncture (EA) regulating endogenous neural stem cells for stroke recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: The model of focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion in rats were established by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and treated by EA. The exosomes were extracted from peri-ischemic striatum and identified by exosomal biomarkers, and detected differentially expressed miRNAs with microarray chip. Primary stem cells were cultured, and oxygen–glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R) was used to mimic vitro ischemic injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The levels of exosomal biomarkers TSG101 and CD81 were increased in peri-ischemic striatum after EA treatment, and we revealed 25 differentially expressed miRNAs in isolated exosomes, of which miR-146b was selected for further analysis, and demonstrated that EA increased miR-146b expression and its inhibitors could block the effects. Subsequently, we confirmed that EA upregulated miR-146b expression to promote neural stem cells differentiation into neurons in peri-ischemic striatum. In vitro, it was verified that OGD/R hindered neural stem cells differentiation, and miR-146b inhibitors furtherly suppressed its differentiation, simultaneously NeuroD1 was involved in neural stem cells differentiation into neurons. Moreover, in vivo we found EA promoted NeuroD1-mediated neural stem cells differentiation via miR-146b. In addition, EA also could improve neurological deficits through miR-146b after ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: EA promotes the differentiation of endogenous neural stem cells via exosomal miR-146b to improve neurological injury after ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Involvement of the Ventrolateral Periaqueductal Gray Matter-Central Medial Thalamic Nucleus-Basolateral Amygdala Pathway in Neuropathic Pain Regulation of Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00032</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The central medial nucleus (CM), a prominent cell group of the intralaminar nuclei (ILN) of the thalamus, and the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray matter (vlPAG) are two major components of the medial pain system. Whether vlPAG and CM are input sources of nociceptive information to the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and whether they are involved in neuropathic pain regulation remain unclear. Clarifying the hierarchical organization of these subcortical nuclei (vlPAG, CM, and BLA) can enhance our understanding on the neural circuits for pain regulation. Behavioral test results showed that a CM lesion made by kainic acid (KA) injection could effectively alleviate mechanical hyperalgesia 4, 6, and 8 days after spared nerve injury (SNI) surgery, with the symptoms returning after 10 days. Morphological studies revealed that: (1) the CM received afferents from vlPAG and sent efferents to BLA, indicating that an indirect vlPAG–CM–BLA pathway exists; (2) such CM–BLA projections were primarily excitatory glutamatergic neurons as revealed by fluorescence in situ hybridization; (3) the fibers originated from the CM-formed close contacts with both excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the BLA; and (4) BLA-projecting CM neurons expressed Fos induced by SNI and formed close contacts with fibers from vlPAG, suggesting that the vlPAG–CM–BLA indirect pathway was activated in neuropathic pain conditions. Finally, the vlPAG–CM–BLA indirect pathway was further confirmed using anterograde and monosynaptic virus tracing investigation. In summary, our present results provide behavioral and morphological evidence that the indirect vlPAG–CM–BLA pathway might be a novel pain pathway involved in neuropathic pain regulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Validation of Multifactor Model of Plasma Aβ42 and Total-Tau in Combination With MoCA for Diagnosing Probable Alzheimer Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00212</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer disease (AD) has an insidious onset and heterogeneous clinical symptoms. The well-accepted biomarkers for clinical diagnosis of AD include β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition and pathologic tau level within cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and imaging AD pathology such as positive emission tomography (PET) imaging of the amyloid-binding agent Pittsburgh compound B (PET-PiB). However, the high expense and invasive nature of these methods highly limit their wide usage in clinic practice. Therefore, it is imperious to develop less expensive and invasive methods, and plasma biomarkers are the premium targets. In the current study, we utilized a single-blind comparison method; all the probable AD cases met the core clinical National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer’s Association (NIA-AA) criteria and validated by PET-PiB. We used ultrasensitive immunomagnetic reduction (IMR) assays to measure plasma Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; and total-tau (t-tau) levels, in combination with different variables including Aβ42 × t-tau value, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). We used logistic regression to analyze the effect of all these variables in the algorism. Our results showed that (1) plasma Aβ42 and t-tau are efficient biomarkers for AD diagnosis using IMR platform, whereas Aβ42 × t-tau value is more efficient for discriminating control and AD; (2) in the control group, Aβ42 level and age demonstrated strong negative correlation; Aβ42 × t-tau value and age demonstrated significant negative correlation; (3) in the AD group, t-tau level and MMSE score demonstrated strong negative correlation; (4) using the model that Aβ42, Aβ42 × t-tau, and MoCA as the variable to generate receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, cutoff value = 0.48, sensitivity = 0.973, specificity = 0.982, area under the curve (AUC) = 0.986, offered better categorical efficacy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC. The multifactor model of plasma Aβ42 and t-tau in combination with MoCA can be a viable model separate health and AD subjects in clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Motor neuron diseases (MNDs) are fatal diseases characterized by loss of motor neurons in the brain cortex, in the bulbar region, and/or in the anterior horns of the spinal cord. While generally sporadic, inherited forms linked to mutant genes encoding altered RNA/protein products have also been described. Several different mechanisms have been found altered or dysfunctional in MNDs, like the protein quality control (PQC) system. In this review, we will discuss how the PQC system is affected in two MNDs—spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)—and how this affects the clearance of aberrantly folded proteins, which accumulate in motor neurons, inducing dysfunctions and their death. In addition, we will discuss how the PQC system can be targeted to restore proper cell function, enhancing the survival of affected cells in MNDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59737</link>
	<content:encoded>Lissencephaly (‘smooth brain’) is a severe brain disease associated with numerous symptoms, including cognitive impairment, and shortened lifespan. The main causative gene of this disease – lissencephaly-1 (LIS1) – has been a focus of intense scrutiny since its first identification almost 30 years ago. LIS1 is a critical regulator of the microtubule motor cytoplasmic dynein, which transports numerous cargoes throughout the cell, and is a key effector of nuclear and neuronal transport during brain development. Here, we review the role of LIS1 in cellular dynein function and discuss recent key findings that have revealed a new mechanism by which this molecule influences dynein-mediated transport. In addition to reconciling prior observations with this new model for LIS1 function, we also discuss phylogenetic data that suggest that LIS1 may have coevolved with an autoinhibitory mode of cytoplasmic dynein regulation.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59709</link>
	<content:encoded>Maladaptive responses to stress are a hallmark of alcohol use disorder, but the mechanisms that underlie this are not well characterized. Here we show that kappa opioid receptor signaling in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is a critical molecular substrate underlying abnormal stress responses to predator odor following heavy alcohol drinking. Exposure to predator odor during protracted withdrawal from intermittent alcohol drinking resulted in enhanced prefrontal cortex (PFC)-driven excitation of prodynorphin-containing neurons in the BNST. Furthermore, deletion of prodynorphin in the BNST and chemogenetic inhibition of the PFC-BNST pathway restored abnormal responses to predator odor in alcohol-exposed mice. These findings suggest that increased corticolimbic drive may promote abnormal stress behavioral responses to predator odor during protracted withdrawal. Various nodes of this PFC-BNST dynorphin-related circuit may serve as potential targets for potential therapeutic mediation as well as biomarkers of negative responses to stress following heavy alcohol drinking.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Changes in ferrous iron and glutathione promote ferroptosis and frailty in aging Caenorhabditis elegans</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56580</link>
	<content:encoded>All eukaryotes require iron. Replication, detoxification, and a cancer-protective form of regulated cell death termed &lt;i&gt;ferroptosis&lt;/i&gt;, all depend on iron metabolism. Ferrous iron accumulates over adult lifetime in &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we show that glutathione depletion is coupled to ferrous iron elevation in these animals, and that both occur in late life to prime cells for ferroptosis. We demonstrate that blocking ferroptosis, either by inhibition of lipid peroxidation or by limiting iron retention, mitigates age-related cell death and markedly increases lifespan and healthspan. Temporal scaling of lifespan is not evident when ferroptosis is inhibited, consistent with this cell death process acting at specific life phases to induce organismal frailty, rather than contributing to a constant aging rate. Because excess age-related iron elevation in somatic tissue, particularly in brain, is thought to contribute to degenerative disease, post-developmental interventions to limit ferroptosis may promote healthy aging.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56383</link>
	<content:encoded>Stem cells reside in and rely upon their niche to maintain stemness but must balance self-renewal with the production of daughters that leave the niche to differentiate. We discovered a mechanism of stem cell niche exit in the canonical &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; distal tip cell (DTC) germ stem cell niche mediated by previously unobserved, thin, membranous protrusions of the adjacent somatic gonad cell pair (Sh1). A disproportionate number of germ cell divisions were observed at the DTC-Sh1 interface. Stem-like and differentiating cell fates segregated across this boundary. Spindles polarized, pairs of daughter cells oriented between the DTC and Sh1, and Sh1 grew over the Sh1-facing daughter. Impeding Sh1 growth by RNAi to cofilin and Arp2/3 perturbed the DTC-Sh1 interface, reduced germ cell proliferation, and shifted a differentiation marker. Because Sh1 membrane protrusions eluded detection for decades, it is possible that similar structures actively regulate niche exit in other systems.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>In prebiotic evolution, molecular self-replicators are considered to develop into diverse, complex living organisms. The appearance of parasitic replicators is believed inevitable in this process. However, the role of parasitic replicators in prebiotic evolution remains elusive. Here, we demonstrated experimental coevolution of RNA self-replicators (host RNAs) and emerging parasitic replicators (parasitic RNAs) using an RNA-protein replication system we developed. During a long-term replication experiment, a clonal population of the host RNA turned into an evolving host-parasite ecosystem through the continuous emergence of new types of host and parasitic RNAs produced by replication errors. The host and parasitic RNAs diversified into at least two and three different lineages, respectively, and they exhibited evolutionary arms-race dynamics. The parasitic RNA accumulated unique mutations, thus adding a new genetic variation to the whole replicator ensemble. These results provide the first experimental evidence that the coevolutionary interplay between host-parasite molecules plays a key role in generating diversity and complexity in prebiotic molecular evolution.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Molecular determinants of large cargo transport into the nucleus</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55963</link>
	<content:encoded>Nucleocytoplasmic transport is tightly regulated by the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Among the thousands of molecules that cross the NPC, even very large (&amp;gt;15 nm) cargoes such as pathogens, mRNAs and pre-ribosomes can pass the NPC intact. For these cargoes, there is little quantitative understanding of the requirements for their nuclear import, especially the role of multivalent binding to transport receptors via nuclear localisation sequences (NLSs) and the effect of size on import efficiency. Here, we assayed nuclear import kinetics of 30 large cargo models based on four capsid-like particles in the size range of 17–36 nm, with tuneable numbers of up to 240 NLSs. We show that the requirements for nuclear transport can be recapitulated by a simple two-parameter biophysical model that correlates the import flux with the energetics of large cargo transport through the NPC. Together, our results reveal key molecular determinants of large cargo import in cells.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: A taxonomy of seizure dynamotypes</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55632</link>
	<content:encoded>Seizures are a disruption of normal brain activity present across a vast range of species and conditions. We introduce an organizing principle that leads to the first objective Taxonomy of Seizure Dynamics (TSD) based on bifurcation theory. The ‘dynamotype’ of a seizure is the dynamic composition that defines its observable characteristics, including how it starts, evolves and ends. Analyzing over 2000 focal-onset seizures from multiple centers, we find evidence of all 16 dynamotypes predicted in TSD. We demonstrate that patients’ dynamotypes evolve during their lifetime and display complex but systematic variations including hierarchy (certain types are more common), non-bijectivity (a patient may display multiple types) and pairing preference (multiple types may occur during one seizure). TSD provides a way to stratify patients in complement to present clinical classifications, a language to describe the most critical features of seizure dynamics, and a framework to guide future research focused on dynamical properties.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Phylogenetic variation in cortical layer II immature neuron reservoir of mammals</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55456</link>
	<content:encoded>The adult mammalian brain is mainly composed of mature neurons. A limited amount of stem cell-driven neurogenesis persists in postnatal life and is reduced in large-brained species. Another source of immature neurons in adult brains is cortical layer II. These cortical immature neurons (cINs) retain developmentally undifferentiated states in adulthood, though they are generated before birth. Here, the occurrence, distribution and cellular features of cINs were systematically studied in 12 diverse mammalian species spanning from small-lissencephalic to large-gyrencephalic brains. In spite of well-preserved morphological and molecular features, the distribution of cINs was highly heterogeneous, particularly in neocortex. While virtually absent in rodents, they are present in the entire neocortex of many other species and their linear density in cortical layer II generally increased with brain size. These findings suggest an evolutionary developmental mechanism for plasticity that varies among mammalian species, granting a reservoir of young cells for the cerebral cortex.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Early life adversity decreases pre-adolescent fear expression by accelerating amygdala PV cell development</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55263</link>
	<content:encoded>Early life adversity (ELA) is associated with increased risk for stress-related disorders later in life. The link between ELA and risk for psychopathology is well established but the developmental mechanisms remain unclear. Using a mouse model of resource insecurity, limited bedding (LB), we tested the effects of LB on the development of fear learning and neuronal structures involved in emotional regulation, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA). LB delayed the ability of peri-weanling (21 days old) mice to express, but not form, an auditory conditioned fear memory. LB accelerated the developmental emergence of parvalbumin (PV) positive cells in the BLA and increased anatomical connections between PL and BLA. Fear expression in LB mice was rescued through optogenetic inactivation of PV positive cells in the BLA. The current results provide a model of transiently blunted emotional reactivity in early development, with latent fear-associated memories emerging later in adolescence.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Sensory restoration by epidural stimulation of the lateral spinal cord in upper-limb amputees</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54349</link>
	<content:encoded>Restoring somatosensory feedback to people with limb amputations is crucial to improve prosthetic control. Multiple studies have demonstrated that peripheral nerve stimulation and targeted reinnervation can provide somatotopically relevant sensory feedback. While effective, the surgical procedures required for these techniques remain a major barrier to translatability. Here, we demonstrate in four people with upper-limb amputation that epidural spinal cord stimulation (SCS), a common clinical technique to treat pain, evoked somatosensory percepts that were perceived as emanating from the missing arm and hand. Over up to 29 days, stimulation evoked sensory percepts in consistent locations in the missing hand regardless of time since amputation or level of amputation. Evoked sensations were occasionally described as naturalistic (e.g. touch or pressure), but were often paresthesias. Increasing stimulus amplitude increased the perceived intensity linearly, without increasing area of the sensations. These results demonstrate the potential of SCS as a tool to restore somatosensation after amputations.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54066</link>
	<content:encoded>Cancer clone evolution takes place within tissue ecosystem habitats. But, how exactly tumors arise from a few malignant cells within an intact epithelium is a central, yet unanswered question. This is mainly due to the inaccessibility of this process to longitudinal imaging together with a lack of systems that model the progression of a fraction of transformed cells within a tissue. Here, we developed a new methodology based on primary mouse mammary epithelial acini, where oncogenes can be switched on in single cells within an otherwise normal epithelial cell layer. We combine this stochastic breast tumor induction model with inverted light-sheet imaging to study single-cell behavior for up to four days and analyze cell fates utilizing a newly developed image-data analysis workflow. The power of this integrated approach is illustrated by us finding that small local clusters of transformed cells form tumors while isolated transformed cells do not.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Calretinin and calbindin architecture of the midline thalamus associated with prefrontal-hippocampal circuitry</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.21.214973v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The midline thalamus bi-directionally connects the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus (HC) creating a unique cortico-thalamo-cortico circuit fundamental to memory and executive function. While the anatomical connectivity of midline thalamus has been thoroughly investigated, little is known about its cellular organization within each nucleus. Here we used immunohistological techniques to examine cellular distributions in the midline thalamus based on the calcium binding proteins parvalbumin (PV), calretinin (CR), and calbindin (CB). We also examined these calcium binding proteins in a population of reuniens cells known to project to both mPFC and HC using a dual fluorescence retrograde adenoassociated virus (AAV) based tracing approach. These dual reuniens mPFC-HC projecting cells, in particular, are thought to be important for synchronizing mPFC and HC activity. First, we confirmed the absence of PV+ neurons in the midline thalamus. Second, we found a common pattern of CR+ and CB+ cells throughout midline thalamus with CR+ cells running along the nearby third ventricle (3V) and penetrating the midline. CB+ cells were consistently more lateral and toward the middle of the dorsal-ventral extent of the midline thalamus. Notably, single-labeled CR+ and CB+ zones were partially overlapping and included dual-labeled CR+/CB+ cells. Within RE, we also observed a CR and CB subzone specific diversity. Interestingly, dual mPFC-HC projecting neurons in RE expressed none of the calcium binding proteins examined, but were contained in nests of CR+ and CB+ cells. Overall, the midline thalamus was well organized into CR+ and CB+ rich zones distributed throughout the region, with dual mPFC-HC projecting cells in reuniens representing a unique cell population. These results provide a cytoarchitectural organization in the midline thalamus based on calcium binding protein expression, and sets the stage for future cell-type specific interrogations of the functional role of these different cell populations in mPFC-HC interactions.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Rostro-caudal specificity of corticospinal tract (CST) projections from different areas of the cortex was assessed by retrograde labeling with fluorogold and retrograde transfection following retro-AAV/Cre injection into the spinal cord of tdT-reporter mice. Injections at C5 led to retrograde labeling of neurons throughout forelimb area of the sensorimotor cortex, the rostral forebrain area (RFA), and a region in the lateral cortex near the barrel field. Injections at L2 led to retrograde labeling of neurons in the posterior sensorimotor cortex (hindlimb area) but not the RFA or lateral cortex. With BDA injections into the main sensorimotor cortex (forelimb region), labeled axons terminated selectively at cervical levels. With BDA injections into caudal sensorimotor cortex (hindlimb region), labeled axons passed through cervical levels without sending collaterals into the gray matter and then elaborated terminal arbors at thoracic-sacral levels. With BDA injections into the RFA and lateral cortex near the barrel field, labeled axons terminated at high cervical levels. Axons from medial sensorimotor cortex terminated primarily in intermediate laminae; Axons from lateral sensorimotor cortex terminated primarily in deep layers of the dorsal horn. One of the descending pathways seen in rats (the ventral CST) was not observed in most mice.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.21.214353v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Mood plays an important role in our life which is illustrated by the disruptive impact of aberrant mood states in depression. Although vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has been shown to improve symptoms of depression, the exact mechanism is still elusive, and it is an open question whether non-invasive VNS could be used to swiftly and robustly improve mood. Here, we investigated the effect of left- and right-sided transcutaneous auricular VNS (taVNS) versus a sham control condition on mood after exertion of physical and cognitive effort in 82 healthy participants (randomized cross-over design). Using linear mixed-effects and hierarchical Bayesian analyses of mood ratings, we found that 90 min of either left-sided or right-sided taVNS improved positive mood (b = 5.11, 95% credible interval, CI [1.39, 9.01], 9.6% improvement relative to the mood intercept, BF10 = 7.69, pLME = .017), yet only during the post stimulation phase. Moreover, lower baseline scores of positive mood were associated with greater taVNS-induced improvements in motivation (r = -.42, 95% CI [-.58, -.21], BF10 = 249). We conclude that taVNS boosts mood after a prolonged period of effort exertion with concurrent stimulation and that acute motivational effects of taVNS are partly dependent on initial mood states. Collectively, our results show that taVNS may help quickly improve affect after a mood challenge, potentially by modulating interoceptive signals contributing to reappraisal of effortful behavior. This suggests that taVNS could be a useful add-on to current behavioral therapies.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.21.214296v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Leptin regulates hypothalamic POMC+ (pro-opiomelanocortin) neurons by inducing TRPC (Transient Receptor Potential Cation) channel-mediate membrane depolarization. Here we assessed the role of T-type channels on POMC neuron excitability and leptin-induced depolarization in vitro. We demonstrate T-type currents are indispensable for both processes, as treatment with NNC-55-0396 prevented the membrane depolarization and rheobase changes induced by leptin in cultured mouse POMC neurons. Furthermore, we demonstrate TRPC1/C5 channels and CaV3.1 and CaV3.2 channels co-exist in complex. The functional relevance of this complex was corroborated using intracellular Ca2+ chelators; intracellular BAPTA (but not EGTA) application was sufficient to preclude POMC neuron excitability by preventing leptin-induced calcium influx through TRPC channels and T-type channel function. We conclude T-type channels are integral in POMC neuron excitability. Leptin activation of TRPC channels existing in a macromolecular complex with T-type channels recruits the latter by locally-induced membrane depolarization, further depolarizing POMC neurons, triggering action potentials and excitability.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Swallowing is a unique movement because orchestration of voluntary and involuntary movement, and coordination between sensory input and motor output are indispensable. We hypothesized that neural mechanism of them were revealed by cortical oscillatory changes. Eight epileptic participants fitted with intracranial electrodes over the orofacial cortex were asked to swallow a water bolus, and cortical oscillatory changes were investigated. At the boundary time between voluntary and involuntary swallowing, high {gamma} (75-150 Hz) power achieved the peak, and subsequently, the power decreased. High {gamma} power increases (burst) were associated with both sensory input and motor output. However, phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) revealed that sensory-related coupling appeared during high {gamma}-bursts, and motor-related coupling appeared before high {gamma}-bursts. The peak of high {gamma} power suggests switching of swallowing driving force from the cortex to the brain stem, and PAC findings suggest that motor-related coupling induces later motor-related high {gamma}-activities representing endogenous neural processing.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.21.213694v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Many studies speak in favor of a rhythmic mode of listening, by which the encoding of acoustic information is structured by rhythmic neural processes at the time scale of about 1 to 4 Hz. Indeed, psychophysical data suggest that humans sample acoustic information in extended soundscapes not uniformly, but weigh the evidence at different moments for their perceptual decision at the time scale of about 2 Hz. We here test the critical prediction that such rhythmic perceptual sampling is directly related to the state of ongoing brain activity prior to the stimulus. Human participants judged the direction of frequency sweeps in 1.2 s long soundscapes while their EEG was recorded. Computing the perceptual weights attributed to different epochs within these soundscapes contingent on the phase or power of pre-stimulus oscillatory EEG activity revealed a direct link between the 4Hz EEG phase and power prior to the stimulus and the phase of the rhythmic component of these perceptual weights. Hence, the temporal pattern by which the acoustic information is sampled over time for behavior is directly related to pre-stimulus brain activity in the delta/theta band. These results close a gap in the mechanistic picture linking ongoing delta band activity with their role in shaping the segmentation and perceptual influence of subsequent acoustic information.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Local homeostatic regulation of the spectral radius of echo-state networks</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.21.213660v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Recurrent cortical network dynamics plays a crucial role for sequential information processing in the brain. While the theoretical framework of reservoir computing provides a conceptual basis for the understanding of recurrent neural computation, it often requires manual adjustments of global network parameters, in particular of the spectral radius of the recurrent synaptic weight matrix. Being a mathematical and relatively complex quantity, the spectral radius is not readily accessible to biological neural networks, which generally adhere to the principle that information about the network state should either be encoded in local intrinsic dynamical quantities (e.g. membrane potentials), or transmitted via synaptic connectivity. We present two synaptic scaling rules for echo state networks that solely rely on locally accessible variables. Both rules work online, in the presence of a continuous stream of input signals. The first rule, termed flow control, is based on a local comparison between the mean squared recurrent membrane potential and the mean squared activity of the neuron itself. It is derived from a global scaling condition on the dynamic flow of neural activities and requires the separability of external and recurrent input currents. We gained further insight into the adaptation dynamics of flow control by using a mean field approximation on the variances of neural activities that allowed us to describe the interplay between network activity and adaptation as a two-dimensional dynamical system. The second rule that we considered, variance control, directly regulates the variance of neural activities by locally scaling the recurrent synaptic weights. The target set point of this homeostatic mechanism is dynamically determined as a function of the variance of the locally measured external input. This functional relation was derived from the same mean-field approach that was used to describe the approximate dynamics of flow control. The effectiveness of the presented mechanisms was tested numerically using different external input protocols. The network performance after adaptation was evaluated by training the network to perform a time delayed XOR operation on binary sequences. As our main result, we found that flow control can reliably regulate the spectral radius under different input statistics, but precise tuning is negatively affected by interneural correlations. Furthermore, flow control showed a consistent task performance over a wide range of input strengths/variances. Variance control, on the other side, did not yield the desired spectral radii with the same precision. Moreover, task performance was less consistent across different input strengths. Given the better performance and simpler mathematical form of flow control, we concluded that a local control of the spectral radius via an implicit adaptation scheme is a realistic alternative to approaches using classical &quot;set point&quot; homeostatic feedback controls of neural firing.</content:encoded>

Machine learning algorithms trained to predict the regulatory activity of nucleic acid sequences have revealed principles of gene regulation and guided genetic variation analysis. While the human genome has been extensively annotated and studied, model organisms have been less explored. Model organism genomes offer both additional training sequences and unique annotations describing tissue and cell states unavailable in humans. Here, we develop a strategy to train deep convolutional neural networks simultaneously on multiple genomes and apply it to learn sequence predictors for large compendia of human and mouse data. Training on both genomes improves gene expression prediction accuracy on held out and variant sequences. We further demonstrate a novel and powerful approach to apply mouse regulatory models to analyze human genetic variants associated with molecular phenotypes and disease. Together these techniques unleash thousands of non-human epigenetic and transcriptional profiles toward more effective investigation of how gene regulation affects human disease.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kM70y0VLd6s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: A novel riboswitch classification based on imbalanced sequences achieved by machine learning</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/o0W5kjlLax4/article</link>

Riboswitch, a part of regulatory mRNA (50–250nt in length), has two main classes: aptamer and expression platform. One of the main challenges raised during the classification of riboswitch is imbalanced data. That is a circumstance in which the records of a sequences of one group are very small compared to the others. Such circumstances lead classifier to ignore minority group and emphasize on majority ones, which results in a skewed classification. We considered sixteen riboswitch families, to be in accord with recent riboswitch classification work, that contain imbalanced sequences. The sequences were split into training and test set using a newly developed pipeline. From 5460 &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-mers (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; value 1 to 6) produced, 156 features were calculated based on &lt;i&gt;CfsSubsetEval&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;BestFirst&lt;/i&gt; function found in WEKA 3.8. Statistically tested result was significantly difference between balanced and imbalanced sequences (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). Besides, each algorithm also showed a significant difference in sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and macro F-score when used in both groups (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). Several &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-mers clustered from heat map were discovered to have biological functions and motifs at the different positions like interior loops, terminal loops and helices. They were validated to have a biological function and some are riboswitch motifs. The analysis has discovered the importance of solving the challenges of majority bias analysis and overfitting. Presented results were generalized evaluation of both balanced and imbalanced models, which implies their ability of classifying, to classify novel riboswitches.

Coordination of fate transition and cell division is crucial to maintain the plant architecture and to achieve efficient production of plant organs. In this paper, we analysed the stem cell dynamics at the shoot apical meristem (SAM) that is one of the plant stem cells locations. We designed a mathematical model to elucidate the impact of hormonal signaling on the fate transition rates between different zones corresponding to slowly dividing stem cells and fast dividing transit amplifying cells. The model is based on a simplified two-dimensional disc geometry of the SAM and accounts for a continuous displacement towards the periphery of cells produced in the central zone. Coupling growth and hormonal signaling results in a nonlinear system of reaction-diffusion equations on a growing domain with the growth rate depending on the model components. The model is tested by simulating perturbations in the level of key transcription factors that maintain SAM homeostasis. The model provides new insights on how the transcription factor HECATE is integrated in the regulatory network that governs stem cell differentiation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UQNwiS0rmxI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Cells adjust to nutrient deprivation by reversible translational shutdown. This is accompanied by maintaining inactive ribosomes in a hibernation state, in which they are bound by proteins with inhibitory and protective functions. In eukaryotes, such a function was attributed to suppressor of target of Myb protein 1 (Stm1; SERPINE1 mRNA-binding protein 1 [SERBP1] in mammals), and recently, late-annotated short open reading frame 2 (Lso2; coiled-coil domain containing short open reading frame 124 [CCDC124] in mammals) was found to be involved in translational recovery after starvation from stationary phase. Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of translationally inactive yeast and human ribosomes. We found Lso2/CCDC124 accumulating on idle ribosomes in the nonrotated state, in contrast to Stm1/SERBP1-bound ribosomes, which display a rotated state. Lso2/CCDC124 bridges the decoding sites of the small with the GTPase activating center (GAC) of the large subunit. This position allows accommodation of the duplication of multilocus region 34 protein (Dom34)-dependent ribosome recycling system, which splits Lso2-containing, but not Stm1-containing, ribosomes. We propose a model in which Lso2 facilitates rapid translation reactivation by stabilizing the recycling-competent state of inactive ribosomes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/7HDgOnINe_s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The 70 kDa heat shock protein (HSP70) family of chaperones are the front line of protection from stress-induced misfolding and aggregation of polypeptides in most organisms and are responsible for promoting the stability, folding, and degradation of clients to maintain cellular protein homeostasis. Here, we demonstrate quantitative identification of HSP70 and 71 kDa heat shock cognate (HSC70) clients using a ubiquitin-mediated proximity tagging strategy and show that, despite their high degree of similarity, these enzymes have largely nonoverlapping specificities. Both proteins show a preference for association with newly synthesized polypeptides, but each responds differently to changes in the stoichiometry of proteins in obligate multi-subunit complexes. In addition, expression of an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-associated superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) mutant protein induces changes in HSP70 and HSC70 client association and aggregation toward polypeptides with predicted disorder, indicating that there are global effects from a single misfolded protein that extend to many clients within chaperone networks. Together these findings show that the ubiquitin-activated interaction trap (UBAIT) fusion system can efficiently isolate the complex interactome of HSP chaperone family proteins under normal and stress conditions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ADIksXEycdo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Rest‐activity Pattern Alterations in Idiopathic REM Sleep Behavior Disorder</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25853?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate the differences in actigraphy‐measured rest‐activity patterns (e.g., sleep‐wake cycle, circadian rest‐activity rhythm, and physical activity) across different stages of α‐synucleinopathy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We compared alterations in 7‐day actigraphy‐measured rest‐activity patterns among patients with clinically diagnosed α‐synucleinopathies (n = 44), and their age‐, sex‐, and BMI‐matched patients with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD, n = 88), and non‐RBD controls (n = 44) in a case‐control study (&lt;i&gt;Study 1 &lt;/i&gt;) and between convertors (n = 22) and their age‐, sex‐, BMI‐, iRBD‐duration and follow‐up‐duration‐matched non‐convertors (n = 66) in a prospective nested case‐control study (&lt;i&gt;Study 2 &lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Study 1 &lt;/i&gt;, there were significantly increases (&lt;i&gt;P &lt;/i&gt; values were adjusted by false discovery rate &amp;lt; 0.01) in probable napping behaviors (percentage, duration, and episodes), activity fragmentation (estimated by k&lt;sub&gt;AR&lt;/sub&gt;), and physical inactivity during active period across controls, iRBD, to clinically diagnosed α‐synucleinopathies. In &lt;i&gt;Study 2 &lt;/i&gt;, higher levels (all &lt;i&gt;P &lt;/i&gt; values were adjusted by false discovery rate &amp;lt; 0.05) of baseline objective probable napping, activity fragmentation, and physical inactivity during active period were associated with the conversion of iRBD patients into clinically diagnosed α‐synucleinopathies at two years of follow‐up with medium to large effect sizes (Cohen's d: 0.56 to 0.80). These findings were further supported by functional linear modeling analyses.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rest‐activity pattern alterations, mainly objective probable napping behaviors, activity fragmentation, and physical inactivity during active period, emerge as early as at the stage of iRBD, which serve as early and robust prodromal markers of the conversion of iRBD into clinically diagnosed α‐synucleinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparative studies on canid cognition have revealed tantalizing evidence for some restructuring in the canine brain. Using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging, we compared the degree of cortical folding in wild and domestic canids. We demonstrate that this parameter is largely consistent across canid species although regional differences in gyrification exist.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last 15 years, research on canid cognition has revealed that domestic dogs possess a surprising array of complex sociocognitive skills pointing to the possibility that the domestication process might have uniquely altered their brains; however, we know very little about how evolutionary processes (natural or artificial) might have modified underlying neural structure to support species‐specific behaviors. Evaluating the degree of cortical folding (i.e., gyrification) within canids may prove useful, as this parameter is linked to functional variation of the cerebral cortex. Using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the impact of domestication on the canine cortical surface, we compared the gyrification index (GI) in 19 carnivore species, including six wild canid and 13 domestic dog individuals. We also explored correlations between global and local GI with brain mass, cortical thickness, white and gray matter volume and surface area. Our results indicated that GI values for domestic dogs are largely consistent with what would be expected for a canid of their given brain mass, although more variable than that observed in wild canids. We also found that GI in canids is positively correlated with cortical surface area, cortical thickness and total cortical gray matter volumes. While we found no evidence of global differences in GI between domestic and wild canids, certain regional differences in gyrification were observed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: The Distinct Traits of the UNC13A Polymorphism in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25841?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rs12608932 single nucleotide polymorphism in &lt;i&gt;UNC13A &lt;/i&gt; is associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) susceptibility, and may underlie differences in treatment response. We aimed to characterize the clinical, cognitive, behavioral, and neuroimaging phenotype of &lt;i&gt;UNC13A &lt;/i&gt; in patients with ALS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We included 2,216 patients with ALS without a &lt;i&gt;C9orf72 &lt;/i&gt; mutation to identify clinical characteristics associated with the &lt;i&gt;UNC13A &lt;/i&gt; polymorphism. A subcohort of 428 patients with ALS was used to study cognitive and behavioral profiles, and 375 patients to study neuroimaging characteristics. Associations were analyzed under an additive genetic model.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genotyping rs12608932 resulted in 854 A/A, 988 A/C, and 374 C/C genotypes. The C allele was associated with a higher age at symptom onset (median years A/A 63.5, A/C 65.6, and C/C 65.5; &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), more frequent bulbar onset (A/A 29.6%, A/C 31.8%, and C/C 43.1%; &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), higher incidences of ALS‐FTD (A/A 4.3%, A/C 5.2%, and C/C 9.5%; &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.003), lower forced vital capacity at diagnosis (median percentage A/A 92.0, A/C 90.0, and C/C 86.5; &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), and a shorter survival (median in months A/A 33.3, A.C 30.7, and C/C 26.6; &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). &lt;i&gt;UNC13A &lt;/i&gt; was associated with lower scores on ALS‐specific cognition tests (means A/A 79.5, A/C 78.1, and C/C 76.6; &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.037), and more frequent behavioral disturbances (A/A 16.7%, A/C 24.4%, and C/C 27.7%; &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.045). Thinner left inferior temporal and right fusiform cortex were associated with the &lt;i&gt;UNC13A &lt;/i&gt; single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.045 and &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.036).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phenotypical distinctions associated with &lt;i&gt;UNC13A &lt;/i&gt; make it an important factor to take into account in clinical trial design, studies on cognition and behavior, and prognostic counseling. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Glycine Receptor Autoantibodies Impair Receptor Function and Induce Motor Dysfunction</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25832?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impairment of glycinergic neurotransmission leads to complex movement and behavioral disorders. Patients harboring glycine receptor autoantibodies suffer from stiff‐person syndrome or its severe variant progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus. Enhanced receptor internalization was proposed as the common molecular mechanism upon autoantibody binding. Although functional impairment of glycine receptors following autoantibody binding has recently been investigated, it is still incompletely understood.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cell‐based assay was used for positive sample evaluation. Glycine receptor function was assessed by electrophysiological recordings and radioligand binding assays. The in vivo passive transfer of patient autoantibodies was done using the zebrafish animal model.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glycine receptor function as assessed by glycine dose–response curves showed significantly decreased glycine potency in the presence of patient sera. Upon binding of autoantibodies from 2 patients, a decreased fraction of desensitized receptors was observed, whereas closing of the ion channel remained fast. The glycine receptor N‐terminal residues &lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;A to &lt;sup&gt;62&lt;/sup&gt;G were mapped as a common epitope of glycine receptor autoantibodies. An in vivo transfer into the zebrafish animal model generated a phenotype with disturbed escape behavior accompanied by a reduced number of glycine receptor clusters in the spinal cord of affected animals.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autoantibodies against the extracellular domain mediate alterations of glycine receptor physiology. Moreover, our in vivo data demonstrate that the autoantibodies are a direct cause of the disease, because the transfer of human glycine receptor autoantibodies to zebrafish larvae generated impaired escape behavior in the animal model compatible with abnormal startle response in stiff‐person syndrome or progressive encephalitis with rigidity and myoclonus patients.

&lt;p&gt;Based on physiological data, biophysical modeling allows the optimization of tDCS montages for stimulation of brain networks. The efficacy of network‐targeted electrical stimulation is shown by the increase of spontaneous activity in the targeted network, as well as the modulation of its interplay with negatively correlated brain networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynamics within and between functional resting‐state networks have a crucial role in determining both healthy and pathological brain functioning in humans. The possibility to noninvasively interact and selectively modulate the activity of networks would open to relevant applications in neuroscience. Here we tested a novel approach for multichannel, network‐targeted transcranial direct current stimulation (net‐tDCS), optimized to increase excitability of the sensorimotor network (SMN) while inducing cathodal inhibitory modulation over prefrontal and parietal brain regions negatively correlated with the SMN. Using an MRI‐compatible multichannel transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) device, 20 healthy participants underwent real and sham tDCS while at rest in the MRI scanner. Changes in functional connectivity (FC) during and after stimulation were evaluated, looking at the intrinsic FC of the SMN and the strength of the negative connectivity between SMN and the rest of the brain. Standard, bifocal tDCS targeting left motor cortex (electrode ~C3) and right frontopolar (~Fp2) regions was tested as a control condition in a separate sample of healthy subjects to investigate network specificity of multichannel stimulation effects. Net‐tDCS induced greater FC increase over the SMN compared to bifocal tDCS, during and after stimulation. Moreover, exploratory analysis of the impact of net‐tDCS on negatively correlated networks showed an increase in the negative connectivity between SMN and prefrontal/parietal areas targeted by cathodal stimulation both during and after real net‐tDCS. Results suggest preliminary evidence of the possibility of manipulating distributed network connectivity patterns through net‐tDCS, with potential relevance for the development of cognitive enhancement and therapeutic tES solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Standing on the Shoulders of Giants: Hardware and Neural Architecture Co-Search with Hot Start. (arXiv:2007.09087v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09087</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hardware and neural architecture co-search that automatically generates
Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions from a given dataset is promising to
promote AI democratization; however, the amount of time that is required by
current co-search frameworks is in the order of hundreds of GPU hours for one
target hardware. This inhibits the use of such frameworks on commodity
hardware. The root cause of the low efficiency in existing co-search frameworks
is the fact that they start from a &quot;cold&quot; state (i.e., search from scratch). In
this paper, we propose a novel framework, namely HotNAS, that starts from a
&quot;hot&quot; state based on a set of existing pre-trained models (a.k.a. model zoo) to
avoid lengthy training time. As such, the search time can be reduced from 200
GPU hours to less than 3 GPU hours. In HotNAS, in addition to hardware design
space and neural architecture search space, we further integrate a compression
space to conduct model compressing during the co-search, which creates new
opportunities to reduce latency but also brings challenges. One of the key
challenges is that all of the above search spaces are coupled with each other,
e.g., compression may not work without hardware design support. To tackle this
issue, HotNAS builds a chain of tools to design hardware to support
compression, based on which a global optimizer is developed to automatically
co-search all the involved search spaces. Experiments on ImageNet dataset and
Xilinx FPGA show that, within the timing constraint of 5ms, neural
architectures generated by HotNAS can achieve up to 5.79% Top-1 and 3.97% Top-5
accuracy gain, compared with the existing ones.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: FSpiNN: An Optimization Framework for Memory- and Energy-Efficient Spiking Neural Networks. (arXiv:2007.08860v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08860</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are gaining interest due to their event-driven
processing which potentially consumes low power/energy computations in hardware
platforms, while offering unsupervised learning capability due to the
spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) rule. However, state-of-the-art SNNs
require a large memory footprint to achieve high accuracy, thereby making them
difficult to be deployed on embedded systems, for instance on battery-powered
mobile devices and IoT Edge nodes. Towards this, we propose FSpiNN, an
optimization framework for obtaining memory- and energy-efficient SNNs for
training and inference processing, with unsupervised learning capability while
maintaining accuracy. It is achieved by (1) reducing the computational
requirements of neuronal and STDP operations, (2) improving the accuracy of
STDP-based learning, (3) compressing the SNN through a fixed-point
quantization, and (4) incorporating the memory and energy requirements in the
optimization process. FSpiNN reduces the computational requirements by reducing
the number of neuronal operations, the STDP-based synaptic weight updates, and
the STDP complexity. To improve the accuracy of learning, FSpiNN employs
timestep-based synaptic weight updates, and adaptively determines the STDP
potentiation factor and the effective inhibition strength. The experimental
results show that, as compared to the state-of-the-art work, FSpiNN achieves
7.5x memory saving, and improves the energy-efficiency by 3.5x on average for
training and by 1.8x on average for inference, across MNIST and Fashion MNIST
datasets, with no accuracy loss for a network with 4900 excitatory neurons,
thereby enabling energy-efficient SNNs for edge devices/embedded systems.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: A biological plausible audio-visual integration model for continual lifelong learning. (arXiv:2007.08855v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08855</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The problem of catastrophic forgetting can be traced back to the 1980s, but
it has not been completely solved. Since human brains are good at continual
lifelong learning, brain-inspired methods may provide solutions to this
problem. The end result of learning different objects in different categories
is the formation of concepts in the brain. Experiments showed that concepts are
likely encoded by concept cells in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) of the human
brain. Furthermore, concept cells encode concepts sparsely and are responsive
to multi-modal stimuli. However, it is unknown how concepts are formed in the
MTL. Here we assume that the integration of audio and visual perceptual
information in the MTL during learning is a crucial step to form concepts and
make continual learning possible, and we propose a biological plausible
audio-visual integration model (AVIM), which is a spiking neural network with
multi-compartmental neuron model and a calcium based synaptic tagging and
capture plasticity model, as a possible mechanism of concept formation. We then
build such a model and run on different datasets to test its ability of
continual learning. Our simulation results show that the AVIM not only achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared with other advanced methods but also the
output of AVIM for each concept has stable representations during the continual
learning process. These results support our assumption that concept formation
is essential for continuous lifelong learning, and suggest the AVIM we propose
here is a possible mechanism of concept formation, and hence is a brain-like
solution to the problem of catastrophic forgetting.

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Peripersonal Visuospatial Abilities in Williams Syndrome Analyzed by a Table Radial Arm Maze Task</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00254</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Williams syndrome (WS) is a genetic deletion syndrome characterized by severe visuospatial deficits affecting spatial exploration and navigation abilities in extra-personal space.To date, little is known about spatial elaboration and reaching abilities in the peripersonal space in individuals with WS. The present study is aimed at evaluating the visuospatial abilities in individuals with WS and comparing their performances with those of mental age-matched typically developing (TD) children by using a highly sensitive ecological version of the Radial Arm Maze (table RAM). We evaluated 15 individuals with WS and 15 TD children in two different table RAM paradigms: the free-choice paradigm, mainly to analyze the aspects linked to procedural and memory components, and the forced-choice paradigm, to disentangle the components linked to spatial working memory from the procedural ones.Data show that individuals with WS made significantly more working memory errors as compared with TD children, thus evidencing a marked deficit in resolving the task when the mnesic load increased. Our findings provide new insights on the cognitive profile of WS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: S-phase-independent silencing establishment in Saccharomyces cerevisiae</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58910</link>
	<content:encoded>The establishment of silent chromatin, a heterochromatin-like structure at &lt;i&gt;HML &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;HMR&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, depends on progression through S phase of the cell cycle, but the molecular nature of this requirement has remained elusive despite intensive study. Using high-resolution chromatin immunoprecipitation and single-molecule RNA analysis, we found that silencing establishment proceeded via gradual repression of transcription in individual cells over several cell cycles, and that the cell-cycle-regulated step was downstream of Sir protein recruitment. In contrast to prior results, &lt;i&gt;HML&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;HMR&lt;/i&gt; had identical cell-cycle requirements for silencing establishment, with no apparent contribution from a tRNA gene adjacent to &lt;i&gt;HMR&lt;/i&gt;. We identified the cause of the S-phase requirement for silencing establishment: removal of transcription-favoring histone modifications deposited by Dot1, Sas2, and Rtt109. These results revealed that silencing establishment was absolutely dependent on the cell-cycle-regulated interplay between euchromatic and heterochromatic histone modifications.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Expandable and reversible copy number amplification drives rapid adaptation to antifungal drugs</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58349</link>
	<content:encoded>Previously, we identified long repeat sequences that are frequently associated with genome rearrangements, including copy number variation (CNV), in many diverse isolates of the human fungal pathogen &lt;i&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/i&gt; (Todd et al., 2019). Here, we describe the rapid acquisition of novel, high copy number CNVs during adaptation to azole antifungal drugs. Single-cell karyotype analysis indicates that these CNVs appear to arise via a dicentric chromosome intermediate and breakage-fusion-bridge cycles that are repaired using multiple distinct long inverted repeat sequences. Subsequent removal of the antifungal drug can lead to a dramatic loss of the CNV and reversion to the progenitor genotype and drug susceptibility phenotype. These findings support a novel mechanism for the rapid acquisition of antifungal drug resistance and provide genomic evidence for the heterogeneity frequently observed in clinical settings.</content:encoded>

&lt;h2&gt;Graphical Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The illustration shows several flatmap representations of the mammalian brain, selected and modified from a collection of new and enhanced flatmap representations of the mouse, rat, and human brain. The human brain flatmap primarily details cortical regionalization. The rat and mouse brain flatmaps are based on current brain reference atlases, and they represent all depths of the divisional hierarchy of central nervous system gray matter represented therein. Also represented for rat and mouse are white matter tracts, ganglia, and nerves, and for the rat a series of flatmaps illustrating stages of brain development. The rat and mouse brain flatmaps are designed to facilitate comparative analysis between these species, and for adaptability to novel parcellation schemas and computational applications. We give examples of these uses, including a proof‐of‐concept workflow demonstrating how the flatmaps could be adapted to form the basis of a web‐based graphical data viewer and analysis platform to represent a wide variety of brain data.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we present a flatmap of the mouse central nervous system (CNS) (brain) and substantially enhanced flatmaps of the rat and human brain. Also included are enhanced representations of nervous system white matter tracts, ganglia, and nerves, and an enhanced series of 10 flatmaps showing different stages of rat brain development. The adult mouse and rat brain flatmaps provide layered diagrammatic representation of CNS divisions, according to their arrangement in corresponding reference atlases: Brain Maps 4.0 (BM4, rat) (Swanson, The Journal of Comparative Neurology, 2018, 526, 935–943), and the first version of the Allen Reference Atlas (mouse) (Dong, The Allen reference atlas, (book + CD‐ROM): A digital color brain atlas of the C57BL/6J male mouse, 2007). To facilitate comparative analysis, both flatmaps are scaled equally, and the divisional hierarchy of gray matter follows a topographic arrangement used in BM4. Also included with the mouse and rat brain flatmaps are cerebral cortex atlas level contours based on the reference atlases, and direct graphical and tabular comparison of regional parcellation. To encourage use of the brain flatmaps, they were designed and organized, with supporting reference tables, for ease‐of‐use and to be amenable to computational applications. We demonstrate how they can be adapted to represent novel parcellations resulting from experimental data, and we provide a proof‐of‐concept for how they could form the basis of a web‐based graphical data viewer and analysis platform. The mouse, rat, and human brain flatmap vector graphics files (Adobe Reader/Acrobat viewable and Adobe Illustrator editable) and supporting tables are provided open access; they constitute a broadly applicable neuroscience toolbox resource for researchers seeking to map and perform comparative analysis of brain data.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Adaptation to statistics of sensory inputs is an essential ability of neural systems and extends their effective operational range. Having a broad operational range facilitates to react to sensory inputs of different granularities, thus is a crucial factor for survival. The computation of auditory cues for spatial localization of sound sources, particularly the interaural level difference (ILD), has long been considered as a static process. Novel findings suggest that this process of ipsi- and contra-lateral signal integration is highly adaptive and depends strongly on recent stimulus statistics. Here, adaptation aids the encoding of auditory perceptual space of various granularities. To investigate the mechanism of auditory adaptation in binaural signal integration in detail, we developed a neural model architecture for simulating functions of lateral superior olive (LSO) and medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) composed of single compartment conductance-based neurons. Neurons in the MNTB serve as an intermediate relay population. Their signal is integrated by the LSO population on a circuit level to represent excitatory and inhibitory interactions of input signals. The circuit incorporates an adaptation mechanism operating at the synaptic level based on local inhibitory feedback signals. The model’s predictive power is demonstrated in various simulations replicating physiological data. Incorporating the innovative adaptation mechanism facilitates a shift in neural responses towards the most effective stimulus range based on recent stimulus history. The model demonstrates that a single LSO neuron quickly adapts to these stimulus statistics and, thus, can encode an extended range of ILDs in the ipsilateral hemisphere. Most significantly, we provide a unique measurement of the adaptation efficacy of LSO neurons. Prerequisite of normal function is an accurate interaction of inhibitory and excitatory signals, a precise encoding of time and a well-tuned local feedback circuit. We suggest that the mechanisms of temporal competitive-cooperative interaction and the local feedback mechanism jointly sensitize the circuit to enable a response shift towards contra-lateral and ipsi-lateral stimuli, respectively.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jBJQd880EGA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Interactions between calmodulin and neurogranin govern the dynamics of CaMKII as a leaky integrator</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/2cmO4SbkOws/article</link>

Calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) has long been known to play an important role in learning and memory as well as long term potentiation (LTP). More recently it has been suggested that it might be involved in the time averaging of synaptic signals, which can then lead to the high precision of information stored at a single synapse. However, the role of the scaffolding molecule, neurogranin (Ng), in governing the dynamics of CaMKII is not yet fully understood. In this work, we adopt a rule-based modeling approach through the Monte Carlo method to study the effect of &lt;i&gt;Ca&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals on the dynamics of CaMKII phosphorylation in the postsynaptic density (PSD). Calcium surges are observed in synaptic spines during an EPSP and back-propagating action potential due to the opening of NMDA receptors and voltage dependent calcium channels. Using agent-based models, we computationally investigate the dynamics of phosphorylation of CaMKII monomers and dodecameric holoenzymes. The scaffolding molecule, Ng, when present in significant concentration, limits the availability of free calmodulin (CaM), the protein which activates CaMKII in the presence of calcium. We show that Ng plays an important modulatory role in CaMKII phosphorylation following a surge of high calcium concentration. We find a non-intuitive dependence of this effect on CaM concentration that results from the different affinities of CaM for CaMKII depending on the number of calcium ions bound to the former. It has been shown previously that in the absence of phosphatase, CaMKII monomers integrate over &lt;i&gt;Ca&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals of certain frequencies through autophosphorylation (Pepke et al, Plos Comp. Bio., 2010). We also study the effect of multiple calcium spikes on CaMKII holoenzyme autophosphorylation, and show that in the presence of phosphatase, CaMKII behaves as a leaky integrator of calcium signals, a result that has been recently observed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Our models predict that the parameters of this leaky integrator are finely tuned through the interactions of Ng, CaM, CaMKII, and PP1, providing a mechanism to precisely control the sensitivity of synapses to calcium signals.

Bacteria need to survive in a wide range of environments. Currently, there is an incomplete understanding of the genetic basis for mechanisms underpinning survival in stressful conditions, such as the presence of anti-microbials. Transposon directed insertion-site sequencing (TraDIS) is a powerful tool to identify genes and networks which are involved in survival and fitness under a given condition by simultaneously assaying the fitness of millions of mutants, thereby relating genotype to phenotype and contributing to an understanding of bacterial cell biology. A recent refinement of this approach allows the roles of essential genes in conditional stress survival to be inferred by altering their expression. These advancements combined with the rapidly falling costs of sequencing now allows comparisons between multiple experiments to identify commonalities in stress responses to different conditions. This capacity however poses a new challenge for analysis of multiple data sets in conjunction. To address this analysis need, we have developed ‘AlbaTraDIS’; a software application for rapid large-scale comparative analysis of TraDIS experiments that predicts the impact of transposon insertions on nearby genes. AlbaTraDIS can identify genes which are up or down regulated, or inactivated, between multiple conditions, producing a filtered list of genes for further experimental validation as well as several accompanying data visualisations. We demonstrate the utility of our new approach by applying it to identify genes used by &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; to survive in a wide range of different concentrations of the biocide Triclosan. AlbaTraDIS identified all well characterised Triclosan resistance genes, including the primary target, &lt;i&gt;fabI&lt;/i&gt;. A number of new loci were also implicated in Triclosan resistance and the predicted phenotypes for a selection of these were validated experimentally with results being consistent with predictions. AlbaTraDIS provides a simple and rapid method to analyse multiple transposon mutagenesis data sets allowing this technology to be used at large scale. To our knowledge this is the only tool currently available that can perform these tasks. AlbaTraDIS is written in Python 3 and is available under the open source licence GNU GPL 3 from https://github.com/quadram-institute-bioscience/albatradis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xOgmwvwDuoY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: FCHSD2 controls oncogenic ERK1/2 signaling outcome by regulating endocytic trafficking</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/ON9Dv7qRL7g/article</link>

The evolution of transformed cancer cells into metastatic tumors is, in part, driven by altered intracellular signaling downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). The surface levels and activity of RTKs are governed mainly through clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), endosomal recycling, or degradation. In turn, oncogenic signaling downstream of RTKs can reciprocally regulate endocytic trafficking by creating feedback loops in cells to enhance tumor progression. We previously showed that FCH/F-BAR and Double SH3 Domain-Containing Protein (FCHSD2) has a cancer-cell specific function in regulating CME in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Here, we report that FCHSD2 loss impacts recycling of the RTKs, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and proto-oncogene c-Met (MET), and shunts their trafficking into late endosomes and lysosomal degradation. Notably, FCHSD2 depletion results in the nuclear translocation of active extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), leading to enhanced transcription and up-regulation of EGFR and MET. The small GTPase, Ras-related protein Rab-7A (Rab7), is essential for the FCHSD2 depletion-induced effects. Correspondingly, FCHSD2 loss correlates to higher tumor grades of NSCLC. Clinically, NSCLC patients expressing high FCHSD2 exhibit elevated survival, whereas patients with high Rab7 expression display decreased survival rates. Our study provides new insight into the molecular nexus for crosstalk between oncogenic signaling and RTK trafficking that controls cancer progression.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ON9Dv7qRL7g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Constant innervation despite pubertal growth of the mouse penis</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Constant innervation despite pubertal growth of the mouse penis&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/36f1bcef-6f80-4d5b-8958-bc3ffaebedf6/cne24892-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We studied the growth and innervation of the mouse penis throughout puberty. We find that the mouse penis grows significantly during puberty while the number of nerve fibers in the dorsal penile nerve were not different in prepubertal compared to adult mice. Antibody staining along with myelin staining suggested that about 57% of penile nerve fibers were myelinated. Furthermore, comparing the size of the somatosensory penis cortex and the barrel cortex suggested that less cortical area is devoted to a penile‐nerve‐fiber than to a whisker‐nerve‐fiber. The constant innervation of mouse penis through puberty suggests that the pubertal increase of cortical magnification of the penis is not simply a reflection of peripheral change.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sexual characteristics of the vertebrate body change under the control of sex hormones. In mammals, genitals undergo major changes in puberty. While such bodily changes have been well documented, the associated changes in the nervous system are poorly understood. To address this issue, we studied the growth and innervation of the mouse penis throughout puberty. To this end, we measured length and thickness of the mouse penis in prepubertal (3–4 week old) and adult (8–10 week old) mice and performed fiber counts of the dorsal penile nerve. We obtained such counts with confocal imaging of proximal sections of the mouse penis after paraffin embedding and antibody staining against Protein‐Gene‐Product‐9.5 or Neurofilament‐H in combination with antigen retrieval procedures. We find that the mouse penis grows roughly 1.4 times in both thickness and length. Fiber counts in the dorsal penile nerve were not different in prepubertal (1,620 ± 165 fibers per penis) and adult (1,572 ± 383 fibers per penis) mice, however. Antibody staining along with myelin staining by Luxol‐Fast‐Blue suggested about 57% of penile nerve fibers were myelinated. Quantification of the area of mouse somatosensory penis cortex allowed us to compare cortical magnification of the penile cortex and the whisker‐barrel‐cortex systems. This comparison suggested that 2 to 4 times less cortical area is devoted to a penile‐nerve‐fiber than to a whisker‐nerve‐fiber. The constant innervation of mouse penis through puberty suggests that the pubertal increase of cortical magnification of the penis is not simply a reflection of peripheral change.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Differential input patterns to excitatory and inhibitory cells in the intermediate and deep layers of the superior colliculus (SC) were assessed using G‐deleted rabies virus‐mediated monosynaptic tracing. Projections to both cell types were observed in many brain regions but were stronger to excitatory than inhibitory SC neurons. However, a subset of brainstem‐projecting excitatory neurons received only weak projections. Commissural SC neurons tended to project to similar rostrocaudal positions in the opposite SC.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intermediate and deep layers of the midbrain superior colliculus (SC) are a key locus for several critical functions, including spatial attention, multisensory integration, and behavioral responses. While the SC is known to integrate input from a variety of brain regions, progress in understanding how these inputs contribute to SC‐dependent functions has been hindered by the paucity of data on innervation patterns to specific types of SC neurons. Here, we use G‐deleted rabies virus‐mediated monosynaptic tracing to identify inputs to excitatory and inhibitory neurons of the intermediate and deep SC. We observed stronger and more numerous projections to excitatory than inhibitory SC neurons. However, a subpopulation of excitatory neurons thought to mediate behavioral output received weaker inputs, from far fewer brain regions, than the overall population of excitatory neurons. Additionally, extrinsic inputs tended to target rostral excitatory and inhibitory SC neurons more strongly than their caudal counterparts, and commissural SC neurons tended to project to similar rostrocaudal positions in the other SC. Our findings support the view that active intrinsic processes are critical to SC‐dependent functions, and will enable the examination of how specific inputs contribute to these functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;The formation of an odor map in the olfactory bulb of vertebrates is based on the general assumption that axons of individual olfactory receptor neurons do not branch and connect to single glomeruli. Here, we show that this general principle does not apply to the olfactory system of amphibians, which exhibits a multi‐glomerular wiring scheme and a putatively different odor coding strategy. Our data underline the need to acknowledge biological diversity to fully understand odor coding in vertebrates.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individual receptor neurons in the peripheral olfactory organ extend long axons into the olfactory bulb forming synapses with projection neurons in spherical neuropil regions, called glomeruli. Generally, odor map formation and odor processing in all vertebrates is based on the assumption that receptor neuron axons exclusively connect to a single glomerulus without any axonal branching. We comparatively tested this hypothesis in multiple fish and amphibian species (both sexes) by applying sparse cell electroporation to trace single olfactory receptor neuron axons. Sea lamprey (jawless fish) and zebrafish (bony fish) support the unbranched axon concept, with 94% of axons terminating in single glomeruli. Contrastingly, axonal projections of the axolotl (salamander) branch extensively before entering up to six distinct glomeruli. Receptor neuron axons labeled in frog species (Pipidae, Bufonidae, Hylidae, and Dendrobatidae) predominantly bifurcate before entering a glomerulus and 59 and 50% connect to multiple glomeruli in larval and postmetamorphotic animals, respectively. Independent of developmental stage, lifestyle, and adaptations to specific habitats, it seems to be a common feature of amphibian olfactory receptor neuron axons to frequently bifurcate and connect to multiple glomeruli. Our study challenges the unbranched axon concept as a universal vertebrate feature and it is conceivable that also later diverging vertebrates deviate from it. We propose that this unusual wiring logic evolved around the divergence of the terrestrial tetrapod lineage from its aquatic ancestors and could be the basis of an alternative way of odor processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Schematic representation of NCoR1 and SMRT distribution in neuronal and non‐neuronal cell types. Five major types of brain cells (glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia) are depicted within a representative coronal slice of the mouse brain. Both NCor1 and SMRT broadly localize within the nuclei of most neuronal cells. However, a diverse pattern of expression is detected in non‐neuronal cells. While NCoR1 is expressed in a small fraction of astrocytes, SMRT is not expressed in GFAP+ astrocytes or in Iba1+ microglia.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to rapidly change gene expression patterns is essential for differentiation, development, and functioning of the brain. Throughout development, or in response to environmental stimuli, gene expression patterns are tightly regulated by the dynamic interplay between transcription activators and repressors. Nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (NCoR1) and silencing mediator for retinoid or thyroid‐hormone receptors (SMRT) are the best characterized transcriptional co‐repressors from a molecular point of view. They mediate epigenetic silencing of gene expression in a wide range of developmental and homeostatic processes in many tissues, including the brain. For instance, NCoR1 and SMRT regulate neuronal stem cell proliferation and differentiation during brain development and they have been implicated in learning and memory. However, we still have a limited understanding of their regional and cell type‐specific expression in the brain. In this study, we used fluorescent immunohistochemistry to map their expression patterns throughout the adult mouse brain. Our findings reveal that NCoR1 and SMRT share an overall neuroanatomical distribution, and are detected in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. However, we observed striking differences in their cell type‐specific expression in glial cells. Specifically, all oligodendrocytes express NCoR1, but only a subset express SMRT. In addition, NCoR1, but not SMRT, was detected in a subset of astrocytes and in the microglia. These novel observations are corroborated by single cell transcriptomics and emphasize how NCoR1 and SMRT may contribute to distinct biological functions, suggesting an exclusive role of NCoR1 in innate immune responses in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Confocal images of triple immunofluorescent labeling for TRPV1 (green), IB4 (red) and CGRP (blue), in a section of the left fourth lumbar (L4) DRG showing the effects of the perinerual application of resiniferatoxin (RTX) onto left L4 nerve. This treatment causes a remarkable reduction in the number of TRPV1, IB4 and CGRP immnuoreactive neurons in the corresponding treated L4 DRG compared to the right control (cont) L4 DRG.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifth lumbar (L5) nerve injury in rats causes neuropathic pain manifested with thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity in the ipsilateral hind paw. This study aimed to determine whether the elimination of unmyelinated primary afferents of the adjacent uninjured nerves (L3 and L4) would alleviate peripheral neuropathic pain. Different concentrations of capsaicin or its analog, resiniferatoxin (RTX), were applied perineurally on either the left L4 or L3 and L4 nerves in Wistar rats whose left L5 nerves were ligated and cut. The application of both capsaicin and RTX on the L4 nerve significantly reduced both thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity. However, only the application of RTX on both L3 and L4 nerves completely alleviated all neuropathic manifestations. Interestingly, responses to thermal and mechanical stimuli were preserved, despite RTX application on uninjured L3, L4, and L5 nerves, which supply the plantar skin in rats. Perineural application of RTX caused downregulation of TRPV1, CGRP, and IB4 binding and upregulation of VIP in the corresponding dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. In comparison, VGLUT1 and NPY immunoreactivities were not altered. RTX application did not cause degenerative or ultrastructural changes in the treated nerves and corresponding DRGs. The results demonstrate that RTX induces neuroplasticity, rather than structural changes in primary afferents, that are responsible for alleviating hypersensitivity and chronic pain. Furthermore, this study suggests that treating uninjured adjacent spinal nerves may be used to manage chronic neuropathic pain following peripheral nerve injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;New octopamine receptor MiMIC‐Gal4 lines, in conjunction with &lt;i&gt;B3RT‐Tdc2‐LexA &lt;/i&gt; intersectional genetics, reveal potential neuronal octopamine autoreceptor locations in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster &lt;/i&gt; . This intersectional genetic tool can be further utilized to identify the subset of &lt;i&gt;Tdc2 &lt;/i&gt;‐expressing neurons within any Gal4 driver of interest.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Octopamine, the invertebrate analog of norepinephrine, is known to modulate a large variety of behaviors in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila &lt;/i&gt; including feeding initiation, locomotion, aggression, and courtship, among many others. Significantly less is known about the identity of the neurons that receive octopamine input and how they mediate octopamine‐regulated behaviors. Here, we characterize adult neuronal expression of MiMIC‐converted Trojan‐Gal4 lines for each of the five &lt;i&gt;Drosophila &lt;/i&gt; octopamine receptors. Broad neuronal expression was observed for all five octopamine receptors, yet distinct differences among them were also apparent. Use of immunostaining for the octopamine neurotransmitter synthesis enzyme Tdc2, along with a novel genome‐edited conditional &lt;i&gt;Tdc2‐LexA &lt;/i&gt; driver, revealed all five octopamine receptors express in Tdc2/octopamine neurons to varying degrees. This suggests autoreception may be an important circuit mechanism by which octopamine modulates behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Smad anchor for receptor activation, besides localizing to early endosomes, exhibits a distinctive nuclear distribution in deep‐layer neurons of the cortex (Layers V and VI). This pattern allows the identification of specific neuronal subpopulations.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smad anchor for receptor activation (SARA, &lt;i&gt;zfyve9 &lt;/i&gt;) has been classically observed in early endosomes of different cells types where it regulates vesicular transport of proteins and membrane components. Very few other members of the zinc finger FYVE domain‐containing family (&lt;i&gt;zfyve &lt;/i&gt;) have different functions other than controlling membrane trafficking. By analyzing SARA localization throughout mouse embryonic brain development, we detected that besides the endosomal localization it also targets neuronal nuclei, specifically of the cortical layers V/VI. These findings were confirmed in human brain organoids. When evaluating neuronal cell lines, we found that SARA accumulates in nuclei of PC‐12 cells, but not Neuro‐2a, highlighting its specificity. SARA functions as a specific marker of the deep cortical layers until the first postnatal week. This temporal regulation corresponds with the final phases of neuron differentiation, such as soma ventral translocation and axonal targeting. In sum, here we report that SARA localization during brain development is temporarily regulated, and layer specific. This defined pattern helps in the identification of early born cortical neurons. We further show that other zfyve family members (FYCO1, WDFY3, Hrs) also distribute to nuclei of different cells in the brain cortex, which raises the possibility that this might be an extended feature within the protein family.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;From random to regular: Variation in the patterning of retinal mosaics*&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/493b459f-fec2-43c9-9811-58f2ae4ec21c/cne24880-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The various types of retinal neurons are each positioned at their respective depths within the retina, where they are believed to be assembled as orderly mosaics. Contrary to that belief, we have shown, through the application of multiple spatial statistics, that there is conspicuous variability in the degree of patterning present among different retinal populations. The three retinal amacrine cells shown here, for example, might appear to be arranged as regular mosaics; the Voronoi tessellations of the real mosaics and random simulations, however, make apparent the differences in their distributions, from notably regular to essentially random.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The various types of retinal neurons are each positioned at their respective depths within the retina where they are believed to be assembled as orderly mosaics, in which like‐type neurons minimize proximity to one another. Two common statistical analyses for assessing the spatial properties of retinal mosaics include the nearest neighbor analysis, from which an index of their “regularity” is commonly calculated, and the density recovery profile derived from autocorrelation analysis, revealing the presence of an exclusion zone indicative of anti‐clustering. While each of the spatial statistics derived from these analyses, the regularity index and the effective radius, can be useful in characterizing such properties of orderly retinal mosaics, they are rarely sufficient for conveying the natural variation in the self‐spacing behavior of different types of retinal neurons and the extent to which that behavior generates uniform intercellular spacing across the mosaic. We consider the strengths and limitations of these and other spatial statistical analyses for assessing the patterning in retinal mosaics, highlighting a number of misconceptions and their frequent misuse. Rather than being diagnostic criteria for determining simply whether a population is “regular,” they should be treated as descriptive statistics that convey variation in the factors that influence neuronal positioning. We subsequently apply multiple spatial statistics to the analysis of eight different mosaics in the mouse retina, demonstrating conspicuous variability in the degree of patterning present, from essentially random to notably regular. This variability in patterning has both a developmental as well as a functional significance, reflecting the rules governing the positioning of different types of neurons as the architecture of the retina is assembled, and the distinct mechanisms by which they regulate dendritic growth to generate their characteristic coverage and connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Location and arrangement of campaniform sensilla in Drosophila melanogaster&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/72fbaf67-1d77-4a04-b01e-ecd5b4bb020c/cne24987-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campaniform sensilla are a sensory system in insects that detect deformations of the exoskeleton. The comparison of front, middle, and hindleg sensilla reveals robust locations with a small amount of interindividual variability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sensory systems provide input to motor networks on the state of the body and environment. One such sensory system in insects is the campaniform sensilla (CS), which detect deformations of the exoskeleton arising from resisted movements or external perturbations. When physical strain is applied to the cuticle, CS external structures are compressed, leading to transduction in an internal sensory neuron. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster &lt;/i&gt;, the distribution of CS on the exoskeleton has not been comprehensively described. To investigate CS number, location, spatial arrangement and potential differences between individuals, we compared the front, middle, and hind legs of multiple flies using scanning electron microscopy. Additionally, we imaged the entire body surface to confirm known CS locations. On the legs, the number and relative arrangement of CS varied between individuals, and single CS of corresponding segments showed characteristic differences between legs. This knowledge is fundamental for studying the relevance of cuticular strain information within the complex neuromuscular networks controlling posture and movement. This comprehensive account of all &lt;i&gt;D. melanogaster &lt;/i&gt; CS helps set the stage for experimental investigations into their responsivity, sensitivity, and roles in sensory acquisition and motor control in a light‐weight model organism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;H‐ABC is a neurodegenerative disease due to mutations in TUBB4A. Auditory evoked potentials are abnormal in this disease. Human mutation D249N impairs central function. A302T‐mutant &lt;i&gt;Taiep &lt;/i&gt; rats presents longer latencies in central waves. Both mutations severely impair the central hearing pathway by progressive central white matter degeneration.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypomyelination with atrophy of the basal ganglia and cerebellum (H‐ABC) is a neurodegenerative disease due to mutations in TUBB4A. Patients suffer from extrapyramidal movements, spasticity, ataxia, and cognitive deficits. Magnetic resonance imaging features are hypomyelination and atrophy of the striatum and cerebellum. A correlation between the mutations and their cellular, tissue and organic effects is largely missing. The effects of these mutations on sensory functions have not been described so far. We have previously reported a rat carring a TUBB4A (A302T) mutation and sharing most of the clinical and radiological signs with H‐ABC patients. Here, for the first time, we did a comparative study of the hearing function in an H‐ABC patient and in this mutant model. By analyzing hearing function we found that there are no significant differences in the auditory brainstem response thresholds between mutant rats and WT controls. Nevertheless, auditory brainstem responses show longer latencies in central waves (II‐IV), that in some cases disappear when compared to WT. The patient also shows abnormal AEPs showing only waves I and II. Distortion product of otoacustic emissions and immunohistochemistry in the rat show that the peripheral hearing function and morphology of the Organ of Corti are normal. We conclude that the tubulin mutation severely impairs the central hearing pathway most probably by progressive central white matter degeneration. Hearing function might be affected in a significant fraction of patients with H‐ABC, therefore screening for auditory function should be done on patients with tubulinopathies to evaluate hearing support therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immunohistochemical staining for parvalbumin reveals the various nuclei of the superior olivary complex and trapezoid body within the brain of the African wild dog. We could identify the medial (&lt;b&gt;MSO &lt;/b&gt;) and lateral (&lt;b&gt;LSO &lt;/b&gt;) superior olivary nuclei, the superior (&lt;b&gt;SPO &lt;/b&gt;), medioventral (&lt;b&gt;MVPO &lt;/b&gt;) and lateroventral (&lt;b&gt;LVPO &lt;/b&gt;) periolivary nuclei, the nucleus of the trapezoid body (&lt;b&gt;Tz &lt;/b&gt;), and the fibre bundles forming the trapezoid body (&lt;b&gt;tz &lt;/b&gt;). Scale bar = 1 mm.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The large external pinnae and extensive vocal repertoire of the African wild dog (&lt;i&gt;Lycaon pictus &lt;/i&gt;) has led to the assumption that the auditory system of this unique canid may be specialized. Here, using cytoarchitecture, myeloarchitecture, and a range of immunohistochemical stains, we describe the systems‐level anatomy of the auditory system of the African wild dog. We observed the cochlear nuclear complex, superior olivary nuclear complex, lateral lemniscus, inferior colliculus, medial geniculate body and auditory cortex all being in their expected locations, and exhibiting the standard subdivisions of this system. While located in the ectosylvian gyri, the auditory cortex includes several areas, resembling the parcellation observed in cats and ferrets, although not all of the auditory areas known from these species could be identified in the African wild dog. These observations suggest that, broadly speaking, the systems‐level anatomy of the auditory system, and by extension the processing of auditory information, within the brain of the African wild dog closely resembles that observed in other carnivores. Our findings indicate that it is likely that the extraction of the semantic content of the vocalizations of African wild dogs, and the behaviours generated, occurs beyond the classically defined auditory system, in limbic or association neocortical regions involved in cognitive functions. Thus, to obtain a deeper understanding of how auditory stimuli are processed, and how communication is achieved, in the African wild dog compared to other canids, cortical regions beyond the primary sensory areas will need to be examined in detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neurons of the dorsomedial division of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTdm) project onto hypothalamic nuclei including the paraventricular (PVH), dorsomedial (DMH), arcuate (ARH) nuclei and the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA). In particular, BNSTdm neurons innervate proopiomelanocortin‐ (POMC), agouti‐related peptide‐ (AgRP), melanin‐concentrating hormone‐ (MCH) and orexin‐ (ORX) expressing neurons of the ARH and the LHA, respectively.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stressful environment is a potent modulator of feeding, we seek in the present work to decipher the neuroanatomical basis for an interplay between stress and feeding behaviors. For this, we combined anterograde and retrograde tracing with immunohistochemical approaches to investigate the patterns of projections between the dorsomedial division of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), well connected to the amygdala, and hypothalamic structures such as the paraventricular (PVH) and dorsomedial (DMH), the arcuate (ARH) nuclei and the lateral hypothalamic areas (LHA) known to control feeding and motivated behaviors. We particularly focused our study on afferences to proopiomelanocortin (POMC), agouti‐related peptide (AgRP), melanin‐concentrating‐hormone (MCH) and orexin (ORX) neurons characteristics of the ARH and the LHA, respectively. We found light to intense innervation of all these hypothalamic nuclei. We particularly showed an innervation of POMC, AgRP, MCH and ORX neurons by the dorsomedial and dorsolateral divisions of the BNST.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, these results lay the foundation for a better understanding of the neuroanatomical basis of the stress‐related feeding behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bidirectional tracer injections in macaque monkey entorhinal cortex (EC), amygdala (AMY), and premotor cortex (PMC) reveal distinct distributions across the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). We show that EC and PMC connections are segregated across ventral (A25, A24a) and dorsal (A24b,c) ACC, while AMY connections are evenly distributed. These distinct ACC networks are likely important for temporal integration and affective, contextual, and motor processing in flexible goal‐directed behavior.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is important for decision‐making as it integrates motor plans with affective and contextual limbic information. Disruptions in these networks have been observed in depression, bipolar disorder, and post‐traumatic stress disorder. Yet, overlap of limbic and motor connections within subdivisions of the ACC is not well understood. Hence, we administered a combination of retro and anterograde tracers into structures important for contextual memories (entorhinal cortex), affective processing (amygdala) and motor planning (dorsal premotor cortex) to assess overlap of labeled projection neurons from (outputs) and axon terminals to (inputs) the ACC of adult rhesus monkeys (&lt;i&gt;Macaca mulatta &lt;/i&gt;). Our data show that entorhinal and dorsal premotor cortical (dPMC) connections are segregated across ventral (A25, A24a) and dorsal (A24b,c) subregions of the ACC, while amygdalar connections are evenly distributed across subregions. Among all areas, the rostral ACC (A32) had the lowest relative density of inter‐connections with all three regions. In the ventral ACC, entorhinal and amygdalar inter‐connections strongly overlap across all layers, especially in A25. In the dorsal ACC, outputs to dPMC and the amygdala strongly overlap in deep layers. However, dPMC input to the dorsal ACC was densest in deep layers, while amygdalar inputs predominantly localized in upper layers. This is consistent with roles of the dorsal ACC in motor evaluation and the ventral ACC in affective and contextual memory. Further, distinct laminar patterns suggest unique interactions within specific ACC compartments that are likely important for the temporal integration of motor and limbic information during flexible goal‐directed behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00129</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Virus-mediated gene therapy has the potential to deliver exogenous genetic material into specific cell types to promote survival and counteract disease. This is particularly enticing for neuronal conditions, as the nervous system is renowned for its intransigence to therapeutic targeting. Administration of gene therapy viruses into skeletal muscle, where distal terminals of motor and sensory neurons reside, has been shown to result in extensive transduction of cells within the spinal cord, brainstem, and sensory ganglia. This route is minimally invasive and therefore clinically relevant for gene therapy targeting to peripheral nerve soma. For successful transgene expression, viruses administered into muscle must undergo a series of processes, including host cell interaction and internalization, intracellular sorting, long-range retrograde axonal transport, endosomal liberation, and nuclear import. In this review article, we outline key characteristics of major gene therapy viruses—adenovirus, adeno-associated virus (AAV), and lentivirus—and summarize the mechanisms regulating important steps in the virus journey from binding at peripheral nerve terminals to nuclear delivery. Additionally, we describe how neuropathology can negatively influence these pathways, and conclude by discussing opportunities to optimize the intramuscular administration route to maximize gene delivery and thus therapeutic potential.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00709</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural implants that deliver multi-site electrical stimulation to the nervous systems are no longer the last resort but routine treatment options for various neurological disorders. Multi-site electrical stimulation is also widely used to study nervous system function and neural circuit transformations. These technologies increasingly demand dynamic electrical stimulation and closed-loop feedback control for real-time assessment of neural function, which is technically challenging since stimulus-evoked artifacts overwhelm the small neural signals of interest. We report a novel and versatile artifact removal method that can be applied in a variety of settings, from single- to multi-site stimulation and recording and for current waveforms of arbitrary shape and size. The method capitalizes on linear electrical coupling between stimulating currents and recording artifacts, which allows us to estimate a multi-channel linear Wiener filter to predict and subsequently remove artifacts via subtraction. We confirm and verify the linearity assumption and demonstrate feasibility in a variety of recording modalities, including in vitro sciatic nerve stimulation, bilateral cochlear implant stimulation, and multi-channel stimulation and recording between the auditory midbrain and cortex. We demonstrate a vast enhancement in the recording quality with a typical artifact reduction of 25−40 dB. The method is efficient and can be scaled to arbitrary number of stimulus and recording sites, making it ideal for applications in large-scale arrays, closed-loop implants, and high-resolution multi-channel brain-machine interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Extramuscular Recording of Spontaneous EMG Activity and Transcranial Electrical Elicited Motor Potentials in Horses: Characteristics of Different Subcutaneous and Surface Electrode Types and Practical Guidelines</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00652</link>
	<content:encoded>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Adhesive surface electrodes are worthwhile to explore in detail as alternative to subcutaneous needle electrodes to assess myogenic evoked potentials (MEP) in human and horses. Extramuscular characteristics of both electrode types and different brands are compared in simultaneous recordings by also considering electrode impedances and background noise under not mechanically secured (not taped) and taped conditions.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;In five ataxic and one non-ataxic horses, transcranial electrical MEPs, myographic activity, and noise were simultaneously recorded from subcutaneous needle (three brands) together with pre-gelled surface electrodes (five brands) on four extremities. In three horses, the impedances of four adjacent-placed surface-electrode pairs of different brands were measured and compared. The similarity between needle and surface EMGs was assessed by cross-correlation functions, pairwise comparison of motor latency times (MLT), and amplitudes. The influence of electrode noise and impedance on the signal quality was assessed by a failure rate (FR) function. Geometric means and impedance ranges under not taped and taped conditions were derived for each brand.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;High coherencies between EMGs of needle-surface pairs degraded to 0.7 at moderate and disappeared at strong noise. MLTs showed sub-millisecond simultaneous differences while sequential variations were several milliseconds. Subcutaneous MEP amplitudes were somewhat lower than epidermal. The impedances of subcutaneous needle electrodes were below 900 Ω and FR = 0. For four brands, the FR for surface electrodes was between 0 and 80% and declined to below 25% after taping. A remaining brand (27G DSN2260 Medtronic) revealed impedances over 100 kΩ and FR = 100% under not taped and taped conditions.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Subcutaneous needle and surface electrodes yield highly coherent EMGs and TES–MEP signals. When taped and allowing sufficient settling time, adhesive surface-electrode signals may approach the signal quality of subcutaneous needle electrodes but still depend on unpredictable conditions of the skin. The study provides a new valuable practical guidance for selection of extramuscular EMG electrodes. This study on horses shares common principles for the choice of adhesive surface or sc needle electrodes in human applications such as in intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring of motor functions of the brain and spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00292</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can relieve motor symptoms related to psychogenic movement disorders (PMDs), but the subtending neurophysiological basis is unclear. We report on a 50-year-old woman with a diagnosis of psychogenic myoclonus in the right lower limb, who was treated with a daily session (in the late morning/early afternoon) of 1 Hz rTMS over the left premotor cortex (PMC), five times a week for 6 weeks. Clinical data and EEG at rest were collected before and immediately and 2-month after the rTMS protocol completion. The patient reported a significant reduction of involuntary movement frequency and intensity and the related disability burden up to the follow-up. In parallel, any abnormality in terms of source current density within and connectivity between the frontal and parietal areas was reset. The short follow–up period, the lack of extensive neurophysiological measures, and the lack of control treatment represent the main limitation of the study. However, low-frequency rTMS over PMC seems a safe and promising approach for the management of psychogenic myoclonus owing to the combination of cortical neuromodulation and non-specific mechanisms suggesting cognitive-behavioral effects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Losses Motivate Cognitive Effort More Than Gains in Effort-Based Decision Making and Performance</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00287</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human behavior is more strongly driven by the motivation to avoid losses than to pursue gains (loss aversion). However, there is little research on how losses influence the motivation to exert effort. We compared the effects of loss and gain incentives on cognitive task performance and effort-based decision making. In three experiments, participants performed a cognitively effortful task under gain and loss conditions and made choices about effort expenditure in a decision-making task. Results consistently showed significant loss aversion in effort-based decision making. Participants were willing to invest more effort in the loss compared to the gain condition (i.e., perform a longer duration task: Experiments 1 and 2; or higher task load: Experiment 3). On the other hand, losses did not lead to improved performance (sustained attention), or higher physiological effort (pupil diameter) in Experiments 1 and 2. In Experiment 3, losses did enhance working memory performance, but only at the highest load level. Taken together, these results suggest that loss aversion motivates higher effort investment in effort-based decision-making, while the effect of loss aversion during a performance may depend on the task type or effort level.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Diffusion Tensor Imaging Revealing the Relation of Age-Related Differences in the Corpus Callosum With Cognitive Style</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00285</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;People may differ in their ways of processing tasks or situations, which may be explained by cognitive styles that define individual differences in information processing strategies. The cognitive style ranges between two extremes: analytic and holistic processing style. The concept of cognitive style has been widely investigated in the literature, but its age-related differences in the neural substrates have remained elusive. In this study, we focused on the white matter structure of the corpus callosum and its possible link to age-related differences in cognitive style, given its functional ability to connect and facilitate efficient communication between the left and right cerebral hemispheres. Seventy-two participants aged 20–75 years participated in this study. Participants’ cognitive styles were measured by the Analysis-Holism Scale (AHS), and their white matter microstructures were acquired using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. The results revealed that older adults tend to have a more holistic processing style than younger adults. We then compared the white matter of tracts of interest between high and low AHS groups and found that the white matter microstructure in the genu of the corpus callosum can be used to distinguish between AHS subgroups. Interestingly, we found that age negatively correlated with the white matter tracts across the brain, indicating that aging is associated with reduced microstructure integrity. Together, our findings suggest that analytic-holistic cognitive styles of information processing possibly reflect that the microstructure development in the anterior part of the corpus callosum may influence the type of age-related information processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Lesion Topography Impact on Shoulder Abduction and Finger Extension Following Left and Right Hemispheric Stroke</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00282</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The existence of shoulder abduction and finger extension movement capacity shortly after stroke onset is an important prognostic factor, indicating favorable functional outcomes for the hemiparetic upper limb (HUL). Here, we asked whether variation in lesion topography affects these two movements similarly or distinctly and whether lesion impact is similar or distinct for left and right hemisphere damage. Shoulder abduction and finger extension movements were examined in 77 chronic post-stroke patients using relevant items of the Fugl-Meyer test. Lesion effects were analyzed separately for left and right hemispheric damage patient groups, using voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping. In the left hemispheric damage group, shoulder abduction and finger extension were affected only by damage to the corticospinal tract in its passage through the corona radiata. In contrast, following the right hemispheric damage, these two movements were affected not only by corticospinal tract damage but also by damage to white matter association tracts, the putamen, and the insular cortex. In both groups, voxel clusters have been found where damage affected shoulder abduction and also finger extension, along with voxels where damage affected only one of the two movements. The capacity to execute shoulder abduction and finger extension movements following stroke is affected significantly by damage to shared and distinct voxels in the corticospinal tract in left-hemispheric damage patients and by damage to shared and distinct voxels in a larger array of cortical and subcortical regions in right hemispheric damage patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Resting-State Connectivity of Auditory and Reward Systems in Alzheimer’s Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00280</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Music-based interventions (MBI) have become increasingly widely adopted for dementia and related disorders. Previous research shows that music engages reward-related regions through functional connectivity with the auditory system, but evidence for the effectiveness of MBI is mixed in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This underscores the need for a unified mechanistic understanding to motivate MBIs. The main objective of the present study is to characterize the intrinsic connectivity of the auditory and reward systems in healthy aging individuals with MCI, and those with AD. Using resting-state fMRI data from the Alzheimer’s Database Neuroimaging Initiative, we tested resting-state functional connectivity within and between auditory and reward systems in older adults with MCI, AD, and age-matched healthy controls (N = 105). Seed-based correlations were assessed from regions of interest (ROIs) in the auditory network (i.e., anterior superior temporal gyrus, posterior superior temporal gyrus, Heschl’s Gyrus), and the reward network (i.e., nucleus accumbens, caudate, putamen, and orbitofrontal cortex). AD individuals were lower in both within-network and between-network functional connectivity in the auditory network and reward networks compared to MCI and controls. Furthermore, graph theory analyses showed that the MCI group had higher clustering and local efficiency than both AD and control groups, whereas AD individuals had lower betweenness centrality than MCI and control groups. Together, the auditory and reward systems show preserved within- and between-network connectivity in MCI individuals relative to AD. These results motivate future music-based interventions in individuals with MCI due to the preservation of functional connectivity within and between auditory and reward networks at that initial stage of neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Electrocortical Signature of Successful and Unsuccessful Deception in a Face-to-Face Social Interaction</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00277</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deceptive behavior, and the evaluation of others’ behavior as truthful or deceptive, are crucial aspects of human social interaction. We report a study investigating two participants in a social interaction, performing a deception task. The first participant, the “informant,” made true or false autobiographical statements. The second participant, the “detective,” then classified these statements as truth or lie. Behavioral data showed that detectives performed slightly above chance and were better at correctly identifying true as compared with deceptive statements. This presumably reflects the “truth bias”: the finding that individuals are more likely to classify others’ statements as truthful than as deceptive – even when informed that a lie is as likely to be told as the truth. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded from the informant. Event-related potential (ERP) analysis revealed a smaller contingent negative variation (CNV) preceding “convincing” statements (statements classified as true by the detective) compared to “unconvincing” statements (statements classified as lie by the detective) – irrespective of whether the statements were actually truthful or deceptive. This finding suggests a distinct electrocortical signature of “successful” compared to “unsuccessful” deceptive statements. One possible explanation is that the pronounced CNV indicates the individuals’ higher “cognitive load” when processing unconvincing statements.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Persistent Differences in Brain Structure in Developmental Dyscalculia: A Longitudinal Morphometry Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00272</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Developmental dyscalculia (DD) is a learning disability affecting the acquisition of numerical-arithmetical skills. Affected people show persistent deficits in number processing, which are associated with aberrant brain activation and structure. Reduced gray matter has been reported in DD for the parietal cortex including the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), but also the frontal and occipito-temporal cortex. Furthermore, dyscalculics show white matter differences for instance in the inferior (ILF) and superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). However, the longitudinal development of these structural differences is unknown. Therefore, our goal was to investigate the developmental trajectory of gray and white matter in children with and without DD. In this longitudinal study, neuropsychological measures and T1-weighted structural images were collected twice with an interval of 4 years from 13 children with DD (8.2–10.4 years) and 10 typically developing (TD) children (8.0–10.4 years). Voxel-wise estimation of gray and white matter volumes was assessed using voxel-based morphometry for longitudinal data. The present findings reveal for the first time that DD children show persistently reduced gray and white matter volumes over development. Reduced gray matter was found in the bilateral inferior parietal lobes including the IPS, supramarginal gyri, left precuneus, cuneus, right superior occipital gyrus, bilateral inferior and middle temporal gyri, and insula. White matter volumes were reduced in the bilateral ILF and SLF, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), corticospinal tracts, and right anterior thalamic radiation (ATR). Behaviorally, children with DD performed significantly worse in various numerical tasks at baseline and follow-up, corroborating persistent deficits in number processing. The present results are in line with the literature showing that children with DD have reduced gray and white matter volumes in the numerical network. Our study further sheds light on the trajectory of brain development, revealing that these known structural differences in the long association fibers and the adjacent regions of the temporal- and frontoparietal cortex persist in dyscalculic children from childhood into adolescence. In conclusion, our results underscore that DD is a persistent learning disorder accompanied by deficits in number processing and reduced gray and white matter volumes in number related brain areas.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The feasibility of the random subspace ensemble learning method was explored to improve the performance of functional near-infrared spectroscopy-based brain-computer interfaces (fNIRS-BCIs). Feature vectors have been constructed using the temporal characteristics of concentration changes in fNIRS chromophores such as mean, slope, and variance to implement fNIRS-BCIs systems. The mean and slope, which are the most popular features in fNIRS-BCIs, were adopted. Linear support vector machine and linear discriminant analysis were employed, respectively, as a single strong learner and multiple weak learners. All features in every channel and available time window were employed to train the strong learner, and the feature subsets were selected at random to train multiple weak learners. It was determined that random subspace ensemble learning is beneficial to enhance the performance of fNIRS-BCIs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Subjective Evaluation of Performance in a Collaborative Task Is Better Predicted From Autonomic Response Than From True Achievements</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00234</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Whereas the fundamental role of the body in social cognition seems to be generally accepted, elucidating the bodily mechanisms associated with non-verbal communication and cooperation between two or more persons is still a challenging endeavor. In this article we propose a fresh approach for investigating the function of the autonomic nervous system that is reflected in parameters of heart rate variability, respiration, and electrodermal activity in a social setting. We analyzed autonomic parameters of dyads solving a target-tracking task together with the partner or individually. A machine classifier was trained to predict the subjects' rating of performance and collaboration either from tracking error data or from the set of autonomic parameters. When subjects collaborated, this classifier could predict the subjective performance ratings better from the autonomic response than from the objective performance of the subjects. However, when they solved the task individually, predictability from autonomic parameters dropped to the level of objective performance, indicating that subjects were more rational in rating their performance in this condition. Moreover, the model captured general knowledge about the population that allows it to predict the performance ratings of an unseen subject significantly better than chance. Our results suggest that, in particular in situations that require collaboration with others, evaluation of performance is shaped by the bodily processes that are quantified by autonomic parameters. Therefore, subjective performance assessments appear to be modulated not only by the output of a rational or discriminative system that tracks the objective performance but to a significant extent also by interoceptive processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Protective Effects of Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating Polypeptide and Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide Against Cognitive Decline in Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00221</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cognitive impairment is one of the major symptoms in most neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s (AD), Parkinson (PD), and Huntington diseases (HD), affecting millions of people worldwide. Unfortunately, there is no treatment to cure or prevent the progression of those diseases. Cognitive impairment has been related to neuronal cell death and/or synaptic plasticity alteration in important brain regions, such as the cerebral cortex, substantia nigra, striatum, and hippocampus. Therefore, compounds that can act to protect the neuronal loss and/or to reestablish the synaptic activity are needed to prevent cognitive decline in neurodegenerative diseases. Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) are two highly related multifunctional neuropeptides widely distributed in the central nervous system (CNS). PACAP and VIP exert their action through two common receptors, VPAC1 and VPAC2, while PACAP has an additional specific receptor, PAC1. In this review article, we first presented evidence showing the therapeutic potential of PACAP and VIP to fight the cognitive decline observed in models of AD, PD, and HD. We also reviewed the main transduction pathways activated by PACAP and VIP receptors to reduce cognitive dysfunction. Furthermore, we identified the therapeutic targets of PACAP and VIP, and finally, we evaluated different novel synthetic PACAP and VIP analogs as promising pharmacological tools.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Silent Synapse-Based Mechanisms of Critical Period Plasticity</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00213</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Critical periods are postnatal, restricted time windows of heightened plasticity in cortical neural networks, during which experience refines principal neuron wiring configurations. Here, we propose a model with two distinct types of synapses, innate synapses that establish rudimentary networks with innate function, and gestalt synapses that govern the experience-dependent refinement process. Nascent gestalt synapses are constantly formed as AMPA receptor-silent synapses which are the substrates for critical period plasticity. Experience drives the unsilencing and stabilization of gestalt synapses, as well as synapse pruning. This maturation process changes synapse patterning and consequently the functional architecture of cortical excitatory networks. Ocular dominance plasticity (ODP) in the primary visual cortex (V1) is an established experimental model for cortical plasticity. While converging evidence indicates that the start of the critical period for ODP is marked by the maturation of local inhibitory circuits, recent results support our model that critical periods end through the progressive maturation of gestalt synapses. The cooperative yet opposing function of two postsynaptic signaling scaffolds of excitatory synapses, PSD-93 and PSD-95, governs the maturation of gestalt synapses. Without those proteins, networks do not progress far beyond their innate functionality, resulting in rather impaired perception. While cortical networks remain malleable throughout life, the cellular mechanisms and the scope of critical period and adult plasticity differ. Critical period ODP is initiated with the depression of deprived eye responses in V1, whereas adult ODP is characterized by an initial increase in non-deprived eye responses. Our model proposes the gestalt synapse-based mechanism for critical period ODP, and also predicts a different mechanism for adult ODP based on the sparsity of nascent gestalt synapses at that age. Under our model, early life experience shapes the boundaries (the gestalt) for network function, both for its optimal performance as well as for its pathological state. Thus, reintroducing nascent gestalt synapses as plasticity substrates into adults may improve the network gestalt to facilitate functional recovery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Exosomes Secreted From Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells Attenuate Oxygen-Glucose Deprivation/Reoxygenation-Induced Pyroptosis in PC12 Cells by Promoting AMPK-Dependent Autophagic Flux</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00182</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Cerebral ischemia–reperfusion (I/R) injury can lead to severe dysfunction, and its treatment is difficult. It is reported that nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat family protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome-mediated cell pyroptosis is an important part of cerebral I/R injury and the activation of autophagy can inhibit pyroptosis in some tissue injury. Our previous study found that the protective effects of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in cerebral I/R injury may be associated with the regulation of autophagy. Recent studies have demonstrated that exosomes secreted from BMSCs (BMSC-Exos) may play an essential role in the effective biological performance of BMSCs and the protective mechanism of BMSC-Exos is associated with the activation of autophagy and the remission of inflammation, but it has not been reported in studies of cerebral I/R injury. We aimed to investigate the effects of BMSC-Exos on cerebral I/R injury and determine if the mechanism is associated with the regulation of pyroptosis and autophagic flux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: PC12 cells were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) to induce cerebral I/R in vitro and were cocultured with BMSC-Exos. Cell viability was determined with CCK-8 and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) detection kits. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Hoechst 33342/propidium iodide (PI) double staining, 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate assay, immunofluorescence, Western blot, and Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to detect cell pyroptosis. Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), GFP-RFP-LC3 adenovirus transfection, and Western blot were used to detect autophagic flux and its influence on pyroptosis. Finally, coimmunoprecipitation was used to detect the binding interaction between NLRP3 and LC3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: BMSC-Exos increased cell viability in OGD/R. The inhibitory effect of BMSC-Exos on pyroptosis was comparable to the NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 and was reversed by NLRP3 overexpression. Furthermore, BMSC-Exos promoted autophagic flux through the AMP-activated kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of the rapamycin pathway, whereas chloroquine, AMPK silencing, and compound C blocked the inhibitory effect on pyroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: BMSC-Exos can protect PC12 cells against OGD/R injury via attenuation of NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis by promoting AMPK-dependent autophagic flux.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Region and Cell Type Distribution of TCF4 in the Postnatal Mouse Brain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00042</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transcription factor 4 is a class I basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor regulating gene expression. Altered TCF4 gene expression has been linked to non-syndromic intellectual disability, schizophrenia, and a severe neurodevelopmental disorder known as Pitt-Hopkins syndrome. An understanding of the cell types expressing TCF4 protein in the mouse brain is needed to help identify potential pathophysiological mechanisms and targets for therapeutic delivery in TCF4-linked disorders. Here we developed a novel green fluorescent protein reporter mouse to visualize TCF4-expressing cells throughout the brain. Using this TCF4 reporter mouse, we observed prominent expression of TCF4 in the pallial region and cerebellum of the postnatal brain. At the cellular level, both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons express TCF4 in the cortex and hippocampus, while only a subset of GABAergic interneurons express TCF4 in the striatum. Among glial cell groups, TCF4 is present in astrocytes and immature and mature oligodendrocytes. In the cerebellum, cells in the granule and molecular layer express TCF4. Our findings greatly extend our knowledge of the spatiotemporal and cell type-specific expression patterns of TCF4 in the brain, and hence, lay the groundwork to better understand TCF4-linked neurological disorders. Any effort to restore TCF4 functions through small molecule or genetic therapies should target these brain regions and cell groups to best recapitulate TCF4 expression patterns.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The estimation of parameters controlling the electrical properties of biological neurons is essential to determine their complement of ion channels and to understand the function of biological circuits. By synchronizing conductance models to time series observations of the membrane voltage, one may construct models capable of predicting neuronal dynamics. However, identifying the actual set of parameters of biological ion channels remains a formidable theoretical challenge. Here, we present a regularization method that improves convergence towards this optimal solution when data are noisy and the model is unknown. Our method relies on the existence of an offset in parameter space arising from the interplay between model nonlinearity and experimental error. By tuning this offset, we induce saddle-node bifurcations from sub-optimal to optimal solutions. This regularization method increases the probability of finding the optimal set of parameters from 67% to 94.3%. We also reduce parameter correlations by implementing adaptive sampling and stimulation protocols compatible with parameter identifiability requirements. Our results show that the optimal model parameters may be inferred from imperfect observations provided the conditions of observability and identifiability are fulfilled.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/N2xySdvpohw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The modeling of the spreading of communicable diseases has experienced significant advances in the last two decades or so. This has been possible due to the proliferation of data and the development of new methods to gather, mine and analyze it. A key role has also been played by the latest advances in new disciplines like network science. Nonetheless, current models still lack a faithful representation of all possible heterogeneities and features that can be extracted from data. Here, we bridge a current gap in the mathematical modeling of infectious diseases and develop a framework that allows to account simultaneously for both the connectivity of individuals and the age-structure of the population. We compare different scenarios, namely, i) the homogeneous mixing setting, ii) one in which only the social mixing is taken into account, iii) a setting that considers the connectivity of individuals alone, and finally, iv) a multilayer representation in which both the social mixing and the number of contacts are included in the model. We analytically show that the thresholds obtained for these four scenarios are different. In addition, we conduct extensive numerical simulations and conclude that heterogeneities in the contact network are important for a proper determination of the epidemic threshold, whereas the age-structure plays a bigger role beyond the onset of the outbreak. Altogether, when it comes to evaluate interventions such as vaccination, both sources of individual heterogeneity are important and should be concurrently considered. Our results also provide an indication of the errors incurred in situations in which one cannot access all needed information in terms of connectivity and age of the population.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_p5v-5p47nE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

For knowledge to benefit research and society, it must be trustworthy. Trustworthy research is robust, rigorous, and transparent at all stages of design, execution, and reporting. Assessment of researchers still rarely includes considerations related to trustworthiness, rigor, and transparency. We have developed the Hong Kong Principles (HKPs) as part of the 6th World Conference on Research Integrity with a specific focus on the need to drive research improvement through ensuring that researchers are explicitly recognized and rewarded for behaviors that strengthen research integrity. We present five principles: responsible research practices; transparent reporting; open science (open research); valuing a diversity of types of research; and recognizing all contributions to research and scholarly activity. For each principle, we provide a rationale for its inclusion and provide examples where these principles are already being adopted.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/1PqEX9TbqCM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Synaptic Loss in Multiple Sclerosis Spinal Cord</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25835?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Disability in multiple sclerosis (MS) is considered primarily a result of axonal loss. However, correlation with spinal cord cross‐sectional area—a predictor of disability—is poor, questioning the unique role of axonal loss. We investigated the degree of synaptic loss in postmortem spinal cords (18 chronic MS, 8 healthy controls) using immunohistochemistry for synaptophysin and synapsin. Substantial (58–96%) loss of synapses throughout the spinal cord was detected, along with moderate (47%) loss of anterior horn neurons, notably in demyelinating MS lesions. We conclude that synaptic loss is significant in chronic MS, likely contributing to disability accrual. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25803?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We screened 662 subjects comprising 462 essential tremor (ET) subjects (285 sporadic, 125 with family history, and 52 probands from well‐characterized ET pedigrees) and 200 controls and identified pathogenic &lt;i&gt;NOTCH2NLC &lt;/i&gt; GGC repeat expansions in 4 sporadic ET patients. Two patients were followed up for &amp;gt;1 decade; one with 90 repeats remained an ET phenotype that did not evolve after 40 years, whereas another patient with 107 repeats developed motor symptoms and cognitive impairment after 8 to 10 years. Neuroimaging in this patient revealed severe leukoencephalopathy; diffusion‐weighted imaging hyperintensity in the corticomedullary junction and skin biopsy revealed intranuclear inclusions suggestive of intranuclear inclusion body disease (NIID). No GGC repeats of &amp;gt;60 units were detected in familial ET cases and controls, although 4 ET patients carried 47 to 53 “intermediate” repeats. &lt;i&gt;NOTCH2NLC &lt;/i&gt; GGC repeat expansions can be associated with sporadic ET. Carriers presenting with a pure ET phenotype may or may not convert to NIID up to 4 decades after initial tremor onset. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Aberrant Cerebellar Circuitry in the Spinocerebellar Ataxias</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00707</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative diseases that share convergent disease features. A common symptom of these diseases is development of ataxia, involving impaired balance and motor coordination, usually stemming from cerebellar dysfunction and neurodegeneration. For most spinocerebellar ataxias, pathology can be attributed to an underlying gene mutation and the impaired function of the encoded protein through loss or gain-of-function effects. Strikingly, despite vast heterogeneity in the structure and function of disease-causing genes across the SCAs and the cellular processes affected, the downstream effects have considerable overlap, including alterations in cerebellar circuitry. Interestingly, aberrant function and degeneration of Purkinje cells, the major output neuronal population present within the cerebellum, precedes abnormalities in other neuronal populations within many SCAs, suggesting that Purkinje cells have increased vulnerability to cellular perturbations. Factors that are known to contribute to perturbed Purkinje cell function in spinocerebellar ataxias include altered gene expression resulting in altered expression or functionality of proteins and channels that modulate membrane potential, downstream impairments in intracellular calcium homeostasis and changes in glutamatergic input received from synapsing climbing or parallel fibers. This review will explore this enhanced vulnerability and the aberrant cerebellar circuitry linked with it in many forms of SCA. It is critical to understand why Purkinje cells are vulnerable to such insults and what overlapping pathogenic mechanisms are occurring across multiple SCAs, despite different underlying genetic mutations. Enhanced understanding of disease mechanisms will facilitate the development of treatments to prevent or slow progression of the underlying neurodegenerative processes, cerebellar atrophy and ataxic symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurogenesis: The Zebrafish Amygdaloid Complex – Functional Ground Plan, Molecular Delineation, and Everted Topology</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00608</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In mammals and other tetrapods, a multinuclear forebrain structure, called the amygdala, forms the neuroregulatory core essential for emotion, cognition, and social behavior. Currently, higher circuits of affective behavior in anamniote non-tetrapod vertebrates (“fishes”) are poorly understood, preventing a comprehensive understanding of amygdala evolution. Through molecular characterization and evolutionary-developmental considerations, we delineated the complex amygdala ground plan of zebrafish, whose everted telencephalon has made comparisons to the evaginated forebrains of tetrapods challenging. In this radical paradigm, thirteen telencephalic territories constitute the zebrafish amygdaloid complex and each territory is distinguished by conserved molecular properties and structure-functional relationships with other amygdaloid structures. Central to our paradigm, the study identifies the teleostean amygdaloid nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract (nLOT), an olfactory integrative structure that links dopaminergic telencephalic groups to the amygdala alongside redefining the putative zebrafish olfactory pallium (“Dp”). Molecular characteristics such as the distribution of substance P and the calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin (PV) and calretinin (CR) indicate, that the zebrafish extended centromedial (autonomic and reproductive) amygdala is predominantly located in the GABAergic and isl1-negative territory. Like in tetrapods, medial amygdaloid (MeA) nuclei are defined by the presence of substance P immunoreactive fibers and calretinin-positive neurons, whereas central amygdaloid (CeA) nuclei lack these characteristics. A detailed comparison of lhx5-driven and vGLut2a-driven GFP in transgenic reporter lines revealed ancestral topological relationships between the thalamic eminence (EmT), the medial amygdala (MeA), the nLOT, and the integrative olfactory pallium. Thus, the study explains how the zebrafish amygdala and the complexly everted telencephalon topologically relate to the corresponding structures in mammals indicating that an elaborate amygdala ground plan evolved early in vertebrates, in a common ancestor of teleosts and tetrapods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Dissociating Arithmetic Operations in the Parietal Cortex Using 1 Hz Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation: The Importance of Strategy Use</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00271</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The triple-code model (TCM) of number processing suggests the involvement of distinct parietal cortex areas in arithmetic operations: the bilateral horizontal segment of the intraparietal sulcus (hIPS) for arithmetic operations that require the manipulation of numerical quantities (e.g., subtraction) and the left angular gyrus (AG) for arithmetic operations that require the retrieval of answers from long-term memory (e.g., multiplication). Although neuropsychological, neuroimaging, and brain stimulation studies suggest the dissociation of these operations into distinct parietal cortex areas, the role of strategy (online calculation vs. retrieval) is not yet fully established. In the present study, we further explored the causal involvement of the left AG for multiplication and left hIPS for subtraction using a neuronavigated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) paradigm. Stimulation sites were determined based on an fMRI experiment using the same tasks. To account for the effect of strategy, participants were asked whether they used retrieval or calculation for each individual problem. We predicted that the stimulation of the left AG would selectively disrupt the retrieval of the solution to multiplication problems. On the other hand, stimulation of the left hIPS should selectively disrupt subtraction. Our results revealed that left AG stimulation was detrimental to the retrieval and online calculation of solutions for multiplication problems, as well as, the retrieval (but not online calculation) of the solutions to subtraction problems. In contrast, left hIPS stimulation had no detrimental effect on both operations regardless of strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Cholinergic Projections From the Pedunculopontine Tegmental Nucleus Contact Excitatory and Inhibitory Neurons in the Inferior Colliculus</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00043</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The inferior colliculus processes nearly all ascending auditory information. Most collicular cells respond to sound, and for a majority of these cells, the responses can be modulated by acetylcholine (ACh). The cholinergic effects are varied and, for the most part, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. The major source of cholinergic input to the inferior colliculus is the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPT), part of the pontomesencephalic tegmentum known for projections to the thalamus and roles in arousal and the sleep-wake cycle. Characterization of PPT inputs to the inferior colliculus has been complicated by the mixed neurotransmitter population within the PPT. Using selective viral-tract tracing techniques in a ChAT-Cre Long Evans rat, the present study characterizes the distribution and targets of cholinergic projections from PPT to the inferior colliculus. Following the deposit of viral vector in one PPT, cholinergic axons studded with boutons were present bilaterally in the inferior colliculus, with the greater density of axons and boutons ipsilateral to the injection site. On both sides, cholinergic axons were present throughout the inferior colliculus, distributing boutons to the central nucleus, lateral cortex, and dorsal cortex. In each inferior colliculus (IC) subdivision, the cholinergic PPT axons appear to contact both GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons. These findings suggest cholinergic projections from the PPT have a widespread influence over the IC, likely affecting many aspects of midbrain auditory processing. Moreover, the effects are likely to be mediated by direct cholinergic actions on both excitatory and inhibitory circuits in the inferior colliculus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Respiration-Locking of Olfactory Receptor and Projection Neurons in the Mouse Olfactory Bulb and Its Modulation by Brain State</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00220</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For sensory systems of the brain, the dynamics of an animal’s own sampling behavior has a direct consequence on ensuing computations. This is particularly the case for mammalian olfaction, where a rhythmic flow of air over the nasal epithelium entrains activity in olfactory system neurons in a phenomenon known as sniff-locking. Parameters of sniffing can, however, change drastically with brain states. Coupled to the fact that different observation methods have different kinetics, consensus on the sniff-locking properties of neurons is lacking. To address this, we investigated the sniff-related activity of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), as well as the principal neurons of the olfactory bulb (OB), using 2-photon calcium imaging and intracellular whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in vivo, both in anesthetized and awake mice. Our results indicate that OSNs and OB output neurons lock robustly to the sniff rhythm, but with a slight temporal shift between behavioral states. We also observed a slight delay between methods. Further, the divergent sniff-locking by tufted cells (TCs) and mitral cells (MCs) in the absence of odor can be used to determine the cell type reliably using a simple linear classifier. Using this classification on datasets where morphological identification is unavailable, we find that MCs use a wider range of temporal shifts to encode odors than previously thought, while TCs have a constrained timing of activation due to an early-onset hyperpolarization. We conclude that the sniff rhythm serves as a fundamental rhythm but its impact on odor encoding depends on cell type, and this difference is accentuated in awake mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Memory and Learning Deficits Are Associated With Ca2+ Dyshomeostasis in Normal Aging</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00224</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis is critical to the normal physiological functions of neurons and neuronal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dyshomeostasis has been associated with the age-related decline of cognitive functions. Accumulated evidence indicates that the underlying mechanism for this is that abnormal intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels stimulate the dysregulation of intracellular signaling, which subsequently induces neuronal cell death. We examined intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis in cortical (in vivo) and hippocampal (in vitro) neurons from young (3-months), middle-age (12-months), and aged (24-months) wild type C57BL6J mice. We found a progressive age-related elevation of intracellular resting calcium ([Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;) in cortical (in vivo) and hippocampal (in vitro) neurons associated with increased hippocampal neuronal calpain activity and reduced cell viability. In vitro, removal of extracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or treatment with SAR7334 or dantrolene reduced [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; in all age groups and dantrolene treatment lowered calpain activity and increased cell viability. In vivo, both middle-aged and aged mice showed cognitive deficits compared to young mice, which improved after dantrolene treatment. These findings support the hypothesis that intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dyshomeostasis is a major mechanism underlying the cognitive deficits seen in both normal aging and degenerative neurologic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Computational drug repositioning and drug-target prediction have become essential tasks in the early stage of drug discovery. In previous studies, these two tasks have often been considered separately. However, the entities studied in these two tasks (i.e., drugs, targets, and diseases) are inherently related. On one hand, drugs interact with targets in cells to modulate target activities, which in turn alter biological pathways to promote healthy functions and to treat diseases. On the other hand, both drug repositioning and drug-target prediction involve the same drug feature space, which naturally connects these two problems and the two domains (diseases and targets). By using the &lt;i&gt;wisdom of the crowds&lt;/i&gt;, it is possible to transfer knowledge from one of the domains to the other. The existence of relationships among drug-target-disease motivates us to jointly consider drug repositioning and drug-target prediction in drug discovery. In this paper, we present a novel approach called iDrug, which seamlessly integrates drug repositioning and drug-target prediction into one coherent model via cross-network embedding. In particular, we provide a principled way to transfer knowledge from these two domains and to enhance prediction performance for both tasks. Using real-world datasets, we demonstrate that iDrug achieves superior performance on both learning tasks compared to several state-of-the-art approaches.

Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is the propagation of a relatively slow wave in cortical brain tissue that is linked to a number of pathological conditions such as stroke and migraine. Most of the existing literature investigates the dynamics of short term phenomena such as the depolarization and repolarization of membrane potentials or large ion shifts. Here, we focus on the clinically-relevant hour-long state of neurovascular malfunction in the wake of CSDs. This dysfunctional state involves widespread vasoconstriction and a general disruption of neurovascular coupling. We demonstrate, using a mathematical model, that dissolution of calcium that has aggregated within the mitochondria of vascular smooth muscle cells can drive an hour-long disruption. We model the rate of calcium clearance as well as the dynamical implications on overall blood flow. Based on reaction stoichiometry, we quantify a possible impact of calcium phosphate dissolution on the maintenance of F&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-ATP synthase activity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v1HJAxQQnVE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Cancer cells have genetic alterations that often directly affect intracellular protein signaling processes allowing them to bypass control mechanisms for cell death, growth and division. Cancer drugs targeting these alterations often work initially, but resistance is common. Combinations of targeted drugs may overcome or prevent resistance, but their selection requires context-specific knowledge of signaling pathways including complex interactions such as feedback loops and crosstalk. To infer quantitative pathway models, we collected a rich dataset on a melanoma cell line: Following perturbation with 54 drug combinations, we measured 124 (phospho-)protein levels and phenotypic response (cell growth, apoptosis) in a time series from 10 minutes to 67 hours. From these data, we trained time-resolved mathematical models that capture molecular interactions and the coupling of molecular levels to cellular phenotype, which in turn reveal the main direct or indirect molecular responses to each drug. Systematic model simulations identified novel combinations of drugs predicted to reduce the survival of melanoma cells, with partial experimental verification. This particular application of perturbation biology demonstrates the potential impact of combining time-resolved data with modeling for the discovery of new combinations of cancer drugs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/eMmy4prvFL0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Towards optogenetic vision restoration with high resolution</title>

In many cases of inherited retinal degenerations, ganglion cells are spared despite photoreceptor cell death, making it possible to stimulate them to restore visual function. Several studies have shown that it is possible to express an optogenetic protein in ganglion cells and make them light sensitive, a promising strategy to restore vision. However the spatial resolution of optogenetically-reactivated retinas has rarely been measured, especially in the primate. Since the optogenetic protein is also expressed in axons, it is unclear if these neurons will only be sensitive to the stimulation of a small region covering their somas and dendrites, or if they will also respond to any stimulation overlapping with their axon, dramatically impairing spatial resolution. Here we recorded responses of mouse and macaque retinas to random checkerboard patterns following an in vivo optogenetic therapy. We show that optogenetically activated ganglion cells are each sensitive to a small region of visual space. A simple model based on this small receptive field predicted accurately their responses to complex stimuli. From this model, we simulated how the entire population of light sensitive ganglion cells would respond to letters of different sizes. We then estimated the maximal acuity expected by a patient, assuming it could make an optimal use of the information delivered by this reactivated retina. The obtained acuity is above the limit of legal blindness. Our model also makes interesting predictions on how acuity might vary upon changing the therapeutic strategy, assuming an optimal use of the information present in the retinal activity. Optogenetic therapy could thus potentially lead to high resolution vision, under conditions that our model helps to determinine.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CmixbOwQ2Ss&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Photoreceptors are specialized cells devoted to the transduction of the incoming visual signals. Rods are able also to shed from their tip old disks and to synthesize at the base of the outer segment (OS) new disks. By combining electrophysiology, optical tweezers (OTs), and biochemistry, we investigate mechanosensitivity in the rods of &lt;i&gt;Xenopus laevis&lt;/i&gt;, and we show that 1) mechanosensitive channels (MSCs), transient receptor potential canonical 1 (TRPC1), and Piezo1 are present in rod inner segments (ISs); 2) mechanical stimulation—of the order of 10 pN—applied briefly to either the OS or IS evokes calcium transients; 3) inhibition of MSCs decreases the duration of photoresponses to bright flashes; 4) bright flashes of light induce a rapid shortening of the OS; and 5) the genes encoding the TRPC family have an ancient association with the genes encoding families of protein involved in phototransduction. These results suggest that MSCs play an integral role in rods’ phototransduction.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/lleVYxXsH_I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Mutations create genetic variation for other evolutionary forces to operate on and cause numerous genetic diseases. Nevertheless, how de novo mutations arise remains poorly understood. Progress in the area is hindered by the fact that error rates of conventional sequencing technologies (1 in 100 or 1,000 base pairs) are several orders of magnitude higher than de novo mutation rates (1 in 10,000,000 or 100,000,000 base pairs per generation). Moreover, previous analyses of germline de novo mutations examined pedigrees (and not germ cells) and thus were likely affected by selection. Here, we applied highly accurate duplex sequencing to detect low-frequency, de novo mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) directly from oocytes and from somatic tissues (brain and muscle) of 36 mice from two independent pedigrees. We found mtDNA mutation frequencies 2- to 3-fold higher in 10-month-old than in 1-month-old mice, demonstrating mutation accumulation during the period of only 9 mo. Mutation frequencies and patterns differed between germline and somatic tissues and among mtDNA regions, suggestive of distinct mutagenesis mechanisms. Additionally, we discovered a more pronounced genetic drift of mitochondrial genetic variants in the germline of older versus younger mice, arguing for mtDNA turnover during oocyte meiotic arrest. Our study deciphered for the first time the intricacies of germline de novo mutagenesis using duplex sequencing directly in oocytes, which provided unprecedented resolution and minimized selection effects present in pedigree studies. Moreover, our work provides important information about the origins and accumulation of mutations with aging/maturation and has implications for delayed reproduction in modern human societies. Furthermore, the duplex sequencing method we optimized for single cells opens avenues for investigating low-frequency mutations in other studies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/K9Qc6_N4PD0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: The pregnant myometrium is epigenetically activated at contractility-driving gene loci prior to the onset of labor in mice</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/prDhSEHk-O0/article</link>

During gestation, uterine smooth muscle cells transition from a state of quiescence to one of contractility, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this transition at a genomic level are not well-known. To better understand these events, we evaluated the epigenetic landscape of the mouse myometrium during the pregnant, laboring, and postpartum stages. We generated gestational time point–specific enrichment profiles for histone H3 acetylation on lysine residue 27 (H3K27ac), histone H3 trimethylation of lysine residue 4 (H3K4me3), and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) occupancy by chromatin immunoprecipitation with massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq), as well as gene expression profiles by total RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). Our findings reveal that 533 genes, including known contractility-driving genes (Gap junction alpha 1 [&lt;i&gt;Gja1&lt;/i&gt;], FBJ osteosarcoma oncogene [&lt;i&gt;Fos&lt;/i&gt;], Fos-like antigen 2 [&lt;i&gt;Fosl2&lt;/i&gt;], Oxytocin receptor [&lt;i&gt;Oxtr&lt;/i&gt;], and Prostaglandin G/H synthase 2 (&lt;i&gt;Ptgs2&lt;/i&gt;), for example), are up-regulated at day 19 during active labor because of an increase in transcription at gene bodies. Labor-associated promoters and putative intergenic enhancers, however, are epigenetically activated as early as day 15, by which point the majority of genome-wide H3K27ac or H3K4me3 peaks present in term laboring tissue is already established. Despite this early exhibited histone signature, increased noncoding enhancer RNA (eRNA) production at putative intergenic enhancers and recruitment of RNAPII to the gene bodies of labor-associated loci were detected only during labor. Our findings indicate that epigenetic activation of the myometrial genome precedes active labor by at least 4 days in the mouse model, suggesting that the myometrium is poised for rapid activation of contraction-associated genes in order to exit the state of quiescence.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/prDhSEHk-O0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our prior studies showed bilateral gustatory cortex (GC) lesions significantly impair taste sensitivity to salts (NaCl and KCl) and quinine (“bitter”) but not to sucrose (“sweet”). The range of qualitative tastants tested here has been extended in a theoretically relevant way to include the maltodextrin, Maltrin, a preferred stimulus by rats thought to represent a unique taste quality, and the “sour” stimulus citric acid; NaCl was also included as a positive control. Male rats (Sprague–Dawley) with histologically confirmed neurotoxin‐induced bilateral (BGCX, &lt;i&gt;n &lt;/i&gt; = 13), or right (RGCX, &lt;i&gt;n &lt;/i&gt; = 13) or left (LGCX, &lt;i&gt;n &lt;/i&gt; = 9) unilateral GC lesions and sham‐operated controls (SHAM, &lt;i&gt;n &lt;/i&gt; = 16) were trained to discriminate a tastant from water in an operant two‐response detection task. A mapping system was used to determine placement, size, and symmetry (when bilateral) of the lesion. BGCX significantly impaired taste sensitivity to NaCl, as expected, but not to Maltrin or citric acid, emulating our prior results with sucrose. However, in the case of citric acid, there was some disruption in performance at higher concentrations. Interestingly, RGCX, but not LGCX, also significantly impaired taste sensitivity, but only to NaCl, suggesting some degree of lateralized function. Taken together with our prior findings, extensive bilateral lesions in GC do not disrupt basic taste signal detection to all taste stimuli uniformly. Moreover, GC lesions do not preclude the ability of rats to learn and perform the task, clearly demonstrating that, in its absence, other brain regions are able to maintain sensory‐discriminative taste processing, albeit with attenuated sensitivity for select stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: RNA Binding Motif 5 (RBM5) in the CNS—Moving Beyond Cancer to Harness RNA Splicing to Mitigate the Consequences of Brain Injury</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00126</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Gene splicing modulates the potency of cell death effectors, alters neuropathological disease processes, influences neuronal recovery, but may also direct distinct mechanisms of secondary brain injury. Therapeutic targeting of RNA splicing is a promising avenue for next-generation CNS treatments. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) regulate a variety of RNA species and are prime candidates in the hunt for druggable targets to manipulate and tailor gene-splicing responses in the brain. RBPs preferentially recognize unique consensus sequences in targeted mRNAs. Also, RBPs often contain multiple RNA-binding domains (RBDs)—each having a unique consensus sequence—suggesting the possibility that drugs could be developed to block individual functional domains, increasing the precision of RBP-targeting therapies. Empirical characterization of most RBPs is lacking and represents a major barrier to advance this emerging therapeutic area. There is a paucity of data on the role of RBPs in the brain including, identification of their unique mRNA targets, defining how CNS insults affect their levels and elucidating which RBPs (and individual domains within) to target to improve neurological outcomes. This review focuses on the state-of-the-art of the RBP tumor suppressor RNA binding motif 5 (RBM5) in the CNS. We discuss its potent pro-death roles in cancer, which motivated our interest to study it in the brain. We review recent studies showing that RBM5 levels are increased after CNS trauma and that it promotes neuronal death in vitro. Finally, we conclude with recent reports on the first set of RBM5 regulated genes identified in the intact brain, and discuss how those findings provide new clues germane to its potential function(s) in the CNS, and pose new questions on its therapeutic utility to mitigate CNS injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00751</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive, chronic, and neurodegenerative disorder that is primarily diagnosed by clinical examinations and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this study, we proposed a machine learning based radiomics method to predict PD. Fifty healthy controls (HC) along with 70 PD patients underwent resting-state magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). For all subjects, we extracted five types of 6664 features, including mean amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (mALFF), mean regional homogeneity (mReHo), resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC), voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) and gray matter (GM) volume. After conducting dimension reduction utilizing Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), fifty-three radiomic features including 46 RSFCs, 1 mALFF, 3 mReHos, 1 VMHC, 2 GM volumes and 1 clinical factor were retained. The selected features also indicated the most discriminative regions for PD. We further conducted model fitting procedure for classifying subjects in the training set employing random forest and support volume machine (SVM) to evaluate the performance of the two methods. After cross-validation, both methods achieved 100% accuracy and area under curve (AUC) for distinguishing between PD and HC in the training set. In the testing set, SVM performed better than random forest with the accuracy, true positive rate (TPR) and AUC being 85%, 1 and 0.97, respectively. These findings demonstrate the radiomics technique has the potential to support radiological diagnosis and to achieve high classification accuracy for clinical diagnostic systems for patients with PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00679</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive and devastating multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder. Although the pathogenesis of ALS is still not completely understood, numerous studies suggest that mitochondrial deregulation may be implicated in its onset and progression. Interestingly, mitochondrial deregulation has also been associated with changes in neural stem cells (NSC) proliferation, differentiation, and migration. In this review, we highlight the importance of mitochondrial function for neurogenesis, and how both processes are correlated and may contribute to the pathogenesis of ALS; we have focused primarily on preclinical data from animal models of ALS, since to date no studies have evaluated this link using human samples. As there is currently no cure and no effective therapy to counteract ALS, we have also discussed how improving neurogenic function by epigenetic modulation could benefit ALS. In support of this hypothesis, changes in histone deacetylation can alter mitochondrial function, which in turn might ameliorate cellular proliferation as well as neuronal differentiation and migration. We propose that modulation of epigenetics, mitochondrial function, and neurogenesis might provide new hope for ALS patients, and studies exploring these new territories are warranted in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

These models can help us further understand the biological function and derive potential pathological mechanisms for LRRK2.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cognitive impairment is prevalent in hemodialysis end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. It might be associated with poor prognosis. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms have not been completely clarified. This study explored spontaneous brain activity in ESRD patients on hemodialysis by using the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF). Nineteen ESRD patients on regular hemodialysis were included in this study. Eighteen age-, sex- and education level-matched volunteers were enrolled as the healthy control group. All participants had resting-state functional MRI scanning, neuropsychological tests, and laboratory testing. ALFF was used for assessing intrinsic brain activity. Independent samples t-test was used for obtaining group differences. Spearman correlation analysis was applied to assess the association between ALFF changes, neuropsychological, and clinical indices. Compared to the healthy control group, hemodialysis patients showed decreased ALFF in the precuneus, right angular gyrus/inferior lobule as well as increased ALFF in the left parahippocampus/hippocampus and right precentral/postcentral gyrus. The ALFF abnormalities in these regions were closely associated with hemoglobin levels. Also, increased ALFF in the left parahippocampus/hippocampus showed a negative correlation with the score of long-delayed free recall. Hemodialysis patients had aberrant ALFF in the default mode network (DMN) regions, particularly in the precuneus and parahippocampus/hippocampus, which may be correlated with neuropathological mechanisms involved in hemodialysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00266</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Our jobs can provide intellectually and socially enriched environments but also be the source of major psychological and physical stressors. As the average full-time worker spends &amp;gt;8 h at work per weekday and remains in the workforce for about 40 years, occupational experiences must be important factors in cognitive and brain aging. Therefore, we studied whether occupational complexity and stress are associated with hippocampal volume and cognitive ability in 99 cognitively normal older adults. We estimated occupational complexity, physical stress, and psychological stress using the Work Design Questionnaire (Morgeson and Humphrey, 2006), Quantitative Workload Inventory and Interpersonal Conflict at Work Scale (Spector and Jex, 1998). We found that physical stress, comprising physical demands and work conditions, was associated with smaller hippocampal volume and poorer memory performance. These associations were independent of age, gender, brain size, socioeconomic factors (education, income, and job title), duration of the job, employment status, leisure physical activity and general stress. This suggests that physical demands at work and leisure physical activity may have largely independent and opposite effects on brain and cognitive health. Our findings highlight the importance of considering midlife occupational experiences, such as work physical stress, in understanding individual trajectories of cognitive and brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Automated Curation of CNMF-E-Extracted ROI Spatial Footprints and Calcium Traces Using Open-Source AutoML Tools</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00042</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In vivo 1-photon (1p) calcium imaging is an increasingly prevalent method in behavioral neuroscience. Numerous analysis pipelines have been developed to improve the reliability and scalability of pre-processing and ROI extraction for these large calcium imaging datasets. Despite these advancements in pre-processing methods, manual curation of the extracted spatial footprints and calcium traces of neurons remains important for quality control. Here, we propose an additional semi-automated curation step for sorting spatial footprints and calcium traces from putative neurons extracted using the popular constrained non-negative matrixfactorization for microendoscopic data (CNMF-E) algorithm. We used the automated machine learning (AutoML) tools TPOT and AutoSklearn to generate classifiers to curate the extracted ROIs trained on a subset of human-labeled data. AutoSklearn produced the best performing classifier, achieving an F1 score &amp;gt;92% on the ground truth test dataset. This automated approach is a useful strategy for filtering ROIs with relatively few labeled data points and can be easily added to pre-existing pipelines currently using CNMF-E for ROI extraction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Challenges for Therapeutic Applications of Opsin-Based Optogenetic Tools in Humans</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00041</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As the technological hurdles are overcome and optogenetic techniques advance to have more control over neurons, therapies based on these approaches will begin to emerge in the clinic. Here, we consider the technical challenges surrounding the transition of this breakthrough technology from an investigative tool to a true therapeutic avenue. The emerging strategies and remaining tasks surrounding genetically encoded molecules which respond to light as well as the vehicles required to deliver them are discussed.The use of optogenetics in humans would represent a completely new paradigm in medicine and would be associated with unprecedented technical considerations. To be applied for stimulation of neurons in humans, an ideal optogenetic tool would need to be non-immunogenic, highly sensitive, and activatable with red light or near-infrared light (to maximize light penetration while minimizing photodamage). To enable sophisticated levels of neuronal control, the combined use of optogenetic actuators and indicators could enable closed-loop all-optical neuromodulation. Such systems would introduce additional challenges related to spectral orthogonality between actuator and indicator, the need for decision making computational algorithms and requirements for large gene cassettes. As in any gene therapy, the therapeutic efficiency of optogenetics will rely on vector delivery and expression in the appropriate cell type. Although viral vectors such as those based on AAVs are showing great potential in human trials, barriers to their general use remain, including immune responses, delivery/transport, and liver clearance. Limitations associated with the gene cassette size which can be packaged in currently approved vectors also need to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Telomere Attrition in Neurodegenerative Disorders</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00219</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Telomere attrition is increased in various disorders and is therefore a potential biomarker for diagnosis and/or prognosis of these disorders. The contribution of telomere attrition in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders is yet to be fully elucidated. We are reviewing the current knowledge regarding the telomere biology in two common neurodegenerative disorders, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and Parkinson’s disease (PD). Furthermore, we are discussing future prospective of telomere research in these disorders. The majority of studies reported consistent evidence of the accelerated telomere attrition in AD patients, possibly in association with elevated oxidative stress levels. On the other hand in PD, various studies reported contradictory evidence regarding telomere attrition. Consequently, due to the low specificity and sensitivity, the clinical benefit of telomere length as a biomarker of neurodegenerative disease development and progression is not yet recognized. Nevertheless, longitudinal studies in large carefully selected cohorts might provide further elucidation of the complex involvement of the telomeres in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Telomere length maintenance is a complex process characterized by environmental, genetic, and epigenetic determinants. Thus, in addition to the selection of the study cohort, also the selection of analytical methods and types of biological samples for evaluation of the telomere attrition is of utmost importance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Spinal Inhibition of GABAB Receptors by the Extracellular Matrix Protein Fibulin-2 in Neuropathic Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00214</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the central nervous system, the inhibitory GABAB receptor is the archetype of heterodimeric G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Receptor interaction with partner proteins has emerged as a novel mechanism to alter GPCR signaling in pathophysiological conditions. We propose here that GABAB activity is inhibited through the specific binding of fibulin-2, an extracellular matrix protein, to the B1a subunit in a rat model of neuropathic pain. We demonstrate that fibulin-2 hampers GABAB activation, presumably through decreasing agonist-induced conformational changes. Fibulin-2 regulates the GABAB-mediated presynaptic inhibition of neurotransmitter release and weakens the GABAB-mediated inhibitory effect in neuronal cell culture. In the dorsal spinal cord of neuropathic rats, fibulin-2 is overexpressed and colocalized with B1a. Fibulin-2 may thus interact with presynaptic GABAB receptors, including those on nociceptive afferents. By applying anti-fibulin-2 siRNA in vivo, we enhanced the antinociceptive effect of intrathecal baclofen in neuropathic rats, thus demonstrating that fibulin-2 limits the action of GABAB agonists in vivo. Taken together, our data provide an example of an endogenous regulation of GABAB receptor by extracellular matrix proteins and demonstrate its functional impact on pathophysiological processes of pain sensitization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: FKBP5 Exacerbates Impairments in Cerebral Ischemic Stroke by Inducing Autophagy via the AKT/FOXO3 Pathway</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00193</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cerebral ischemic stroke is regarded as one of the most serious diseases in the human central nervous system. The secondary ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury increased the difficulty of treatment. Moreover, the latent molecular regulating mechanism in I/R injury is still unclear. Based on our previous clinical study, we discovered that FK506 binding protein 5 (FKBP5) is significantly upregulated in patients, who suffered acute ischemic stroke (AIS), with high diagnostic value. Levels of FKBP5 were positively correlated with patients’ neurological impairments. Furthermore, a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) model of mice was used to confirm that FKBP5 expression in plasma could reflect its relative level in brain tissue. Thus, we hypothesized that FKBP5 participated in the regulation of cerebral I/R injury. In order to explore the possible roles FKBP5 acted, the oxygen and glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) model was established to mimic I/R injury in vitro. FKBP5 expressing levels were changed by plasmid stable transfection. The altered expression of FKBP5 influenced cell viability and autophagy after OGD/R injury notably. Besides, AKT/FOXO3 cascade was involved in the FKBP5-regulating process. In the present study, FKBP5 was verified upregulated in cerebral I/R injury, related to the severity of ischemia and reperfusion injury. Additionally, our analyses revealed that FKBP5 regulates autophagy induced by OGD/R via the downstream AKT/FOXO3 signaling pathway. Our findings provide a novel biomarker for the early diagnosis of ischemic stroke and a potential strategy for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Heart Rate Variability Mainly Relates to Cognitive Executive Functions and Improves Through Exergame Training in Older Adults: A Secondary Analysis of a 6-Month Randomized Controlled Trial</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00197</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Heart rate variability (HRV) mirrors autonomic nervous system activities and might serve as a parameter to monitor health status in older adults. However, it is currently unknown which functional health measures, including cognitive, physical, and gait performance parameters, are most strongly related to HRV indices. This knowledge would enable implementing HRV assessments into health monitoring routines and training planning for older adults. Simultaneous cognitive–motor and exergame training may be effective to improve HRV indices but has not been investigated yet. Eighty-nine healthy older adults (≥70 years of age) were randomized into three groups: (1) virtual reality video game dancing, i.e., exergaming (DANCE); (2) treadmill walking with simultaneous verbal memory training (MEMORY); or (3) treadmill walking only (PHYS). Strength and balance exercises complemented each program. Over 6 months, two weekly 1-h training sessions were performed. HRV indices (standard deviation of N–N intervals, SDNN; root mean square of successive R–R interval differences, RMSSD; and absolute power of high-frequency band (0.15–0.4 Hz), HF power) and various measures of cognitive, physical, and gait performance were assessed at baseline and after 3 months and 6 months. Multiple linear regression analyses with planned comparisons were calculated. At baseline, 8–12% of HRV variance was significantly explained by cognitive executive functions and leg strength (inversely related). Verbal long-term memory, aerobic and functional fitness, and gait performance did not contribute to the model (SDNN: R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.082, p = 0.016; RMSSD: R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.121, p = 0.013; HF power: R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.119, p = 0.015). After 6 months, DANCE improved HRV indices, while MEMORY and PHYS did not (time × intervention interactions: first-contrast DANCE/MEMORY vs. PHYS: SDNN p = 0.014 one-tailed, ΔR&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.020 and RMSSD p = 0.052 one-tailed (trend), ΔR&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.007; second-contrast DANCE vs. MEMORY: SDNN p = 0.002 one-tailed, ΔR&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.035, RMSSD p = 0.017 one-tailed, ΔR&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.012, and HF power p = 0.011 one-tailed, ΔR&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.013). We conclude that mainly cognitive executive functions are associated with HRV indices and that exergame training improves global and parasympathetic autonomic nervous system activities in older adults. Periodic assessments of HRV in older citizens could be particularly beneficial to monitor cognitive health and provide indications for preventative exercise measures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Tools enabling closed-loop experiments are crucial to delineate causal relationships between the activity of genetically labeled neurons and specific behaviors. We developed the Raspberry Pi Virtual Reality (PiVR) system to conduct closed-loop optogenetic stimulation of neural functions in unrestrained animals. PiVR is an experimental platform that operates at high temporal resolution (70 Hz) with low latencies (&amp;lt;30 milliseconds), while being affordable (&amp;lt;6 hours). Through extensive documentation, this tool was designed to be accessible to a wide public, from high school students to professional researchers studying systems neuroscience. We illustrate the functionality of PiVR by focusing on sensory navigation in response to gradients of chemicals (chemotaxis) and light (phototaxis). We show how &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; adult flies perform negative chemotaxis by modulating their locomotor speed to avoid locations associated with optogenetically evoked bitter taste. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; larvae, we use innate positive chemotaxis to compare behavior elicited by real- and virtual-odor gradients. Finally, we examine how positive phototaxis emerges in zebrafish larvae from the modulation of turning maneuvers to orient in virtual white-light gradients. Besides its application to study chemotaxis and phototaxis, PiVR is a versatile tool designed to bolster efforts to map and to functionally characterize neural circuits.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/TZkBZnaofMc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Improving the reproducibility of biomedical research is a major challenge. Transparent and accurate reporting is vital to this process; it allows readers to assess the reliability of the findings and repeat or build upon the work of other researchers. The ARRIVE guidelines (Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments) were developed in 2010 to help authors and journals identify the minimum information necessary to report in publications describing in vivo experiments. Despite widespread endorsement by the scientific community, the impact of ARRIVE on the transparency of reporting in animal research publications has been limited. We have revised the ARRIVE guidelines to update them and facilitate their use in practice. The revised guidelines are published alongside this paper. This explanation and elaboration document was developed as part of the revision. It provides further information about each of the 21 items in ARRIVE 2.0, including the rationale and supporting evidence for their inclusion in the guidelines, elaboration of details to report, and examples of good reporting from the published literature. This document also covers advice and best practice in the design and conduct of animal studies to support researchers in improving standards from the start of the experimental design process through to publication.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/TVG_d0RsR0c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Reproducible science requires transparent reporting. The ARRIVE guidelines (Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments) were originally developed in 2010 to improve the reporting of animal research. They consist of a checklist of information to include in publications describing in vivo experiments to enable others to scrutinise the work adequately, evaluate its methodological rigour, and reproduce the methods and results. Despite considerable levels of endorsement by funders and journals over the years, adherence to the guidelines has been inconsistent, and the anticipated improvements in the quality of reporting in animal research publications have not been achieved. Here, we introduce ARRIVE 2.0. The guidelines have been updated and information reorganised to facilitate their use in practice. We used a Delphi exercise to prioritise and divide the items of the guidelines into 2 sets, the “ARRIVE Essential 10,” which constitutes the minimum requirement, and the “Recommended Set,” which describes the research context. This division facilitates improved reporting of animal research by supporting a stepwise approach to implementation. This helps journal editors and reviewers verify that the most important items are being reported in manuscripts. We have also developed the accompanying Explanation and Elaboration (E&amp;amp;E) document, which serves (1) to explain the rationale behind each item in the guidelines, (2) to clarify key concepts, and (3) to provide illustrative examples. We aim, through these changes, to help ensure that researchers, reviewers, and journal editors are better equipped to improve the rigour and transparency of the scientific process and thus reproducibility.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/z2lkpZ3p6v0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Selective Antagonism of A1 Adenosinergic Receptors Strengthens the Neuromodulation of the Sensorimotor Network During Epidural Spinal Stimulation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00044</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Although epidural spinal stimulation (ESS) results in promising therapeutic effects in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI), its potential to generate functional motor recovery varies between individuals and remains largely unclear. However, both preclinical and clinical studies indicate the capacity of electrical and pharmacological interventions to synergistically increase the engagement of spinal sensorimotor networks and regain motor function after SCI. This study explored whether selective pharmacological antagonism of the adenosine A1 receptor subtype synergizes with ESS, thereby increasing motor response. We hypothesized that selective pharmacological antagonism of A1 receptors during ESS would produce facilitatory effects in spinal sensorimotor networks detected as an increased amplitude of spinally-evoked motor potentials and sustained duration of ESS induced activity. Terminal experiments were performed in adult rats using trains of stereotyped pulses at 40 Hz delivered at L5 with the local administration to the cord of 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX). We demonstrated that ESS combined with the blockage of A1 receptors increased the magnitude of the endogenous modulation and postponed the decay of responses that occur during ESS alone. Although DPCPX significantly increased the yield of repetitive stimulation in intact spinal cords, the effects of A1 antagonism on motor evoked responses after an acute spinal transection was not detected. These studies support the future investigation of the optimal dosage, methods of delivery, and systemic effects of the synergistic application of A1 antagonists and spinal stimulation in the intact and injured spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Evaluating the Efficacy of Taurodeoxycholic Acid in Providing Otoprotection Using an in vitro Model of Electrode Insertion Trauma</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00113</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cochlear implants (CIs) are widely used to provide auditory rehabilitation to individuals having severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). However, insertion of electrode leads to inner trauma and activation of inflammatory and apoptotic signaling cascades resulting in loss of residual hearing in implanted individuals. Pharmaceutical interventions that can target these signaling cascades hold great potential for preserving residual hearing by preventing sensory cell damage. Bile salts have shown efficacy in various regions of the body as powerful antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents. However, their efficacy against inner ear trauma has never been explored. The objective of this study was to determine whether taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA), a bile salt derivative, can prevent sensory cell damage employing an in vitro model of electrode insertion trauma (EIT). The organ of Corti (OC) explants were dissected from postnatal day 3 (P-3) rats and placed in serum-free media. Explants were divided into control and experimental groups: (1) untreated controls; (2) EIT; (3) EIT+ TDCA (different concentrations). Hair cell (HC) density, analyses of apoptosis pathway (cleaved caspase 3), levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity and Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (MMP) were assayed. Treatment with TDCA provided significant otoprotection against HC loss in a dose-dependent manner. The molecular mechanisms underlying otoprotection involved decreasing oxidative stress, lowering levels of iNOS, and abrogating generation of cleaved caspase 3. The results of the present study suggest that TDCA provides efficient otoprotection against EIT, in vitro and should be explored for developing pharmaceutical interventions to preserve residual hearing post-cochlear implantation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Intravenous Injection of PHF-Tau Proteins From Alzheimer Brain Exacerbates Neuroinflammation, Amyloid Beta, and Tau Pathologies in 5XFAD Transgenic Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00106</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation in the brain of intraneuronal aggregates of abnormally and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins and of extracellular deposits of amyloid-β surrounded by dystrophic neurites. Numerous experimental models have shown that tau pathology develops in the brain after intracerebral injection of brain homogenates or pathological tau [paired helical filaments (PHF)-tau)] from AD brains. Further investigations are however necessary to identify or exclude potential extracerebral routes of tau pathology transmission, e.g., through the intravascular route. In this study, we have analyzed the effect of intravenous injection of PHF-tau proteins from AD brains on the formation of tau and amyloid pathologies in the brain of wild-type (WT) mice and of 5XFAD mice (an amyloid model). We observed that 5XFAD mice with a disrupted blood–brain barrier showed increased plaque-associated astrogliosis, microgliosis, and increased deposits of Aβ40 and Aβ42 after intravenous injection of PHF-tau proteins. In addition, an increased phosphotau immunoreactivity was observed in plaque-associated dystrophic neurites. These results suggest that blood products contaminated by PHF-tau proteins could potentially induce an exacerbation of neuroinflammation and AD pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) caused by noise exposure and attendant loss of glutamatergic synapses between cochlear spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) and hair cells is the most common sensory deficit worldwide. We show here that systemic administration of a bisphosphonate to mice 24 h after synaptopathic noise exposure regenerated synapses between inner hair cells and SGNs and restored cochlear function. We further demonstrate that this effect is mediated by inhibition of the mevalonate pathway. These results are highly significant because they suggest that bisphosphonates could reverse cochlear synaptopathy for the treatment of SNHL.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Multisensory Audiovisual Processing in Children With a Sensory Processing Disorder (II): Speech Integration Under Noisy Environmental Conditions</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00039</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: There exists a cohort of children and adults who exhibit an inordinately high degree of discomfort when experiencing what would be considered moderate and manageable levels of sensory input. That is, they show over-responsivity in the face of entirely typical sound, light, touch, taste, or smell inputs, and this occurs to such an extent that it interferes with their daily functioning and reaches clinical levels of dysfunction. What marks these individuals apart is that this sensory processing disorder (SPD) is observed in the absence of other symptom clusters that would result in a diagnosis of Autism, ADHD, or other neurodevelopmental disorders more typically associated with sensory processing difficulties. One major theory forwarded to account for these SPDs posits a deficit in multisensory integration, such that the various sensory inputs are not appropriately integrated into the central nervous system, leading to an overwhelming sensory-perceptual environment, and in turn to the sensory-defensive phenotype observed in these individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We tested whether children (6–16 years) with an over-responsive SPD phenotype (N = 12) integrated multisensory speech differently from age-matched typically-developing controls (TD: N = 12). Participants identified monosyllabic words while background noise level and sensory modality (auditory-alone, visual-alone, audiovisual) were varied in pseudorandom order. Improved word identification when speech was both seen and heard compared to when it was simply heard served to index multisensory speech integration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: School-aged children with an SPD show a deficit in the ability to benefit from the combination of both seen and heard speech inputs under noisy environmental conditions, suggesting that these children do not benefit from multisensory integrative processing to the same extent as their typically developing peers. In contrast, auditory-alone performance did not differ between the groups, signifying that this multisensory deficit is not simply due to impaired processing of auditory speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Children with an over-responsive SPD show a substantial reduction in their ability to benefit from complementary audiovisual speech, to enhance speech perception in a noisy environment. This has clear implications for performance in the classroom and other learning environments. Impaired multisensory integration may contribute to sensory over-reactivity that is the definitional of SPD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Abnormalities in Brain and Muscle Microstructure and Neurochemistry of the DMD Rat Measured by in vivo Diffusion Tensor Imaging and High Resolution Localized 1H MRS</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00739</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked disorder caused by the lack of dystrophin with progressive degeneration of skeletal muscles. Most studies regarding DMD understandably focus on muscle, but dystrophin is also expressed in the central nervous system, potentially resulting in cognitive and behavioral changes. Animal models are being used for developing more comprehensive neuromonitoring protocols and clinical image acquisition procedures. The recently developed DMD rat is an animal model that parallels the progressive muscle wasting seen in DMD. Here, we studied the brain and temporalis muscle structure and neurochemistry of wild type (WT) and dystrophic (DMD) rats using magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. Both structural and neurochemistry alterations were observed in the DMD rat brain and the temporalis muscle. There was a decrease in absolute brain volume (WT = 1579 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;; DMD = 1501 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;; p = 0.039, Cohen’s d = 1.867), but not normalized (WT = 4.27; DMD = 4.02; p = 0.306) brain volume. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) revealed structural alterations in the DMD temporalis muscle, with increased mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD). In the DMD rat thalamus, DTI revealed an increase in fractional anisotropy (FA) and a decrease in RD. Smaller normalized brain volume correlated to severity of muscle dystrophy (r = −0.975). Neurochemical changes in the DMD rat brain included increased GABA and NAA in the prefrontal cortex, and GABA in the hippocampus. Such findings could indicate disturbed motor and sensory signaling, resulting in a dysfunctional GABAergic neurotransmission, and an unstable osmoregulation in the dystrophin-null brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Static and Dynamic Changes of Amplitude of Low-Frequency Fluctuations in Cervical Discogenic Pain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00733</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cervical discogenic pain (CDP) is a clinically common pain syndrome caused by cervical disk degeneration. A large number of studies have reported that CDP results in brain functional impairments. However, the detailed dynamic brain functional abnormalities in CDP are still unclear. In this study, using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, we explored the neural basis of CDP with 40 CDP patients and 40 age-, gender-matched healthy controls to delineate the changes of the voxel-level static and dynamic amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF). We found increased static ALFF in left insula (INS) and posterior precuneus (PCu), and decreased static ALFF in left precentral/postcentral gyrus (PreCG/PoCG), thalamus (THA), and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex in CPD patients compared to healthy controls. We also found decreased dynamic ALFF in left PreCG/PoCG, right posterior middle temporal gyrus, and bilateral THA. Moreover, we found that static ALFF in left PreCG/PoCG and dynamic ALFF in THA were significantly negatively correlated with visual analog scale and disease duration, respectively. Our findings provide the neurophysiological basis for CDP and facilitate understanding the neuropathology of CDP.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: NR4A1 Methylation Associated Multimodal Neuroimaging Patterns Impaired in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00727</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;DNA hypermethylation has been widely observed in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), in which NR4A1 knockdown has been reported to be able to alleviate seizure severity in mouse model, while the underlying methylation-imaging pathway modulated by aberrant methylation levels of NR4A1 remains to be clarified in patients with TLE. Here, using multi-site canonical correlation analysis with reference, methylation levels of NR4A1 in blood were used as priori to guide fusion of three MRI features: functional connectivity (FC), fractional anisotropy (FA), and gray matter volume (GMV) for 56 TLE patients and 65 healthy controls. Post-hoc correlations were further evaluated between the identified NR4A1-associated brain components and disease onset. Results suggested that higher NR4A1 methylation levels in TLE were related with impaired temporal-cerebellar and occipital-cerebellar FC strength, lower FA in cingulum (hippocampus), and reduced GMV in putamen, temporal pole, and cerebellum. Moreover, findings were also replicated well in both patient subsets with either right TLE or left TLE only. Particularly, right TLE patients showed poorer cognitive abilities and more severe brain impairment than left TLE patients, especially more reduced GMV in thalamus. In summary, this work revealed a potential imaging-methylation pathway modulated by higher NR4A1 methylation in TLE via data mining, which may impact the above-mentioned multimodal brain circuits and was also associated with earlier disease onset and more cognitive deficits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Meets Virtual Reality: The Potential of Integrating Brain Stimulation With a Simulative Technology for Food Addiction</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00720</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The aim of this perspective is to propose and discuss the integration of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with virtual reality (VR) food exposure for therapeutic interventions for food addiction. “Food addiction” is a dysfunctional eating pattern which is typically observed in eating disorders (ED) such as bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder. Food addiction has been compared to substance use disorder due to the necessity of consuming a substance (food) and the presence of a dependence behavior. In recent years, VR has been applied in the treatment of ED because it triggers psychological and physiological responses through food exposure in place of real stimuli. Virtual reality-Cue exposure therapy has been proven as a valid technique for regulating anxiety and food craving in ED. More, TMS has been proven to modulate circuits and networks implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders and is effective in treating addiction such as nicotine craving and consumption and cocaine use disorder. The combination of a simulative technology and a neurostimulation would presumably provide better improvement compared to a single intervention because it implies the presence of both cognitive and neuropsychological techniques. The possible advantage of this approach will be discussed in the perspective.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00712</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Understanding how neural networks generate activity patterns and communicate with each other requires monitoring the electrical activity from many neurons simultaneously. Perfectly suited tools for addressing this challenge are genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) because they can be targeted to specific cell types and optically report the electrical activity of individual, or populations of neurons. However, analyzing and interpreting the data from voltage imaging experiments is challenging because high recording speeds and properties of current GEVIs yield only low signal-to-noise ratios, making it necessary to apply specific analytical tools. Here, we present NOSA (Neuro-Optical Signal Analysis), a novel open source software designed for analyzing voltage imaging data and identifying temporal interactions between electrical activity patterns of different origin. In this work, we explain the challenges that arise during voltage imaging experiments and provide hands-on analytical solutions. We demonstrate how NOSA’s baseline fitting, filtering algorithms and movement correction can compensate for shifts in baseline fluorescence and extract electrical patterns from low signal-to-noise recordings. NOSA allows to efficiently identify oscillatory frequencies in electrical patterns, quantify neuronal response parameters and moreover provides an option for analyzing simultaneously recorded optical and electrical data derived from patch-clamp or other electrode-based recordings. To identify temporal relations between electrical activity patterns we implemented different options to perform cross correlation analysis, demonstrating their utility during voltage imaging in Drosophila and mice. All features combined, NOSA will facilitate the first steps into using GEVIs and help to realize their full potential for revealing cell-type specific connectivity and functional interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00682</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Diabetes mellitus (DM) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) have been and will continue to be two common chronic diseases globally that are difficult to diagnose during the prodromal phase. Current molecular genetics, cell biological, and epidemiological evidences have shown the correlation between PD and DM. PD shares the same pathogenesis pathways and pathological factors with DM. In addition, β-cell reduction, which can cause hyperglycemia, is a striking feature of DM. Recent studies indicated that hyperglycemia is highly relevant to the pathologic changes in PD. However, further correlation between DM and PD remains to be investigated. Intriguingly, polycystic monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), which is co-expressed in dopaminergic neurons and β cells, is responsible for taking up dopamine into the presynaptic vesicles and can specifically bind to the β cells. Furthermore, we have summarized the specific molecular and diagnostic functions of VMAT2 for the two diseases reported in this review. Therefore, VMAT2 can be applied as a target probe for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to detect β-cell and dopamine level changes, which can contribute to the diagnosis of DM and PD during the prodromal phase. Targeting VMAT2 with the molecular probe &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FP-(+)-DTBZ can be an entry point for the β cell mass (BCM) changes in DM at the molecular level, to clarify the potential relationship between DM and PD. VMAT2 has promising clinical significance in investigating the pathogenesis, early diagnosis, and treatment evaluation of the two diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00675</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A long-standing goal of translational neuroscience is the ability to noninvasively deliver therapeutic agents to specific brain regions with high spatiotemporal resolution. Focused ultrasound (FUS) is an emerging technology that can noninvasively deliver energy up the order of 1 kW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with millimeter and millisecond resolution to any point in the human brain with Food and Drug Administration-approved hardware. Although FUS is clinically utilized primarily for focal ablation in conditions such as essential tremor, recent breakthroughs have enabled the use of FUS for drug delivery at lower intensities (i.e., tens of watts per square centimeter) without ablation of the tissue. In this review, we present strategies for image-guided FUS-mediated pharmacologic neurointerventions. First, we discuss blood–brain barrier opening to deliver therapeutic agents of a variety of sizes to the central nervous system. We then describe the use of ultrasound-sensitive nanoparticles to noninvasively deliver small molecules to millimeter-sized structures including superficial cortical regions and deep gray matter regions within the brain without the need for blood–brain barrier opening. We also consider the safety and potential complications of these techniques, with attention to temporal acuity. Finally, we close with a discussion of different methods for mapping the ultrasound field within the brain and describe future avenues of research in ultrasound-targeted drug therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Deciphering the Morphology of Motor Evoked Potentials</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.00028</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Motor Evoked Potentials (MEPs) are used to monitor disability progression in multiple sclerosis (MS). Their morphology plays an important role in this process. Currently, however, there is no clear definition of what constitutes a normal or abnormal morphology. To address this, five experts independently labeled the morphology (normal or abnormal) of the same set of 1,000 MEPs. The intra- and inter-rater agreement between the experts indicates they agree on the concept of morphology, but differ in their choice of threshold between normal and abnormal morphology. We subsequently performed an automated extraction of 5,943 time series features from the MEPs to identify a valid proxy for morphology, based on the provided labels. To do this, we compared the cross-validation performances of one-dimensional logistic regression models fitted to each of the features individually. We find that the approximate entropy (ApEn) feature can accurately reproduce the majority-vote labels. The performance of this feature is evaluated on an independent test set by comparing to the majority vote of the neurologists, obtaining an AUC score of 0.92. The model slightly outperforms the average neurologist at reproducing the neurologists consensus-vote labels. We can conclude that MEP morphology can be consistently defined by pooling the interpretations from multiple neurologists and that ApEn is a valid continuous score for this. Having an objective and reproducible MEP morphological abnormality score will allow researchers to include this feature in their models, without manual annotation becoming a bottleneck. This is crucial for large-scale, multi-center datasets. An exploratory analysis on a large single-center dataset shows that ApEn is potentially clinically useful. Introducing an automated, objective, and reproducible definition of morphology could help overcome some of the barriers that are currently obstructing broad adoption of evoked potentials in daily care and patient follow-up, such as standardization of measurements between different centers, and formulating guidelines for clinical use.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00274</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Schizophrenia patients often show impaired facial expression recognition, which leads to difficulties in adaptation to daily life. However, it remains unclear whether the deficit is at the perceptual or higher cognitive level of facial emotion processing. Recent studies have shown that earlier face-evoked event-related potential (ERP) components such as N170 and P100 can effectively distinguish schizophrenia patients from healthy controls; however, findings for later waveforms are ambiguous. To clarify this point, in this study we compared electroencephalographic signals in schizophrenia patients and control subjects during a facial expression judgment task. We found that group effects of the occipital N170 and frontal lobe contingent negative variation (CNV) were both significant. The effect sizes (ESs) of N170 and CNV amplitudes were generally medium or small, whereas that of CNV slope for an upright face was large (&amp;gt;0.8). Moreover, N170 amplitude and CNV slope but not CNV amplitude was correlated with Personal and Social Performance (PSP) Scale score. These results suggest that the slope of CNV drift during facial expression processing has a potential clinical value for schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: ABBaH: Activity Breaks for Brain Health. A Protocol for a Randomized Crossover Trial</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00273</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Extended periods of sitting may have detrimental effects on brain health. However, the effects of breaking up prolonged sedentary periods with frequent, short physical activity bouts on mechanisms to improve brain health remain unclear. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the immediate effects of uninterrupted sitting and frequent, short bouts of physical activity on cerebral blood flow and cognitive function in the prefrontal cortex in middle-aged adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: This is a protocol article to describe a randomized crossover study. We will collect data from 13 healthy adults, aged between 40 and 60 years old, with a body mass index &amp;lt;35 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Participants will be required to come into the laboratory on three occasions, sit for 3 h, and perform a different type of break for 3 min every 30 min at each visit in a random order, being either: (1) a social break; (2) brisk walk on a treadmill; or (3) simple resistance activities. Before and after each experimental condition, cerebral blood flow (primary outcome) will be measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), with short-separation channels, and working memory (1-, 2-, and 3-back on the computer) will be assessed. The following additional secondary outcomes will be collected: psychological factors (questionnaires); arterial stiffness; salivary cortisol levels; and blood glucose levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The results from this randomized crossover study will determine the effects of uninterrupted sitting and frequent, short bouts of physical activity on cerebral blood flow and cognitive performance. Publication of this study protocol emphasizes the importance of registration and publication of protocols in the field of sedentary behavior research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Graded fMRI Neurofeedback Training of Motor Imagery in Middle Cerebral Artery Stroke Patients: A Preregistered Proof-of-Concept Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00226</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), a major brain vessel that supplies the primary motor and premotor cortex, is one of the most common causes for severe upper limb impairment. Currently available motor rehabilitation training largely lacks satisfying efficacy with over 70% of stroke survivors showing residual upper limb dysfunction. Motor imagery-based functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback (fMRI-NF) has been suggested as a potential therapeutic technique to improve motor impairment in stroke survivors. In this preregistered proof-of-concept study (https://osf.io/y69jc/), we translated graded fMRI-NF training, a new paradigm that we have previously studied in healthy participants, to first-time MCA stroke survivors with residual mild to severe impairment of upper limb motor function. Neurofeedback was provided from the supplementary motor area (SMA) targeting two different neurofeedback target levels (low and high). We hypothesized that MCA stroke survivors will show (1) sustained SMA-region of interest (ROI) activation and (2) a difference in SMA-ROI activation between low and high neurofeedback conditions during graded fMRI-NF training. At the group level, we found only anecdotal evidence for these preregistered hypotheses. At the individual level, we found anecdotal to moderate evidence for the absence of the hypothesized graded effect for most subjects. These null findings are relevant for future attempts to employ fMRI-NF training in stroke survivors. The study introduces a Bayesian sequential sampling plan, which incorporates prior knowledge, yielding higher sensitivity. The sampling plan was preregistered together with a priori hypotheses and all planned analysis before data collection to address potential publication/researcher biases. Unforeseen difficulties in the translation of our paradigm to a clinical setting required some deviations from the preregistered protocol. We explicitly detail these changes, discuss the accompanied additional challenges that can arise in clinical neurofeedback studies, and formulate recommendations for how these can be addressed. Taken together, this work provides new insights about the feasibility of motor imagery-based graded fMRI-NF training in MCA stroke survivors and serves as a first example for comprehensive study preregistration of an (fMRI) neurofeedback experiment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00219</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Children born very preterm (VPT) are at high-risk for altered brain development and impaired neurodevelopmental outcomes but are not well-studied before school-age. We investigated 64 four-year-olds: 37 VPT children [&amp;lt;32 weeks gestational age [GA]; 22 males; mean GA: 28.8 weeks ± 1.6], 25 full-term (FT) children (12 males), plus two VPT cases with ventriculomegaly and exceptionally resilient outcomes. All children underwent high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging and developmental assessments. Measures of brain volume, cortical thickness, and surface area were obtained. Children born VPT demonstrated reduced cerebral and cerebellar white matter volumes yet increased cerebral gray matter, temporal lobe, occipital lobe and ventricle volumes after adjusting for total brain volume. Cortical thickness was greater in the VPT children compared to FT children across all lobes. On developmental assessments, the VPT children scored lower on average than FT children while the two cases had intact cognitive abilities. In addition to larger ventricle volumes, the two cases had white matter and gray matter volumes within the ranges of the FT children. The VPT children displayed distinct differences in structural brain volumes at 4 years of age, consistent with delayed maturation. The cases with persistent ventriculomegaly and good cognitive outcomes displayed typical gray matter and increased white matter volumes, indicating a potential protective developmental phenomenon contributing to their intact cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Optimization of Efficient Neuron Models With Realistic Firing Dynamics. The Case of the Cerebellar Granule Cell</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00161</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Biologically relevant large-scale computational models currently represent one of the main methods in neuroscience for studying information processing primitives of brain areas. However, biologically realistic neuron models tend to be computationally heavy and thus prevent these models from being part of brain-area models including thousands or even millions of neurons. The cerebellar input layer represents a canonical example of large scale networks. In particular, the cerebellar granule cells, the most numerous cells in the whole mammalian brain, have been proposed as playing a pivotal role in the creation of somato-sensorial information representations. Enhanced burst frequency (spiking resonance) in the granule cells has been proposed as facilitating the input signal transmission at the theta-frequency band (4–12 Hz), but the functional role of this cell feature in the operation of the granular layer remains largely unclear. This study aims to develop a methodological pipeline for creating neuron models that maintain biological realism and computational efficiency whilst capturing essential aspects of single-neuron processing. Therefore, we selected a light computational neuron model template (the adaptive-exponential integrate-and-fire model), whose parameters were progressively refined using an automatic parameter tuning with evolutionary algorithms (EAs). The resulting point-neuron models are suitable for reproducing the main firing properties of a realistic granule cell from electrophysiological measurements, including the spiking resonance at the theta-frequency band, repetitive firing according to a specified intensity-frequency (I-F) curve and delayed firing under current-pulse stimulation. Interestingly, the proposed model also reproduced some other emergent properties (namely, silent at rest, rheobase and negligible adaptation under depolarizing currents) even though these properties were not set in the EA as a target in the fitness function (FF), proving that these features are compatible even in computationally simple models. The proposed methodology represents a valuable tool for adjusting AdEx models according to a FF defined in the spiking regime and based on biological data. These models are appropriate for future research of the functional implication of bursting resonance at the theta band in large-scale granular layer network models.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: The Neurodevelopmental Pathogenesis of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00039</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a model disorder for understanding brain development because the genes that cause TSC are known, many downstream molecular pathways have been identified, and the resulting perturbations of cellular events are established. TSC, therefore, provides an intellectual framework to understand the molecular and biochemical pathways that orchestrate normal brain development. The TSC1 and TSC2 genes encode Hamartin and Tuberin which form a GTPase activating protein (GAP) complex. Inactivating mutations in TSC genes (TSC1/TSC2) cause sustained Ras homologue enriched in brain (RHEB) activation of the mammalian isoform of the target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). TOR is a protein kinase that regulates cell size in many organisms throughout nature. mTORC1 inhibits catabolic processes including autophagy and activates anabolic processes including mRNA translation. mTORC1 regulation is achieved through two main upstream mechanisms. The first mechanism is regulation by growth factor signaling. The second mechanism is regulation by amino acids. Gene mutations that cause too much or too little mTORC1 activity lead to a spectrum of neuroanatomical changes ranging from altered brain size (micro and macrocephaly) to cortical malformations to Type I neoplasias. Because somatic mutations often underlie these changes, the timing, and location of mutation results in focal brain malformations. These mutations, therefore, provide gain-of-function and loss-of-function changes that are a powerful tool to assess the events that have gone awry during development and to determine their functional physiological consequences. Knowledge about the TSC-mTORC1 pathway has allowed scientists to predict which upstream and downstream mutations should cause commensurate neuroanatomical changes. Indeed, many of these predictions have now been clinically validated. A description of clinical imaging and histochemical findings is provided in relation to laboratory models of TSC that will allow the reader to appreciate how human pathology can provide an understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Comparison of Noninvasive Imagery Methods to Observe Healthy and Degenerated Olfactory Epithelium in Mice for the Early Diagnosis of Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00034</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Olfactory dysfunction could be an early and reliable indicator for the diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer and Parkinson's diseases. In this paper, we compare the potential of different noninvasive medical imaging modalities (optical coherence tomography, confocal microscopy, and fluorescence endomicroscopy) to distinguish how the olfactory epithelium, both at the cellular and the structural levels, is altered. Investigations were carried out on three experimental groups: two pathological groups (mice models with deliberately altered olfactory epithelium and Alzheimer's disease transgenic mice models) were compared with healthy mice models. As histological staining, the three tested noninvasive imaging tools demonstrated the general tubular organization of the olfactory epithelium on healthy mice. Contrary to OCT, confocal microscopy, and endomicroscopy allowed visualizing the inner structure of olfactory epithelium as well as its morphological or functional changes on pathological models, alterations classically observed with histological assessment. The results could lead to relevant development of imaging tools for noninvasive and early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases through the in situ characterization of the olfactory epithelium.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Objectives&lt;p&gt;Clinical characteristics of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) include migraine, recurrent stroke, white matter lesions, and vascular dementia. CADASIL is one of the most common hereditary cerebral small vessel diseases. Clinical presentation of CADASIL varies and a racial gap may exist between the Asian and Caucasian populations. This is the first nationwide epidemiological survey which aimed to elucidate the clinical features of CADASIL in Japan. Moreover, the registration database of CADASIL was constructed.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Subjects included CADASIL patients who visited the hospitals (totally 1,448 hospitals) certified by the Japanese Society of Neurology and/or Japan Stroke Society in 2016. This study consisted of a two-step survey; patients with CADASIL were identified genetically by the first questionnaire, and their clinical features were assessed by the second questionnaire. Selected 6 hospitals registered the data of all CADASIL patients using a Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) system for the second questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Based on the criteria, 88 patients (50 male and 38 female) with CADASIL were enrolled. The mean age of symptom onset was 49.5 years. Sixteen (18.2%) patients had an elderly onset (&amp;gt;60 years). Thirteen patients (13.6%) had history of migraine with aura and 33 patients (37.5%) had vascular risk factor(s). From among the 86 patients who were examined using magnetic resonance imaging, abnormal deep white matter lesions were detected in 85 patients (98.8%), WMLs extending to anterior temporal pole in 73 patients (84.9%), and cerebral microbleeds in 41 patients (47.7%). Anti-platelet therapy was received by 65 patients (73.9%). Thirty-eight patients (43.2%) underwent treatment with lomerizine hydrochloride. Thirty-four different mutations of NOTCH3 were found in exons 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 11, 14, and 19. Most of the mutations existed in exon 4 (n = 44, 60.3%). The prevalence rate of CADASIL was 1.20 to 3.58 per 100,000 adults in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This questionnaire-based study revealed clinical features and treatment status in Japanese CADASIL patient, although it may not be an exhaustive search. We have constructed the REDCap database for these CADASIL patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has become a major disease contributing to human death and is thought to be closely related to the aging process. The rich antioxidant substances in plants have been shown to play a role in delaying aging, and in recent years, significant research has focused on also examining their potential role in AD onset and progression. Many plant-derived antioxidant research studies have provided insights for the future treatment and prevention of AD. This article reviews various types of plant-derived antioxidants with anti-aging effects on neurons. Also it distinguishes the different types of active substances that exhibit different degrees of protection for the nervous system and summarizes the mechanism thereof. Plant-derived antioxidants with neuroprotective functions can protect various components of the nervous system in a variety of ways and can have a positive impact on interventions to prevent and alleviate AD. Furthermore, when considering neuroprotective agents, glial cells also contribute to the defense of the nervous system and should not be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Spotlight on Ferroptosis: Iron-Dependent Cell Death in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00196</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is an emerging global epidemic that is becoming increasingly unsustainable. Most of the clinical trials have been centered around targeting β-amyloid and have met with limited success. There is a great impetus to identify alternative drug targets. Iron appears to be the common theme prevalent across neurodegenerative diseases. Iron has been shown to promote aggregation and pathogenicity of the characteristic aberrant proteins, β-amyloid, tau, α-synuclein, and TDP43, in these diseases. Further support for the involvement of iron in pathogenesis is provided by the recent discovery of a new form of cell death, ferroptosis. Arising from iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, ferroptosis is augmented in conditions of cysteine deficiency and glutathione peroxidase-4 inactivation. Here, we review clinical trials that provide the rationale for targeting ferroptosis to delay the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), potentially of relevance to other neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Heart failure-induced atrial remodelling promotes electrical and conduction alternans</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/QNHklWhCOGI/article</link>

Heart failure (HF) is associated with an increased propensity for atrial fibrillation (AF), causing higher mortality than AF or HF alone. It is hypothesized that HF-induced remodelling of atrial cellular and tissue properties promotes the genesis of atrial action potential (AP) alternans and conduction alternans that perpetuate AF. However, the mechanism underlying the increased susceptibility to atrial alternans in HF remains incompletely elucidated. In this study, we investigated the effects of how HF-induced atrial cellular electrophysiological (with prolonged AP duration) and tissue structural (reduced cell-to-cell coupling caused by atrial fibrosis) remodelling can have an effect on the generation of atrial AP alternans and their conduction at the cellular and one-dimensional (1D) tissue levels. Simulation results showed that HF-induced atrial electrical remodelling prolonged AP duration, which was accompanied by an increased sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; content and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transient amplitude. Further analysis demonstrated that HF-induced atrial electrical remodelling increased susceptibility to atrial alternans mainly due to the increased sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase (SERCA) Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; reuptake, modulated by increased phospholamban (PLB) phosphorylation, and the decreased transient outward K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; current (&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;to&lt;/sub&gt;). The underlying mechanism has been suggested that the increased SR Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; content and prolonged AP did not fully recover to their previous levels at the end of diastole, resulting in a smaller SR Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release and AP in the next beat. These produced Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transient alternans and AP alternans, and further caused AP alternans and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transient alternans through Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;→AP coupling and AP→Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; coupling, respectively. Simulation of a 1D tissue model showed that the combined action of HF-induced ion channel remodelling and a decrease in cell-to-cell coupling due to fibrosis increased the heart tissue’s susceptibility to the formation of spatially discordant alternans, resulting in an increased functional AP propagation dispersion, which is pro-arrhythmic. These findings provide insights into how HF promotes atrial arrhythmia in association with atrial alternans.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QNHklWhCOGI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Single-cell DNA sequencing technologies are enabling the study of mutations and their evolutionary trajectories in cancer. Somatic copy number aberrations (CNAs) have been implicated in the development and progression of various types of cancer. A wide array of methods for CNA detection has been either developed specifically for or adapted to single-cell DNA sequencing data. Understanding the strengths and limitations that are unique to each of these methods is very important for obtaining accurate copy number profiles from single-cell DNA sequencing data. We benchmarked three widely used methods–Ginkgo, HMMcopy, and CopyNumber–on simulated as well as real datasets. To facilitate this, we developed a novel simulator of single-cell genome evolution in the presence of CNAs. Furthermore, to assess performance on empirical data where the ground truth is unknown, we introduce a phylogeny-based measure for identifying potentially erroneous inferences. While single-cell DNA sequencing is very promising for elucidating and understanding CNAs, our findings show that even the best existing method does not exceed 80% accuracy. New methods that significantly improve upon the accuracy of these three methods are needed. Furthermore, with the large datasets being generated, the methods must be computationally efficient.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/a13HESH3ra4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Although quantitative insights into the killing behaviour of Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs) are necessary for the rational design of immune-based therapies, CTL killing function remains insufficiently characterised. One established model of CTL killing treats CTL cytotoxicity as a Poisson process, based on the assumption that CTLs serially kill antigen-presenting target cells via delivery of lethal hits, each lethal hit corresponding to a single injection of cytotoxic proteins into the target cell cytoplasm. Contradicting this model, a recent &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; study of individual CTLs killing targets over a 12-hour period found significantly greater heterogeneity in CTL killing performance than predicted by Poisson-based killing. The observed killing process was dynamic and varied between CTLs, with the best performing CTLs exhibiting a marked increase in killing during the final hours of the experiments, along with a “burst killing” kinetic. Despite a search for potential differences between CTLs, no mechanistic explanation for the heterogeneous killing kinetics was found. Here we have used stochastic simulations to assess whether target cells might require multiple hits from CTLs before undergoing apoptosis, in order to verify whether multiple-hitting could explain the late onset, burst killing dynamics observed &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. We found that multiple-hitting from CTLs was entirely consistent with the observed killing kinetics. Moreover, the number of available targets and the spatiotemporal kinetics of CTL:target interactions influenced the realised CTL killing rate. We subsequently used realistic, spatial simulations to assess methods for estimating the hitting rate and the number of hits required for target death, to be applied to microscopy data of individual CTLs killing targets. We found that measuring the cumulative duration of individual contacts that targets have with CTLs would substantially improve accuracy when estimating the killing kinetics of CTLs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/a5KHho2JRgo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Variations on a theme: Morphological variation in the secondary eye visual pathway across the order of Araneae&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d8780e15-abef-40e0-a13f-ed557c51fcd5/cne24945-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diagrams showing the four different groups of secondary eye morphology found by the study. For each group, neuropils of the secondary eye visual pathway and the connections between the secondary eye visual pathway and the protocerebrum are given.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spiders possess a wide array of sensory‐driven behaviors and therefore provide rich models for studying evolutionary hypotheses about the relationship between brain morphology, sensory systems, and behavior. Despite this, only a handful of studies have examined brain variation across the order of Araneae. In this study, I present descriptions of the gross brain morphology for 19 families of spiders that vary in eye morphology. Spiders showed the most variation in the secondary eye visual pathway. Based on this variation, spiders could be categorized into four groups. Group 1 spiders had small, underdeveloped laminae, no medullae, and no mushroom bodies. Group 2 spiders had large laminae, no medullae and large mushroom bodies. Group 3 spiders had laminae and some evidence of reduced medullae and mushroom bodies. Group 4 spiders had the most complex systems, with large laminae, medullae formed from optical glomeruli, and robust mushroom bodies. Within groups, there was large variation in the shape and size of individual regions, indicating possible variation in neuronal organization. The possible evolutionary implications of the loss of a dedicated olfactory organ in spiders and its effects on the mushroom body are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Normal pressure hydrocephalus associated with Alzheimer’ disease</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25847?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate if neurodegenerative biomarkers in cerebro‐spinal fluid (CSF) diffferentiate patients with suspected normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) who respond to CSF drainage from patients who do not respond.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data of 62 consecutive patients who presented with MRI‐changes indicative of NPH were studied with regard to cognitive and gait functions before and after drainage of 40‐50 ml CSF. Additionally, S100, NSE, ß‐amyloid protein, tau‐protein, phospho‐tau were determined in CSF. Statistical analyses were carried out with ANOVA and multiple linear regression.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with CSF constellations typical for Alzheimer’s disease (N = 28) improved significantly in cognitive and gait‐related functions after CSF drainage. In contrast, those patients without CSF constellation typical for Alzheimer’s disease (N = 34) did not improve in cognitive and gait‐related functions after CSF drainage. In addition, Alzheimer’s positive CSF biomarkers predicted these improvements.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data suggest an association between Alzheimer’s disease and NPH‐changes supporting the recently suggested dichotomy of a neurodegenerative NPH and a true idiopathic NPH the latter of which appearing to be rare.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Association between Pregnancy and Cervical Artery Dissection</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25813?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanted to determine whether pregnancy is associated with cervical artery dissection.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed a case–control study using claims data from all nonfederal emergency departments and acute care hospitals in New York and Florida between 2005 and 2015. Cases were women 12–42 years of age hospitalized with cervical artery dissection, defined using validated diagnosis codes for carotid/vertebral artery dissection. Controls were women 12–42 years of age with a primary diagnosis of renal colic. Cases and controls were matched 1:1 on age, race, insurance, income, state, and visit year. The exposure variable was pregnancy, defined as labor and delivery within 90 days before or 6 months after the index visit. Logistic regression was used to compare the odds of pregnancy between cases and controls. We performed a secondary cohort‐crossover study comparing the risk of cervical artery dissection during pregnancy versus the same time period 1 year later.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pregnancy was twice as common among 826 women with cervical artery dissection compared with the 826 matched controls with renal colic (odds ratio, 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3–4.7). In our secondary analysis, pregnancy was associated with a higher risk of cervical artery dissection (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 2.2; 95% CI, 1.3–3.5), with the heightened risk limited to the postpartum period (IRR, 5.5; 95% CI, 2.6–11.7).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pregnancy, specifically the postpartum period, was associated with hospitalization for cervical artery dissection. Although these findings might in part reflect ascertainment bias, our results suggest that arterial dissection is one mechanism by which pregnancy can lead to stroke.

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Top-Down Control of Inhibitory Granule Cells in the Main Olfactory Bulb Reshapes Neural Dynamics Giving Rise to a Diversity of Computations</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00059</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Growing evidence shows that top-down projections from excitatory neurons in piriform cortex selectively synapse onto local inhibitory granule cells in the main olfactory bulb, effectively gating their own inputs by controlling inhibition. An open question in olfaction is the role this feedback plays in shaping the dynamics of local circuits, and the resultant computational benefits it provides. Using rate models of neuronal firing in a network consisting of excitatory mitral and tufted cells, inhibitory granule cells and top-down piriform cortical neurons, we found that changes in the weight of feedback to inhibitory neurons generated diverse network dynamics and complex transitions between these dynamics. Changes in the weight of top-down feedback supported a number of computations, including both pattern separation and oscillatory synchrony. Additionally, the network could generate gamma oscillations though a mechanism we termed Top-down control of Inhibitory Neuron Gamma (TING). Collectively, these functions arose from a codimension-2 bifurcation in the dynamical system. Our results highlight a key role for this top-down feedback, gating inhibition to facilitate often diametrically different computations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Ferroptosis in Neurological Diseases</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis is mechanism for non-apoptotic, iron-dependent, oxidative cell death that is characterized by glutathione consumption and lipid peroxides accumulation. Ferroptosis is crucially involved in neurological diseases, including neurodegeneration, stroke and neurotrauma. This review provides detailed discussions of the ferroptosis mechanisms in these neurological diseases. Moreover, it summarizes recent drugs that target ferroptosis for neurological disease treatment. Furthermore, it compares the differences and relationships among the various cell death mechanisms involved in neurological diseases. Elucidating the ferroptosis role in the brain can improve the understanding of neurological disease mechanism and provide potential prevention and treatment interventions for acute and chronic neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Herculano‐Houzel et al. examine numbers of neurons in the brain of 13 bat species and find that the apparently “enlarged” cerebellum of small echolocating bats has the same proportion of brain neurons as other mammals, and is more likely simply the result of a diminutive cerebral cortex.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small echolocating bats are set apart from most other mammals by their relatively large cerebellum, a feature that has been associated to echolocation, as it is presumed to indicate a relatively enlarged number of neurons in the cerebellum in comparison to other brain structures. Here we quantify the neuronal composition of the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and remaining brain structures of 7 species of large Pteropodid bats (formerly classified as megachiropterans), one of which echolocates, and 6 species of small bats (formerly classified as microchiropterans), all of which echolocate. This chiropteran data is compared to 60 mammalian species in our dataset to determine whether the relatively large cerebellum of the small echolocating bats, and possibly that of the echolocating Pteropodid, contains a relatively enlarged number of neurons. We find no evidence that the distribution of neurons differs between microchiropterans and megachiropterans, but our data indicate that microchiropterans, like the smallest shrew in our dataset, have diminutive cerebral cortices, which makes the cerebellum appear relatively large. We propose that, in agreement with the diminutive brain size of the earliest fossil mammals, this is a plesiomorphic, not a derived, feature of microchiropteran brains. The results of this study also reveal important neural characteristics related to the phylogenetic affinities and relationships of the chiropterans.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Anticoagulation Timing in Cardioembolic Stroke and Recurrent Event Risk</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25844?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guidelines recommend to initiate anticoagulation within 4‐14 days after cardioembolic stroke. Data supporting this did not account for key factors potentially affecting the decision to initiate anticoagulation such as infarct size, hemorrhagic transformation, or high risk features on echocardiography.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pooled data from stroke registries of 8 comprehensive stroke centers across the United States. We included consecutive patients admitted with ischemic stroke and atrial fibrillation. The primary predictor was timing of initiating anticoagulation (0‐3 days, 4‐14 days, or &amp;gt;14 days) and outcomes were recurrent stroke/TIA/systemic embolism, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH), and major extracranial hemorrhage (ECH) within 90 days.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among 2084 patients, 1289 met the inclusion criteria. The combined endpoint occurred in 10.1% (n = 130) subjects (87 ischemic events, 20 sICH, and 29 ECH). Overall, there was no significant difference in the composite endpoint between the three groups: 0‐3 days [10.3% (64/617)], 4‐14 days [(9.7%) 52/535)], &amp;gt;14 days [10.2% (14/137), p=0.933]. In adjusted models, patients started on anticoagulation between 4‐14 days did not have a lower rate of sICH (vs. 0‐3 days) (OR 1.49 95% CI 0.50 – 4.43) neither did they have a lower rate of recurrent ischemic events (vs. &amp;gt; 14 days) (OR 0.76 95% CI 0.36 – 1.62, p = 0.482).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this multicenter real world cohort, the recommended (4‐14 days) time frame to start oral anticoagulation was not associated with reduced ischemic and hemorrhagic outcomes. Randomized trials are required to determine the optimal timing of anticoagulation initiation.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Mapping of the excitatory, inhibitory, and modulatory afferent projections to the anatomically defined active expiratory oscillator in adult male rats</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.24984?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lateral parafacial region (pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;; which encompasses the parafacial respiratory group, pFRG) is a conditional oscillator that drives active expiration during periods of high respiratory demand, and increases ventilation through the recruitment of expiratory muscles. The pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; activity is highly modulated, and systematic analysis of its afferent projections is required to understand its connectivity and modulatory control. We combined a viral retrograde tracing approach to map direct brainstem projections to the putative location of pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, with RNAScope and immunofluorescence to identify the neurochemical phenotype of the projecting neurons. Within the medulla, retrogradely‐labelled, glutamatergic, glycinergic and GABAergic neurons were found in the ventral respiratory column (Bötzinger and preBötzinger Complex [preBötC], ventral respiratory group, ventral parafacial region [pF&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;] and pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;), nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), reticular formation (RF), pontine and midbrain vestibular nuclei, and medullary raphe. In the pons and midbrain, retrogradely‐labelled neurons of the same phenotypes were found in the Kölliker‐Fuse and parabrachial nuclei, periaqueductal grey, pedunculopontine nucleus (PPT) and laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT). We also identified somatostatin‐expressing neurons in the preBötC and PHOX2B immunopositive cells in the pF&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;, NTS and part of the RF. Surprisingly, we found no catecholaminergic neurons in the NTS, A5 or &lt;i&gt;Locus Coeruleus, &lt;/i&gt; no serotoninergic raphe neurons nor any cholinergic neurons in the PPT and LDT that projected to the pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. Our results indicate that pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; neurons receive extensive excitatory and inhibitory inputs from several respiratory and non‐respiratory related brainstem regions that could contribute to the complex modulation of the conditional pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; oscillator for active expiration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Distribution of polysialic acid immunoreactivity in the adult rat brainstem (a) and thoracolumbar spinal cord (b‐e). Discrete neural regions express the glycan, including the NTS, Sp5C, A1 region (a) and dorsal horn and lateral horn (b) where ChAT positive sympathetic preganglionic neurons are often coated with polySia (c‐e).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polysialic acid (polySia), a homopolymer of α2,8‐linked glycans, is a post translational modification on a few glycoproteins, most commonly in the brain, on the neural cell adhesion molecule. Most research in the adult central nervous system has focused on its expression in higher brain regions, where its distribution coincides with regions known to exhibit high levels of synaptic plasticity. In contrast, scant attention has been paid to the expression of polySia in the hindbrain. The main aims of the study were to examine the distribution of polySia immunoreactivity in the brainstem and thoracolumbar spinal cord, to compare the distribution of polySia revealed by two commercial antibodies commonly used for its investigation, and to compare labelling in the rat and mouse. We present a comprehensive atlas of polySia immunoreactivity: we report that polySia labelling is particularly dense in the dorsal tegmentum, medial vestibular nuclei and lateral parabrachial nucleus, and in brainstem regions associated with autonomic function, including the dorsal vagal complex, A5, RVL, A1 and midline raphe, as well as sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the spinal cord and central targets of primary sensory afferents (nucleus of the solitary tract, spinal trigeminal nucleus, and dorsal horn). Ultrastructural examination showed labelling was present predominantly on the plasma membrane/within the extracellular space/in or on astrocytes. Labelling throughout the brainstem and spinal cord were very similar for the two antibodies and was eliminated by the polySia‐specific sialidase, Endo‐NF. Similar patterns of distribution were found in rat and mouse brainstem with differences evident in dorsal horn.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;The entorhinal cortex of the monkey: VI. Organization of projections from the hippocampus, subiculum, presubiculum and parasubiculum&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b5710ef4-d4ee-4f00-9b2f-117659696bd4/cne24983-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projections from hippocampal fields CA1 and the subiculum to the entorhinal cortex are topographically organized. Projections from the presubiculum preferentially distribute to the caudal half of the entorhinal cortex and thus provides a potential indicator for a primate homologue of the medial entorhinal cortex as defined in rodents.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organization of projections from the macaque monkey hippocampus, subiculum, presubiculum and parasubiculum to the entorhinal cortex was analyzed using anterograde and retrograde tracing techniques. Projections exclusively originate in the CA1 field of the hippocampus and in the subiculum, presubiculum and parasubiculum. The CA1 and subicular projections terminate most densely in layers V and VI of the entorhinal cortex, with sparser innervation of the deep portion of layer III and layer I. Entorhinal projections from CA1 and the subiculum are topographically organized such that a rostrocaudal axis of origin is related to a medial‐to‐lateral axis of termination. A proximodistal axis of origin in CA1 and distoproximal axis in subiculum are related to a rostrocaudal axis of termination in the entorhinal cortex. The presubiculum sends a dense, bilateral projection to caudal parts of the entorhinal cortex. This projection terminates most densely in layer III with sparser termination in layers I, II and V. The same parts of entorhinal cortex receive a dense projection from the parasubiculum. This projection terminates in layers III and II. Both presubicular and parasubicular projections demonstrate the same longitudinal topographic organization as the projections from CA1 and the subiculum. These studies demonstrate that: 1) hippocampal and subicular inputs to the entorhinal cortex in the monkey are organized similar to those described in non‐primate species; 2) the topographic organization of the projections from the hippocampus and subicular areas matches that of the reciprocal projections from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus and the subicular areas.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Absence of Subcerebral Projection Neurons Is Beneficial in a Mouse Model of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25833?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent studies carried out on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients suggest that the disease might initiate in the motor cortex and spread to its targets along the corticofugal tracts. In this study, we aimed to test the corticofugal hypothesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis experimentally.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sod1 &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;G86R &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Fezf2 &lt;/i&gt; knockout mouse lines were crossed to generate a model that expresses a mutant of the murine &lt;i&gt;Sod1 &lt;/i&gt; gene ubiquitously, a condition sufficient to induce progressive motor symptoms and premature death, but genetically lacks corticospinal neurons and other subcerebral projection neurons, one of the main populations of corticofugal neurons. Disease onset and survival were recorded, and weight and motor behavior were followed longitudinally. Hyper‐reflexia and spasticity were monitored using electromyographic recordings. Neurodegeneration and gliosis were assessed by histological techniques.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absence of subcerebral projection neurons delayed disease onset, reduced weight loss and motor impairment, and increased survival without modifying disease duration. Absence of corticospinal neurons also limited presymptomatic hyper‐reflexia, a typical component of the upper motoneuron syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major corticofugal tracts are crucial to the onset and progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In the context of the disease, subcerebral projection neurons might carry detrimental signals to their downstream targets. In its entirety, this study provides the first experimental arguments in favor of the corticofugal hypothesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Reelin activates the small GTPase TC10 and VAMP7 to promote neurite outgrowth and regeneration of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24688?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Reelin activates the small GTPase TC10 and VAMP7 to promote neurite outgrowth and regeneration of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/483c8343-0984-40b6-b460-cea4777e0c37/jnr24688-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Axonal growth is a relevant process for development and regeneration. After peripheral nervous system (PNS) injury, Reelin levels increase, and mice devoid of Reelin show an impairment in nerve regeneration. Here we show, for the first time, that Reelin increases the regenerative outcome of dorsal root ganglia axons after axotomy (a mock, b Reelin treated). (c) After binding to its receptor, Apolipoprotein E‐receptor 2, Reelin activates the Rho GTPases Cdc42 that regulates actin dynamics, and TC10, required for membrane addition by interacting with the exocyst complex. TC10 recruits to membrane vesicles that potentially could come from Golgi and/or recycling endosomes. TC10 vesicles also contain ApoER2 and the v‐SNARE protein VAMP7. Reelin increases the fusion of vesicles, containing VAMP7, at the growth cone. Therefore, Reelin signaling could have a therapeutic role in PNS lesions, improving axonal outgrowth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Axonal outgrowth is a fundamental process during the development of central (CNS) and peripheral (PNS) nervous system as well as in nerve regeneration and requires accurate axonal navigation and extension to the correct target. These events need proper coordination between membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal rearrangements and are under the control of the small GTPases of the Rho family, among other molecules. Reelin, a relevant protein for CNS development and synaptic function in the adult, is also present in the PNS. Upon sciatic nerve damage, Reelin expression increases and, on the other hand, mice deficient in Reelin exhibit an impaired nerve regeneration. However, the mechanism(s) involved the Reelin‐dependent axonal growth is still poorly understood. In this work, we present evidence showing that Reelin stimulates dorsal root ganglia (DRG) regeneration after axotomy. Moreover, dissociated DRG neurons express the Reelin receptor Apolipoprotein E‐receptor 2 and also require the presence of TC10 to develop their axons. TC10 is a Rho GTPase that promotes neurite outgrowth through the exocytic fusion of vesicles at the growth cone. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that Reelin controls TC10 activation in DRG neurons. Besides, we confirmed that the known CNS Reelin target Cdc42 is also activated in DRG and controls TC10 activity. Finally, in the process of membrane addition, we found that Reelin stimulates the fusion of membrane carriers containing the v‐SNARE protein VAMP7 in vesicles that contain TC10. Altogether, our work shows a new role of Reelin in PNS, opening the option of therapeutic interventions to improve the regeneration process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: NMDAR Antibodies Alter Dopamine Receptors and Cause Psychotic Behavior in Mice</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25829?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim was to demonstrate that antibodies from patients with anti‐&lt;i&gt;N &lt;/i&gt;‐methyl‐&lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;d &lt;/span&gt;‐aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis alter the levels of dopamine 1 receptor (D1R) and dopamine 2 receptor (D2R) and cause psychotic‐like features in mice.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cultured rat hippocampal neurons were treated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis or controls, and the effects on clusters of D1R and D2R were quantified. In vivo studies included 71 C57BL/6J mice that were chronically infused with CSF from patients or controls through ventricular catheters connected to subcutaneous osmotic pumps. Prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startling reflex (PPI; a marker of psychotic‐like behavior), memory, locomotor activity, and the density of cell‐surface and synaptic D1R, D2R, and NMDAR clusters were examined at different time points using reported techniques.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In cultured neurons, CSF from patients, but not from controls, caused a significant decrease of cell‐surface D1R and an increase of D2R clusters. In mice, CSF from patients caused a significant decrease of synaptic and total cell‐surface D1R clusters and an increase of D2R clusters associated with a decrease of PPI. These effects were accompanied by memory impairment and a reduction of surface NMDARs, as reported in this model. The psychotic‐like features, memory impairment, and changes in levels of D1R, D2R, and NMDAR progressively improved several days after the infusion of CSF from patients stopped.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to memory deficits and reduction of NMDARs, CSF antibodies from patients with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis cause reversible psychotic‐like features accompanied by changes (D1R decrease, D2R increase) in cell‐surface dopamine receptor clusters.

Antibiotic production is coordinated in the &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces coelicolor&lt;/i&gt; population through the use of diffusible signaling molecules of the γ-butyrolactone (GBL) family. The GBL regulatory system involves a small, and not completely defined two-gene network which governs a potentially bi-stable switch between the “on” and “off” states of antibiotic production. The use of this circuit as a tool for synthetic biology has been hampered by a lack of mechanistic understanding of its functionality. We hereby present the creation and analysis of a versatile and adaptable ensemble model of the &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; GBL system (detailed information on all model mechanisms and parameters is documented in http://www.systemsbiology.ls.manchester.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/Main_Page). We use the model to explore a range of previously proposed mechanistic hypotheses, including transcriptional interference, antisense RNA interactions between the mRNAs of the two genes, and various alternative regulatory activities. Our results suggest that transcriptional interference alone is not sufficient to explain the system’s behavior. Instead, antisense RNA interactions seem to be the system's driving force, combined with an aggressive &lt;i&gt;scbR&lt;/i&gt; promoter. The computational model can be used to further challenge and refine our understanding of the system’s activity and guide future experimentation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vQcdHwJpGWc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Whole cell biophysical modeling of codon-tRNA competition reveals novel insights related to translation dynamics</title>

The importance of mRNA translation models has been demonstrated across many fields of science and biotechnology. However, a whole cell model with codon resolution and biophysical dynamics is still lacking. We describe a whole cell model of translation for &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt;. The model simulates all major translation components in the cell: ribosomes, mRNAs and tRNAs. It also includes, for the first time, fundamental aspects of translation, such as competition for ribosomes and tRNAs at a codon resolution while considering tRNAs wobble interactions and tRNA recycling. The model uses parameters that are tightly inferred from large scale measurements of translation. Furthermore, we demonstrate a robust modelling approach which relies on state-of-the-art practices of translation modelling and also provides a framework for easy generalizations. This novel approach allows simulation of thousands of mRNAs that undergo translation in the same cell with common resources such as ribosomes and tRNAs in feasible time. Based on this model, we demonstrate, for the first time, the direct importance of competition for resources on translation and its accurate modelling. An effective supply-demand ratio (ESDR) measure, which is related to translation factors such as tRNAs, has been devised and utilized to show superior predictive power in complex scenarios of heterologous gene expression. The devised model is not only more accurate than the existing models, but, more importantly, provides a framework for analyzing complex whole cell translation problems and variables that haven't been explored before, making it important in various biomedical fields.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XlLFYvqkEAQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: The interplay between somatic and dendritic inhibition promotes the emergence and stabilization of place fields</title>

During the exploration of novel environments, place fields are rapidly formed in hippocampal CA1 neurons. Place cell firing rate increases in early stages of exploration of novel environments but returns to baseline levels in familiar environments. Although similar in amplitude and width, place fields in familiar environments are more stable than in novel environments. We propose a computational model of the hippocampal CA1 network, which describes the formation, dynamics and stabilization of place fields. We show that although somatic disinhibition is sufficient to form place fields, dendritic inhibition along with synaptic plasticity is necessary for place field stabilization. Our model suggests that place cell stability can be attributed to strong excitatory synaptic weights and strong dendritic inhibition. We show that the interplay between somatic and dendritic inhibition balances the increased excitatory weights, such that place cells return to their baseline firing rate after exploration. Our model suggests that different types of interneurons are essential to unravel the mechanisms underlying place field plasticity. Finally, we predict that artificially induced dendritic events can shift place fields even after place field stabilization.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/riZBHO8GGwk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

High-throughput sequencing of human immunoglobulin genes allows analysis of antibody repertoires and the reconstruction of clonal lineage evolution. The study of antibodies (Abs) affinity maturation is of specific interest to understand the generation of Abs with high affinity or broadly neutralizing activities. Moreover, phylogenic analysis enables the identification of the key somatic mutations required to achieve optimal antigen binding. The Immcantation framework provides a start-to-finish set of analytical methods for high-throughput adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-Seq; Rep-Seq) data. Furthermore, Immcantation’s Change-O package has developed IgPhyML, an algorithm designed to build specifically immunoglobulin (Ig) phylogenic trees. Meanwhile Phylip, an algorithm that has been originally developed for applications in ecology and macroevolution, can also be used for the phylogenic reconstruction of antibodies maturation pathway. To complement Ig lineages made by IgPhyML or Dnaml (Phylip), we developed AncesTree, a graphic user interface (GUI) that aims to give researchers the opportunity to interactively explore antibodies clonal evolution. AncesTree displays interactive immunoglobulins phylogenic tree, Ig related mutations and sequence alignments using additional information coming from specialized antibody tools. The GUI is a Java standalone application allowing interaction with Ig tree that can run under Windows, Linux and Mac OS.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6Irkwzuv4fQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: A single touch can provide sufficient mechanical stimulation to trigger Venus flytrap closure</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/a8JG4sFhJUg/article</link>

The carnivorous Venus flytrap catches prey by an ingenious snapping mechanism. Based on work over nearly 200 years, it has become generally accepted that two touches of the trap’s sensory hairs within 30 s, each one generating an action potential, are required to trigger closure of the trap. We developed an electromechanical model, which, however, suggests that under certain circumstances one touch is sufficient to generate two action potentials. Using a force-sensing microrobotic system, we precisely quantified the sensory-hair deflection parameters necessary to trigger trap closure and correlated them with the elicited action potentials in vivo. Our results confirm the model’s predictions, suggesting that the Venus flytrap may be adapted to a wider range of prey movements than previously assumed.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/a8JG4sFhJUg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Rest-task modulation of fMRI-derived global signal topography is mediated by transient coactivation patterns</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/KpYFzcwnd0Q/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Jianfeng Zhang, Zirui Huang, Shankar Tumati, Georg Northoff&lt;/p&gt;

Recent resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) studies have revealed that the global signal (GS) exhibits a nonuniform spatial distribution across the gray matter. Whether this topography is informative remains largely unknown. We therefore tested rest-task modulation of GS topography by analyzing static GS correlation and dynamic coactivation patterns in a large sample of an fMRI dataset (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 837) from the Human Connectome Project. The GS topography in the resting state and in seven different tasks was first measured by correlating the GS with the local time series (GSCORR). In the resting state, high GSCORR was observed mainly in the primary sensory and motor regions, whereas low GSCORR was seen in the association brain areas. This pattern changed during the seven tasks, with mainly decreased GSCORR in sensorimotor cortex. Importantly, this rest-task modulation of GSCORR could be traced to transient coactivation patterns at the peak period of GS (GS-peak). By comparing the topography of GSCORR and respiration effects, we observed that the topography of respiration mimicked the topography of GS in the resting state, whereas both differed during the task states; because of such partial dissociation, we assume that GSCORR could not be equated with a respiration effect. Finally, rest-task modulation of GS topography could not be exclusively explained by other sources of physiological noise. Together, we here demonstrate the informative nature of GS topography by showing its rest-task modulation, the underlying dynamic coactivation patterns, and its partial dissociation from respiration effects during task states.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/KpYFzcwnd0Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Bidirectional Dysregulation of AMPA Receptor-Mediated Synaptic Transmission and Plasticity in Brain Disorders</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00026</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are glutamate-gated ion channels that mediate the majority of fast excitatory synaptic transmission throughout the brain. Changes in the properties and postsynaptic abundance of AMPARs are pivotal mechanisms in synaptic plasticity, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic transmission. A wide range of neurodegenerative, neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, despite their extremely diverse etiology, pathogenesis and symptoms, exhibit brain region-specific and AMPAR subunit-specific aberrations in synaptic transmission or plasticity. These include abnormally enhanced or reduced AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission or plasticity. Bidirectional reversal of these changes by targeting AMPAR subunits or trafficking ameliorates drug-seeking behavior, chronic pain, epileptic seizures, or cognitive deficits. This indicates that bidirectional dysregulation of AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission or plasticity may contribute to the expression of many brain disorders and therefore serve as a therapeutic target. Here, we provide a synopsis of bidirectional AMPAR dysregulation in animal models of brain disorders and review the preclinical evidence on the therapeutic targeting of AMPARs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;While non-invasive brain imaging has made substantial contributions to advance human brain science, estimation of individual state is becoming important to realize its applications in society. Brain activations were used to classify second-language proficiencies. Participants in functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) experiment were 20/20 native Japanese speakers with high/low English abilities and 19/19 native English speakers with high/low Japanese abilities. Their cortical activities were measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy while they were conducting Japanese/English listening comprehension tests. The data-driven method achieved classification accuracy of 77.5% in the case of Japanese speakers and 81.9% in the case of English speakers. The informative features predominantly originated from regions associated with language function. These results bring an insight of fNIRS neuroscience and its applications in society.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Relational Memory at Short and Long Delays in Individuals With Moderate-Severe Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00270</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Memory deficits are a common and frequently-cited consequence of moderate-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, we know less about how TBI influences relational memory, which allows the binding of the arbitrary elements of experience and the flexible use and recombination of relational representations in novel situations. Relational memory is of special interest for individuals with TBI, given the vulnerability of the hippocampus to injury mechanisms, as well as a growing body of literature establishing the role of relational memory in flexible and goal-directed behavior. In this study, participants with and without a history of moderate-severe TBI completed a continuous relational memory task for face-scene pairings. Participants with TBI exhibited a disruption in relational memory not only when tested after a delay, but also when tested with no experimenter-imposed delay after stimulus presentation. Further, canonical assessments of working and episodic memory did not correspond with performance on the face-scene task, suggesting that this task may tap into relational memory differently and with greater sensitivity than standardized memory assessments. These results highlight the need for rigorous assessment of relational memory in TBI, which is likely to detect deficits that have specific consequences for community reintegration and long-term functional outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Semantic Processing in Autism Spectrum Disorders Is Associated With the Timing of Language Acquisition: A Magnetoencephalographic Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00267</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Individuals with autism show difficulties in using sentence context to identify the correct meaning of ambiguous words, such as homonyms. In this study, the brain basis of sentence context effects on word understanding during reading was examined in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and typical development (TD) using magnetoencephalography. The correlates of a history of developmental language delay in ASD were also investigated. Event related field responses at early (150 ms after the onset of a final word) and N400 latencies are reported for three different types of sentence final words: dominant homonyms, subordinate homonyms, and unambiguous words. Clear evidence for semantic access was found at both early and conventional N400 latencies in both TD participants and individuals with ASD with no history of language delay. By contrast, modulation of evoked activity related to semantic access was weak and not significant at early latencies in individuals with ASD with a history of language delay. The reduced sensitivity to semantic context in individuals with ASD and language delay was accompanied by strong right hemisphere lateralization at early and N400 latencies; such strong activity was not observed in TD individuals and individuals with ASD without a history of language delay at either latency. These results provide new evidence and support for differential neural mechanisms underlying semantic processing in ASD, and indicate that delayed language acquisition in ASD is associated with different lateralization and processing of language.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00265</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tactile stimulation is less frequently used than visual for brain-computer interface (BCI) control, partly because of limitations in speed and accuracy. Non-visual BCI paradigms, however, may be required for patients who struggle with vision dependent BCIs because of a loss of gaze control. With the present study, we attempted to replicate earlier results by Herweg et al. (2016), with several minor adjustments and a focus on training effects and usability. We invited 16 healthy participants and trained them with a 4-class tactile P300-based BCI in five sessions. Their main task was to navigate a virtual wheelchair through a 3D apartment using the BCI. We found significant training effects on information transfer rate (ITR), which increased from a mean of 3.10–9.50 bits/min. Further, both online and offline accuracies significantly increased with training from 65% to 86% and 70% to 95%, respectively. We found only a descriptive increase of P300 amplitudes at Fz and Cz with training. Furthermore, we report subjective data from questionnaires, which indicated a relatively high workload and moderate to high satisfaction. Although our participants have not achieved the same high performance as in the Herweg et al. (2016) study, we provide evidence for training effects on performance with a tactile BCI and confirm the feasibility of the paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Frequency-Dependent Interictal Neuromagnetic Activities in Children With Benign Epilepsy With Centrotemporal Spikes: A Magnetoencephalography (MEG) Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00264</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: This study aimed to investigate interictal neuromagnetic activities in the low- to high-frequency ranges in patients with benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS), especially those without interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We studied 21 clinically-diagnosed BECTS patients and 11 age-matched healthy controls (HC) using high-sampling magnetoencephalography (MEG). Neuromagnetic sources were assessed with accumulated source imaging (ASI). The MEG data were analyzed in seven frequency bands. The MEG recordings distinguished BECTS without IEDs (n = 10) from those with IEDs (n = 11) and HC (n = 11).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: At 1–4 Hz, the neuromagnetic activities in healthy subjects tended to locate at the precuneus/posterior cingulate, while those of the BECTS patients without IEDs tended to locate at the medial frontal cortex (MFC) compared to BECTS patients with IEDs. The MEG source imaging at 30–80 Hz revealed that BECTS patients without IEDs had higher occurrences of interictal brain activity in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) compared to controls and the brain activity strength seemed to be weaker. There was a significant correlation between the source strength of the interictal gamma oscillations of BECTS patients without IEDs and the duration of epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: IEDs might disrupt the default mode network (DMN). Aberrant brain activities in BECTS patients without IEDs were associated with cognitive areas of the brain. The strength of gamma oscillations in the chronic epilepsy state reflected the duration of BECTS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significance: MEG could reveal the aberrant neural activities in BECTS patients during the interictal period, and such abnormality is frequency-dependent. Gamma oscillations could be used to identify BECTS patients without IEDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00258</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Schizencephalies are abnormal clefts of the cerebral hemispheres that result from abnormal late neuronal migration and cortical organization. In the present study, we report a different type of unusual motor organization in a patient with a schizencephalic cleft in the right hemisphere and polymicrogyria in the opposite hemisphere. Despite similar brain pathology affecting the sensorimotor cortex, motor organization differed from previously known bilateral congenital brain lesions. We conducted a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and diffusion tensor image (DTI) study to confirm the motor organization. In this case, ipsilateral corticospinal projections to the paretic hands were observed during TMS of the less affected hemisphere, along with polymicrogyria, similar to the previous study. However, a crossed corticospinal tract to the paretic hand from the more severely affected hemisphere was observed in this case-a pattern of motor organization that has yet to be reported in this patient population. Our findings indicate that motor organization after early brain injury may be affected by the interhemispheric competition of the corticospinal system and bilateral brain lesions, thereby resulting in unilateral hemiparesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Do Muscle Synergies Improve Optimization Prediction of Muscle Activations During Gait?</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00054</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Determination of muscle forces during motion can help to understand motor control, assess pathological movement, diagnose neuromuscular disorders, or estimate joint loads. Difficulty of in vivo measurement made computational analysis become a common alternative in which, as several muscles serve each degree of freedom, the muscle redundancy problem must be solved. Unlike static optimization (SO), synergy optimization (SynO) couples muscle activations across all time frames, thereby altering estimated muscle co-contraction. This study explores whether the use of a muscle synergy structure within an SO framework improves prediction of muscle activations during walking. A motion/force/electromyography (EMG) gait analysis was performed on five healthy subjects. A musculoskeletal model of the right leg actuated by 43 Hill-type muscles was scaled to each subject and used to calculate joint moments, muscle–tendon kinematics, and moment arms. Muscle activations were then estimated using SynO with two to six synergies and traditional SO, and these estimates were compared with EMG measurements. Synergy optimization neither improved SO prediction of experimental activation patterns nor provided SO exact matching of joint moments. Finally, synergy analysis was performed on SO estimated activations, being found that the reconstructed activations produced poor matching of experimental activations and joint moments. As conclusion, it can be said that, although SynO did not improve prediction of muscle activations during gait, its reduced dimensional control space could be beneficial for applications such as functional electrical stimulation or motion control and prediction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electrical excitation of neural tissue has wide applications, but how electrical stimulation interacts with neural tissue remains to be elucidated. Here, we propose a new theory, named the Circuit-Probability theory, to reveal how this physical interaction happen. The relation between the electrical stimulation input and the neural response can be theoretically calculated. We show that many empirical models, including strength-duration relationship and linear-non-linear-Poisson model, can be theoretically explained, derived, and amended using our theory. Furthermore, this theory can explain the complex non-linear and resonant phenomena and fit in vivo experiment data. In this letter, we validated an entirely new framework to study electrical stimulation on neural tissue, which is to simulate voltage waveforms using a parallel RLC circuit first, and then calculate the excitation probability stochastically.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Microglia and Their Promising Role in Ischemic Brain Injuries: An Update</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00211</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ischemic brain injuries are common diseases with high morbidity, disability, and mortality rates, which have significant impacts on human health and life. Microglia are resident cells of the central nervous system (CNS). The inflammatory responses mediated by microglia play an important role in the occurrence and development of ischemic brain injuries. This article summarizes the activation, polarization, depletion, and repopulation of microglia after ischemic brain injuries, proposing new treatment strategies for such injuries through the modulation of microglial function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Mouse Astrocytes Promote Microglial Ramification by Releasing TGF-β and Forming Glial Fibers</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00195</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The morphology of microglial cells is often closely related to their functions. The mechanisms that regulate microglial ramification are not well understood. Here we reveal the biological mechanisms by which astrocytes regulate microglial ramification. Morphological variation in mouse microglial cultures was measured in terms of cell area as well as branch number and length. Effects on microglial ramification were analyzed after microinjecting the toxin L-alpha-aminoadipic acid (L-AAA) in the mouse cortex or hippocampus to ablate astrocytes, and after culturing microglia on their own in an astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM) or together with astrocytes in coculture. TGF-β expression was determined by Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and ELISA. The TGF-β signaling pathway was blocked by the TGF-β antibody to assess the role of TGF-β on microglial ramification. The results showed that microglia had more and longer branches and smaller cell bodies in brain areas where astrocytes were abundant. In the mouse cortex and hippocampus, ablation of astrocytes by L-AAA decreased number and length of microglial branches and increased the size of cell bodies. Similar results were obtained with isolated microglia in culture. However, isolated microglia were able to maintain their multibranched structure for a long time when cultured on astrocyte monolayers. Ameboid microglia isolated from P0 to P3 mice showed increased ramification when cultured in ACM or on astrocyte monolayers. Microglia cultured on astrocyte monolayers showed more complex branching structures than those cultured in ACM. Blocking astrocyte-derived TGF-β decreased microglial ramification. Astrocytes induced the formation of protuberances on branches of microglia by forming glial fibers that increased traction. These experiments in mice suggest that astrocytes promote microglial ramification by forming glial fibers to create traction and by secreting soluble factors into the surroundings. For example, astrocyte-secreted TGF-β promotes microglia to generate primitive branches, whose ramification is refined by glial fibers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Whole-Cell Photobleaching Reveals Time-Dependent Compartmentalization of Soluble Proteins by the Axon Initial Segment</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00180</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;By limiting protein exchange between the soma and the axon, the axon initial segment (AIS) enables the segregation of specific proteins and hence the differentiation of the somatodendritic compartment and the axonal compartment. Electron microscopy and super-resolution fluorescence imaging have provided important insights in the ultrastructure of the AIS. Yet, the full extent of its filtering properties is not fully delineated. In particular, it is unclear whether and how the AIS opposes the free exchange of soluble proteins. Here we describe a robust framework to combine whole-cell photobleaching and retrospective high-resolution imaging in developing neurons. With this assay, we found that cytoplasmic soluble proteins that are not excluded from the axon upon expression over tens of hours exhibit a strong mobility reduction at the AIS – i.e., are indeed compartmentalized – when monitored over tens of minutes. This form of compartmentalization is developmentally regulated, requires intact F-actin and may be correlated with the composition and ultrastructure of the submembranous spectrin cytoskeleton. Using computational modeling, we provide evidence that both neuronal morphology and the AIS regulate this compartmentalization but act on distinct time scales, with the AIS having a more pronounced effect on fast exchanges. Our results thus suggest that the rate of protein accumulation in the soma may impact to what extent and over which timescales freely moving molecules can be segregated from the axon. This in turn has important implications for our understanding of compartment-specific signaling in neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: COX5A Plays a Vital Role in Memory Impairment Associated With Brain Aging via the BDNF/ERK1/2 Signaling Pathway</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00215</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cytochrome c oxidase subunit Va (COX5A) is involved in maintaining normal mitochondrial function. However, little is known on the role of COX5A in the development and progress of Alzheimer’s disease (Martinez-Losa et al., 2018). In this study, we established and characterized the genomic profiles of genes expressed in the hippocampus of Senescence-Accelerated Mouse-prone 8 (SAMP8) mice, and revealed differential expression of COX5A among 12-month-aged SAMP8 mice and 2-month-aged SAMP8 mice. Newly established transgenic mice with systemic COX5A overexpression (51% increase) resulted in the improvement of spatial recognition memory and hippocampal synaptic plasticity, recovery of hippocampal CA1 dendrites, and activation of the BDNF/ERK1/2 signaling pathway in vivo. Moreover, mice with both COX5A overexpression and BDNF knockdown showed a poor recovery in spatial recognition memory as well as a decrease in spine density and branching of dendrites in CA1, when compared to mice that only overexpressed COX5A. In vitro studies supported that COX5A affected neuronal growth via BDNF. In summary, this study was the first to show that COX5A in the hippocampus plays a vital role in aging-related cognitive deterioration via BDNF/ERK1/2 regulation, and suggested that COX5A may be a potential target for anti-senescence drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Individuals in low socioeconomic brackets are considered at-risk for developing influenza-related complications and often exhibit higher than average influenza-related hospitalization rates. This disparity has been attributed to various factors, including restricted access to preventative and therapeutic health care, limited sick leave, and household structure. Adequate influenza surveillance in these at-risk populations is a critical precursor to accurate risk assessments and effective intervention. However, the United States of America’s primary national influenza surveillance system (ILINet) monitors outpatient healthcare providers, which may be largely inaccessible to lower socioeconomic populations. Recent initiatives to incorporate Internet-source and hospital electronic medical records data into surveillance systems seek to improve the timeliness, coverage, and accuracy of outbreak detection and situational awareness. Here, we use a flexible statistical framework for integrating multiple surveillance data sources to evaluate the adequacy of traditional (ILINet) and next generation (BioSense 2.0 and Google Flu Trends) data for situational awareness of influenza across poverty levels. We find that ZIP Codes in the highest poverty quartile are a critical vulnerability for ILINet that the integration of next generation data fails to ameliorate.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TufeTsxwbfw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Network-based intervention strategies can be effective and cost-efficient approaches to curtailing harmful contagions in myriad settings. As studied, these strategies are often impractical to implement, as they typically assume complete knowledge of the network structure, which is unusual in practice. In this paper, we investigate how different immunization strategies perform under realistic conditions—where the strategies are informed by partially-observed network data. Our results suggest that global immunization strategies, like degree immunization, are optimal in most cases; the exception is at very high levels of missing data, where stochastic strategies, like acquaintance immunization, begin to outstrip them in minimizing outbreaks. Stochastic strategies are more robust in some cases due to the different ways in which they can be affected by missing data. In fact, one of our proposed variants of acquaintance immunization leverages a logistically-realistic ongoing survey-intervention process as a form of targeted data-recovery to improve with increasing levels of missing data. These results support the effectiveness of targeted immunization as a general practice. They also highlight the risks of considering networks as idealized mathematical objects: overestimating the accuracy of network data and foregoing the rewards of additional inquiry.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lFc02eNMJ-g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Kindlin-1, -2, and -3 directly bind integrin β cytoplasmic tails to regulate integrin activation and signaling. Despite their functional significance and links to several diseases, structural information on full-length kindlin proteins remains unknown. Here, we report the crystal structure of human full-length kindlin-3, which reveals a novel homotrimer state. Unlike kindlin-3 monomer, which is the major population in insect and mammalian cell expression systems, kindlin-3 trimer does not bind integrin β cytoplasmic tail as the integrin-binding pocket in the F3 subdomain of 1 protomer is occluded by the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of another protomer, suggesting that kindlin-3 is auto-inhibited upon trimer formation. This is also supported by functional assays in which kindlin-3 knockout K562 erythroleukemia cells reconstituted with the mutant kindlin-3 containing trimer-disrupting mutations exhibited an increase in integrin-mediated adhesion and spreading on fibronectin compared with those reconstituted with wild-type kindlin-3. Taken together, our findings reveal a novel mechanism of kindlin auto-inhibition that involves its homotrimer formation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/_wp-lAqDT68&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

CRISPR-&lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; Cas9 (CRISPR-SaCas9) has been harnessed as an effective in vivo genome-editing tool to manipulate genomes. However, off-target effects remain a major bottleneck that precludes safe and reliable applications in genome editing. Here, we characterize the off-target effects of wild-type (WT) SaCas9 at single-nucleotide (single-nt) resolution and describe a directional screening system to identify novel SaCas9 variants with desired properties in human cells. Using this system, we identified enhanced-fidelity SaCas9 (efSaCas9) (variant Mut268 harboring the single mutation of N260D), which could effectively distinguish and reject single base-pair mismatches. We demonstrate dramatically reduced off-target effects (approximately 2- to 93-fold improvements) of Mut268 compared to WT using targeted deep-sequencing analyses. To understand the structural origin of the fidelity enhancement, we find that N260, located in the REC3 domain, orchestrates an extensive network of contacts between REC3 and the guide RNA-DNA heteroduplex. efSaCas9 can be broadly used in genome-editing applications that require high fidelity. Furthermore, this study provides a general strategy to rapidly evolve other desired CRISPR-Cas9 traits besides enhanced fidelity, to expand the utility of the CRISPR toolkit.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/7DlnCXht8Ac&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron is essential for normal cellular function, however, excessive accumulation of iron in neural tissue has been implicated in both cortical and retinal diseases. The exact role of iron in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders remains incompletely understood. However, iron‐induced damage to the brain and retina is often attributed to the redox ability of iron to generate dangerous free radicals, which exacerbates local oxidative stress and neuronal damage. Iron chelators are compounds designed to scavenge labile iron, aiding to regulate iron bioavailability. Recently there has been growing interest in the application of chelating agents for treatment of diseases including neurodegenerative conditions, characterized by increased oxidative stress. This article reviews both clinical and preclinical evidence relating to the effectiveness of iron chelation therapy in conditions of iron dyshomeostasis linked to neurodegeneration in the brain and retina. The limitations as well as future opportunities iron chelation therapy are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25809?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pathogenic variants in &lt;i&gt;SCN3A &lt;/i&gt;, encoding the voltage‐gated sodium channel subunit Nav1.3, cause severe childhood onset epilepsy and malformation of cortical development. Here, we define the spectrum of clinical, genetic, and neuroimaging features of &lt;i&gt;SCN3A &lt;/i&gt;‐related neurodevelopmental disorder.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients were ascertained via an international collaborative network. We compared sodium channels containing wild‐type versus variant Nav1.3 subunits coexpressed with β1 and β2 subunits using whole‐cell voltage clamp electrophysiological recordings in a heterologous mammalian system (HEK‐293T cells).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of 22 patients with pathogenic &lt;i&gt;SCN3A &lt;/i&gt; variants, most had treatment‐resistant epilepsy beginning in the first year of life (16/21, 76%; median onset, 2 weeks), with severe or profound developmental delay (15/20, 75%). Many, but not all (15/19, 79%), exhibited malformations of cortical development. Pathogenic variants clustered in transmembrane segments 4 to 6 of domains II to IV. Most pathogenic missense variants tested (10/11, 91%) displayed gain of channel function, with increased persistent current and/or a leftward shift in the voltage dependence of activation, and all variants associated with malformation of cortical development exhibited gain of channel function. One variant (p.Ile1468Arg) exhibited mixed effects, with gain and partial loss of function. Two variants demonstrated loss of channel function.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study defines &lt;i&gt;SCN3A‐ &lt;/i&gt;related neurodevelopmental disorder along a spectrum of severity, but typically including epilepsy and severe or profound developmental delay/intellectual disability. Malformations of cortical development are a characteristic feature of this unusual channelopathy syndrome, present in &amp;gt;75% of affected individuals. Gain of function at the channel level in developing neurons is likely an important mechanism of disease pathogenesis. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: The CSF Profile Linked to Cortical Damage Predicts Multiple Sclerosis Activity</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25786?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intrathecal inflammation correlates with the grey matter damage since the early stages of multiple sclerosis (MS), but whether the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile can help to identify patients at risk of disease activity is still unclear.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We evaluated the association between CSF levels of 18 cytokines, previously found to be associated to grey matter damage, and the disease activity, among 99 patients with relapsing‐remitting MS, who underwent blinded clinical and 3 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluations for 4 years. Groups with evidence of disease activity (EDA) or no evidence of disease activity (NEDA; occurrence of relapses, new white matter lesions, and Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] change) were identified. Cortical lesions and the annualized cortical thinning were also evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forty‐one patients experienced EDA and, compared to the NEDA group, had at diagnosis higher CSF levels of CXCL13, CXCL12, IFNγ, TNF, sCD163, LIGHT, and APRIL (&lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). In the multivariate analysis, CXCL13 (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.35; &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.0002), LIGHT (HR = 1.22; &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.005) and APRIL (HR = 1.78; &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.0001) were the CSF molecules more strongly associated with the risk of EDA. The model, including CSF variables, predicted more accurately the occurrence of disease activity than the model with only clinical/MRI parameters (C‐index at 4 years = 71% vs 44%). Finally, higher CSF levels of CXCL13 (β = 4.7*10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;; &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), TNF (β = 3.1*10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;; &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.004), LIGHT (β = 2.6*10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;; &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.003), sCD163 (β = 4.3*10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;; &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.009), and TWEAK (β = 3.4*10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;; &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.024) were associated with more severe cortical thinning.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A specific CSF profile, mainly characterized by elevated levels of B‐cell related cytokines, distinguishes patients at high risk of disease activity and severe cortical damage. The CSF analysis may allow stratifications of patients at diagnosis for optimizing therapeutic approaches. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Report on Electroencephalographic Findings in Critically Ill Patients with COVID‐19</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25814?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In March 2020, we treated a cohort of 26 critically ill hospitalized SARS‐CoV‐2–infected patients who underwent electroencephalography to assess unexplained altered mental status, loss of consciousness, or poor arousal and responsiveness. Of the 26 patients studied, 5 patients had electroencephalograms that showed periodic discharges consisting of high‐amplitude frontal monomorphic delta waves with absence of epileptic activity. These findings may suggest central nervous system injury potentially related to COVID‐19 in these patients. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Vision Therapy: Ocular Motor Training in Mild Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25820?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Vision therapy in the form of ocular motor training is increasingly used to treat visual complaints, particularly in the setting of persistent symptoms after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). In this review, we discuss the rationale behind this intervention and the evidence for its utility. Although the efficacy of exercises for primary convergence insufficiency is plausible and supported by data, there is not yet strong evidence of benefit for the post‐traumatic variant. It is not established that abnormalities in fixation, pursuit, and saccades in mTBI are the cause of post‐concussive symptoms, or that these abnormalities arise from ocular motor damage rather than being secondary effects of cognitive problems with attention or executive control. The few studies to date have significant methodological weaknesses. More substantial evidence is required before vision therapy can be accepted as a useful tool in the rehabilitation of patients with brain trauma. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Development and Validation of Forecasting Next Reported Seizure Using e‐Diaries</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25812?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no validated methods for predicting the timing of seizures. Using machine learning, we sought to forecast 24‐hour risk of self‐reported seizure from e‐diaries.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data from 5,419 patients on &lt;a href=&quot;http://SeizureTracker.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;SeizureTracker.com&lt;/a&gt; (including seizure count, type, and duration) were split into training (3,806 patients/1,665,215 patient‐days) and testing (1,613 patients/549,588 patient‐days) sets with no overlapping patients. An artificial intelligence (AI) program, consisting of recurrent networks followed by a multilayer perceptron (“deep learning” model), was trained to produce risk forecasts. Forecasts were made from a sliding window of 3‐month diary history for each day of each patient's diary. After training, the model parameters were held constant and the testing set was scored. A rate‐matched random (RMR) forecast was compared to the AI. Comparisons were made using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), a measure of binary discrimination performance, and the Brier score, a measure of forecast calibration. The Brier skill score (BSS) measured the improvement of the AI Brier score compared to the benchmark RMR Brier score. Confidence intervals (CIs) on performance statistics were obtained via bootstrapping.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AUC was 0.86 (95% CI = 0.85–0.88) for AI and 0.83 (95% CI = 0.81–0.85) for RMR, favoring AI (&lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Overall (all patients combined), BSS was 0.27 (95% CI = 0.23–0.31), also favoring AI (&lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AI produced a valid forecast superior to a chance forecaster, and provided meaningful forecasts in the majority of patients. Future studies will be needed to quantify the clinical value of these forecasts for patients. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Neur1 and Neur2 are required for hippocampus‐dependent spatial memory and synaptic plasticity</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23247?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Neur1 &lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Neur2 &lt;/i&gt;, mouse homologs of the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila neur &lt;/i&gt; gene, consist of two neuralized homology repeat domains and a RING domain. Both &lt;i&gt;Neur1 &lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Neur2 &lt;/i&gt; are expressed in the whole adult brain and encode E3 ubiquitin ligases, which play a crucial role in the Notch signaling pathways. A previous study reported that overexpression of &lt;i&gt;Neur1 &lt;/i&gt; enhances hippocampus‐dependent memory, whereas the role of &lt;i&gt;Neur2 &lt;/i&gt; remains largely unknown. Here, we aimed to elucidate the respective roles of &lt;i&gt;Neur1 &lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Neur2 &lt;/i&gt; in hippocampus‐dependent memory using three lines of genetically modified mice: &lt;i&gt;Neur1 &lt;/i&gt; knock‐out, &lt;i&gt;Neur2 &lt;/i&gt; knock‐out, and &lt;i&gt;Neur1 &lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Neur2 &lt;/i&gt; double knock‐out (D‐KO). Our results showed that spatial memory was impaired when both &lt;i&gt;Neur1 &lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Neur2 &lt;/i&gt; were deleted, but not in the individual knock‐out of either &lt;i&gt;Neur1 &lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Neur2 &lt;/i&gt;. In addition, basal synaptic properties estimated by input–output relationships and paired‐pulse facilitation did not change, but a form of long‐term potentiation that requires protein synthesis was specifically impaired in the D‐KO mice. These results collectively suggest that &lt;i&gt;Neur1 &lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Neur2 &lt;/i&gt; are crucially involved in hippocampus‐dependent spatial memory and synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
