	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Brain dynamics for confidence-weighted learning</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/cCqNonMiEZE/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Florent Meyniel&lt;/p&gt;

Learning in a changing, uncertain environment is a difficult problem. A popular solution is to predict future observations and then use surprising outcomes to update those predictions. However, humans also have a sense of confidence that characterizes the precision of their predictions. Bayesian models use a confidence-weighting principle to regulate learning: for a given surprise, the update is smaller when the confidence about the prediction was higher. Prior behavioral evidence indicates that human learning adheres to this confidence-weighting principle. Here, we explored the human brain dynamics sub-tending the confidence-weighting of learning using magneto-encephalography (MEG). During our volatile probability learning task, subjects’ confidence reports conformed with Bayesian inference. MEG revealed several stimulus-evoked brain responses whose amplitude reflected surprise, and some of them were further shaped by confidence: surprise amplified the stimulus-evoked response whereas confidence dampened it. Confidence about predictions also modulated several aspects of the brain state: pupil-linked arousal and beta-range (15–30 Hz) oscillations. The brain state in turn modulated specific stimulus-evoked surprise responses following the confidence-weighting principle. Our results thus indicate that there exist, in the human brain, signals reflecting surprise that are dampened by confidence in a way that is appropriate for learning according to Bayesian inference. They also suggest a mechanism for confidence-weighted learning: confidence about predictions would modulate intrinsic properties of the brain state to amplify or dampen surprise responses evoked by discrepant observations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cCqNonMiEZE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Contrasting model mechanisms of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) release from damaged and necrotic hepatocytes as an example of general biomarker mechanisms</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/GPPLZ3c2lbU/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Andrew K. Smith, Glen E. P. Ropella, Mitchell R. McGill, Preethi Krishnan, Lopamudra Dutta, Ryan C. Kennedy, Hartmut Jaeschke, C. Anthony Hunt&lt;/p&gt;

Interpretations of elevated blood levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) for drug-induced liver injury often assume that the biomarker is released passively from dying cells. However, the mechanisms driving that release have not been explored experimentally. The usefulness of ALT and related biomarkers will improve by developing mechanism-based explanations of elevated levels that can be expanded and elaborated incrementally. We provide the means to challenge the ability of closely related model mechanisms to generate patterns of simulated hepatic injury and ALT release that scale (or not) to be quantitatively similar to the wet-lab validation targets, which are elevated plasma ALT values following acetaminophen (APAP) exposure in mice. We build on a published model mechanism that helps explain the generation of characteristic spatiotemporal features of APAP hepatotoxicity within hepatic lobules. Discrete event and agent-oriented software methods are most prominent. We instantiate and leverage a small constellation of concrete model mechanisms. Their details during execution help bring into focus ways in which particular sources of uncertainty become entangled with cause-effect details within and across several levels. We scale ALT amounts in virtual mice directly to target plasma ALT values in individual mice. A virtual experiment comprises a set of Monte Carlo simulations. We challenge the sufficiency of four potentially explanatory theories for ALT release. The first of the tested model theories failed to achieve the initial validation target, but each of the three others succeeded. Results for one of the three model mechanisms matched all target ALT values quantitatively. It explains how ALT externalization is the combined consequence of lobular-location-dependent drug-induced cellular damage and hepatocyte death. Falsification of one (or more) of the model mechanisms provides new knowledge and incrementally shrinks the constellation of model mechanisms. The modularity and biomimicry of our explanatory models enable seamless transition from mice to humans.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GPPLZ3c2lbU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01010</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Conventional uncertainty quantification methods usually lacks the capability
of dealing with high-dimensional problems due to the curse of dimensionality.
This paper presents a semi-supervised learning framework for dimension
reduction and reliability analysis. An autoencoder is first adopted for mapping
the high-dimensional space into a low-dimensional latent space, which contains
a distinguishable failure surface. Then a deep feedforward neural network (DFN)
is utilized to learn the mapping relationship and reconstruct the latent space,
while the Gaussian process (GP) modeling technique is used to build the
surrogate model of the transformed limit state function. During the training
process of the DFN, the discrepancy between the actual and reconstructed latent
space is minimized through semi-supervised learning for ensuring the accuracy.
Both labeled and unlabeled samples are utilized for defining the loss function
of the DFN. Evolutionary algorithm is adopted to train the DFN, then the Monte
Carlo simulation method is used for uncertainty quantification and reliability
analysis based on the proposed framework. The effectiveness is demonstrated
through a mathematical example.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Visual world studies show that upon hearing a word in a target-absent visual
context containing related and unrelated items, toddlers and adults briefly
direct their gaze towards phonologically related items, before shifting towards
semantically and visually related ones. We present a neural network model that
processes dynamic unfolding phonological representations and maps them to
static internal semantic and visual representations. The model, trained on
representations derived from real corpora, simulates this early phonological
over semantic/visual preference. Our results support the hypothesis that
incremental unfolding of a spoken word is in itself sufficient to account for
the transient preference for phonological competitors over both unrelated and
semantically and visually related ones. Phonological representations mapped
dynamically in a bottom-up fashion to semantic-visual representations capture
the early phonological preference effects reported in a visual world task. The
semantic-visual preference observed later in such a trial does not require
top-down feedback from a semantic or visual system.

demonstrate how performance can be further improved by training an ensemble of
policy networks with shared parameters, each network conditioned on a different
autoregressive factorization order. On the NASBench-101 search space, it
outperforms most algorithms in the literature, including random search. In
particular, it outperforms RL methods based on policy gradients that use
alternate architectures to specify the policy network, underscoring the

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Semantic segmentation by convolutional neural networks (CNN) has advanced the
state of the art in pixel-level classification of remote sensing images.
However, processing large images typically requires analyzing the image in
small patches, and hence features that have large spatial extent still cause
challenges in tasks such as cloud masking. To support a wider scale of spatial
features while simultaneously reducing computational requirements for large
satellite images, we propose an architecture of two cascaded CNN model
components successively processing undersampled and full resolution images. The
first component distinguishes between patches in the inner cloud area from
patches at the cloud's boundary region. For the cloud-ambiguous edge patches
requiring further segmentation, the framework then delegates computation to a
fine-grained model component. We apply the architecture to a cloud detection
dataset of complete Sentinel-2 multispectral images, approximately annotated
for minimal false negatives in a land use application. On this specific task
and data, we achieve a 16\% relative improvement in pixel accuracy over a CNN
baseline based on patching.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This paper proposes a data-driven distributed voltage control approach based
on the spectrum clustering and the enhanced multi-agent deep reinforcement
learning (MADRL) algorithm. Via the unsupervised clustering, the whole
distribution system can be decomposed into several sub-networks according to
the voltage and reactive power sensitivity. Then, the distributed control
problem of each sub-network is modeled as Markov games and solved by the
enhanced MADRL algorithm, where each sub-network is modeled as an adaptive
agent. Deep neural networks are used in each agent to approximate the policy
function and the action value function. All agents are centrally trained to
learn the optimal coordinated voltage regulation strategy while executed in a
distributed manner to make decisions based on only local information. The
proposed method can significantly reduce the requirements of communications and
knowledge of system parameters. It also effectively deals with uncertainties
and can provide online coordinated control based on the latest local
information. Comparison results with other existing model-based and data-driven

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00544</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This paper proposes a data-driven approach for optimal power flow (OPF) based
on the stacked extreme learning machine (SELM) framework. SELM has a fast
training speed and does not require the time-consuming parameter tuning process
compared with the deep learning algorithms. However, the direct application of
SELM for OPF is not tractable due to the complicated relationship between the
system operating status and the OPF solutions. To this end, a data-driven OPF
regression framework is developed that decomposes the OPF model features into
three stages. This not only reduces the learning complexity but also helps
correct the learning bias. A sample pre-classification strategy based on active
constraint identification is also developed to achieve enhanced feature
attractions. Numerical results carried out on IEEE and Polish benchmark systems
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other alternatives. It is also
shown that the proposed method can be easily extended to address different test
systems by adjusting only a few hyperparameters.

lack comprehensive mathematical theories. For example, there are very few
statistical guarantees for learning neural networks from data, especially for
classes of estimators that are used in practice or at least similar to such. In
this paper, we develop a general statistical guarantee for estimators that
consist of a least-squares term and a regularizer. We then exemplify this
guarantee with $\ell_1$-regularization, showing that the corresponding
prediction error increases at most sub-linearly in the number of layers and at
most logarithmically in the total number of parameters. Our results establish a
mathematical basis for regularized estimation of neural networks, and they
deepen our mathematical understanding of neural networks and deep learning more

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In most network problems, the optimum behaviors of agents in the network are
not known before deployment. In addition to that, agents might be required to
adapt, i.e. change their behavior based on the environment conditions. In these
scenarios, offline optimization is usually costly and inefficient, while online
methods might be more suitable. In this work we propose a distributed embodied
evolutionary approach to optimize spatially distributed, locally interacting
agents by allowing them to exchange their behavior parameters and learn from
each other to adapt to a certain task within a given environment. Our numerical
results show that the local exchange of information, performed by means of
crossover of behavior parameters with neighbors, allows the network to converge
to the global optimum more efficiently than the cases where local interactions
are not allowed, even when there are large differences on the optimal behaviors
within a neighborhood.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: The Landscape of Matrix Factorization Revisited. (arXiv:2002.12795v2 [math.OC] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.12795</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We revisit the landscape of the simple matrix factorization problem. For
low-rank matrix factorization, prior work has shown that there exist infinitely
many critical points all of which are either global minima or strict saddles.
At a strict saddle the minimum eigenvalue of the Hessian is negative. Of
interest is whether this minimum eigenvalue is uniformly bounded below zero
over all strict saddles. To answer this we consider orbits of critical points
under the general linear group. For each orbit we identify a representative
point, called a canonical point. If a canonical point is a strict saddle, so is
every point on its orbit. We derive an expression for the minimum eigenvalue of
the Hessian at each canonical strict saddle and use this to show that the
minimum eigenvalue of the Hessian over the set of strict saddles is not
uniformly bounded below zero. We also show that a known invariance property of
gradient flow ensures the solution of gradient flow only encounters critical
points on an invariant manifold $\mathcal{M}_C$ determined by the initial
condition. We show that, in contrast to the general situation, the minimum
eigenvalue of strict saddles in $\mathcal{M}_{0}$ is uniformly bounded below
zero. We obtain an expression for this bound in terms of the singular values of
the matrix being factorized. This bound depends on the size of the nonzero
singular values and on the separation between distinct nonzero singular values
of the matrix.

studying body perception and action in a simulated and a real Nao robot.
Results show that our approach allows the robot to perform 1) dynamical body

reaching to &quot;imagined&quot; arm poses in the visual space. This suggests that robot

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Backward Feature Correction: How Deep Learning Performs Deep Learning. (arXiv:2001.04413v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04413</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;How does a 110-layer ResNet learn a high-complexity classifier using
relatively few training examples and short training time? We present a theory
towards explaining this in terms of hierarchical learning. We refer
hierarchical learning as the learner learns to represent a complicated target
function by decomposing it into a sequence of simpler functions to reduce
sample and time complexity. This paper formally analyzes how multi-layer neural
networks can perform such hierarchical learning efficiently and automatically
by applying SGD.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the conceptual side, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the FIRST
theory result indicating how deep neural networks can be sample and time
efficient on certain hierarchical learning tasks, when NO KNOWN
non-hierarchical algorithms (such as kernel method, linear regression over
feature mappings, tensor decomposition, sparse coding, and their simple
combinations) are efficient. We establish a principle called &quot;backward feature
correction&quot;, where training higher layers in the network can improve the
features of lower level ones. We believe this is the key to understand the deep
learning process in multi-layer neural networks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the technical side, we show for every input dimension $d &amp;gt; 0$, there is a
concept class consisting of degree $\omega(1)$ multi-variate polynomials so
that, using $\omega(1)$-layer neural networks as learners, SGD can learn any
target function from this class in $\mathsf{poly}(d)$ time using
$\mathsf{poly}(d)$ samples to any $\frac{1}{\mathsf{poly}(d)}$ error, through
learning to represent it as a composition of $\omega(1)$ layers of quadratic
functions. In contrast, we present lower bounds stating that several
non-hierarchical learners, including any kernel methods, neural tangent
kernels, must suffer from $d^{\omega(1)}$ sample or time complexity to learn
this concept class even to $d^{-0.01}$ error.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We analyze the efficacy of modern neuro-evolutionary strategies for
continuous control optimization. Overall, the results collected on a wide
variety of qualitatively different benchmark problems indicate that these
methods are generally effective and scale well with respect to the number of
parameters and the complexity of the problem. Moreover, they are relatively
robust with respect to the setting of hyper-parameters. The comparison of the
most promising methods indicates that the OpenAI-ES algorithm outperforms or
equals the other algorithms on all considered problems. Moreover, we
demonstrate how the reward functions optimized for reinforcement learning
methods are not necessarily effective for evolutionary strategies and vice
versa. This finding can lead to reconsideration of the relative efficacy of the
two classes of algorithm since it implies that the comparisons performed to
date are biased toward one or the other class.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Expert2Coder: Capturing Divergent Brain Regions Using Mixture of Regression Experts. (arXiv:1909.12299v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12299</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;fMRI semantic category understanding using linguistic encoding models
attempts to learn a forward mapping that relates stimuli to the corresponding
brain activation. State-of-the-art encoding models use a single global model
(linear or non-linear) to predict brain activation given the stimulus. However,
the critical assumption in these methods is that a priori different brain
regions respond the same way to all the stimuli, that is, there is no
modularity or specialization assumed for any region. This goes against the
modularity theory, supported by many cognitive neuroscience investigations
suggesting that there are functionally specialized regions in the brain. In
this paper, we achieve this by clustering similar regions together and for
every cluster we learn a different linear regression model using a mixture of
linear experts model. The key idea here is that each linear expert captures the
behaviour of similar brain regions. Given a new stimulus, the utility of the
proposed model is twofold (i) predicts the brain activation as a weighted
linear combination of the activations of multiple linear experts and (ii) to
learn multiple experts corresponding to different brain regions. We argue that
each expert captures activity patterns related to a particular region of
interest (ROI) in the human brain. This study helps in understanding the brain
regions that are activated together given different kinds of stimuli.
Importantly, we suggest that the mixture of regression experts (MoRE) framework
successfully combines the two principles of organization of function in the
brain, namely that of specialization and integration. Experiments on fMRI data
from paradigm 1 [1]where participants view linguistic stimuli show that the
proposed MoRE model has better prediction accuracy compared to that of
conventional models.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Musical scales are used throughout the world, but the question of how they
evolved remains open. Some suggest that scales based on the harmonic series are
inherently pleasant, while others propose that scales are chosen that are easy
to communicate. However, testing these theories has been hindered by the
sparseness of empirical evidence. Here, we assimilate data from diverse
ethnomusicological sources into a cross-cultural database of scales. We
generate populations of scales based on multiple theories and assess their
similarity to empirical distributions from the database. Most scales tend to
include intervals which are close in size to perfect fifths (``imperfect
fifths''), and packing arguments explain the salient features of the
distributions. Scales are also preferred if their intervals are compressible,
which may facilitate efficient communication and memory of melodies. While
scales appear to evolve according to various selection pressures, the simplest
h imperfect-fifths packing model best fits the empirical data.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10337</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;How can neural networks such as ResNet efficiently learn CIFAR-10 with test
accuracy more than 96%, while other methods, especially kernel methods, fall
relatively behind? Can we more provide theoretical justifications for this gap?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, there is an influential line of work relating neural networks to
kernels in the over-parameterized regime, proving they can learn certain
concept class that is also learnable by kernels with similar test error. Yet,
can neural networks provably learn some concept class BETTER than kernels?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We answer this positively in the distribution-free setting. We prove neural
networks can efficiently learn a notable class of functions, including those
defined by three-layer residual networks with smooth activations, without any
distributional assumption. At the same time, we prove there are simple
functions in this class such that with the same number of training examples,
the test error obtained by neural networks can be MUCH SMALLER than ANY kernel
method, including neural tangent kernels (NTK).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main intuition is that multi-layer neural networks can implicitly perform
hierarchical learning using different layers, which reduces the sample
complexity comparing to &quot;one-shot&quot; learning algorithms such as kernel methods.
In a follow-up work [2], this theory of hierarchical learning is further
strengthened to incorporate the &quot;backward feature correction&quot; process when
training deep networks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, we also prove a computation complexity advantage of ResNet with
respect to other learning methods including linear regression over arbitrary
feature mappings.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07536</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The human brain is composed of distinct regions that are each associated with
particular functions and distinct propensities for the control of neural
dynamics. However, the relation between these functions and control profiles is
poorly understood, as is the variation in this relation across diverse scales
of space and time. Here we probe the relation between control and dynamics in
brain networks constructed from diffusion tensor imaging data in a large
community based sample of young adults. Specifically, we probe the control
properties of each brain region and investigate their relationship with
dynamics across various spatial scales using the Laplacian eigenspectrum. In
addition, through analysis of regional modal controllability and partitioning
of modes, we determine whether the associated dynamics are fast or slow, as
well as whether they are alternating or monotone. We find that brain regions
that facilitate the control of energetically easy transitions are associated
with activity on short length scales and slow time scales. Conversely, brain
regions that facilitate control of difficult transitions are associated with
activity on long length scales and fast time scales. Built on linear dynamical
models, our results offer parsimonious explanations for the activity
propagation and network control profiles supported by regions of differing
neuroanatomical structure.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The fundamental learning theory behind neural networks remains largely open.
What classes of functions can neural networks actually learn? Why doesn't the
trained network overfit when it is overparameterized?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, we prove that overparameterized neural networks can learn some
notable concept classes, including two and three-layer networks with fewer
parameters and smooth activations. Moreover, the learning can be simply done by
SGD (stochastic gradient descent) or its variants in polynomial time using
polynomially many samples. The sample complexity can also be almost independent
of the number of parameters in the network.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the technique side, our analysis goes beyond the so-called NTK (neural
tangent kernel) linearization of neural networks in prior works. We establish a
new notion of quadratic approximation of the neural network (that can be viewed
as a second-order variant of NTK), and connect it to the SGD theory of escaping
saddle points.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05684</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In quantum physics there are well-known situations when measurements of the
same property in different contexts (under different conditions) have the same
probability distribution, but cannot be represented by one and the same random
variable. Such systems of random variables are called contextual. More
generally, true contextuality is observed when different contexts force
measurements of the same property (in psychology, responses to the same
question) to be more dissimilar random variables than warranted by the
difference of their distributions. The difference in distributions is itself a
form of context-dependence, but of another nature: it is attributable to direct
causal influences exerted by contexts upon the random variables. The
Contextuality-by-Default (CbD) theory allows one to separate true contextuality
from direct influences in the overall context-dependence. The CbD analysis of
numerous previous attempts to demonstrate contextuality in human judgments
shows that all context-dependence in them can be accounted for by direct
influences, with no true contextuality present. However, contextual systems in
human behavior can be found. In this paper we present a series of crowdsourcing
experiments that exhibit true contextuality in simple decision making.}{The
design of these experiments is an elaboration of one introduced in the &quot;Snow
Queen&quot; experiment (Decision 5, 193-204, 2018), where contextuality was for the
first time demonstrated unequivocally.

	<title>eLife: Dithranol targets keratinocytes, their crosstalk with neutrophils and inhibits the IL-36 inflammatory loop in psoriasis</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56991</link>
	<content:encoded>Despite the introduction of biologics, topical dithranol (anthralin) has remained one of the most effective anti-psoriatic agents. Serial biopsies from human psoriatic lesions and both the c-Jun/JunB and imiquimod psoriasis mouse model allowed us to study the therapeutic mechanism of this drug. Top differentially expressed genes in the early response to dithranol belonged to keratinocyte and epidermal differentiation pathways and IL-1 family members (i.e. &lt;i&gt;IL36RN)&lt;/i&gt; but not elements of the IL-17/IL-23 axis. In human psoriatic response to dithranol, rapid decrease in expression of keratinocyte differentiation regulators (e.g. involucrin, &lt;i&gt;SERPINB7&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;SERPINB13&lt;/i&gt;), antimicrobial peptides (e.g. ß-defensins like &lt;i&gt;DEFB4A, DEFB4B, DEFB103A,&lt;/i&gt; S100 proteins like &lt;i&gt;S100A7, S100A12&lt;/i&gt;), chemotactic factors for neutrophils (e.g. &lt;i&gt;CXCL5, CXCL8&lt;/i&gt;) and neutrophilic infiltration was followed with much delay by reduction in T cell infiltration. Targeting keratinocytes rather than immune cells may be an alternative approach in particular for topical anti-psoriatic treatment, an area with high need for new drugs.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Diverse homeostatic and immunomodulatory roles of immune cells in the developing mouse lung at single cell resolution</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56890</link>
	<content:encoded>At birth, the lungs rapidly transition from a pathogen-free, hypoxic environment to a pathogen-rich, rhythmically distended air-liquid interface. Although many studies have focused on the adult lung, the perinatal lung remains unexplored. Here, we present an atlas of the murine lung immune compartment during early postnatal development. We show that the late embryonic lung is dominated by specialized proliferative macrophages with a surprising physical interaction with the developing vasculature. These macrophages disappear after birth and are replaced by a dynamic mixture of macrophage subtypes, dendritic cells, granulocytes, and lymphocytes. Detailed characterization of macrophage diversity revealed an orchestration of distinct subpopulations across postnatal development to fill context-specific functions in tissue remodeling, angiogenesis, and immunity. These data both broaden the putative roles for immune cells in the developing lung and provide a framework for understanding how external insults alter immune cell phenotype during a period of rapid lung growth and heightened vulnerability.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Hyperalignment: Modeling shared information encoded in idiosyncratic cortical topographies</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56601</link>
	<content:encoded>Information that is shared across brains is encoded in idiosyncratic fine-scale functional topographies. Hyperalignment captures shared information by projecting pattern vectors for neural responses and connectivities into a common, high-dimensional information space, rather than by aligning topographies in a canonical anatomical space. Individual transformation matrices project information from individual anatomical spaces into the common model information space, preserving the geometry of pairwise dissimilarities between pattern vectors, and model cortical topography as mixtures of overlapping, individual-specific topographic basis functions, rather than as contiguous functional areas. The fundamental property of brain function that is preserved across brains is information content, rather than the functional properties of local features that support that content. In this Perspective, we present the conceptual framework that motivates hyperalignment, its computational underpinnings for joint modeling of a common information space and idiosyncratic cortical topographies, and discuss implications for understanding the structure of cortical functional architecture.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56159</link>
	<content:encoded>Multivalent biopolymers phase separate into membrane-less organelles (MLOs) which exhibit liquid-like behavior. Here, we explore formation of prototypical MOs from multivalent proteins on various time and length scales and show that the kinetically arrested metastable multi-droplet state is a dynamic outcome of the interplay between two competing processes: a diffusion-limited encounter between proteins, and the exhaustion of available valencies within smaller clusters. Clusters with satisfied valencies cannot coalesce readily, resulting in metastable, long-living droplets. In the regime of dense clusters akin to phase-separation, we observe co-existing assemblies, in contrast to the single, large equilibrium-like cluster. A system-spanning network encompassing all multivalent proteins was only observed at high concentrations and large interaction valencies. In the regime favoring large clusters, we observe a slow-down in the dynamics of the condensed phase, potentially resulting in loss of function. Therefore, metastability could be a hallmark of dynamic functional droplets formed by sticker-spacer proteins.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Lysosome activity is modulated by multiple longevity pathways and is                    important for lifespan extension in C. elegans</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55745</link>
	<content:encoded>Lysosomes play important roles in cellular degradation to maintain cell                    homeostasis. In order to understand whether and how lysosomes alter with age and                    contribute to lifespan regulation, we characterized multiple properties of                    lysosomes during the aging process in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;. We uncovered                    age-dependent alterations in lysosomal morphology, motility, acidity and                    degradation activity, all of which indicate a decline in lysosome function with                    age. The age-associated lysosomal changes are suppressed in the long-lived                    mutants &lt;i&gt;daf-2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;eat-2&lt;/i&gt; and                        &lt;i&gt;isp-1&lt;/i&gt;, which extend lifespan by inhibiting insulin/IGF-1                    signaling, reducing food intake and impairing mitochondrial function,                    respectively. We found that 43 lysosome genes exhibit reduced expression with                    age, including genes encoding subunits of the proton pump V-ATPase and cathepsin                    proteases. The expression of lysosome genes is upregulated in the long-lived                    mutants, and this upregulation requires the functions of DAF-16/FOXO and                    SKN-1/NRF2 transcription factors. Impairing lysosome function affects clearance                    of aggregate-prone proteins and disrupts lifespan extension in&lt;i&gt;                        daf-2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;eat-2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;isp-1&lt;/i&gt; worms. Our                    data indicate that lysosome function is modulated by multiple longevity pathways                    and is important for lifespan extension.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55470</link>
	<content:encoded>Temperature affects the conductances and kinetics of the ionic channels that underlie neuronal activity. Each membrane conductance has a different characteristic temperature sensitivity, which raises the question of how neurons and neuronal circuits can operate robustly over wide temperature ranges. To address this, we employed computational models of the pyloric network of crabs and lobsters. We produced multiple different models that exhibit a triphasic pyloric rhythm over a range of temperatures and explored the dynamics of their currents and how they change with temperature. Temperature can produce smooth changes in the relative contributions of the currents to neural activity so that neurons and networks undergo graceful transitions in the mechanisms that give rise to their activity patterns. Moreover, responses of the models to deletions of a current can be different at high and low temperatures, indicating that even a well-defined genetic or pharmacological manipulation may produce qualitatively distinct effects depending on the temperature.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54954</link>
	<content:encoded>MCL1 has critical antiapoptotic functions and its levels are tightly regulated by ubiquitylation and degradation, but mechanisms that drive this degradation, particularly in solid tumors, remain to be established. We show here in prostate cancer cells that increased NOXA, mediated by kinase inhibitor activation of an integrated stress response, drives the degradation of MCL1, and identify the mitochondria-associated ubiquitin ligase MARCH5 as the primary mediator of this NOXA-dependent MCL1 degradation. Therapies that enhance MARCH5-mediated MCL1 degradation markedly enhance apoptosis in response to a BH3 mimetic agent targeting BCLXL, which may provide for a broadly effective therapy in solid tumors. Conversely, increased MCL1 in response to MARCH5 loss does not sensitize to BH3 mimetic drugs targeting MCL1, but instead also sensitizes to BCLXL inhibition, revealing a codependence between MARCH5 and MCL1 that may also be exploited in tumors with &lt;i&gt;MARCH5&lt;/i&gt; genomic loss.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53913</link>
	<content:encoded>The fusion of gamete membranes during fertilization is an essential process for sexual reproduction. Despite its importance, only three proteins are known to be indispensable for sperm-egg membrane fusion: the sperm proteins IZUMO1 and SPACA6, and the egg protein JUNO. Here we demonstrate that another sperm protein, TMEM95, is necessary for sperm-egg interaction. TMEM95 ablation in mice caused complete male-specific infertility. Sperm lacking this protein were morphologically normal exhibited normal motility, and could penetrate the zona pellucida and bind to the oolemma. However, once bound to the oolemma, TMEM95-deficient sperm were unable to fuse with the egg membrane or penetrate into the ooplasm, and fertilization could only be achieved by mechanical injection of one sperm into the ooplasm, thereby bypassing membrane fusion. These data demonstrate that TMEM95 is essential for mammalian fertilization.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/51260</link>
	<content:encoded>Involvement of dopamine in regulating exploration during decision-making has long been hypothesized, but direct causal evidence in humans is still lacking. Here, we use a combination of computational modeling, pharmacological intervention and functional magnetic resonance imaging to address this issue. Thirty-one healthy male participants performed a restless four-armed bandit task in a within-subjects design under three drug conditions: 150 mg of the dopamine precursor L-dopa, 2 mg of the D2 receptor antagonist haloperidol, and placebo. Choices were best explained by an extension of an established Bayesian learning model accounting for perseveration, directed exploration and random exploration. Modeling revealed attenuated directed exploration under L-dopa, while neural signatures of exploration, exploitation and prediction error were unaffected. Instead, L-dopa attenuated neural representations of overall uncertainty in insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Our results highlight the computational role of these regions in exploration and suggest that dopamine modulates how this circuit tracks accumulating uncertainty during decision-making.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Shear stress activates ADAM10 sheddase to regulate Notch1 via the Piezo1 force sensor in endothelial cells</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/50684</link>
	<content:encoded>Mechanical force is a determinant of Notch signalling but the mechanism of force detection and its coupling to Notch are unclear. We propose a role for Piezo1 channels, which are mechanically-activated non-selective cation channels. In cultured microvascular endothelial cells, Piezo1 channel activation by either shear stress or a chemical agonist Yoda1 activated a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10 (ADAM10), a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-regulated transmembrane sheddase that mediates S2 Notch1 cleavage. Consistent with this observation, we found Piezo1-dependent increase in the abundance of Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD) that depended on ADAM10 and the downstream S3 cleavage enzyme, g-secretase. Conditional endothelial-specific disruption of Piezo1 in adult mice suppressed the expression of multiple Notch1 target genes in hepatic vasculature, suggesting constitutive functional importance in vivo. The data suggest that Piezo1 is a mechanism conferring force sensitivity on ADAM10 and Notch1 with downstream consequences for sustained activation of Notch1 target genes and potentially other processes.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.01.127753v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Animals rely on multiple sensory information systems to make decisions. The integration of information stemming from these systems is believed to result in a precise behavioural output. To what degree a single sensory system may override the others is unknown. Evidence for a hierarchical use of different systems to guide navigation is lacking. We used Drosophila melanogaster to investigate whether, in order to relieve an unpleasant stimulation, fruit flies employed an idiothetically-based local search strategy before making use of visual information, or viceversa. Fruit flies appear to initially resort to idiothetic information and only later, if the first strategy proves unsuccessful to relieve the unpleasant stimulation, make use of other information, such as visual cues. By leveraging on this innate preference for a hierarchical use of one strategy over another, we believe that in vivo recordings of brain activity during the navigation of fruit flies could provide mechanistic insights into how simultaneous information from multiple sensory modalities is evaluated, integrated, and motor responses elicited, thus shedding new light on the neural basis of decision-making.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.01.127688v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Functional connectivity (FC) analyses of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have established robust alterations of brain connectivity at the group level. Yet, the translation of these imaging findings into robust markers of individual risk is hampered by the extensive heterogeneity among ASD individuals. Here, we report an FC endophenotype that confers a greater than 7-fold risk increase of ASD diagnosis, yet is still identified in an estimated 1 in 200 individuals in the general population. By focusing on a subset of individuals with ASD and highly predictive FC alterations, we achieved a greater than 3-fold increase in risk over previous predictive models. The identified FC risk endophenotype was characterized by underconnectivity of transmodal brain networks and generalized to independent data. Our results demonstrate the ability of a highly targeted prediction model to meaningfully decompose part of the heterogeneity of the autism spectrum. The identified FC signature may help better delineate the multitude of etiological pathways and behavioural symptoms that challenge our understanding of the autism spectrum.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Patterns of multisensory facilitation distinguish peripersonal from reaching space</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.01.127282v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Peripersonal space is a multisensory representation of the space near body parts facilitating interactions with the close environment. Studies on non-human and human primates converge in showing that peripersonal space (PPS) is a body-part-centred representation that guides actions. Because of these characteristics, growing confusion conflates peripersonal and arm-reaching space (ARS) that is the space one's arm can reach. Despite neuroanatomical evidence favors their distinction, whether PPS and ARS tap into different spatial representations remains poorly understood. Here, in five experiments we found that PPS differs from ARS in male and female human participants (N = 120), as evidenced both by their performance and the modeling of their multisensory facilitation. We mapped multisensory facilitation in detecting touches at the hand, placed in different locations radially within ARS. Results showed that 1) PPS is smaller than ARS; 2) multivariate modeling of spatial patterns of multisensory facilitation predicts well the position of the participants' hand within ARS; 3) multisensory facilitation maps shift according to changes of hand position, revealing hand-centred coding of PPS, but not ARS; and 4) cross-correlation analyses highlight isomorphic multisensory facilitation maps across hand positions, suggesting their functional similarity to the receptive fields of monkeys' multisensory neurons. In sharp contrast, ARS mapping produced undistinguishable patterns across hand positions, cross-validating the conclusion that PPS and ARS are distinct. These findings call for a refinement of theoretical models of PPS and ARS, which are relevant in constructs as diverse as action and self representation, (social) interpersonal distance, brain-machine interfaces and neuroprosthetics.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.01.127183v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Deletion of SCN9A encoding the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.7 in humans leads to profound pain insensitivity and anosmia. Conditional deletion of NaV1.7 in sensory neurons of mice also abolishes pain suggesting the locus of analgesia is the nociceptor. Here we demonstrate that NaV1.7 knockout mice have essentially normal nociceptor activity using in vivo calcium imaging and extracellular recording. However, glutamate and substance P release from nociceptor central terminals in the spinal cord is greatly reduced by an opioid-dependent mechanism. Analgesia is also substantially reversed by central but not peripheral application of opioid antagonists. In contrast, the lack of neurotransmitter release from olfactory sensory neurons is opioid-independent. Male and female humans with NaV1.7 null mutations show naloxone reversible analgesia. Thus opioid-dependent inhibition of neurotransmitter release is the principal mechanism of NaV1.7 null analgesia in mice and humans.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.01.126375v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Deep learning has shown promise for predicting glioma molecular profiles using MR images. Before clinical implementation, ensuring robustness to real-world problems, such as patient motion, is crucial. We sought to evaluate the effects of motion artifact on glioma marker classifier performance and develop a deep learning motion correction network to restore classification accuracies. T2w images and molecular information were retrieved from the TCIA and TCGA databases. Three-fold cross-validation was used to train and test the motion correction network on artifact-corrupted images. We then compared the performance of three glioma marker classifiers (IDH mutation, 1p/19q codeletion, and MGMT methylation) using motion-corrupted and motion-corrected images. Glioma marker classifier performance decreased markedly with increasing motion corruption. Applying motion correction effectively restored classification accuracy for even the most motion-corrupted images. Robust motion correction can enable high accuracy in deep learning MRI-based molecular marker classification rivaling tissue-based characterization.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Although the neural processing of chromatic and spatial features is intertwined, it is unknown how consistent this spatio-chromatic coding is across different brains. In this fMRI study we predicted the color a person was seeing using a classifier that has never been trained on chromatic responses from that same brain, solely by taking into account: (1) chromatic responses in other individuals' brains and (2) commonalities between spatial coding in brains used for training and the test brain. Fitting shared response models to fMRI responses elicited by spatially defined and achromatic retinotopic mapping stimuli, we transformed subject-specific color responses to a common functional space. In this space we successfully decoded color across observers based on activity patterns in V1-V3, hV4 and LO1. Examining classification weights, we found that systematic large-scale retinotopic biases for the different colors may explain at least partially the observed agreement of neural color coding between brains.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.29.115782v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background Mutations in parkin are the most common cause of early onset Parkinsons disease. Parkin is an E3 ubiquitin ligase, functioning in mitophagy. Mitochondrial abnormalities are present in parkin mutant models. Patient derived neurons are a promising model in which to study pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic targets. Here we generate induced neuronal progenitor cells from parkin mutant patient fibroblasts with a high dopaminergic neuron yield. We reveal changing mitochondrial phenotypes as neurons undergo a metabolic switch during differentiation. Methods Fibroblasts from 4 controls and 4 parkin mutant patients were transformed into induced neuronal progenitor cells and subsequently differentiated into dopaminergic neurons. Mitochondrial morphology, function and mitophagy were evaluated using live cell fluorescent imaging, cellular ATP and reactive oxygen species production quantification. Results Direct conversion of control and parkin mutant patient fibroblasts results in induced neuronal progenitor and their differentiation yields high percentage of dopaminergic neurons. We were able to observe changing mitochondrial phenotypes as neurons undergo a metabolic switch during differentiation. Our results show that when pre-neurons are glycolytic early in differentiation mitophagy is unimpaired by PRKN deficiency. However as neurons become oxidative phosphorylation dependent, mitophagy is severely impaired in the PRKN mutant patient neurons. These changes correlate with changes in mitochondrial function and morphology; resulting in lower neuron yield and altered neuronal morphology. Conclusions Induced neuronal progenitor cell conversion can produce a high yield of dopaminergic neurons. The mitochondrial phenotype, including mitophagy status, is highly dependent on the metabolic status of the cell. Only when neurons are oxidative phosphorylation reliant the extent of mitochondrial abnormalities are identified. These data provide insight into cell specific effects of PRKN mutations, in particular in relation to mitophagy dependent disease phenotypes and provide avenues for alternative therapeutic approaches.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The cellular architecture of the ventral tegmental area (VTA), the main hub of the brain reward system, remains only partially characterized. To extend the characterization to inhibitory neurons, we have identified three distinct subtypes of somatostatin (Sst)-expressing neurons in the mouse VTA. These neurons differ in their electrophysiological and morphological properties, anatomical localization, as well as mRNA expression profiles. Importantly, similar to cortical Sst-containing interneurons, most VTA Sst neurons express GABAergic inhibitory markers, but some of them also express glutamatergic excitatory markers and a subpopulation even express dopaminergic markers. Furthermore, only some of the proposed marker genes for cortical Sst neurons were expressed in the VTA Sst neurons. Physiologically, one of the VTA Sst neuron subtypes locally inhibited neighboring dopamine neurons. Overall, our results demonstrate the remarkable complexity and heterogeneity of VTA Sst neurons and suggest that these cells are multifunctional players in the midbrain reward circuitry.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>In this paper, we present the results of a study to determine the effect of the p-300 BCI based Virtual Reality game on the cognitive functions of healthy human subjects. This study is a part of on-going research related to evaluation of the the long-term effect of P300 training in Virtual Reality surrounding (VR game) on the cognitive performance of the young healthy population. A comparison of results between 3 groups of participants (15 people each) revealed the progressing difference in cognitive assessment for experimental group played P300-BCI VR game, showing the positive increase in flanker and conjunction visual search task performance associated with selective attention and mental inhibition. We show that the effect is due to the use of P300-BCI paradigm. Our results suggest that P300 BCI games combined with virtual reality can not only be used for rehabilitation in patients with slight mental disorders or elderly, but for increasing some cognitive functions in healthy subjects, giving an additional improvement in learning in case of combination with possible educational tasks or used for attention training

	<content:encoded>The hippocampus and associated cholinergic inputs regulate spatial memory in rodents. Muscarinic blockade with scopolamine results in cognition deficits usually attributed to impaired memory encoding, but effects on memory retrieval are controversial. Here, we simultaneously recorded hundreds of neurons in mouse hippocampal CA1 using calcium imaging with a miniatured fluorescent microscope to study place cell and ensemble neuronal properties in a linear track environment. We found decoding accuracy and ensemble stability were significantly reduced after the administration of scopolamine. Several other parameters including the Ca2+ event rate, number of total cells and place cells observed, spatial information content were affected including a small increase in running speed. This study enhances the understanding of cholinergic blockade on spatial memory impairment.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The onset and prevalence of motor and psychiatric symptoms in Huntingtons disease</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.26.116798v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>BackgroundHuntingtons disease is characterised by a range of motor, psychiatric and cognitive symptoms. These present in different combinations through the disease course and impact on daily life and functioning. Huntingtons disease is caused by a dominant CAG repeat expansion in the HTT gene, and longer repeats are associated with earlier onset of motor symptoms.

ObjectivesTo investigate the onset, prevalence and functional impact of motor and psychiatric symptoms of Huntingtons disease.

MethodsWe analysed clinical phenotype data from the European REGISTRY study for 6316 individuals with manifest Huntingtons disease. Onset and prevalence data for motor and psychiatric symptoms were extracted from the clinical history part of REGISTRY and the detailed Clinical Characteristics Questionnaire. Generalised linear models were constructed to assess relationships between symptoms and functional outcomes.

ResultsAs age at first presentation of Huntingtons disease increases, the likelihood that the initial presenting symptom is motor also increases. This is not associated with pathogenic CAG repeat length. At a population level there were conserved relationships between symptoms across different repeat lengths, with depression often occurring early followed by motor and then cognitive symptoms. There were significant relationships between all individual psychiatric and cognitive symptoms and reduced functional capacity.

ConclusionsThere are conserved patterns of symptoms in HD that can be quantified. Psychiatric and behavioural symptoms significantly impair daily functioning and should be considered part of the disease trajectory at any age.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Realistic modeling of mesoscopic ephaptic coupling in the human brain</title>

Several decades of research suggest that weak electric fields may influence neural processing, including those induced by neuronal activity and proposed as a substrate for a potential new cellular communication system, i.e., ephaptic transmission. Here we aim to model mesoscopic ephaptic activity in the human brain and explore its trajectory during aging by characterizing the electric field generated by cortical dipoles using realistic finite element modeling. Extrapolating from electrophysiological measurements, we first observe that modeled endogenous field magnitudes are comparable to those in measurements of weak but functionally relevant self-generated fields and to those produced by noninvasive transcranial brain stimulation, and therefore possibly able to modulate neuronal activity. Then, to evaluate the role of these fields in the human cortex in large MRI databases, we adapt an interaction approximation that considers the relative orientation of neuron and field to estimate the membrane potential perturbation in pyramidal cells. We use this approximation to define a simplified metric (EMOD1) that weights dipole coupling as a function of distance and relative orientation between emitter and receiver and evaluate it in a sample of 401 realistic human brain models from healthy subjects aged 16–83. Results reveal that ephaptic coupling, in the simplified mesoscopic modeling approach used here, significantly decreases with age, with higher involvement of sensorimotor regions and medial brain structures. This study suggests that by providing the means for fast and direct interaction between neurons, ephaptic modulation may contribute to the complexity of human function for cognition and behavior, and its modification across the lifespan and in response to pathology.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qqipGVcY2wg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Two-step mechanism of J-domain action in driving Hsp70 function</title>

J-domain proteins (JDPs), obligatory Hsp70 cochaperones, play critical roles in protein homeostasis. They promote key allosteric transitions that stabilize Hsp70 interaction with substrate polypeptides upon hydrolysis of its bound ATP. Although a recent crystal structure revealed the physical mode of interaction between a J-domain and an Hsp70, the structural and dynamic consequences of J-domain action once bound and how Hsp70s discriminate among its multiple JDP partners remain enigmatic. We combined free energy simulations, biochemical assays and evolutionary analyses to address these issues. Our results indicate that the invariant aspartate of the J-domain perturbs a conserved intramolecular Hsp70 network of contacts that crosses domains. This perturbation leads to destabilization of the domain-domain interface—thereby promoting the allosteric transition that triggers ATP hydrolysis. While this mechanistic step is driven by conserved residues, evolutionarily variable residues are key to initial JDP/Hsp70 recognition—via electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged surfaces. We speculate that these variable residues allow an Hsp70 to discriminate amongst JDP partners, as many of them have coevolved. Together, our data points to a two-step mode of J-domain action, a recognition stage followed by a mechanistic stage.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QKhvBg2Ay6I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Modelling the effects of ephaptic coupling on selectivity and response patterns during artificial stimulation of peripheral nerves</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/9LYYJGiFpOs/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Miguel Capllonch-Juan, Francisco Sepulveda&lt;/p&gt;

Artificial electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves for sensory feedback restoration can greatly benefit from computational models for simulation-based neural implant design in order to reduce the trial-and-error approach usually taken, thus potentially significantly reducing research and development costs and time. To this end, we built a computational model of a peripheral nerve trunk in which the interstitial space between the fibers and the tissues was modelled using a resistor network, thus enabling distance-dependent ephaptic coupling between myelinated axons and between fascicles as well. We used the model to simulate a) the stimulation of a nerve trunk model with a cuff electrode, and b) the propagation of action potentials along the axons. Results were used to investigate the effect of ephaptic interactions on recruitment and selectivity stemming from artificial (i.e., neural implant) stimulation and on the relative timing between action potentials during propagation. Ephaptic coupling was found to increase the number of fibers that are activated by artificial stimulation, thus reducing the artificial currents required for axonal recruitment, and it was found to reduce and shift the range of optimal stimulation amplitudes for maximum inter-fascicular selectivity. During propagation, while fibers of similar diameters tended to lock their action potentials and reduce their conduction velocities, as expected from previous knowledge on bundles of identical axons, the presence of many other fibers of different diameters was found to make their interactions weaker and unstable.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9LYYJGiFpOs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

We study the pathogenesis of &lt;i&gt;Francisella tularensis&lt;/i&gt; infection with an experimental mouse model, agent-based computation and mathematical analysis. Following inhalational exposure to &lt;i&gt;Francisella tularensis&lt;/i&gt; SCHU S4, a small initial number of bacteria enter lung host cells and proliferate inside them, eventually destroying the host cell and releasing numerous copies that infect other cells. Our analysis of disease progression is based on a stochastic model of a population of infectious agents inside one host cell, extending the birth-and-death process by the occurrence of catastrophes: cell rupture events that affect all bacteria in a cell simultaneously. Closed expressions are obtained for the survival function of an infected cell, the number of bacteria released as a function of time after infection, and the total bacterial load. We compare our mathematical analysis with the results of agent-based computation and, making use of approximate Bayesian statistical inference, with experimental measurements carried out after murine aerosol infection with the virulent SCHU S4 strain of the bacterium &lt;i&gt;Francisella tularensis&lt;/i&gt;, that infects alveolar macrophages. The posterior distribution of the rate of replication of intracellular bacteria is consistent with the estimate that the time between rounds of bacterial division is less than 6 hours &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4LaLP1GtotU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Linking skeletal muscle aging with osteoporosis by lamin A/C deficiency</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/orKeAPv1UCs/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Lei Xiong, Kai Zhao, Yu Cao, Hao-Han Guo, Jin-Xiu Pan, Xiao Yang, Xiao Ren, Lin Mei, Wen-Cheng Xiong&lt;/p&gt;

The nuclear lamina protein lamin A/C is a key component of the nuclear envelope. Mutations in the lamin A/C gene (&lt;i&gt;LMNA&lt;/i&gt;) are identified in patients with various types of laminopathy-containing diseases, which have features of accelerated aging and osteoporosis. However, the underlying mechanisms for laminopathy-associated osteoporosis remain largely unclear. Here, we provide evidence that loss of lamin A/C in skeletal muscles, but not osteoblast (OB)-lineage cells, results in not only muscle aging–like deficit but also trabecular bone loss, a feature of osteoporosis. The latter is due in large part to elevated bone resorption. Further cellular studies show an increase of osteoclast (OC) differentiation in cocultures of bone marrow macrophages/monocytes (BMMs) and OBs after treatment with the conditioned medium (CM) from lamin A/C–deficient muscle cells. Antibody array screening analysis of the CM proteins identifies interleukin (IL)-6, whose expression is markedly increased in lamin A/C–deficient muscles. Inhibition of IL-6 by its blocking antibody in BMM-OB cocultures diminishes the increase of osteoclastogenesis. Knockout (KO) of IL-6 in muscle lamin A/C–KO mice diminishes the deficits in trabecular bone mass but not muscle. Further mechanistic studies reveal an elevation of cellular senescence marked by senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-β-gal), p16&lt;sup&gt;Ink4a&lt;/sup&gt;, and p53 in lamin A/C–deficient muscles and C2C12 muscle cells, and the p16&lt;sup&gt;Ink4a&lt;/sup&gt; may induce senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and IL-6 expression. Taken together, these results suggest a critical role for skeletal muscle lamin A/C to prevent cellular senescence, IL-6 expression, hyperosteoclastogenesis, and trabecular bone loss, uncovering a pathological mechanism underlying the link between muscle aging/senescence and osteoporosis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/orKeAPv1UCs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Data-driven research in biomedical science requires structured, computable data. Increasingly, these data are created with support from automated text mining. Text-mining tools have rapidly matured: although not perfect, they now frequently provide outstanding results. We describe 10 straightforward writing tips—and a web tool, PubReCheck—guiding authors to help address the most common cases that remain difficult for text-mining tools. We anticipate these guides will help authors’ work be found more readily and used more widely, ultimately increasing the impact of their work and the overall benefit to both authors and readers.

&lt;p&gt;Early life stress (ELS) induces long‐lasting social behavior deficits. We used chemogenetics to manipulate activity in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), which undergoes maturation during the early postnatal period. Altering BNST activity in adulthood produced divergent effects on social behavior that were dependent upon history of ELS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trauma during critical periods of development can induce long‐lasting adverse effects. To study neural aberrations resulting from early life stress (ELS), many studies utilize rodent maternal separation, whereby pups are intermittently deprived of maternal care necessary for proper development. This can produce adulthood behavioral deficits related to anxiety, reward, and social behavior. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) encodes aspects of anxiety‐like and social behaviors, and also undergoes developmental maturation during the early postnatal period, rendering it vulnerable to effects of ELS. Mice underwent maternal separation (separation 4 hr/day during postnatal day (PD)2–5 and 8 hr/day on PD6‐16) with early weaning on PD17, which induced behavioral deficits in adulthood performance on two‐part social interaction task designed to test social motivation (choice between a same‐sex novel conspecific or an empty cup) and social novelty preference (choice between the original‐novel conspecific vs. a new‐novel conspecific). We used chemogenetics to non‐selectively silence or activate neurons in the BNST to examine its role in social motivation and social novelty preference, in mice with or without the history of ELS. Manipulation of BNST produced differing social behavior effects in non‐stressed versus ELS mice; social motivation was decreased in non‐stressed mice following BNST activation, but unchanged following BNST silencing, while ELS mice showed no change in social behavior after BNST activation, but exhibited enhancement of social motivation—for which they were deficient prior—following BNST silencing. Findings emphasize the BNST as a potential therapeutic target for social anxiety disorders instigated by childhood trauma.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;h2&gt;Graphical Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we present methods for guided volume reconstruction of serial section animal brain histology with an evaluation of registration accuracy. Using methods derived from diffeomorphometry, we quantify the 3D distortion caused by two steps in the histology tissue processing pipeline: (a) reassembly of tape‐transfer assisted histology sections and (b) tissue perfusion and fixation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whole brain neuroanatomy using tera‐voxel light‐microscopic data sets is of much current interest. A fundamental problem in this field is the mapping of individual brain data sets to a reference space. Previous work has not rigorously quantified in‐vivo to ex‐vivo distortions in brain geometry from tissue processing. Further, existing approaches focus on registering unimodal volumetric data; however, given the increasing interest in the marmoset model for neuroscience research and the importance of addressing individual brain architecture variations, new algorithms are necessary to cross‐register multimodal data sets including MRIs and multiple histological series. Here we present a computational approach for same‐subject multimodal MRI‐guided reconstruction of a series of consecutive histological sections, jointly with diffeomorphic mapping to a reference atlas. We quantify the scale change during different stages of brain histological processing using the Jacobian determinant of the diffeomorphic transformations involved. By mapping the final image stacks to the ex‐vivo post‐fixation MRI, we show that (a) tape‐transfer assisted histological sections can be reassembled accurately into 3D volumes with a local scale change of 2.0 ± 0.4% per axis dimension; in contrast, (b) tissue perfusion/fixation as assessed by mapping the in‐vivo MRIs to the ex‐vivo post fixation MRIs shows a larger median absolute scale change of 6.9 ± 2.1% per axis dimension. This is the first systematic quantification of local metric distortions associated with whole‐brain histological processing, and we expect that the results will generalize to other species. These local scale changes will be important for computing local properties to create reference brain maps.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;This review in memoriam of Jack Pettigrew provides an overview of research into the phenomenon of perceptual rivalry, across a wide variety of species including insects, fish, reptiles, and primates. Perceptual rivalry is characterized by spontaneous alternations in perceptual state in response to ambiguous or conflicting sensory input.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review in memoriam of Jack Pettigrew provides an overview of past and current research into the phenomenon of multistable perception across multiple animal species. Multistable perception is characterized by two or more perceptual interpretations spontaneously alternating, or rivaling, when animals are exposed to stimuli with inherent sensory ambiguity. There is a wide array of ambiguous stimuli across sensory modalities, ranging from the configural changes observed in simple line drawings, such as the famous Necker cube, to the alternating perception of entire visual scenes that can be instigated by interocular conflict. The latter phenomenon, called binocular rivalry, in particular caught the attention of the late Jack Pettigrew, who combined his interest in the neuronal basis of perception with a unique comparative biological approach that considered ambiguous sensation as a fundamental problem of sensory systems that has shaped the brain throughout evolution. Here, we examine the research findings on visual perceptual alternation and suppression in a wide variety of species including insects, fish, reptiles, and primates. We highlight several interesting commonalities across species and behavioral indicators of perceptual alternation. In addition, we show how the comparative approach provides new avenues for understanding how the brain suppresses opposing sensory signals and generates alternations in perceptual dominance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;h2&gt;Graphical Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the geniculocortical pathway which interconnects only between the lateral geniculate nucleus and primary visual cortex (V1), the pulvinar has long been known to interconnect with most if not all of visual cortex. Here we show that pulvinar interconnectivity is actually more dominant with higher visual cortex (V2) than with V1. Thus, the pulvinocortical pathway does not likely play as big a role in directly modulating V1 activity as previously thought.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extrageniculate visual pathway, which carries visual information from the retina through the superficial layers of the superior colliculus and the pulvinar, is poorly understood. The pulvinar is thought to modulate information flow between cortical areas, and has been implicated in cognitive tasks like directing visually guided actions. In order to better understand the underlying circuitry, we performed retrograde injections of modified rabies virus in the visual cortex and pulvinar of the Long‐Evans rat. We found a relatively small population of cells projecting to primary visual cortex (V1), compared to a much larger population projecting to higher visual cortex. Reciprocal corticothalamic projections showed a similar result, implying that pulvinar does not play as big a role in directly modulating rodent V1 activity as previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;In the resting‐state functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we used a Granger causality analysis (GCA) to identify direction of information flow and whether the impact of that flow was excitatory or inhibitory of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in patients with obsessive‐compulsive disorder (OCD). Results showed decreased amplitude of low‐frequency fluctuation in left pregenual ACC (pACC) in patients than controls. There was significantly decreased excitatory output from the left pACC to both right dorsal superior frontal gyrus (dSFG) and left precuneus in patients compared with controls. Patients also had decreased inhibitory input to left pACC from left ventral SFG and left thalamus and caudate relative to controls. In patients, path coefficients of GCA from left pACC to right dSFG showed significant negative correlations with obsession and anxiety ratings. Decreased spontaneous neural activity and altered effective connectivity of pACC with widely distributed cortical circuitry, and associations with clinical ratings highlight the importance of pACC functional alteration in OCD.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disabling neuropsychiatric disorder whose neurobiological basis remains unclear. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have reported functional and structural alterations of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in OCD. In this study, we explored the functional activity of subregions of the ACC and effective connectivity (EC) between ACC subregions and the whole brain in OCD. We used a Granger causality analysis (GCA) to identify the direction of information flow and whether the impact of that flow was excitatory or inhibitory. We performed resting‐state functional MRI in 31 patients with OCD and 36 healthy controls and analyzed the amplitude of low‐frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and coefficient‐based GCA. The left pregenual ACC (pACC) in patients with OCD showed decreased ALFF relative to controls. There was significantly decreased excitatory output from the left pACC to both right dorsal superior frontal gyrus (dSFG) and left precuneus in patients compared with controls. Patients also had decreased inhibitory input to left pACC from left ventral SFG and left thalamus and caudate relative to controls. Results were similar in drug‐naive patients and those with prior but not current psychopharmacological treatment. In patients, path coefficients of GCA from left pACC to right dSFG showed significant negative correlations with obsession and anxiety ratings. Decreased spontaneous neural activity and altered EC of pACC with widely distributed cortical circuitry, and associations with clinical ratings highlight the importance of pACC functional alteration in OCD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voltage‐gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;) channels are crucial for neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission upon depolarization. Their properties &lt;i&gt;in vivo &lt;/i&gt; are modulated by their interaction with a variety of scaffolding proteins. Such interactions can influence the function and localization of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; channels, as well as their coupling to intracellular second messengers and regulatory pathways, thus amplifying their signaling potential. Among these scaffolding proteins, a subset of PDZ (postsynaptic density‐95, Drosophila discs‐large, and zona occludens)‐domain containing proteins play diverse roles in modulating Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; channel properties. At the presynaptic terminal, PDZ proteins enrich Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; channels in the active zone, enabling neurotransmitter release by maintaining a tight and vital link between channels and vesicles. In the postsynaptic density, these interactions are essential in regulating dendritic spine morphology and postsynaptic signaling cascades. In this review, we highlight the studies that demonstrate dynamic regulations of neuronal Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; channels by PDZ proteins. We discuss the role of PDZ proteins in controlling channel activity, regulating channel cell surface density, and influencing channel‐mediated downstream signaling events. We highlight the importance of PDZ protein regulations of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; channels and evaluate the link between this regulatory effect and human disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Localizing the seizure onset zone by comparing patient postictal hypoperfusion to healthy controls&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/98ceea7d-9406-438a-9530-325bb5e5fcea/jnr24646-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We compared post‐ictal hypoperfusion ASL MRI data in epilepsy patients to healthy controls to determine the location of the seizure onset zone (SOZ). This comparison identified the clinically suspected SOZ in 59% of patients. These findings matched our previous subtraction ASL MRI study (Gaxiola‐Valdez et al., 2017).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI can provide seizure onset zone (SOZ) localizing information in up to 80% of patients. Clinical implementation of this technique is limited by the need to obtain two scans per patient: a postictal scan that is subtracted from an interictal scan. We aimed to determine whether it is possible to limit the number of ASL scans to one per patient by comparing patient postictal ASL scans to baseline scans of 100 healthy controls. Eighteen patients aged 20–55 years underwent ASL MRI &amp;lt;90 min after a seizure and during the interictal period. Each postictal cerebral blood flow (CBF) map was statistically compared to average baseline CBF maps from 100 healthy controls (pvcASL; patient postictal CBF vs. control baseline CBF). The pvcASL maps were compared to subtraction ASL maps (sASL; patient baseline CBF minus patient postictal CBF). Postictal CBF reductions from pvcASL and sASL maps were seen in 17 of 18 (94.4%) and 14 of 18 (77.8%) patients, respectively. Maximal postictal hypoperfusion seen in pvcASL and sASL maps was concordant with the SOZ in 10 of 17 (59%) and 12 of 14 (86%) patients, respectively. In seven patients, both pvcASL and sASL maps showed similar results. In two patients, sASL showed no significant hypoperfusion, while pvcASL showed significant hypoperfusion concordant with the SOZ. We conclude that pvcASL is clinically useful and although it may have a lower overall concordance rate than sASL, pvcASL does provide localizing or lateralizing information for specific cases that would be otherwise missed through sASL.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Noise appears in the brain due to various sources, such as ionic channel
fluctuations and synaptic events. They affect the activities of the brain and
influence neuron action potentials. Stochastic differential equations have been
used to model firing patterns of neurons subject to noise. In this work, we
consider perturbing noise in the adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire (AEIF)
neuron. The AEIF is a two-dimensional model that describes different neuronal
firing patterns by varying its parameters. Noise is added in the equation
related to the membrane potential. We show that a noise current can induce
continuous and noncontinuous transitions in neuronal interspike intervals.
Moreover, we show that the noncontinuous transition occurs mainly for
parameters close to the border between tonic spiking and burst activities of
the neuron without noise.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Band power modulation through intracranial EEG stimulation and its cross-session consistency. (arXiv:2005.14258v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14258</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Direct electrical stimulation of the brain through intracranial
electrodes is currently used to probe the epileptic brain as part of
pre-surgical evaluation, and it is also being considered for therapeutic
treatments through neuromodulation. It is still unknown, however, how
consistent intracranial direct electrical stimulation responses are across
sessions, to allow effective neuromodulation design.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objective: To investigate the cross-session consistency of the
electrophysiological effect of electrical stimulation delivered through
intracranial EEG.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methods: We analysed data from 79 epilepsy patients implanted with
intracranial EEG who underwent brain stimulation as part of a memory
experiment. We quantified the effect of stimulation in terms of band power
modulation and compared this effect from session to session. As a reference, we
applied the same measures during baseline periods.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results: In most sessions, the effect of stimulation on band power could not
be distinguished from baseline fluctuations of band power. Stimulation effect
was also not consistent across sessions; only a third of the session pairs had
a higher consistency than the baseline standards. Cross-session consistency is
mainly associated with the strength of positive stimulation effects, and it
also tends to be higher when the baseline conditions are more similar between
sessions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: These findings can inform our practices for designing
neuromodulation with greater efficacy when using direct electrical brain
stimulation as a therapeutic treatment.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We show that neural networks trained by evolutionary reinforcement learning
can enact efficient molecular self-assembly protocols. Presented with molecular
simulation trajectories, networks learn to change temperature and chemical
potential in order to promote the assembly of desired structures or choose
between competing polymorphs. In the first case, networks reproduce in a
qualitative sense the results of previously-known protocols, but faster and
with higher fidelity; in the second case they identify strategies previously
unknown, from which we can extract physical insight. Networks that take as
input the elapsed time of the simulation or microscopic information from the
system are both effective, the latter more so. The evolutionary scheme we have
used is simple to implement and can be applied to a broad range of examples of
experimental self-assembly, whether or not one can monitor the experiment as it
proceeds. Our results have been achieved with no human input beyond the
specification of which order parameter to promote, pointing the way to the
design of synthesis protocols by artificial intelligence.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03347</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Biological and cultural inspired optimization algorithms are nowadays part of
the basic toolkit of a great many research domains. By mimicking processes in
nature and animal societies, these general-purpose search algorithms promise to
deliver optimal or near-optimal solutions using hardly any information on the
optimization problems they are set to tackle. Here we study the performances of
a cultural-inspired algorithm -- the imitative learning search -- as well as of
asexual and sexual variants of evolutionary algorithms in finding the global
maxima of NK-fitness landscapes. The main performance measure is the total
number of agent updates required by the algorithms to find those global maxima
and the baseline performance, which establishes the effectiveness of the
cooperative algorithms, is set by the blind search in which the agents explore
the problem space (binary strings) by flipping bits at random. We find that
even for smooth landscapes that exhibit a single maximum, the evolutionary
algorithms do not perform much better than the blind search due to the
stochastic effects of the genetic roulette. The imitative learning is immune to
this effect thanks to the deterministic choice of the fittest string in the
population, which is used as a model for imitation. The tradeoff is that for
rugged landscapes the imitative learning search is more prone to be trapped in
local maxima than the evolutionary algorithms. In fact, in the case of rugged
landscapes with a mild density of local maxima, the blind search either beats
or matches the cooperative algorithms regardless of whether the task is to find
the global maximum or to find the fittest state within a given runtime.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.12755</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Structural covariance analysis is a widely used structural MRI analysis
method which characterises the co-relations of morphology between brain regions
over a group of subjects. To our knowledge, little has been investigated in
terms of the comparability of results between different data sets or the
reliability of results over the same subjects in different rescan sessions,
image resolutions, or FreeSurfer versions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of comparability, our results show substantial differences in the
structural covariance matrix between data sets of age- and sex-matched healthy
human adults. These differences persist after site correction, they are
exacerbated by low sample sizes, and they are most pronounced when using
average cortical thickness as a morphological measure. Down-stream graph
theoretic analyses further show statistically significant differences.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of reliability, substantial differences were also found when
comparing repeated scan sessions of the same subjects, and image resolutions
and FreeSurfer versions of the same image. We could further estimate the
relative measurement error and showed that it is largest when using thickness.
With simulated data, we argue that cortical thickness is least reliable because
of larger relative measurement errors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practically, we make the following recommendations (1) pooling subjects
across sites into one group should be avoided, particularly if sites differ in
image resolutions, demographics, or preprocessing; (2) surface area and volume
should be preferred as morphological measures over cortical thickness; (3) a
large number of subjects should be used to estimate structural covariance; (4)
measurement error should be assessed where repeated measurements are available;
(5) if combining sites is critical, univariate site-correction is insufficient,
but error covariance should be explicitly measured and modelled.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Traditional neuroimage analysis pipelines involve computationally intensive,
time-consuming optimization steps, and thus, do not scale well to large cohort
studies with thousands or tens of thousands of individuals. In this work we
propose a fast and accurate deep learning based neuroimaging pipeline for the
automated processing of structural human brain MRI scans, replicating
FreeSurfer's anatomical segmentation including surface reconstruction and
cortical parcellation. To this end, we introduce an advanced deep learning
architecture capable of whole brain segmentation into 95 classes. The network
architecture incorporates local and global competition via competitive dense
blocks and competitive skip pathways, as well as multi-slice information
aggregation that specifically tailor network performance towards accurate
segmentation of both cortical and sub-cortical structures. Further, we perform
fast cortical surface reconstruction and thickness analysis by introducing a
spectral spherical embedding and by directly mapping the cortical labels from
the image to the surface. This approach provides a full FreeSurfer alternative
for volumetric analysis (in under 1 minute) and surface-based thickness
analysis (within only around 1h runtime). For sustainability of this approach
we perform extensive validation: we assert high segmentation accuracy on
several unseen datasets, measure generalizability and demonstrate increased
test-retest reliability, and high sensitivity to group differences in dementia.

architectures, AutoGrow can always discover near-optimal depth on various
datasets of MNIST, FashionMNIST, SVHN, CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet. For
example, in terms of accuracy-computation trade-off, AutoGrow discovers a
better depth combination in ResNets than human experts. Our AutoGrow is
efficient. It discovers depth within similar time of training a single DNN. Our
code is available at https://github.com/wenwei202/autogrow.

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Absence of Serotonin in the Brain Alters Acute Stress Responsiveness by Interfering With the Genomic Function of the Glucocorticoid Receptors</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00128</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alterations in serotonergic transmission have been related to a major predisposition to develop psychiatric pathologies, such as depression. We took advantage of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) 2 deficient rats, characterized by a complete absence of serotonin in the brain, to evaluate whether a vulnerable genotype may influence the reaction to an acute stressor. In this context, we investigated if the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) genomic pathway activation was altered by the lack of serotonin in the central nervous system. Moreover, we analyzed the transcription pattern of the clock genes that can be affected by acute stressors. Adult wild type (TPH2&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt;) and TPH2-deficient (TPH2&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;) male rats were sacrificed after exposure to one single session of acute restraint stress. Protein and gene expression analyses were conducted in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The acute stress enhanced the translocation of GRs in the nucleus of TPH2&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; animals. This effect was blunted in TPH2&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; rats, suggesting an impairment of the GR genomic mechanism. This alteration was mirrored in the expression of GR-responsive genes: acute stress led to the up-regulation of GR-target gene expression in TPH2&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt;, but not in TPH2&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; animals. Finally, clock genes were differently modulated in the two genotypes after the acute restraint stress. Overall our findings suggest that the absence of serotonin within the brain interferes with the ability of the HPA axis to correctly modulate the response to acute stress, by altering the nuclear mechanisms of the GR and modulation of clock genes expression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Increased Connexin36 Phosphorylation in AII Amacrine Cell Coupling of the Mouse Myopic Retina</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00124</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Myopia is a substantial public health problem worldwide. In the myopic retina, distant images are focused in front of the photoreceptors. The cells and mechanisms for retinal signaling that account either for emmetropization (i.e., normal refraction) or for refractive errors have remained elusive. Gap junctions play a key component in enhancement of signal transmission in visual pathways. AII amacrine cells (ACs), coupled by connexin36, segregate signals into ON and OFF pathways. Coupling between AII ACs is actively modulated through phosphorylation at serine 293 via dopamine in the mouse retina. In this study, form deprivation mouse myopia models were used to evaluate the expression patterns of connexin36-positive plaques (structural assay) and the state of connexin36 phosphorylation (functional assay) in AII ACs, which was green fluorescent protein-expressing in the Fam81a mouse line. Single-cell RNA sequencing showed dopaminergic synapse and gap junction pathways of AII ACs were downregulated in the myopic retina, although Gjd2 mRNA expression remained the same. Compared with the normal refractive eye, phosphorylation of connexin36 was increased in the myopic retina, but expression of connexin36 remained unchanged. This increased phosphorylation of Cx36 could indicate increased functional gap junction coupling of AII ACs in the myopic retina, a possible adaptation to adjust to the altered noisy signaling status.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Retrocopying expands the functional repertoire of APOBEC3 antiviral proteins in primates</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58436</link>
	<content:encoded>Host-virus arms races are inherently asymmetric; viruses evolve much more rapidly than host genomes. Thus, there is high interest in discovering mechanisms by which host genomes keep pace with rapidly evolving viruses. One family of restriction factors, the &lt;i&gt;APOBEC3 (A3)&lt;/i&gt; cytidine deaminases, has undergone positive selection and expansion via segmental gene duplication and recombination. Here, we show that new copies of &lt;i&gt;A3&lt;/i&gt; genes have also been created in primates by reverse transcriptase-encoding elements like LINE-1 or endogenous retroviruses via a process termed retrocopying. First, we discovered that all simian primate genomes retain the remnants of an ancient &lt;i&gt;A3&lt;/i&gt; retrocopy: &lt;i&gt;A3I&lt;/i&gt;. Furthermore, we found that some New World monkeys encode up to ten additional &lt;i&gt;APOBEC3G&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;A3G&lt;/i&gt;) retrocopies. Some of these &lt;i&gt;A3G&lt;/i&gt; retrocopies are transcribed in a variety of tissues and able to restrict retroviruses. Our findings suggest that host genomes co-opt retroelement activity in the germline to create new host restriction factors as another means to keep pace with the rapid evolution of viruses.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57438</link>
	<content:encoded>Tissue resident macrophages in the mammary gland are found in close association with epithelial structures and within the adipose stroma, and are important for mammary gland development and tissue homeostasis. While macrophages have been linked to ductal development in the virgin mammary gland, less is known regarding the effects of macrophages on the adipose stroma. Using transcriptional profiling and single cell RNA sequencing approaches, we identify a distinct resident stromal macrophage subpopulation within the mouse nulliparous mammary gland characterized by expression of Lyve-1, a receptor for the extracellular matrix (ECM) component hyaluronan. This subpopulation is enriched in genes associated with ECM remodeling and is specifically associated with hyaluronan-rich regions within the adipose stroma and fibrous capsule of the virgin mammary gland. Furthermore, macrophage depletion leads to enhanced accumulation of hyaluronan-associated ECM in the adipose-associated stroma, indicating that resident macrophages are important for maintaining homeostasis within the nulliparous mammary gland stroma.</content:encoded>

We demonstrate that many recently emerged murine KRAB-ZFPs also bind to TEs, including the active ETn, IAP, and L1 families. Using a CRISPR/Cas9-based engineering approach, we genetically deleted five large clusters of KRAB-ZFPs and demonstrate that target TEs are de-repressed, unleashing TE-encoded enhancers. Homozygous knockout mice lacking one of two KRAB-ZFP gene clusters on chromosome 2 and chromosome 4 were nonetheless viable. In pedigrees of chromosome 4 cluster KRAB-ZFP mutants, we identified numerous novel ETn insertions with a modest increase in mutants. Our data strongly support the current model that recent waves of retrotransposon activity drove the expansion of KRAB-ZFP genes in mice and that many KRAB-ZFPs play a redundant role restricting TE activity.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: A Bayesian and efficient observer model explains concurrent attractive and repulsive history biases in visual perception</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55389</link>
	<content:encoded>Human perceptual decisions can be repelled away from (repulsive adaptation) or attracted towards recent visual experience (attractive serial dependence). It is currently unclear whether and how these repulsive and attractive biases interact during visual processing and what computational principles underlie these history dependencies. Here we disentangle repulsive and attractive biases by exploring their respective timescales. We find that perceptual decisions are concurrently attracted towards the short-term perceptual history and repelled from stimuli experienced up to minutes into the past. The temporal pattern of short-term attraction and long-term repulsion cannot be captured by an ideal Bayesian observer model alone. Instead, it is well captured by an ideal observer model with efficient encoding and Bayesian decoding of visual information in a slowly changing environment. Concurrent attractive and repulsive history biases in perceptual decisions may thus be the consequence of the need for visual processing to simultaneously satisfy constraints of efficiency and stability.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: The copy-number and varied strength of MELT motifs in Spc105 balance the strength and responsiveness of the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55096</link>
	<content:encoded>The Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) maintains genome stability while ensuring timely anaphase onset. To maintain genome stability, it must be strong to delay cell division even if one chromosome is unattached, but for timely anaphase onset, it must promptly respond to silencing mechanisms. How the SAC meets these potentially antagonistic requirements is unclear. Here we show that the balance between SAC strength and responsiveness is determined by the number of 'MELT' motifs in the kinetochore protein Spc105/KNL1 and their Bub3-Bub1 binding affinities. Many strong MELT motifs per Spc105/KNL1 minimize chromosome missegregation, but too many delay SAC silencing and anaphase onset. We demonstrate this by constructing a Spc105 variant that trades SAC responsiveness for much more accurate chromosome segregation. We propose that the necessity of balancing SAC strength and responsiveness drives the dual evolutionary trend of the amplification of MELT motif number, but degeneration of their functionally optimal amino acid sequence.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>In this review, we approach Parkinson’s disease (PD) in the context of an evolutionary mismatch of central nervous system functions. The neurons at risk have hyperbranched axons, extensive transmitter release sites, display spontaneous spiking, and elevated mitochondrial stress. They function in networks largely unchanged throughout vertebrate evolution, but now connecting to the expanded human cortex. Their breakdown is favoured by longevity. At the cellular level, mitochondrial dysfunction starts at the synapses, then involves axons and cell bodies.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Computation of expected values, i.e., probability times magnitude, seems to be a dynamic integrative process performed in the brain for efficient economic behavior. However, neural dynamics underlying this computation remain largely unknown. We examined (1) whether four core reward-related regions detect and integrate the probability and magnitude cued by numerical symbols and (2) whether these regions have different dynamics in the integrative process. Extractions of mechanistic structure of neural population signal demonstrated that expected-value signals simultaneously arose in central part of orbitofrontal cortex (cOFC, area 13m) and ventral striatum (VS). These expected-value signals were incredibly stable in contrast to weak and unstable signals in dorsal striatum and medial OFC. Notably, temporal dynamics of these stable expected-value signals were unambiguously distinct: sharp and gradual signal evolutions in cOFC and VS, respectively. These intimate dynamics suggest that cOFC and VS compute the expected-values with unique time constants, as distinct, partially overlapping processes.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.01.127449v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Interpersonal physiological synchrony has been consistently found during collaborative tasks. However, few studies have applied synchrony to predict collaborative learning quality in real classroom. This study collected electrodermal activity (EDA) and heart rate (HR) in naturalistic class sessions, and compared the physiological synchrony between independent task and group discussion task. Since each student learn differently and not everyone prefers collaborative learning, participants were sorted into collaboration and independent dyads based on collaborative behaviors before data analysis. The result showed that during groups discussions, high collaboration pairs produced significantly higher synchrony than low collaboration dyads (p = 0.010). Given the equivalent engagement level during independent and collaborative tasks, the difference of physiological synchrony between high and low collaboration dyads was triggered by collaboration quality. Building upon this result, the classification analysis was conducted, indicating that EDA synchrony can predict collaboration quality (AUC = 0.767, p = 0.015).</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Comparative performance of mutual information and transfer entropy for analyzing the balance of information flow and energy consumption at synapses</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.01.127399v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Information theory has become an essential tool of modern neuroscience. It can however be difficult to apply in experimental contexts when acquisition of very large datasets is prohibitive. Here, we compare the relative performance of two information theoretic measures, mutual information and transfer entropy, for the analysis of information flow and energetic consumption at synapses. We show that transfer entropy outperforms mutual information in terms of reliability of estimates for small datasets. However, we also show that a detailed understanding of the underlying neuronal biophysics is essential for properly interpreting the results obtained with transfer entropy. We conclude that when time and experimental conditions permit, mutual information might provide an easier to interpret alternative. Finally, we apply both measures to the study of energetic optimality of information flow at thalamic relay synapses in the visual pathway. We show that both measures recapitulate the experimental finding that these synapses are tuned to optimally balance information flowing through them with the energetic consumption associated with that synaptic and neuronal activity. Our results highlight the importance of conducting systematic computational studies prior to applying information theoretic tools to experimental data.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Recording site placement on planar silicon-based probes affects neural signal quality: edge sites enhance acute recording performance</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.01.127308v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective: Multisite, silicon-based probes are widely used tools to record the electrical activity of neuronal populations. Several physical features of these devices (e.g. shank thickness, tip geometry) are designed to improve their recording performance. Here, our goal was to investigate whether the position of recording sites on the silicon shank might affect the quality of the recorded neural signal in acute experiments. Approach: Neural recordings obtained with five different types of high-density, single-shank, planar silicon probes from anesthetized rats were analyzed. Wideband data were filtered (500 - 5000 Hz) to extract spiking activity, then various quantitative properties (e.g. amplitude distribution of the filtered potential, single unit yield) of the recorded cortical and thalamic activity were compared between sites located at different positions of the silicon shank, focusing particularly on edge and center sites. Main results: Edge sites outperformed center sites: mean values of the examined properties of the spiking activity were in most cases higher for edge sites (~94%, 33/35) and a large fraction of these differences were also statistically significant (~45%, 15/33) with effect sizes ranging from small to large. Although the single unit yield was similar between site positions, the difference in signal quality was remarkable in the range corresponding to high-amplitude spikes. Furthermore, the advantage of edge sites slightly decreased for probes having a narrower shank. Significance: The better signal quality on edge sites might be the result of the reduced shielding effect of the silicon shank providing a larger field of view for edge sites to detect spikes, or the less tissue damage caused near the edges of the shank. Our results might aid the design of novel neural implants in enhancing their recording performance by identifying more efficient recording site placements.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Learning to synchronize: midfrontal theta dynamics during reversal learning</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.01.127175v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In recent years, several hierarchical extensions of well-known learning algorithms have been proposed. For example, when stimulus-action mappings vary across time or context, the brain may learn two or more stimulus-action mappings in separate modules, and additionally (at a hierarchically higher level) learn to appropriately switch between those modules. However, how the brain mechanistically coordinates neural communication to implement such hierarchical learning, remains unknown. Therefore, the current study tests a recent computational model that proposed how midfrontal theta oscillations implement hierarchical learning via the principle of binding by synchrony (Sync model). 64-channel EEG signal was recorded while 27 subjects performed a probabilistic reversal learning task. In line with the Sync model, post-feedback theta power showed a linear relationship with negative prediction errors, but not with positive prediction errors. This relationship was especially pronounced for subjects with better behavioral fit (measured via AIC) of the Sync model. Also consistent with Sync model simulations, theta phase-coupling between midfrontal electrodes and temporo-parietal electrodes was stronger after negative feedback. Our data suggest that the brain uses theta power and synchronization for flexibly switching between task rule modules, as is useful for example when multiple stimulus-action mappings must be retained and used.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Cooperative action of miR-124 and ISX9 in instructing direct reprogramming of mouse astrocytes to induced-neurons in vitro and in vivo</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.01.127126v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>miR-124 plays a major regulatory role in neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation during brain development through control of its multiple non-neuronal targets and has therefore been employed in direct reprogramming protocols supplementary to neurogenic TFs, and other miRNAs to enhance neurogenic conversion. However, its capacity to instruct neurogenic conversion of astrocytes and its independent mechanism of direct reprogramming action have been poorly investigated. Aim of the study was to investigate whether miR-124 is a master-regulatory reprogramming agent, potent to drive direct reprogramming of astrocytes to induced-neurons (iNs) on its own and to elucidate its mechanism of reprogramming action. To this end we overexpressed miR-124 either alone or in combination with the small neurogenic compound ISX9 both in vitro and in in vivo in a mouse mechanical cortical trauma model and analyzed their mechanism of reprogramming action. Our data indicate that miR-124 and ISX9 exhibit both unique and convergent molecular contributions in the reprogramming process to iNs. miR-124 is a potent driver of the astrocytic reprogramming switch of astrocytes towards an immature neuronal fate by repressing genes regulating astrocytic function, among which we identified the RNA-binding protein Zfp36l1 as a novel miR-124 direct target. We also provide evidence that ISX9 greatly improves both miR-124-induced reprogramming efficiency and functional maturation of iNs. Importantly, miR-124 either alone or along with ISX9 is potent to guide direct neuronal reprogramming of reactive astrocytes to iNs of cortical identity in vivo, a novel finding confirming the robust direct reprogramming action of the two molecules in activated astrocytes in vivo.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Coding and non-coding RNAs have diagnostic and prognostic importance in Parkinson's diseases (PD). We studied circulating small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) in 7,003 samples from two longitudinal PD cohorts (Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) and Luxembourg Parkinson's Study (NCER-PD)) and modelled their influence on the transcriptome. First, we sequenced sncRNAs in 5,450 blood samples of 1,614 individuals in PPMI. The majority of 323 billion reads (59 million reads per sample) mapped to miRNAs. Other covered RNA classes include piRNAs, rRNAs, snoRNAs, tRNAs, scaRNAs, and snRNAs. De-regulated miRNAs were associated with the disease and disease progression and occur in two distinct waves in the third and seventh decade of live. Originating mostly from a characteristic set of immune cells they resemble a systemic inflammation response and mitochondrial dysfunction, two hallmarks of PD. By profiling 1,553 samples from 1,024 individuals in the NCER-PD cohort using an independent technology, we validate relevant findings from the sequencing study. Finally, network analysis of sncRNAs and transcriptome sequencing of the original cohort identified regulatory modules emerging in progressing PD patients.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.01.127050v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Bioelectronic medicine is opening new perspectives for the treatment of some major chronic diseases through the physical modulation of autonomic nervous system activity. Being the main peripheral route for electrical signals between central nervous system and visceral organs, the vagus nerve (VN) is one of the most promising targets. Closed-loop neuromodulation would be crucial to increase effectiveness and reduce side effects, but it depends on the possibility of extracting useful physiological information from VN electrical activity, which is currently very limited. Here, we present a new decoding algorithm properly detecting different functional changes from VN signals. They were recorded using intraneural electrodes in anaesthetized pigs during cardiovascular and respiratory challenges mimicking increases in arterial blood pressure, tidal volume and respiratory rate. A novel decoding algorithm was developed combining discrete wavelet transformation, principal component analysis, and ensemble learning made of classification trees. It robustly achieved high accuracy levels in identifying different functional changes and discriminating among them. We also introduced a new index for the characterization of recording and decoding performance of neural interfaces. Finally, by combining an anatomically validated hybrid neural model and discrimination analysis, we provided new evidence suggesting a functional topographical organization of VN fascicles. This study represents an important step towards the comprehension of VN signaling, paving the way to the development of effective closed-loop bioelectronic systems.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.01.127035v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The advent of large-scale microscopy along with advances in automated image analysis algorithms is currently revolutionizing neuroscience. These approaches result in rapidly increasing libraries of neuron reconstructions requiring innovative computational methods to draw biological insight from. Here, we propose a framework from differential geometry based on scale-space representation to extract a quantitative structural readout of neurite traces seen as tridimensional (3D) curves within the anatomical space. We define and propose algorithms to compute a multiscale hierarchical decomposition of traced neurites according to their intrinsic dimensionality, from which we deduce a local 3D scale, i.e. the scale in microns at which the curve is fully 3D as opposed to being embedded in a 2D plane or a 1D line. We applied our scale-space analysis to recently published data including zebrafish whole brain traces to demonstrate the importance of the computed local 3D scale for description and comparison at the single arbor levels and as a local spatialized information characterizing axons populations at the whole brain level. The use of this broadly applicable approach is facilitated through an open-source implementation in Python available through GeNePy3D, a quantitative geometry library.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.01.127027v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Dopamine D2 receptors (D2-R) in extrastriatal brain regions are of high interest for research in a wide range of psychiatric and neurologic disorders. Pharmacological competition studies and test-retest experiments have shown high validity and reliability of the positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand [11C]FLB 457 for D2-R quantification in extrastriatal brain regions. However, this radioligand is not available at most research centres. Instead, the medium affinity radioligand [11C]raclopride, which has been extensively validated for quantification of D2-R in the high-density region striatum, has been applied also in studies on extrastriatal D2-R. Recently, the validity of this approach has been questioned by observations of low occupancy of [11C]raclopride in extrastriatal regions in a pharmacological competition study. Here, we utilise a data set of 16 healthy control subjects examined with both [11C]raclopride and [11C]FLB 457 to assess the correlation in binding potential (BPND) in extrastriatal brain regions. BPND was quantified using the simplified reference tissue model with cerebellum as reference region. The rank order of mean regional BPND values were similar for both radioligands, and corresponded to previously reported data, both post-mortem and using PET. Nevertheless, weak to moderate within-subject correlations were observed between [11C]raclopride and [11C]FLB 457 BPND extrastriatally (Pearsons R: 0.30 - 0.56), in contrast to very strong correlations between repeated [11C]FLB 457 measurements (Pearsons R: 0.82 - 0.98). These results are likely related to low signal to noise ratio of [11C]raclopride in extrastriatal brain regions, and further strengthen the recommendation that extrastriatal D2-R measures obtained with [11C]raclopride should be interpreted with caution.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.31.126870v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: People with Parkinson's disease who meet criteria for mild cognitive impairment are at increased risk of dementia. It is not known which tests are more effective than others for identifying the risk of dementia. Methods: At baseline, we assessed performance on 21 neuropsychological test measures spanning five cognitive domains in a prospective longitudinal study of 196 non-demented people with Parkinson's. Elastic net logistic regression was used to identify a pair of tests from each cognitive domain that best predicted conversion to dementia over a four year period. The optimal tests most predictive of dementia were also determined when mild cognitive impairment was derived from a logistic-regression classifier that used all 21 measures simultaneously. Results: With two tests per domain, the resulting mild cognitive impairment group (N=87/196) captured 44 of 51 individuals who converted to PDD; the out-of-sample relative risk of PDD was 8.0 (95% CI [4.3, 24]), similar to that achieved with the full battery (N=102/196, capturing 45/51, relative risk = 6.9). When selecting tests regardless of domain, there was strong evidence for three tests: Trail Making part B (Executive), Map Search (Attention), and CVLT-II word list acquisition (Episodic Memory). The logistic-regression classifier achieved an out-of-sample AUC of 0.90 [0.84, 0.96] and a relative risk of 12 [6, 39]. Conclusions: An abbreviated selection of neuropsychological tests can identify non-demented patients who have a high relative risk of progression to PDD.</content:encoded>

Itch is a common side effect of opioids, particularly as a result of epidural or intrathecal (i.t.) administration. Recent progress has advanced our understanding of itch circuits in the spinal cord. However, the mechanisms underlying opioid-induced itch are not fully understood, although an interaction between mu opioid receptor (MOR) and gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) in spinal GRPR-expressing neurons has been implicated. In this study we investigated the cellular mechanisms of intrathecal (i.t.) opioid-induced itch by conditional deletion of MOR-encoding Oprm1 in distinct populations of interneurons and sensory neurons. We found that i.t. injection of the MOR agonists morphine or DAMGO elicited dose-dependent scratching, but this pruritus was totally abolished in mice with a specific Oprm1 deletion in Vgat+ neurons (Oprm1-Vgat). Loss of MOR in somatostatin+ interneurons and TRPV1+ sensory neurons did not affect morphine-induced itch but impaired morphine-induced antinociception. In situ hybridization revealed Oprm1 expression in 30% of inhibitory and 20% of excitatory interneurons in the spinal dorsal horn. Whole-cell recordings from spinal cord slices showed that DAMGO induced outward currents in 9 out of 19 Vgat+ interneurons examined. Morphine also inhibited action potentials in Vgat+ interneurons and suppressed evoked IPSCs in postsynaptic Vgat- excitatory neurons, suggesting a mechanism of disinhibition by MOR agonists. Notably, morphine-elicited itch was suppressed by i.t. administration of NPY and abolished by spinal ablation of GRPR+ neurons, whereas i.t. GRP-induced itch response remained intact in mice lacking Oprm1-Vgat. Additionally, chronic itch from DNFB-induced allergic contact dermatitis was decreased by Oprm1-Vgat deletion. Finally, naloxone, but not peripherally restricted naloxone methiodide, inhibited chronic itch in the DNFB model and the cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) model, indicating a contribution of central MOR signaling to chronic itch. Our findings demonstrate that i.t. morphine elicits itch via acting on MOR on spinal inhibitory interneurons, leading to disinhibition of the spinal itch circuit. Our data also suggest that chronic itch could be effectively treated with CNS-targeted naloxone.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Inactivation of the mitochondrial protease Afg3l2 results in severely diminished respiratory chain activity and widespread defects in mitochondrial gene expression</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.31.126607v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The m-AAA proteases play a critical role in the proteostasis of the inner mitochondrial membrane proteins, and mutations in the genes encoding these proteases cause severe incurable neurological diseases. To further explore the biological role of the m-AAA proteases and the pathological consequences of their deficiency, we used a genetic approach in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster to inactivate the ATPase family gene 3-like 2 (AFG3L2) gene, which encodes a component of the m-proteases. We found that null alleles of Drosophila AFG3L2 die early in development, but partial inactivation of AFG3L2 using RNAi extended viability to the late pupal and adult stages of development. Flies with partial inactivation of Afg3l2 exhibited marked behavioral defects, neurodegeneration, mitochondrial morphological alterations, and diminished respiratory chain (RC) activity. Further work revealed that reduced RC activity was a consequence of widespread defects in mitochondrial gene expression, including diminished mitochondrial transcription, translation and impaired mitochondrial ribosome biogenesis. These defects were accompanied by the compensatory activation of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mito-UPR) and accumulation of unfolded mitochondrial proteins, including proteins involved in transcription. Overexpression of the mito-UPR components partially rescued the Afg3l2-deficient phenotypes, indicating that sequestration of essential components of the mitochondrial gene expression into aggregates partly accounts for these defects. However, Afg3l2 also co-sediments with the mitochondrial ribosome biogenesis machinery, suggesting an additional novel role for Afg3l2 in ribosome biogenesis. Our work suggests that strategies designed to modify mitochondrial stress pathways and mitochondrial gene expression could be therapeutic in the diseases caused by mutations in AFG3L2.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Scalp EEG interictal high frequency oscillations as an objective EEG biomarker of infantile spasms</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.31.126573v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective: To investigate the diagnostic utility of high frequency oscillations (HFOs) via scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) in infantile spasms. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed interictal slow-wave sleep EEGs sampled at 2,000 Hz recorded from 30 consecutive patients who were suspected of having infantile spasms. We measured the rate of HFOs (80-500 Hz) and the strength of the cross-frequency coupling between HFOs and slow-wave activity (SWA) at 3-4 Hz and 0.5-1 Hz as quantified with modulation indices (MIs). Results: Twenty-three patients (77%) exhibited active spasms during the overnight EEG recording. Although the HFOs were detected in all children, increased HFO rate and MIs correlated with the presence of active spasms (p &amp;lt; 0.001 by HFO rate; p &amp;lt; 0.01 by MIs at 3-4 Hz; p = 0.02 by MIs at 0.5-1 Hz). The presence of active spasms was predicted by the logistic regression models incorporating HFO-related metrics (AUC: 0.80-0.98) better than that incorporating hypsarrhythmia (AUC: 0.61). The predictive performance of the best model remained favorable (87.5% accuracy) after a cross-validation procedure. Conclusions: Increased rate of HFOs and coupling between HFOs and SWA are associated with active epileptic spasms. Significance: Scalp-recorded HFOs may serve as an objective EEG biomarker for active epileptic spasms.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.31.126474v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>High acuity binocularity is established in primary visual cortex during an early postnatal critical period. In contrast to current models for the developmental of binocular neurons, we find that the binocular network present at the onset of the critical period is dismantled and remade. Using longitudinal imaging of receptive field tuning (e.g. orientation selectivity) of thousands of layer 2/3 neurons through development, we show most binocular neurons present at critical-period onset are poorly tuned and rendered monocular. These are replenished by newly formed binocular neurons that are established by a vision-dependent recruitment of well-tuned ipsilateral inputs to contralateral monocular neurons with matched tuning properties. The binocular network in layer 4 is equally unstable but does not improve. Thus, vision instructs a new and more sharply tuned binocular network in layer 2/3 by exchanging one population of neurons for another and not by refining an extant network.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Dense Computer Replica of Cortical Microcircuits Unravels Cellular Underpinnings of Auditory Surprise Response</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.31.126466v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The nervous system is notorious for its strong response evoked by a surprising sensory input, but the biophysical and anatomical underpinnings of this phenomenon are only partially understood. Here we utilized in silico experiments of a biologically-detailed model of a neocortical microcircuit to study stimulus specific adaptation (SSA) in the auditory cortex, whereby the neuronal response adapts significantly for a repeated (&quot;expected&quot;) tone but not for a rare (&quot;surprise&quot;) tone. SSA experiments were mimicked by stimulating tonotopically-mapped thalamo-cortical afferents projecting to the microcircuit; the activity of these afferents was modeled based on our in vivo recordings from individual thalamic neurons. The modeled microcircuit expressed naturally many experimentally-observed properties of SSA, suggesting that SSA is a general property of neocortical microcircuits. By systematically modulating circuit parameters, we found that key features of SSA depended on synergistic effects of synaptic depression, spike frequency adaptation and recurrent network connectivity. The relative contribution of each of these mechanisms in shaping SSA was explored, additional SSA-related experimental results were explained and new experiments for further studying SSA were suggested.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.31.126359v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>At any moment in time, new information is sampled from the environment and interacts with ongoing brain state. Often, such interaction takes place within individual circuits that are capable of both mediating the internally ongoing plan as well as representing exogenous sensory events. Here we investigated how sensory-driven neural activity can be integrated, very often in the same neuron types, into ongoing oculomotor commands for saccades. Despite the ballistic nature of saccades, visually-induced action potentials in the superior colliculus (SC), a structure known to drive eye movements, not only occurred intra-saccadically, but they were also associated with highly predictable modifications of the ongoing eye movements. Such modifications were also possible by peri-saccadically injecting single, double, or triple electrical microstimulation pulses into the SC. Our results suggest instantaneous readout of the SC map during movement generation, irrespective of activity source, and explain a significant component of kinematic variability of motor outputs.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Sodium valproate protects against neuronal ferroptosis in epilepsy via suppressing lysyl oxidase</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.31.126227v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background and purpose: Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disease that is characterized by repetitive seizures. Seizures-related complications such as cognitive deficits, anxiety and sleep disorders seriously impact the life quality of patients. Antiepileptic drugs are widely used for the treatment of epilepsy. Sodium valproate is served as the first-line antiepileptic drugs and possesses various pharmacological effects on the brain. Sodium valproate exerts neuroprotective effects in acute nervous system diseases such as ischemic brain damage by inhibiting oxidative stress. However, the mechanism of neuroprotection of sodium valproate in epilepsy is unclear. Lysyl oxidase (Lox) is a monoamine oxidase that acts on extracellular matrix collagen and elastin and it can promote accumulation of oxidative stress. Our previous studies have confirmed that Lox is involved in ferroptosis, a novel iron-dependent and lipid peroxidation-mediated cell death pathway, during epilepsy. In this study, we would like to investigate whether sodium valproate can exert neuroprotective effects on kainic acid-induced epileptic seizures by inhibiting Lox-mediated ferroptosis. Methods: Epileptic mouse models were established by intracranial injection of 250 ng/l kainic acid on right hippocampus. Sodium valproate and ferroptosis inhibitors were administrated by intraperitoneal injecting. The epileptic behavior of the mice within 4 hours was recorded after intracranial injection of kainic acid. Mouse hippocampus was acquired to analyze the mRNA expression of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) and the production of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE). In vitro, the protective effects of sodium valproate on glutamate-induced HT22 cell damage model was assessed by PI/Hoechst staining; The levels of PTGS2, 4-HNE and lipid ROS were analyzed by RT-qPCR, western blot and flow cytometry, respectively. RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis the mRNA and protein expression of Lox in the glutamate-induced HT22 cell damage model. The Lox overexpression model was established by intracranial injection of AAV on right hippocampus. Results: Pretreatment with sodium valproate and ferroptosis inhibitors could significantly alleviate the epileptic seizures in the kainic acid induced epilepsy mouse model. Western blot and RT-qPCR results showed that sodium valproate and ferroptosis inhibitors significantly inhibited the levels of 4-HNE and PTGS2. PI/Hoechst staining showed that 1 mM sodium valproate exerted protective effect on glutamate-induced HT22 cell injury model. There was no significant difference observed between sodium valproate and ferroptosis inhibitors co-intervention group and sodium valproate intervention group on glutamate-induced cell injury model. And sodium valproate could significantly inhibit the production of lipid reactive oxygen species and 4-HNE. The expression of Lox was significantly increased in the glutamate-induced HT22 cell injury model, which could be reversed by pretreatment of sodium valproate. And {beta}-aminopropionitrile (a specific inhibitor of Lox) could inhibit ferroptosis induced by glutamate, as well as ameliorate the epileptic seizures in the kainic acid induced epilepsy mouse model. Pretreatment with sodium valproate could not ameliorate the epileptic behavior in the Lox-overexpression mice. Western blot analysis showed that sodium valproate could not suppress the production of 4-HNE in kainic acid induced epileptic mice model. Conclusions: The neuroprotective effect of sodium valproate in epileptic seizures is closely related to the inhibition of ferroptosis. The inhibition of ferroptosis is involved in the neuroprotective effect of sodium valproate on glutamate-induced HT22 cell damage model. Sodium valproate may exert neuroprotective effects in kainic acid-induced epileptic seizures by abrogating Lox-mediated ferroptosis.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Neurofunctional mechanisms underlying audiovisual integration of characters and pinyin in Chinese children</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.31.126128v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Efficient integration of grapheme and phoneme is crucial for reading development in alphabetic languages, and superior temporal cortex (STC) has been demonstrated to be the most critical region for this process. To determine whether a similar neural mechanism underlies such processing in non-alphabetic languages, and to explore its relationship with reading, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging study in typically developing Chinese children. Highly frequent pictographic characters and pinyin, a transparent alphabetic coding system that assists individuals to learn the pronunciation of new characters were investigated. In support of the orthographic depth hypothesis developed in alphabetic languages, reverse congruency effect (i.e., higher activation in incongruent condition compared to congruent condition) was identified in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and bilateral STC for character (deep orthography) conditions. Furthermore, correlation analysis revealed that the congruency contrast in the left IFG was associated with proficiency in reading comprehension and morphological awareness, suggesting reading-related semantic access during the implicit integration of multisensory information regarding characters. For pinyin (shallow orthography) conditions, while no regions showed a significant congruency effect at the group level in either direction, the congruency contrast in the left superior temporal gyrus was positively correlated with oral reading performance. This observation is consistent with findings in transparent scripts on reading disorders. Taken together, these results support and generalize the orthographic depth hypothesis to a logographic language, highlight the role of the left IFG in character-syllable integration, and underscore the role pinyin could play in developing fluent reading in Chinese children.</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Mice were tested for baseline place preference on day 1 (D1), conditioned on days 2–7 (D2‐7) with saline in both conditioning chambers (Saline Group) or saline in one and nicotine in the other (Nicotine Group) once daily for 6 days and tested 24 hr later on day 8 (D8). Mice received additional conditioning and tested again for place preference on day 13 (D13). Four days later, mice were challenged with mecamylamine and 30 min later tested for anxiety‐like behaviors in the elevated plus maze. Two hours later, mice were exposed to forced swim test for 15 min and tested for immobility time the next day. Our results showed that male mice lacking PACAP showed reduced anxiety‐like and depression‐like behaviors following withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent evidence implicates endogenous pituitary adenylyl cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) in the aversive effect of nicotine. In the present study, we assessed if nicotine‐induced conditioned place preference (CPP) or affective signs of nicotine withdrawal would be altered in the absence of PACAP and if there were any sex‐related differences in these responses. Male and female mice lacking PACAP and their wild‐type controls were tested for baseline place preference on day 1, received conditioning with saline or nicotine (1 mg/kg) on alternate days for 6 days and were then tested for CPP the next day. Mice were then exposed to four additional conditioning and were tested again for nicotine‐induced CPP 24 hr later. Controls were conditioned with saline in both chambers and tested similarly. All mice were then, 96 hr later, challenged with mecamylamine (3 mg/kg), and tested for anxiety‐like behaviors 30 min later. Mice were then, 2 hr later, forced to swim for 15 min and then tested for depression‐like behaviors 24 hr later. Our results showed that male but not female mice lacking PACAP expressed a significant CPP that was comparable to their wild‐type controls. In contrast, male but not female mice lacking PACAP exhibited reduced anxiety‐ and depression‐like behaviors compared to their wild‐type controls following the mecamylamine challenge. These results suggest that endogenous PACAP is involved in affective signs of nicotine withdrawal, but there is a sex‐related difference in this response.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;No cognitive processing in the unconscious, Anesthetic‐Like, state of sleep&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/da1775fc-103f-41b8-b5d1-0ed3328b8c4e/cne24963-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locations of waking/arousal‐related cell groups of the brainstem and caudal diencephalon at which general anesthetics exert anesthetic actions. They include the pontomesencephalic reticular formation (PRF), locus coeruleus (LC), parabrachial nucleus (PB), tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) and orexin‐containing cells of the lateral hypothalamus.  General anesthetics have been shown to suppress the activity of each of these structures to induce anesthesia whereas their activation (e.g., by electrical stimulation) hastens the recovery from anesthesia.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We review evidence challenging the hypothesis that memories are processed or consolidated in sleep. We argue that the brain is in an unconscious state in sleep, akin to general anesthesia, and hence is incapable of meaningful cognitive processing – the sole purview of waking consciousness. At minimum, the encoding of memories in sleep would require that waking events are faithfully transferred to and reproduced in sleep. Remarkably, however, this has never been demonstrated, as waking experiences are never truly replicated in sleep but rather appear in very altered or distorted forms. General anesthetics (GAs) exert their effects through endogenous sleep‐wake control systems and accordingly GAs and sleep share several common features: sensory blockade, immobility, amnesia and lack of awareness (unconsciousness). The loss of consciousness in non‐REM (NREM) sleep or to GAs is characterized by: (1) delta oscillations throughout the cortex; (2) marked reductions in neural activity (from waking) over widespread regions of the cortex, most pronounced in frontal and parietal cortices; and (3) a significant disruption of the functional connectivity of thalamocortical and corticocortical networks, particularly those involved in “higher order” cognitive functions. Several (experimental) reports in animals and humans have shown that disrupting the activity of the cortex, particularly the orbitofrontal cortex, severely impairs higher order cognitive and executive functions. The profound and widespread deactivation of the cortex in the unconscious states of NREM sleep or GA would be expected to produce an equivalent, or undoubtedly a much greater, disruptive effect on mnemonic and cognitive functions. In conclusion, we contend that the unconscious, severely altered state of the brain in NREM sleep would negate any possibility of cognitive processing in NREM sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Comparison of core features in four Developmental Encephalopathies in the Rett Natural History Study</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25797?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rett Syndrome, &lt;i&gt;CDKL5 &lt;/i&gt;‐Deficiency Disorder, &lt;i&gt;FOXG1 &lt;/i&gt; Disorder, and &lt;i&gt;MECP2 &lt;/i&gt; Duplication Disorder are Developmental Encephalopathies with shared and distinct features. Though historically linked, no direct comparison has been performed. The first head‐to‐head comparison of clinical features in these conditions is presented.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comprehensive clinical information was collected from 793 individuals enrolled in the Rett Syndrome and Related Disorders Natural History Study. Clinical features including clinical severity, regression, and seizures were cross‐sectionally compared between diagnoses to test the hypothesis that these are 4 distinct disorders.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distinct patterns of clinical severity, seizure onset age, and regression were present. Individuals with &lt;i&gt;CDKL5 &lt;/i&gt;‐Deficency Disorder were the most severely affected and had the youngest age of seizure onset (2 months) whereas children with &lt;i&gt;MECP2 &lt;/i&gt;‐duplication syndrome had the oldest median age of seizure onset (64 months) and lowest severity scores. Rett syndrome and &lt;i&gt;FOGX1 &lt;/i&gt; were intermediate in both features. Smaller head circumference correlates with increased severity in all disorders and earlier age of seizure onset in MECP2‐duplication syndrome. Developmental regression occurred in all Rett syndrome participants (median 18 months) but only 23–34% of the other disorders. Seizure incidence prior to the baseline visit was highest for &lt;i&gt;CDKL5 &lt;/i&gt;‐Deficency Disorder (96.2%) and lowest for Rett syndrome (47.5%). Other clinical features including seizure types and frequency differed amongst groups.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these Developmental Encephalopathies share many clinical features, clear differences in severity, regression, and seizures warrant considering them as unique disorders. These results will aid in the development of disease specific severity scales, precise therapeutics, and future clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Studies of the phenotype and population distribution of rare genetic forms of parkinsonism are required, now that gene‐targeting approaches for Parkinson's disease have reached the clinical trial stage. We evaluated the frequencies of &lt;i&gt;PRKN &lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PINK1 &lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;DJ‐1 &lt;/i&gt; mutations in a cohort of 1587 cases. Mutations were found in 14.1% of patients: 27.6% were familial and 8% were isolated. &lt;i&gt;PRKN &lt;/i&gt; was the gene most frequently mutated in Caucasians whereas &lt;i&gt;PINK1 &lt;/i&gt; mutations predominated in Arab‐Berber individuals. Patients with &lt;i&gt;PRKN &lt;/i&gt; mutations had an earlier age at onset, and less asymmetry, levodopa‐induced motor complications, dysautonomia, and dementia than those without mutations.&lt;/p&gt;

Phenotypic delay—the time delay between genetic mutation and expression of the corresponding phenotype—is generally neglected in evolutionary models, yet recent work suggests that it may be more common than previously assumed. Here, we use computer simulations and theory to investigate the significance of phenotypic delay for the evolution of bacterial resistance to antibiotics. We consider three mechanisms which could potentially cause phenotypic delay: effective polyploidy, dilution of antibiotic-sensitive molecules and accumulation of resistance-enhancing molecules. We find that the accumulation of resistant molecules is relevant only within a narrow parameter range, but both the dilution of sensitive molecules and effective polyploidy can cause phenotypic delay over a wide range of parameters. We further investigate whether these mechanisms could affect population survival under drug treatment and thereby explain observed discrepancies in mutation rates estimated by Luria-Delbrück fluctuation tests. While the effective polyploidy mechanism does not affect population survival, the dilution of sensitive molecules leads both to decreased probability of survival under drug treatment and underestimation of mutation rates in fluctuation tests. The dilution mechanism also changes the shape of the Luria-Delbrück distribution of mutant numbers, and we show that this modified distribution provides an improved fit to previously published experimental data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cTXAdBu9x_Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Dynamic changes in microbial communities play an important role in human health and disease. Specifically, deciphering how microbial species in a community interact with each other and their environment can elucidate mechanisms of disease, a problem typically investigated using tools from community ecology. Yet, such methods require measurements of absolute densities, whereas typical datasets only provide estimates of relative abundances. Here, we systematically investigate models of microbial dynamics in the simplex of relative abundances. We derive a new nonlinear dynamical system for microbial dynamics, termed “compositional” Lotka-Volterra (cLV), unifying approaches using generalized Lotka-Volterra (gLV) equations from community ecology and compositional data analysis. On three real datasets, we demonstrate that cLV recapitulates interactions between relative abundances implied by gLV. Moreover, we show that cLV is as accurate as gLV in forecasting microbial trajectories in terms of relative abundances. We further compare cLV to two other models of relative abundance dynamics motivated by common assumptions in the literature—a linear model in a log-ratio transformed space, and a linear model in the space of relative abundances—and provide evidence that cLV more accurately describes community trajectories over time. Finally, we investigate when information about direct effects can be recovered from relative data that naively provide information about only indirect effects. Our results suggest that strong effects may be recoverable from relative data, but more subtle effects are challenging to identify.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uCOijCLgqwg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Reconstructing haplotypes from sequencing data is one of the major challenges in genetics. Haplotypes play a crucial role in many analyses, including genome-wide association studies and population genetics. Haplotype reconstruction becomes more difficult for higher numbers of homologous chromosomes, as it is often the case for polyploid plants. This complexity is compounded further by higher heterozygosity, which denotes the frequent presence of variants between haplotypes. We have designed &lt;i&gt;Ranbow&lt;/i&gt;, a new tool for haplotype reconstruction of polyploid genome from short read sequencing data. &lt;i&gt;Ranbow&lt;/i&gt; integrates all types of small variants in bi- and multi-allelic sites to reconstruct haplotypes. To evaluate &lt;i&gt;Ranbow&lt;/i&gt; and currently available competing methods on real data, we have created and released a real gold standard dataset from sweet potato sequencing data. Our evaluations on real and simulated data clearly show &lt;i&gt;Ranbow&lt;/i&gt;’s superior performance in terms of accuracy, haplotype length, memory usage, and running time. Specifically, &lt;i&gt;Ranbow&lt;/i&gt; is one order of magnitude faster than the next best method. The efficiency and accuracy of &lt;i&gt;Ranbow&lt;/i&gt; makes whole genome haplotype reconstruction of complex genome with higher ploidy feasible.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/04uZOmXwKcs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Early warning signals in motion inference</title>

The ability to infer intention lies at the basis of many social interactions played out via motor actions. We consider a simple paradigm of this ability in humans using data from experiments simulating an antagonistic game between an Attacker and a Blocker. Evidence shows early inference of an Attacker move by as much as 100ms but the nature of the informational cues signaling the impending move remains unknown. We show that the transition to action has the hallmark of a critical transition that is accompanied by early warning signals. These early warning signals occur as much as 130 ms before motion ensues—showing a sharp rise in motion autocorrelation at lag-1 and a sharp rise in the autocorrelation decay time. The early warning signals further correlate strongly with Blocker response times. We analyze the variance of the motion near the point of transition and find that it diverges in a manner consistent with the dynamics of a fold-transition. To test if humans can recognize and act upon these early warning signals, we simulate the dynamics of fold-transition events and ask people to recognize the onset of directional motion: participants react faster to fold-transition dynamics than to its uncorrelated counterpart. Together, our findings suggest that people can recognize the intent and onset of motion by inferring its early warning signals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vm9oxoW9JN0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Corticotropin‐releasing factor (CRF) signaling is mediated by two receptor types, CRF&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and CRF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Herein, we demonstrate that genetic CRF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor deficiency (CRF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;−/−) reduces sociability in female mice &lt;i&gt;but &lt;/i&gt; increases it in male mice. Moreover, the CRF&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor‐preferring antagonist antalarmin reverses sociability in both female and male wild‐type (CRF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+/+) and CRF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;−/− mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dysfunctional social behavior is a major clinical feature of mood, anxiety, autism spectrum, and substance‐related disorders, and may dramatically contribute to the poor outcome of these diseases. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying social behavior deficits are still largely unknown. The corticotropin‐releasing factor (CRF) system, a major coordinator of the stress response, has been hypothesized to modulate social behavior. CRF signaling is mediated by two receptor types, termed CRF&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and CRF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Using the three‐chamber task for sociability (i.e., preference for an unfamiliar conspecific vs. an object), this study demonstrates that CRF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor null mutation (CRF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;−/−) reduces sociability in female mice &lt;i&gt;but &lt;/i&gt; increases it in male mice. Both female and male CRF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;−/− mice display a preference for social odor cues over neutral cues, indicating that sex‐ and CRF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor‐dependent sociability is not due to altered olfaction or impaired social cues discrimination. Moreover, treatment with the CRF&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor‐preferring antagonist, antalarmin, consistently induces sociability in non‐social mice but disrupts it in social mice, independently of CRF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor deficiency. Sex, CRF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor deficiency, or antalarmin affect locomotor activity during the three‐chamber test. However, throughout the study CRF&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and CRF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor‐linked sociability is independent of locomotor activity. The present findings highlight major functions for the CRF system in the regulation of social behavior. Moreover, they provide initial evidence of sex‐linked roles for the CRF&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and the CRF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor, emphasizing the importance of sex as a major biological variable to be taken into consideration in preclinical and clinical studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Many animals, just like humans, are able to categorize objects based on physical appearance. In humans, training improves performance in such tasks by distorting perceived similarity at the category boundary, a nonlinear effect termed categorical perception (CP). Here we sought evidence for a comparable effect in a lower vertebrate. Based on stimuli generated using a novel image morphing technique, we describe a series of visual discrimination experiments demonstrating CP of facial patterns in a reef fish, providing insight into the evolutionary origins and neural bases of this ability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Categorical perception (CP) is the phenomenon by which a smoothly varying stimulus property undergoes a nonlinear transformation during processing in the brain. Consequently, the stimuli are perceived as belonging to distinct categories separated by a sharp boundary. Originally thought to be largely innate, the discovery of CP in tasks such as novel image discrimination has piqued the interest of cognitive scientists because it provides compelling evidence that learning can shape a category's perceptual boundaries. CP has been particularly closely studied in human face perception. In nonprimates, there is evidence for CP for sound and color discrimination, but not for image or face discrimination. Here, we investigate the potential for learned CP in a lower vertebrate, the damselfish &lt;i&gt;Pomacentrus amboinensis. &lt;/i&gt; Specifically, we tested whether the ability of these fish to discriminate complex facial patterns tracked categorical rather than metric differences in the stimuli. We first trained the fish to discriminate sets of two facial patterns. Next, we morphed between these patterns and determined the just noticeable difference (JND) between a morph and original image. Finally, we tested for CP by analyzing the discrimination ability of the fish for pairs of JND stimuli along the spectrum of morphs between two original images. Discrimination performance was significant for the image pair straddling the boundary between categories, and chance for equivalent stimulus pairs on either side, thus producing the classic “category boundary” effect. Our results reveal how perception can be influenced in a top‐down manner even in the absence of a visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Humans can reason at an abstract level and structure information into abstract categories, but the underlying neural processes have remained unknown. Recent experimental data provide the hint that this is likely to involve specific subareas of the brain from which structural information can be decoded. Based on this data, we introduce the concept of assembly projections, a general principle for attaching structural information to content in generic networks of spiking neurons. According to the assembly projections principle, structure-encoding assemblies emerge and are dynamically attached to content representations through Hebbian plasticity mechanisms. This model provides the basis for explaining a number of experimental data and provides a basis for modeling abstract computational operations of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro: A Single Intraventricular Injection of VEGF Leads to Long-Term Neurotrophic Effects in Axotomized Motoneurons</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/3/ENEURO.0467-19.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been recently demonstrated to induce neuroprotective and synaptotrophic effects on lesioned neurons. Hitherto, the administration of VEGF in different animal models of lesion or disease has been conducted following a chronic protocol of administration. We questioned whether a single dose of VEGF, administered intraventricularly, could induce long-term neurotrophic effects on injured motoneurons. For this purpose, we performed in cats the axotomy of abducens motoneurons and the injection of VEGF into the fourth ventricle in the same surgical session and investigated the discharge characteristics of axotomized and treated motoneurons by single-unit extracellular recordings in the chronic alert preparation. We found that injured motoneurons treated with a single VEGF application discharged with normal characteristics, showing neuronal eye position (EP) and velocity sensitivities similar to control, thereby preventing the axotomy-induced alterations. These effects were present for a prolonged period of time (50 d) after VEGF administration. By confocal immunofluorescence we also showed that the synaptic stripping that ensues lesion was not present, rather motoneurons showed a normal synaptic coverage. Moreover, we demonstrated that VEGF did not lead to any angiogenic response pointing to a direct action of the factor on neurons. In summary, a single dose of VEFG administered just after motoneuron axotomy is able to prevent for a long time the axotomy-induced firing and synaptic alterations without any associated vascular sprouting. We consider that these data are of great relevance due to the potentiality of VEGF as a therapeutic agent in neuronal lesions and diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro: Targeting Morphine-Responsive Neurons: Generation of a Knock-In Mouse Line Expressing Cre Recombinase from the Mu-Opioid Receptor Gene Locus</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/3/ENEURO.0433-19.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The mu-opioid receptor (MOR) modulates nociceptive pathways and reward processing, and mediates the strong analgesic and addictive properties of both medicinal as well as abused opioid drugs. MOR function has been extensively studied, and tools to manipulate or visualize the receptor protein are available. However, circuit mechanisms underlying MOR-mediated effects are less known, because genetic access to MOR-expressing neurons is lacking. Here we report the generation of a knock-in &lt;i&gt;Oprm1&lt;/i&gt;-Cre mouse line, which allows targeting and manipulating MOR opioid-responsive neurons. A cDNA encoding a T2A cleavable peptide and Cre recombinase fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP/Cre) was inserted downstream of the &lt;i&gt;Oprm1&lt;/i&gt; gene sequence. The resulting &lt;i&gt;Oprm1-&lt;/i&gt;Cre line shows intact &lt;i&gt;Oprm1&lt;/i&gt; gene transcription. MOR and EGFP/Cre proteins are coexpressed in the same neurons, and localized in cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments, respectively. MOR signaling is unaltered, demonstrated by maintained DAMGO-induced G-protein activation, and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; MOR function is preserved as indicated by normal morphine-induced analgesia, hyperlocomotion, and sensitization. The Cre recombinase efficiently drives the expression of Cre-dependent reporter genes, shown by local virally mediated expression in the medial habenula and brain-wide fluorescence on breeding with tdTomato reporter mice, the latter showing a distribution patterns typical of MOR expression. Finally, we demonstrate that optogenetic activation of MOR neurons in the ventral tegmental area of &lt;i&gt;Oprm1&lt;/i&gt;-Cre mice evokes strong avoidance behavior, as anticipated from the literature. The &lt;i&gt;Oprm1&lt;/i&gt;-Cre line is therefore an excellent tool for both mapping and functional studies of MOR-positive neurons, and will be of broad interest for opioid, pain, and addiction research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;People often fail to individuate members of social outgroups, a phenomenon known as the outgroup homogeneity effect. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) repetition suppression to investigate the neural representation underlying this effect. In a preregistered study, White human perceivers (&lt;i&gt;N &lt;/i&gt;=&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;29) responded to pairs of faces depicting White or Black targets. In each pair, the second face depicted either the same target as the first face, a different target from the same race, or a scrambled face outline. We localized face-selective neural regions via an independent task, and demonstrated that neural activity in the fusiform face area (FFA) distinguished different faces only when targets belonged to the perceivers’ racial ingroup (White). By contrast, face-selective cortex did not discriminate between other-race individuals. Moreover, across two studies (total &lt;i&gt;N &lt;/i&gt;=&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;67) perceivers were slower to discriminate between different outgroup members and remembered them to a lesser extent. Together, these results suggest that the outgroup homogeneity effect arises when early-to-mid-level visual processing results in an erroneous overlap of representations of outgroup members.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro: Ablation of TRPV1+ Afferent Terminals by Capsaicin Mediates Long-Lasting Analgesia for Trigeminal Neuropathic Pain</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/3/ENEURO.0118-20.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Trigeminal neuropathic pain (TNP) is often resistant to current pharmacotherapy, and there is a pressing need to develop more efficacious treatments. Capsaicin is a pungent ingredient of chili peppers and specifically activates transient receptor potential vanilloid subtype 1 (TRPV1), a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-permeable ion channel. Topical capsaicin invariably induces burning pain. Paradoxically, the transient pain is often followed by prolonged attenuation of the preexisting pathologic pain from the same region. However, the mechanisms underlying capsaicin-induced analgesia are not well understood. Although the reports of the involvement of TRPV1 and TRPV1+ afferents in neuropathic pain are controversial, we recently demonstrated that TRPV1 and TRPV1+ afferents are involved in mechanical hyperalgesia in mice with chronic constriction injury of the infraorbital nerve (ION-CCI). Consistently, chemogenetic inhibition of TRPV1-lineage (TRPV1-LN) afferents attenuated mechanical hyperalgesia and ongoing pain. In mice with ION-CCI, we found that a single focal injection of capsaicin into facial skin led to attenuation of mechanical hyperalgesia over two weeks. Capsaicin treatment also attenuated secondary hyperalgesia in extraterritorial mandibular skin. Furthermore, capsaicin treatment decreased ongoing pain. Longitudinal &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; two-photon imaging of cutaneous nerve fibers showed that such capsaicin-induced analgesia is correlated with cutaneous nerve terminal density. Furthermore, preventing capsaicin-induced ablation of afferent terminals by co-administration of capsaicin with MDL28170, an inhibitor of calpain, abolished capsaicin-induced analgesia. These results suggest that a single focal injection of capsaicin induces long-lasting analgesia for neuropathic pain via selective ablation of TRPV1+ afferent terminals and that TRPV1+ afferents contribute to the maintenance of TNP.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro: Muscarinic-Dependent miR-182 and QR2 Expression Regulation in the Anterior Insula Enables Novel Taste Learning</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/3/ENEURO.0067-20.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;In a similar manner to other learning paradigms, intact muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) neurotransmission or protein synthesis regulation in the anterior insular cortex (aIC) is necessary for appetitive taste learning. Here we describe a parallel local molecular pathway, where GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor control of mAChR activation causes upregulation of miRNA-182 and quinone reductase 2 (QR2) mRNA destabilization in the rodent aIC. Damage to long-term memory by prevention of this process, with the use of mAChR antagonist scopolamine before novel taste learning, can be rescued by local QR2 inhibition, demonstrating that QR2 acts downstream of local muscarinic activation. Furthermore, we prove for the first time the presence of endogenous QR2 cofactors in the brain, establishing QR2 as a functional reductase there. In turn, we show that QR2 activity causes the generation of reactive oxygen species, leading to modulation in Kv2.1 redox state. QR2 expression reduction therefore is a previously unaccounted mode of mAChR-mediated inflammation reduction, and thus adds QR2 to the cadre of redox modulators in the brain. The concomitant reduction in QR2 activity during memory consolidation suggests a complementary mechanism to the well established molecular processes of this phase, by which the cortex gleans important information from general sensory stimuli. This places QR2 as a promising new target to tackle neurodegenerative inflammation and the associated impediment of novel memory formation in diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Clinical and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Outcome Predictors in Pediatric Anti–N‐Methyl‐D‐Aspartate Receptor Encephalitis</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25754?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To evaluate disease symptoms, and clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and to perform longitudinal volumetric MRI analyses in a European multicenter cohort of pediatric anti–N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptor encephalitis (NMDARE) patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We studied 38 children with NMDARE (median age = 12.9 years, range =1–18) and a total of 82 MRI scans for volumetric MRI analyses compared to matched healthy controls. Mixed‐effect models and brain volume &lt;i&gt;z &lt;/i&gt; scores were applied to estimate longitudinal brain volume development. Ordinal logistic regression and ordinal mixed models were used to predict disease outcome and severity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial MRI scans showed abnormal findings in 15 of 38 (39.5%) patients, mostly white matter T2/fluid‐attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensities. Volumetric MRI analyses revealed reductions of whole brain and gray matter as well as hippocampal and basal ganglia volumes in NMDARE children. Longitudinal mixed‐effect models and &lt;i&gt;z &lt;/i&gt; score transformation showed failure of age‐expected brain growth in patients. Importantly, patients with abnormal MRI findings at onset were more likely to have poor outcome (Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category score &amp;gt; 1, incidence rate ratio = 3.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.31–9.31, &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.012) compared to patients with normal MRI. Ordinal logistic regression models corrected for time from onset confirmed abnormal MRI at onset (odds ratio [OR] = 9.90, 95% CI = 2.51–17.28, &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.009), a presentation with sensorimotor deficits (OR = 13.71, 95% CI = 2.68–24.73, &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.015), and a treatment delay &amp;gt; 4 weeks (OR = 5.15, 95% CI = 0.47–9.82, &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.031) as independent predictors of poor clinical outcome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children with NMDARE exhibit significant brain volume loss and failure of age‐expected brain growth. Abnormal MRI findings, a clinical presentation with sensorimotor deficits, and a treatment delay &amp;gt; 4 weeks are associated with worse clinical outcome. These characteristics represent promising prognostic biomarkers in pediatric NMDARE. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Prolonged Continuous Theta Burst Stimulation of the Motor Cortex Modulates Cortical Excitability But not Pain Perception</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00027</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, theta-burst stimulation (TBS) has become a focus of interest in neurostimulatory research. Compared to conventional repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), TBS produces more robust changes in cortical excitability (CE). There is also some evidence of an analgesic effect of the method. Previously published studies have suggested that different TBS parameters elicit opposite effects of TBS on CE. While intermittent TBS (iTBS) facilitates CE, continuous TBS (cTBS) attenuates it. However, prolonged TBS (pTBS) with twice the number of stimuli produces the opposite effect. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study with healthy subjects (n = 24), we investigated the effects of various pTBS (cTBS, iTBS, and placebo TBS) over the right motor cortex on CE and pain perception. Changes in resting motor thresholds (RMTs) and absolute motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes were assessed before and at two time-points (0–5 min; 40–45 min) after pTBS. Tactile and thermal pain thresholds were measured before and 5 min after application. Compared to the placebo, prolonged cTBS (pcTBS) transiently increased MEP amplitudes, while no significant changes were found after prolonged iTBS. However, the facilitation of CE after pcTBS did not induce a parallel analgesic effect. We confirmed that pcTBS with twice the duration converts the conventional inhibitory effect into a facilitatory one. Despite the short-term boost of CE following pcTBS, a corresponding analgesic effect was not demonstrated. Therefore, the results indicate a more complex regulation of pain, which cannot be explained entirely by the modulation of excitability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Brain Derived Exosomes Are a Double-Edged Sword in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00079</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain derived exosomes (BDEs) are extracellular nanovesicles that are collectively released by all cell lineages of the central nervous system and contain cargo from their original cells. They are emerging as key mediators of communication and waste management among neurons, glial cells and connective tissue during both physiological and pathological conditions in the brain. We review the rapidly growing frontier of BDEs biology in recent years including the involvement of exosomes in neuronal development, maintenance and communication through their multiple signaling functions. Particularly, we highlight the important role of exosomes in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), both as a pathogenic agent and as a disease biomarker. Our understanding of such unique nanovesicles may offer not only answers about the (patho) physiological course in AD and associated neurodegenerative diseases but also ideal methods to develop these vesicles as vehicles for drug delivery or as tools to monitor brain diseases in a non-invasive manner because crossing the blood brain barrier is an inherent capability of exosomes. BDEs have potential as biomarkers and as therapeutic tools for AD and related brain disorders in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Dysregulation of RNA-Binding Proteins in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00078</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Genetic analyses of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) have revealed a strong association between mutations in genes encoding many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), including TARDBP, FUS, hnRNPA1, hnRNPA2B1, MATR3, ATXN2, TAF15, TIA-1, and EWSR1, and disease onset/progression. RBPs are a group of evolutionally conserved proteins that participate in multiple steps of RNA metabolism, including splicing, polyadenylation, mRNA stability, localization, and translation. Dysregulation of RBPs, as a consequence of gene mutations, impaired nucleocytoplasmic trafficking, posttranslational modification (PTM), aggregation, and sequestration by abnormal RNA foci, has been shown to be involved in neurodegeneration and the development of ALS. While the exact mechanism by which dysregulated RBPs contribute to ALS remains elusive, emerging evidence supports the notion that both a loss of function and/or a gain of toxic function of these ALS-linked RBPs play a significant role in disease pathogenesis through facilitating abnormal protein interaction, causing aberrant RNA metabolism, and by disturbing ribonucleoprotein granule dynamics and phase transition. In this review article, we summarize the current knowledge on the molecular mechanism by which RBPs are dysregulated and the influence of defective RBPs on cellular homeostasis during the development of ALS. The strategies of ongoing clinical trials targeting RBPs and/or relevant processes are also discussed in the present review.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Visual Feedback of Object Motion Direction Influences the Timing of Grip Force Modulation During Object Manipulation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00198</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;During manipulation, object slipping is prevented by modulating the grip force (GF) in synchrony with motion-related inertial forces, i.e., load force (LF). However, due to conduction delays of the sensory system, GF must be modulated in advance based on predictions of LF changes. It has been proposed that such predictive force control relies on internal representations, i.e., internal models, of the relation between the dynamic of the environment and movement kinematics. Somatosensory and visual feedback plays a primary role in building these internal representations. For instance, it has been shown that manipulation-dependent somatosensory signals contribute to building internal representations of gravity in normal and altered gravitational contexts. Furthermore, delaying the timing of visual feedback of object displacement has been shown to affect GF. Here, we explored whether and the extent to which spatial features of visual feedback movement, such as motion direction, may contribute to GF control. If this were the case, a spatial mismatch between actual (somatosensory) and visual feedback of object motion would elicit changes in GF modulation. We tested this hypothesis by asking participants to generate vertical object movements while visual feedback of object position was congruent (0° rotation) or incongruent (180° or 90°) with the actual object displacement. The role of vision on GF control was quantified by the temporal shift of GF modulation as a function of visual feedback orientation and actual object motion direction. GF control was affected by visual feedback when this was incongruent in the vertical (180°), but not horizontal dimension. Importantly, 180° visual feedback rotation delayed and anticipated GF modulation during upward and downward actual movements, respectively. Our findings suggest that during manipulation, spatial features of visual feedback motion are used to predict upcoming LF changes. Furthermore, the present study provides evidence that an internal model of gravity contributes to GF control by influencing sensory reweighting processes during object manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation With the Theta-Band Portion of the Temporally-Aligned Speech Envelope Improves Speech-in-Noise Comprehension</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00187</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transcranial alternating current stimulation with the speech envelope can modulate the comprehension of speech in noise. The modulation stems from the theta- but not the delta-band portion of the speech envelope, and likely reflects the entrainment of neural activity in the theta frequency band, which may aid the parsing of the speech stream. The influence of the current stimulation on speech comprehension can vary with the time delay between the current waveform and the audio signal. While this effect has been investigated for current stimulation based on the entire speech envelope, it has not yet been measured when the current waveform follows the theta-band portion of the speech envelope. Here, we show that transcranial current stimulation with the speech envelope filtered in the theta frequency band improves speech comprehension as compared to a sham stimulus. The improvement occurs when there is no time delay between the current and the speech stimulus, as well as when the temporal delay is comparatively short, 90 ms. In contrast, longer delays, as well as negative delays, do not impact speech-in-noise comprehension. Moreover, we find that the improvement of speech comprehension at no or small delays of the current stimulation is consistent across participants. Our findings suggest that cortical entrainment to speech is most influenced through current stimulation that follows the speech envelope with at most a small delay. They also open a path to enhancing the perception of speech in noise, an issue that is particularly important for people with hearing impairment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00148</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent research into axon-glial interactions in the nervous system has made a compelling case that glial cells have a relevant role in the metabolic support of axons, and that, in the case of myelinating cells, this role is independent of myelination itself. In this mini-review article, we summarize some of those observations and focus on Schwann cells (SC), drawing parallels between glia of the central and peripheral nervous systems (PNS), pointing out limitations in current knowledge, and discussing its potential clinical relevance. First, we introduce SC, their development and main roles, and follow with an evolutionary perspective of glial metabolic function. Then we provide evidence of the myelin-independent aspects of axonal support and their coupling to neuronal metabolism. Finally, we address the opportunity to use SC-axon metabolic interactions as therapeutic targets to treat peripheral neuropathies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Neuronal Replacement as a Tool for Basal Ganglia Circuitry Repair: 40 Years in Perspective</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00146</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The ability of new neurons to promote repair of brain circuitry depends on their capacity to re-establish afferent and efferent connections with the host. In this review article, we give an overview of past and current efforts to restore damaged connectivity in the adult mammalian brain using implants of fetal neuroblasts or stem cell-derived neuronal precursors, with a focus on strategies aimed to repair damaged basal ganglia circuitry induced by lesions that mimic the pathology seen in humans affected by Parkinson’s or Huntington’s disease. Early work performed in rodents showed that neuroblasts obtained from striatal primordia or fetal ventral mesencephalon can become anatomically and functionally integrated into lesioned striatal and nigral circuitry, establish afferent and efferent connections with the lesioned host, and reverse the lesion-induced behavioral impairments. Recent progress in the generation of striatal and nigral progenitors from pluripotent stem cells have provided compelling evidence that they can survive and mature in the lesioned brain and re-establish afferent and efferent axonal connectivity with a remarkable degree of specificity. The studies of cell-based circuitry repair are now entering a new phase. The introduction of genetic and virus-based techniques for brain connectomics has opened entirely new possibilities for studies of graft-host integration and connectivity, and the access to more refined experimental techniques, such as chemo- and optogenetics, has provided new powerful tools to study the capacity of grafted neurons to impact the function of the host brain. Progress in this field will help to guide the efforts to develop therapeutic strategies for cell-based repair in Huntington’s and Parkinson’s disease and other neurodegenerative conditions involving damage to basal ganglia circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Capgras Delusion in Posterior Cortical Atrophy–A Quantitative Multimodal Imaging Single Case Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00133</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Although Alzheimer’s disease presents homogeneous histopathology, it causes several clinical phenotypes depending on brain regions involved. Beside the most abundant memory variant, several atypical variants exist. Among them posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) is associated with severe visuospatial/visuoperceptual deficits in the absence of significant primary ocular disease. Here, we report for the first time a case of Capgras delusion—a delusional misidentification syndrome, where patients think that familiar persons are replaced by identical “doubles” or an impostor—in a patient with PCA. The 57-year-old female patient was diagnosed with PCA and developed Capgras delusion 8 years after first symptoms. The patient did not recognize her husband, misidentified him as a stranger, and perceived him as a threat. Such misidentifications did not happen for other persons. Events could be interrupted by reassuring the husband’s identity by the patient’s female friend or children. We applied in-depth multimodal neuroimaging phenotyping and used single-subject voxel-based morphometry to identify atrophy changes specifically related to the development of the Capgras delusion. The latter, based on structural T1 magnetic resonance imaging, revealed progressive gray matter volume decline in occipital and temporoparietal areas, involving more the right than the left hemisphere, especially at the beginning. Correspondingly, the right fusiform gyrus was already affected by atrophy at baseline, whereas the left fusiform gyrus became involved in the further disease course. At baseline, glucose hypometabolism as measured by positron emission tomography (PET) with F18-fluorodesoxyglucose (FDG-PET) was evident in the parietooccipital cortex, more pronounced right-sided, and in the right frontotemporal cortex. Amyloid accumulation as assessed by PET with F18-florbetaben was found in the gray matter of the neocortex indicating underlying Alzheimer’s disease. Appearance of the Capgras delusion was related to atrophy in the right posterior cingulate gyrus/precuneus, as well as right middle frontal gyrus/frontal eye field, supporting right frontal areas as particularly relevant for Capgras delusion. Atrophy in these regions respectively might affect the default mode and dorsal attention networks as shown by meta-analytical co-activation and resting state functional connectivity analyses. This case elucidates the brain-behavior relationship in PCA and Capgras delusion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Fitness Level Influences White Matter Microstructure in Postmenopausal Women</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00129</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aerobic exercise has both neuroprotective and neurorehabilitative benefits. However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood and need to be investigated, especially in postmenopausal women, who are at increased risk of age-related disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and stroke. To advance our understanding of the potential neurological benefits of aerobic exercise in aging women, we examined anatomical and functional responses that may differentiate women of varying cardiorespiratory fitness using neuroimaging and neurophysiology. A total of 35 healthy postmenopausal women were recruited (59 ± 3 years) and cardiorespiratory fitness estimated (22–70 mL/kg/min). Transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to assess -aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate (Glu) receptor function in the primary motor cortex (M1), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was used to quantify GABA and Glu concentrations in M1. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess mean cortical thickness (MCT) of sensorimotor and frontal regions, while the microstructure of sensorimotor and other white matter tracts was evaluated through diffusion tensor imaging. Regression analysis revealed that higher fitness levels were associated with improved microstructure in pre-motor and sensory tracts, and the hippocampal cingulum. Fitness level was not associated with MCT, MRS, or neurophysiology measures. These data indicate that, in postmenopausal women, higher cardiorespiratory fitness is linked with preserved selective white matter microstructure, particularly in areas that influence sensorimotor control and memory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Further, we analyzed the 3D genome organization using 3C-seq data, which revealed spatial proximity among the centromeres as well as telomeres of seven chromosomes in &lt;i&gt;C. tropicalis&lt;/i&gt;. Intriguingly, we observed evidence of inter-centromeric translocations in the common ancestor of &lt;i&gt;C. albicans&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C. tropicalis&lt;/i&gt;.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58243</link>
	<content:encoded>Yeast DEAD-box helicase Ded1 stimulates translation initiation, particularly of mRNAs with structured 5'UTRs. Interactions of the Ded1 N-terminal domain (NTD) with eIF4A, and Ded1-CTD with eIF4G, subunits of eIF4F, enhance Ded1 unwinding activity and stimulation of preinitiation complex (PIC) assembly in vitro. However, the importance of these interactions, and of Ded1-eIF4E association, in vivo were poorly understood. We identified separate amino-acid clusters in the Ded1-NTD required for binding to eIF4A or eIF4E in vitro. Disrupting each cluster selectively impairs native Ded1 association with eIF4A or eIF4E, and reduces cell growth, polysome assembly, and translation of reporter mRNAs with structured 5'UTRs. It also impairs Ded1 stimulation of PIC assembly on a structured mRNA in vitro. Ablating Ded1 interactions with eIF4A/eIF4E unveiled a requirement for the Ded1-CTD for robust initiation. Thus, Ded1 function in vivo is stimulated by independent interactions of its NTD with eIF4E and eIF4A, and its CTD with eIF4G.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Plasmodium falciparum translational machinery condones polyadenosine repeats</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57799</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; is causative agent of human malaria. Sixty percent of mRNAs from its extremely AT-rich (81%) genome harbor long polyadenosine (polyA) runs within their ORFs, distinguishing the parasite from its hosts and other sequenced organisms. Recent studies indicate polyA runs cause ribosome stalling and frameshifting, triggering mRNA surveillance pathways and attenuating protein synthesis. Here, we show that the &lt;i&gt;P. falciparum&lt;/i&gt; is an exception to this rule. We demonstrate that both endogenous genes and reporter sequences containing long polyA runs are efficiently and accurately translated in &lt;i&gt;P. falciparum&lt;/i&gt; cells. We show that polyA runs do not elicit any response from No Go Decay (NGD) or result in the production of frameshifted proteins. This is in stark contrast to what we observe in human cells or &lt;i&gt;T. thermophile&lt;/i&gt;, an organism with similar AT-content. Finally, using stalling reporters we show that Plasmodium cells evolved not to have a fully functional NGD pathway.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Structure of substrate-bound SMG1-8-9 kinase complex reveals molecular basis for phosphorylation specificity</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57127</link>
	<content:encoded>PI3K-related kinases (PIKKs) are large Serine/Threonine (Ser/Thr)-protein kinases central to the regulation of many fundamental cellular processes. PIKK family member SMG1 orchestrates progression of an RNA quality control pathway, termed nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), by phosphorylating the NMD factor UPF1. Phosphorylation of UPF1 occurs in its unstructured N- and C-terminal regions at Serine/Threonine-Glutamine (SQ) motifs. How SMG1 and other PIKKs specifically recognize SQ motifs has remained unclear. Here, we present a cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstruction of a human SMG1-8-9 kinase complex bound to a UPF1 phosphorylation site at an overall resolution of 2.9 Å. This structure provides the first snapshot of a human PIKK with a substrate-bound active site. Together with biochemical assays, it rationalizes how SMG1 and perhaps other PIKKs specifically phosphorylate Ser/Thr-containing motifs with a glutamine residue at position +1 and a hydrophobic residue at position -1, thus elucidating the molecular basis for phosphorylation site recognition.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: PrkA controls peptidoglycan biosynthesis through the essential phosphorylation of ReoM</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56048</link>
	<content:encoded>Peptidoglycan (PG) is the main component of bacterial cell walls and the target for many antibiotics. PG biosynthesis is tightly coordinated with cell wall growth and turnover, and many of these control activities depend upon PASTA-domain containing eukaryotic-like serine/threonine protein kinases (PASTA-eSTK) that sense PG fragments. However, only a few PG biosynthetic enzymes are direct kinase substrates. Here, we identify the conserved ReoM protein as a novel PASTA-eSTK substrate in the Gram-positive pathogen &lt;i&gt;Listeria monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt;. Our data show that the phosphorylation of ReoM is essential as it controls ClpCP-dependent proteolytic degradation of the essential enzyme MurA, which catalyses the first committed step in PG biosynthesis. We also identify ReoY as a second novel factor required for degradation of ClpCP substrates. Collectively, our data imply that the first committed step of PG biosynthesis is activated through control of ClpCP protease activity in response to signals of PG homeostasis imbalance.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55414</link>
	<content:encoded>Evolutionary innovations allow populations to colonize new ecological niches. We previously reported that aerobic growth on citrate (Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) evolved in an &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; population during adaptation to a minimal glucose medium containing citrate (DM25). Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; variants can also grow in citrate-only medium (DM0), a novel environment for &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;. To study adaptation to this new niche, we founded two sets of Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; populations and evolved them for 2,500 generations in DM0 or DM25. The evolved lineages acquired numerous parallel mutations, many mediated by transposable elements. Several also evolved amplifications of regions containing the &lt;i&gt;maeA&lt;/i&gt; gene. Unexpectedly, some evolved populations and clones show apparent declines in fitness. We also found evidence of substantial cell death in Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; clones. Our results thus demonstrate rapid novel trait refinement and adaptation to the novel citrate niche, while also suggesting a recalcitrant mismatch between &lt;i&gt;E. coli &lt;/i&gt;physiology and growth on citrate.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Hippocampal and cortical mechanisms at retrieval explain variability in episodic remembering in older adults</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55335</link>
	<content:encoded>Age-related episodic memory decline is characterized by striking heterogeneity across individuals. Hippocampal pattern completion is a fundamental process supporting episodic memory. Yet, the degree to which this mechanism is impaired with age, and contributes to variability in episodic memory, remains unclear. We combine univariate and multivariate analyses of fMRI data from a large cohort of cognitively normal older adults (N=100) to measure hippocampal activity and cortical reinstatement during retrieval of trial-unique associations. Trial-wise analyses revealed that (a) hippocampal activity scaled with reinstatement strength, (b) cortical reinstatement partially mediated the relationship between hippocampal activity and associative retrieval, (c) older age weakened cortical reinstatement and its relationship to memory behaviour. Moreover, individual differences in the strength of hippocampal activity and cortical reinstatement explained unique variance in performance across multiple assays of episodic memory. These results indicate that fMRI indices of hippocampal pattern completion explain within- and across-individual memory variability in older adults.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Conformational distributions of isolated myosin motor domains encode their mechanochemical properties</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55132</link>
	<content:encoded>Myosin motor domains perform an extraordinary diversity of biological functions despite sharing a common mechanochemical cycle. Motors are adapted to their function, in part, by tuning the thermodynamics and kinetics of steps in this cycle. However, it remains unclear how sequence encodes these differences, since biochemically distinct motors often have nearly indistinguishable crystal structures. We hypothesized that sequences produce distinct biochemical phenotypes by modulating the relative probabilities of an ensemble of conformations primed for different functional roles. To test this hypothesis, we modeled the distribution of conformations for 12 myosin motor domains by building Markov state models (MSMs) from an unprecedented two milliseconds of all-atom, explicit-solvent molecular dynamics simulations. Comparing motors reveals shifts in the balance between nucleotide-favorable and nucleotide-unfavorable P-loop conformations that predict experimentally measured duty ratios and ADP release rates better than sequence or individual structures. This result demonstrates the power of an ensemble perspective for interrogating sequence-function relationships.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54898</link>
	<content:encoded>Errors can occur at any level during the replication and transcription of genetic information. Genetic mutations derived mainly from replication errors have been extensively studied. However, fundamental details of transcript errors, such as their rate, molecular spectrum, and functional effects, remain largely unknown. To globally identify transcript errors, we applied an adapted rolling-circle sequencing approach to &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Agrobacterium tumefaciens&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Mesoplasma florum,&lt;/i&gt; revealing transcript-error rates 3 to 4 orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding genetic mutation rates. The majority of detected errors would result in amino-acid changes, if translated. With errors identified from 9929 loci, the molecular spectrum and distribution of errors were uncovered in great detail. A G→A substitution bias was observed in &lt;i&gt;M. florum&lt;/i&gt;, which apparently has an error-prone RNA polymerase. Surprisingly, an increased frequency of nonsense errors towards the 3′ end of mRNAs was observed, suggesting a Nonsense-Mediated Decay-like quality-control mechanism in prokaryotes.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53608</link>
	<content:encoded>The body plan along the anteroposterior axis and regional identities are specified by the spatiotemporal expression of &lt;i&gt;Hox&lt;/i&gt; genes. Multistep controls are required for their unique expression patterns; however, the molecular mechanisms behind the tight control of &lt;i&gt;Hox&lt;/i&gt; genes are not fully understood. In this study, we demonstrated that the &lt;i&gt;Lin28a&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;let-7&lt;/i&gt; pathway is critical for axial elongation. &lt;i&gt;Lin28a&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice exhibited axial shortening with mild skeletal transformations of vertebrae, which were consistent with results in mice with tail bud-specific mutants of Lin28a. The accumulation of &lt;i&gt;let-7&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Lin28a&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice resulted in the reduction of PRC1 occupancy at the &lt;i&gt;Hox&lt;/i&gt; cluster loci by targeting &lt;i&gt;Cbx2&lt;/i&gt;. Consistently, Lin28a loss in embryonic stem-like cells led to aberrant induction of posterior &lt;i&gt;Hox&lt;/i&gt; genes, which was rescued by the knockdown of &lt;i&gt;let-7&lt;/i&gt;. These results suggest that the &lt;i&gt;Lin28&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;let-7&lt;/i&gt; pathway is involved in the modulation of the ‘&lt;i&gt;Hox&lt;/i&gt; code’ via &lt;i&gt;Polycomb&lt;/i&gt; regulation during axial patterning.</content:encoded>

Tumour hypoxia is a well-studied phenomenon with implications in cancer progression, treatment resistance, and patient survival. While a clear adverse prognosticator, hypoxia is also a theoretically ideal target for guided drug delivery. This idea has lead to the development of hypoxia-activated prodrugs (HAPs): a class of chemotherapeutics which remain inactive in the body until metabolized within hypoxic regions. In theory, these drugs have the potential for increased tumour selectivity and have therefore been the focus of numerous preclinical studies. Unfortunately, HAPs have had mixed results in clinical trials, necessitating further study in order to harness their therapeutic potential. One possible avenue for the improvement of HAPs is through the selective application of anti angiogenic agents (AAs) to improve drug delivery. Such techniques have been used in combination with other conventional chemotherapeutics to great effect in many studies. A further benefit is theoretically achieved through nanocell administration of the combination, though this idea has not been the subject of any experimental or mathematical studies to date. In the following, a mathematical model is outlined and used to compare the predicted efficacies of separate vs. nanocell administration for AAs and HAPs in tumours. The model is experimentally motivated, both in mathematical form and parameter values. Preliminary results of the model are highlighted throughout which qualitatively agree with existing experimental evidence. The novel prediction of our model is an improvement in the efficacy of AA/HAP combination therapies when administered through nanocells as opposed to separately. While this study specifically models treatment on glioblastoma, similar analyses could be performed for other vascularized tumours, making the results potentially applicable to a range of tumour types.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CIXvvwFFclE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Dietary nutrients provide macromolecules necessary for organism growth and development. In response to animal feeding, evolutionarily conserved growth signaling pathways are activated, leading to increased rates of cell proliferation and tissue growth. It remains unclear how different cell types within developing tissues coordinate growth in response to dietary nutrients and whether coordinated growth of different cell types is necessary for proper tissue function. Here, we report that &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; neural stem cells, known as neuroblasts, reactivate from developmental quiescence in a dietary-nutrient–dependent manner. Neuroblast reactivation in the brain requires nonautonomous activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) signaling from cortex glia and tracheal processes, both of which are closely associated with neuroblasts. Furthermore, PI3-kinase activation in neuroblasts is required nonautonomously for glial membrane expansion and robust neuroblast–glial contact. Finally, PI3-kinase is required cell autonomously for nutrient-dependent growth of neuroblasts, glia, and trachea. Of the 7 &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; insulin-like peptides (Dilps), we find that Dilp-2 is required for PI3-kinase activation and growth coordination between neuroblasts and glia in the brain. Dilp-2 induces brain cortex glia to initiate membrane growth and make first contact with quiescent neuroblasts. After contact, neuroblasts increase in size and reenter S-phase. Once reactivated from quiescence, neuroblasts promote growth of cortex glia, which, in turn, form a selective membrane barrier around neuroblasts and their newborn progeny. Our results highlight the importance of bidirectional growth signaling between neural stem cells and surrounding cell types in the brain in response to nutrition and demonstrate how coordinated growth among different cell types drives tissue morphogenesis and function.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/pBqX1ztcA14&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

We have used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to provide important new insights into the function of the human placenta in utero. We have measured slow net flow and high net oxygenation in the placenta in vivo, which are consistent with efficient delivery of oxygen from mother to fetus. Our experimental evidence substantiates previous hypotheses on the effects of spiral artery remodelling in utero and also indicates rapid venous drainage from the placenta, which is important because this outflow has been largely neglected in the past. Furthermore, beyond Braxton Hicks contractions, which involve the entire uterus, we have identified a new physiological phenomenon, the ‘utero-placental pump’, by which the placenta and underlying uterine wall contract independently of the rest of the uterus, expelling maternal blood from the intervillous space.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/A0htTTl-kOU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;The brain vasculature develops by angiogenesis from preformed blood vessels in the cephalic mesenchyme. Here we show that in addition, avascular cells expressing primitive erythroid, hemangioblast, and endothelial makers exist in the developing cephalic mesenchyme and neuroepithelium where they generate angiogenic, vasculogenic, and hemogenic foci. From E10.5 to E13.5, the neuroepithelial vasculogenic foci were an additional source of blood vessel formation in the developing brain. Thus, the brain vasculature develops in part by hemovasculogenesis, a process in which vasculogenesis and hematopoiesis occur simultaneously.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vascular structures in the developing brain are thought to form via angiogenesis from preformed blood vessels in the cephalic mesenchyme. Immunohistochemical studies of developing mouse brain from E10.5 to E13.5 revealed the presence of avascular blood islands of primitive erythroid cells expressing hemangioblast markers (Flk1, Tal1/Scl1, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1, vascular endothelial‐cadherin, and CD34) and an endothelial marker recognized by &lt;i&gt;Griffonia simplicifolia &lt;/i&gt; isolectin B4 (IB4) in the cephalic mesenchyme. These cells formed a perineural vascular plexus from which angiogenic sprouts originated and penetrated the neuroepithelium. In addition, avascular isolated cells expressing primitive erythroid, hemangioblast and endothelial makers were visible in the neuroepithelium where they generated vasculogenic and hemogenic foci. From E10.5 to E13.5, these vasculogenic foci were a source of new blood vessel formation in the developing brain. In vitro, cultured E13.5 brain endothelial cells contained hemogenic endothelial cells capable of generating erythroid cells. Similar cells were present in primary cultures of dissociated cells from E10.5 embryonic head. Our results provide new evidence that the brain vasculature, like that of the yolk sac and the eye choriocapillaris and hyaloid vascular systems, develops at least in part via hemovasculogenesis, a process in which vasculogenesis and hematopoiesis occur simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Retrospectively assessed subjective effects of initial opioid use differ between opioid misusers with opioid use disorder (OUD) and those who never progressed to OUD: Data from a pilot and a replication sample&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ac678dc2-95f0-48b7-8b4b-5bedf925d120/jnr24643-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subjective effects of initial opioid misuse were assessed in two samples of opioid misusers that included low‐level users who never met criteria for opioid use disorder (OUD) and heavier users with OUD. In both samples, OUD+ individuals reported greater euphoria, activation, pruritus, and internalizing symptoms (replication sample data are displayed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attempts to identify opioid users with increased risk of escalating to opioid use disorder (OUD) have had limited success. Retrospectively assessed subjective effects of initial opioid misuse were compared in a pilot sample of opioid misusers (nonmedical use ≤60 times lifetime) who had never met criteria for OUD (&lt;i&gt;N &lt;/i&gt; = 14) and heroin‐addicted individuals in treatment for OUD (&lt;i&gt;N &lt;/i&gt; = 15). Relative to opioid misusers without a lifetime OUD diagnosis, individuals with OUD reported greater euphoria and other positive emotions, activation, pruritus, and internalizing symptoms. Consistent with these findings, proxy Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI) Amphetamine Group, and Morphine Benzedrine Group scale mean item scores were significantly higher in those with OUD. Replication was attempted in opioid misusers with (&lt;i&gt;N &lt;/i&gt; = 25) and without OUD (&lt;i&gt;N &lt;/i&gt; = 25) who were assessed as part of an ongoing genetic study. We observed similar significant between‐group differences in individual subjective effect items and ARCI scale mean item scores in the replication sample. We, thus confirm findings from prior reports that retrospectively assessed subjective responses to initial opioid exposure differ significantly between opioid users who do, and do not, progress to OUD. Our report extends these findings in comparisons limited to opioid misusers. Additional research will be necessary to examine prospectively whether the assessment of subjective effects after initial use has predictive utility in the identification of individuals more likely to progress to OUD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Is RBD a risk factor for impulse control disorder in Parkinson’s disease?</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25798?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assess the association between REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and other determinants and incident impulse control disorder behaviors (ICBs) in patients with early Parkinson’s disease (PD) using longitudinal data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;401 newly‐diagnosed PD patients were prospectively evaluated at baseline (BL), month 6, and annually for 5 years. Probable RBD (pRBD) was assessed with the RBD Screening Questionnaire and dichotomized using a cut‐off value ≥6. The association of BL and time‐dependent (TD) pRBD and other covariates with the development of ICB symptoms, was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression and general estimating equations logistic regression. Models considered adjustment for age, sex, MDS‐UPDRS III, Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS‐15), RBD medication use, total levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD), and dopamine agonist (DA) and antidepressant medication use.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both baseline pRBD and TD pRBD were not associated with an increased risk for incident ICB symptoms after adjustment for covariates (adjusted HR=1.17, p=0.458 and HR=1.27, p=0.257 respectively). In a modified‐TD pRBD model (i.e., considering subjects as pRBD onward from the first time point with RBDSQ score ≥6), the risk for incident ICB symptoms was higher in pRBD in unadjusted (HR=1.48, p=0.038), but not adjusted (HR=1.29, p=0.202) models. TD DA use (HR=1.64, p=0.039), TD GDS‐15 score (HR=1.12, p&amp;lt;0.001), and male sex (year 3: HR=2.10,p=0.009; year 4: HR=3.04,p=0.006; year 5: HR=4.40,p=0.007) were associated with increased ICB symptom risk.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pRBD is not clearly associated with ICB symptom development in early PD, in contrast to DA use, depression, and male sex.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Hippocampal Shape Is Associated with Memory Deficits in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25762?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cognitive problems, especially disturbances in episodic memory, and hippocampal sclerosis are common in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), but little is known about the relationship of hippocampal morphology with memory. We aimed to relate hippocampal surface‐shape patterns to verbal and visual learning.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We analyzed hippocampal surface shapes on high‐resolution magnetic resonance images and the Adult Memory and Information Processing Battery in 145 unilateral refractory TLE patients undergoing epilepsy surgery, a validation set of 55 unilateral refractory TLE patients, and 39 age‐ and sex‐matched healthy volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both left TLE (LTLE) and right TLE (RTLE) patients had lower verbal (LTLE 44 ± 11; RTLE 45 ± 10) and visual learning (LTLE 34 ± 8, RTLE 30 ± 8) scores than healthy controls (verbal 58 ± 8, visual 39 ± 6; &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Verbal learning was more impaired the greater the atrophy of the left superolateral hippocampal head. In contrast, visual memory was worse with greater bilateral inferomedial hippocampal atrophy. Postsurgical verbal memory decline was more common in LTLE than in RTLE (reliable change index in LTLE 27% vs RTLE 7%, &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.006), whereas there were no differences in postsurgical visual memory decline between those groups. Preoperative atrophy of the left hippocampal tail predicted postsurgical verbal memory decline.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memory deficits in TLE are associated with specific morphological alterations of the hippocampus, which could help stratify TLE patients into those at high versus low risk of presurgical or postsurgical memory deficits. This knowledge could improve planning and prognosis of selective epilepsy surgery and neuropsychological counseling in TLE. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro: Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) Controls the Expression of the Transcriptional Activator Neuronal PAS Domain Protein 4 (NPAS4) and Synaptic GABA Release</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/3/ENEURO.0322-19.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The amyloid precursor protein (APP) has been extensively studied as the precursor of the β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide, the major component of the senile plaques found in the brain of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients. However, the function of APP per se in neuronal physiology remains to be fully elucidated. APP is expressed at high levels in the brain. It resembles a cell adhesion molecule or a membrane receptor, suggesting that its function relies on cell-cell interaction and/or activation of intracellular signaling pathways. In this respect, the APP intracellular domain (AICD) was reported to act as a transcriptional regulator. Here, we used a transcriptome-based approach to identify the genes transcriptionally regulated by APP in the rodent embryonic cortex and on maturation of primary cortical neurons. Surprisingly, the overall transcriptional changes were subtle, but a more detailed analysis pointed to genes clustered in neuronal-activity dependent pathways. In particular, we observed a decreased transcription of neuronal PAS domain protein 4 (NPAS4) in APP–/– neurons. NPAS4 is an inducible transcription factor (ITF) regulated by neuronal depolarization. The downregulation of NPAS4 co-occurs with an increased production of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA and a reduced expression of the GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors α1. CRISPR-Cas-mediated silencing of NPAS4 in neurons led to similar observations. Patch-clamp investigation did not reveal any functional decrease of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors activity, but long-term potentiation (LTP) measurement supported an increased GABA component in synaptic transmission of APP–/– mice. Together, NPAS4 appears to be a downstream target involved in APP-dependent regulation of inhibitory synaptic transmission.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro: Increased Tau Expression Correlates with Neuronal Maturation in the Developing Human Cerebral Cortex</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/3/ENEURO.0058-20.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Although best known for its role in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), tau is expressed throughout brain development, although it remains unclear when and which cell types this expression occurs and how it affects disease states in both fetal and neonatal periods. We thus sought to map tau mRNA and protein expression in the developing human brain at the cellular level using a combination of existing single-cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNAseq) data, RNA &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization (RNAscope), and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Using sc-RNAseq, we found that tau mRNA expression begins in radial glia but increases dramatically as migrating neuronal precursors mature. Specifically, &lt;i&gt;TBR1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; maturing neurons and &lt;i&gt;SYN&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; mature neurons showed significantly higher mRNA expression than &lt;i&gt;GFAP&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;i&gt;NES&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; radial glia or &lt;i&gt;TBR2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; intermediate progenitors. By RNAscope, we found low levels of tau mRNA in subventricular zone (SVZ) radial glia and deep white matter intermediate progenitors, with an increase in more superficially located maturing and mature neurons. By total-tau IHC, the germinal matrix and SVZ showed little protein expression, although both RNAscope and sc-RNAseq showed mRNA, and Western blotting revealed significantly less protein in those areas compared with more mature regions. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cortical organoids showed a similar tau expression pattern by sc-RNAseq and RNAscope. Our results indicate that tau increases with neuronal maturation in both the developing fetal brain and iPSC-derived organoids and forms a basis for future research on regulatory mechanisms triggering the onset of tau gene transcription and translation, which may represent potential therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative tauopathies and neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Nilotinib Effects on Safety, Tolerability, and Biomarkers in Alzheimer's Disease</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25775?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preclinical evidence with nilotinib, a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)‐approved drug for leukemia, indicates improvement in Alzheimer's disease phenotypes. We investigated whether nilotinib is safe, and detectable in cerebrospinal fluid, and alters biomarkers and clinical decline in Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This single‐center, phase 2, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study investigated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of nilotinib, and measured biomarkers in participants with mild to moderate dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. The diagnosis was supported by cerebrospinal fluid or amyloid positron emission tomography biomarkers. Nilotinib 150 mg versus matching placebo was taken orally once daily for 26 weeks followed by nilotinib 300 mg versus placebo for another 26 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 37 individuals enrolled, 27 were women and the mean (SD) age was 70.7 (6.48) years. Nilotinib was well‐tolerated, although more adverse events, particularly mood swings, were noted with the 300 mg dose. In the nilotinib group, central nervous system (CNS) amyloid burden was significantly reduced in the frontal lobe compared to the placebo group. Cerebrospinal fluid Aβ40 was reduced at 6 months and Aβ42 was reduced at 12 months in the nilotinib group compared to the placebo. Hippocampal volume loss was attenuated (−27%) at 12 months and phospho‐tau‐181 was reduced at 6 months and 12 months in the nilotinib group.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nilotinib is safe and achieves pharmacologically relevant cerebrospinal fluid concentrations. Biomarkers of disease were altered in response to nilotinib treatment. These data support a larger, longer, multicenter study to determine the safety and efficacy of nilotinib in Alzheimer's disease. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year, millions of Australian Bogong moths (&lt;i&gt;Agrotis infusa &lt;/i&gt;) complete an astonishing journey: In Spring, they migrate over 1,000 km from their breeding grounds to the alpine regions of the Snowy Mountains, where they endure the hot summer in the cool climate of alpine caves. In autumn, the moths return to their breeding grounds, where they mate, lay eggs and die. These moths can use visual cues in combination with the geomagnetic field to guide their flight, but how these cues are processed and integrated into the brain to drive migratory behavior is unknown. To generate an access point for functional studies, we provide a detailed description of the Bogong moth's brain. Based on immunohistochemical stainings against synapsin and serotonin (5HT), we describe the overall layout as well as the fine structure of all major neuropils, including the regions that have previously been implicated in compass‐based navigation. The resulting average brain atlas consists of 3D reconstructions of 25 separate neuropils, comprising the most detailed account of a moth brain to date. Our results show that the Bogong moth brain follows the typical lepidopteran ground pattern, with no major specializations that can be attributed to their spectacular migratory lifestyle. These findings suggest that migratory behavior does not require widespread modifications of brain structure, but might be achievable via small adjustments of neural circuitry in key brain areas. Locating these subtle changes will be a challenging task for the future, for which our study provides an essential anatomical framework.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Cross‐modal modulation of cell activity by sound in first‐order visual thalamic nucleus&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a3dcaa16-26e6-4f8b-b9cd-7fd7aa46c8d2/cne24865-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound stimulation modulated cell activities in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of anesthetized rats with regard to response magnitude, latency, jitter and burst spiking of onset and late visual responses evoked by single or double flashlight stimulation. Suppression predominated in modulation but de novo cell activity was also induced. Modulation was observed in cells morphologically comparable to X‐, Y‐, and W‐like projection cells and interneurons. Auditory influence is considered incorporated into parallel channels of visual processing in the first‐order thalamic nucleus.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cross‐modal auditory influence on cell activity in the primary visual cortex emerging at short latencies raises the possibility that the first‐order visual thalamic nucleus, which is considered dedicated to unimodal visual processing, could contribute to cross‐modal sensory processing, as has been indicated in the auditory and somatosensory systems. To test this hypothesis, the effects of sound stimulation on visual cell activity in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus were examined in anesthetized rats, using juxta‐cellular recording and labeling techniques. Visual responses evoked by light (white LED) were modulated by sound (noise burst) given simultaneously or 50–400 ms after the light, even though sound stimuli alone did not evoke cell activity. Alterations of visual response were observed in 71% of cells (57/80) with regard to response magnitude, latency, and/or burst spiking. Suppression predominated in response magnitude modulation, but de novo responses were also induced by combined stimulation. Sound affected not only onset responses but also late responses. Late responses were modulated by sound given before or after onset responses. Further, visual responses evoked by the second light stimulation of a double flash with a 150–700 ms interval were also modulated by sound given together with the first light stimulation. In morphological analysis of labeled cells projection cells comparable to X‐, Y‐, and W‐like cells and interneurons were all susceptible to auditory influence. These findings suggest that the first‐order visual thalamic nucleus incorporates auditory influence into parallel and complex thalamic visual processing for cross‐modal modulation of visual attention and perception.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Identifying spinal afferent (sensory) nerve endings that innervate the marrow cavity and periosteum using anterograde tracing&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3823713c-659b-4587-b669-c47da501e46f/cne24862-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The marrow cavity, trabecular bone, and the periosteum are all innervated by myelinated spinal afferent nerve endings, and both peptidergic and nonpeptidergic unmyelinated spinal afferent nerve endings, and there is heterogeneity with respect to their morphology. This approach to selective anterograde labeling of nerve terminal endings will help better identify how different sub‐populations of sensory neurons interact with bone.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While sensory and sympathetic neurons are known to innervate bone, previous studies have found it difficult to unequivocally identify and characterize only those that are of sensory origin. In this study, we have utilized an &lt;i&gt;in vivo &lt;/i&gt; anterograde tracing technique to selectively label spinal afferent (sensory) nerve endings that innervate the periosteum and marrow cavity of murine long bones. Unilateral injections of dextran–biotin (anterograde tracer; 20% in saline, 50–100 nl) were made into L3–L5 dorsal root ganglia. After a 10‐day recovery period to allow sufficient time for selective anterograde transport of the tracer to nerve terminal endings in bone, the periosteum (whole‐mount) and underlying bone were collected, processed to reveal anterograde labeling, and immuno‐labeled with antibodies directed against protein gene product (pan‐neuronal marker; PGP9.5), tyrosine hydroxylase (sympathetic neuron marker; TH), calcitonin gene‐related protein (peptidergic nociceptor marker; CGRP), and/or neurofilament 200 (myelinated axon marker; NF200). Anterograde‐labeled nerve endings were dispersed throughout the periosteum and marrow cavity and could be identified in close apposition to blood vessels and at sites distant from them. The periosteum and the marrow cavity were each innervated by myelinated (NF200+) sensory neurons, and unmyelinated (NF200‑) sensory neurons that were either peptidergic (CGRP+) or nonpeptidergic (CGRP‑). Spinal afferent nerve endings did not express TH, and lacked the cylindrical morphology around blood vessels characteristic of sympathetic innervation. This approach to selective labeling of sensory nerve terminal endings will help to better identify how different sub‐populations of sensory neurons, and their peripheral nerve terminal endings, interact with bone.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Visual pathways in the brain of the jumping spider Marpissa muscosa&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3c5e9aaf-ee76-4896-915e-6e59bd798dd1/cne24861-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most spider species possess eight eyes, of which two (the principal eyes) are used for object discrimination, whereas the other three pairs (secondary eyes) detect movement. Jumping spiders are particularly renowned for their visual abilities and we studied the neural substrate for visual processing in the jumping spider &lt;i&gt;Marpissa muscosa &lt;/i&gt; 
&lt;i&gt;. &lt;/i&gt; We show that the principal eye pathway involves two subsequent visual neuropils and the arcuate body. Among the secondary eyes, the anterior lateral and the posterior lateral eyes are connected to two subsequent visual neuropils (AL1, PL1, and AL2/PL2) and the mushroom body (MBp). They also share an additional second‐order visual neuropil (L2), which might serve as integration center. The small posterior median eye is connected via a single visual neuropil (PM1) with the arcuate body and might thus not detect movement. Additional data on the visual pathways in the ctenid spider &lt;i&gt;Cupiennius salei &lt;/i&gt;  are provided and differences to &lt;i&gt;M. muscosa &lt;/i&gt;  are discussed.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some animals have evolved task differentiation among their eyes. A particular example is spiders, where most species have eight eyes, of which two (the principal eyes) are used for object discrimination, whereas the other three pairs (secondary eyes) detect movement. In the ctenid spider &lt;i&gt;Cupiennius salei &lt;/i&gt;,  these two eye types correspond to two visual pathways in the brain. Each eye is associated with its own first‐ and second‐order visual neuropil. The second‐order neuropils of the principal eyes are connected to the arcuate body, whereas the second‐order neuropils of the secondary eyes are linked to the mushroom body. We explored the principal‐ and secondary eye visual pathways of the jumping spider &lt;i&gt;Marpissa muscosa &lt;/i&gt; , in which size and visual fields of the two eye types are considerably different. We found that the connectivity of the principal eye pathway is the same as in &lt;i&gt;C. salei &lt;/i&gt; , while there are differences in the secondary eye pathways. In &lt;i&gt;M. muscosa &lt;/i&gt; , all secondary eyes are connected to their own first‐order visual neuropils. The first‐order visual neuropils of the anterior lateral and posterior lateral eyes are connected with a second‐order visual neuropil each and an additional shared one (L2). In the posterior median eyes, the axons of their first‐order visual neuropils project directly to the arcuate body, suggesting that the posterior median eyes do not detect movement&lt;i&gt;. &lt;/i&gt; The L2 might function as an upstream integration center enabling faster movement decisions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Multisensory processing occurs across the neocortex, but what makes an area multisensory? Multisensory processing in ferret lateral rostral suprasylvian (LRSS) area was examined using tract tracing and multichannel neuronal recording and compared with other cortical areas. Inputs from lower level auditory and somatosensory cortices converged in the LRSS, where the majority of neurons were auditory‐somatosensory multisensory and multisensory activity was the dominant output signal. Comparison with similarly studied cortical areas indicates that areas dominated by multisensory activity are appropriately designated as multisensory.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that examples of multisensory neurons have been observed across the neocortex, this has led to some confusion about the features that actually designate a region as “multisensory.” While the documentation of multisensory effects within many different cortical areas is clear, often little information is available about their proportions or net functional effects. To assess the compositional and functional features that contribute to the multisensory nature of a region, the present investigation used multichannel neuronal recording and tract tracing methods to examine the ferret temporal region: the lateral rostral suprasylvian sulcal area. Here, auditory‐tactile multisensory neurons were predominant and constituted the majority of neurons across all cortical layers whose responses dominated the net spiking activity of the area. These results were then compared with a literature review of cortical multisensory data and were found to closely resemble multisensory features of other, higher‐order sensory areas. Collectively, these observations argue that multisensory processing presents itself in hierarchical and area‐specific ways, from regions that exhibit few multisensory features to those whose composition and processes are dominated by multisensory activity. It seems logical that the former exhibit some multisensory features (among many others), while the latter are legitimately designated as “multisensory.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Prenatal methamphetamine exposure (PME) may alter brain structure of children, but no longitudinal studies have investigated structural connectivity during the formative school years. Graph theoretical analysis was used to investigate changes in structural connectivity at age 6 and 8 years in children with and without PME. While controls showed increased connectivity in frontal and limbic hubs (i.e., regions directing brain function) over time, children with PME showed increased connectivity in the superior parietal cortex and striatum. Those with PME also had less change in segregation of structural networks over time. These findings are consistent with previous work on regions implicated in children with PME, but they additionally demonstrate alterations in structural connectivity between regions that underlie primary cognitive, behavioral, and emotional development. Understanding patterns of network development during critical periods in at‐risk children may inform supportive strategies in these developmental tasks important for lifelong brain health and development.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain imaging studies in children with prenatal methamphetamine exposure (PME) suggest structural and functional alterations of striatal, frontal, parietal, and limbic regions. However, no longitudinal studies have investigated changes in structural connectivity during the first 2 years of formal schooling. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of PME on structural connectivity of brain networks in children over the critical first 2 years of formal schooling when foundational learning takes place. Networks are expected to gradually increase in global connectedness while segregating into defined systems. Graph theoretical analysis was used to investigate changes in structural connectivity at age 6 and 8 years in children with and without PME. While healthy control children showed increased connectivity in frontal and limbic hubs over time, children with PME showed increased connectivity in the superior parietal cortex and striatum in their global network. Furthermore, compared to control children, those with PME were characterized by less change in segregation of structural networks over time. These findings are consistent with previous work on regions implicated in children with PME, but they additionally demonstrate alterations in structural connectivity between regions that underlie primary cognitive, behavioral, and emotional development. Understanding patterns of network development during critical periods in at‐risk children may inform strategies for supporting this group of children in these developmental tasks important for lifelong brain health and development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Distributions of hypothalamic neuron populations coexpressing tyrosine hydroxylase and the vesicular GABA transporter in the mouse</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Distributions of hypothalamic neuron populations coexpressing tyrosine hydroxylase and the vesicular GABA transporter in the mouse&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/fab22f0d-7140-457c-9da7-81ac4cce3db3/cne24857-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nissl‐based maps of the distribution of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in hypothalamic neurons that coexpress the vesicular GABA transporter revealed striking colocalization within the zona incerta. These neurons also express dopamine immunoreactivity but not dopamine beta‐hydroxylase; thus, dopamine is the likely terminal catecholamine produced by these cells.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hypothalamus contains catecholaminergic neurons marked by the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). As multiple chemical messengers coexist in each neuron, we determined if hypothalamic TH‐immunoreactive (ir) neurons express vesicular glutamate or GABA transporters. We used Cre/loxP recombination to express enhanced GFP (EGFP) in neurons expressing the vesicular glutamate (vGLUT2) or GABA transporter (vGAT), then determined whether TH‐ir neurons colocalized with native EGFP&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;Vglut2 &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;‐ or EGFP&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;Vgat &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;‐fluorescence, respectively. EGFP&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;Vglut2 &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; neurons were not TH‐ir. However, discrete TH‐ir signals colocalized with EGFP&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;Vgat &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; neurons, which we validated by &lt;i&gt;in situ &lt;/i&gt; hybridization for &lt;i&gt;Vgat &lt;/i&gt; mRNA. To contextualize the observed pattern of colocalization between TH‐ir and EGFP&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;Vgat &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;, we first performed Nissl‐based parcellation and plane‐of‐section analysis, and then mapped the distribution of TH‐ir EGFP&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;Vgat &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; neurons onto atlas templates from the &lt;i&gt;Allen Reference Atlas &lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;ARA &lt;/i&gt;) for the mouse brain. TH‐ir EGFP&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;Vgat &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; neurons were distributed throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the hypothalamus. Within the &lt;i&gt;ARA &lt;/i&gt; ontology of gray matter regions, TH‐ir neurons localized primarily to the periventricular hypothalamic zone, periventricular hypothalamic region, and lateral hypothalamic zone. There was a strong presence of EGFP&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;Vgat &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; fluorescence in TH‐ir neurons across all brain regions, but the most striking colocalization was found in a circumscribed portion of the zona incerta (ZI)—a region assigned to the hypothalamus in the &lt;i&gt;ARA &lt;/i&gt;—where every TH‐ir neuron expressed EGFP&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;Vgat &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;. Neurochemical characterization of these ZI neurons revealed that they display immunoreactivity for dopamine but not dopamine β‐hydroxylase. Collectively, these findings indicate the existence of a novel mouse hypothalamic population that may signal through the release of GABA and/or dopamine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;We report that a protein belonged to the PDLIM family is associated to the retinal periactive zone in cones of the chicken retina. PDLIM1, is a cytoskeletal protein that acts as an adapter that allows the trafficking of other proteins, like kinases, to the cytoskeleton and plays a role in controlling neurite outgrowth. The data in this work demonstrated that PDLIM1 delineates the cone's terminals and intermingles between the ribbons of the synapses. The localization of PDLIM1 could be of importance not only for understanding the molecular anatomy of the terminal ending in cones, but also to knowledge the fine mechanisms of the process of neurotransmission.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PDLIM's protein family is involved in the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton. In the present study, we describe the localization of PDLIM1 in chicken photoreceptors. This study provides evidence that this protein is present at the cone pedicles, as well as in other synapses of the chicken retina. Here, we demonstrate the expression pattern of PDLIM1 through immunofluorescence staining, immunoblots, subcellular fractionation, and immunoprecipitation experiments. Also, we consider the possibility that PDLIM1 may be involved in the synaptic vesicle endocytosis and/or the presynaptic trafficking of synaptic vesicles back to the nonready releasable pool. This endocytotic/exocytotic coupling requires a tight link between exocytic vesicle fusion at defined release sites and endocytic retrieval of synaptic vesicle membranes. In turn, photoreceptor ribbon synaptic structure depends on the cytoskeleton arrangement, both at the active zone‐related with exocytosis—as well as at the endocytic zone—periactive zone. To our knowledge, the PDLIM1 protein has not been observed in the pre synapses of the retina. Thus, the present study describes the expression and subcellular localization of PDLIM1 for the first time, as well as its modulation by visual environment in the chicken retina.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Retrograde transsynaptic virus (a) allowed to trace (two to three synapses) projections onto the main olfactory bulb (b). Monosynaptic cholera toxin b (a) was a control to differentiate direct and indirect projections. The MOB mainly receives indirect projections from hypothalamic nuclei (c) and reward‐related regions (c1), underlining the role of olfaction in feeding (d).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A wide range of evidence indicates that olfactory perception is strongly involved in food intake. However, the polysynaptic circuitry linking the brain areas involved in feeding behavior to the olfactory regions is not well known. The aim of this article was to examine such circuits. Thus, we described, using hodological tools such as transsynaptic viruses (PRV152) transported in a retrograde manner, the long‐distance indirect projections (two to three synapses) onto the main olfactory bulb (MOB). The ß‐subunit of the cholera toxin which is a monosynaptic retrograde tracer was used as a control to be able to differentiate between direct and indirect projections. Our tracing experiments showed that the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, as a major site for regulation of food intake, sends only very indirect projections onto the MOB. Indirect projections to MOB also originate from the solitary nucleus which is involved in energy homeostasis. Other indirect projections have been evidenced in areas of the reward circuit such as VTA and accumbens nucleus. In contrast, direct projections to the MOB arise from melanin‐concentrating hormone and orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus. Functional significances of these projections are discussed in relation to the role of food odors in feeding and reward‐related behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

In a complex NMJ organization centering on MuSK: (1) the Wnt non-canonical pathway through the Wnt-Lrp4-MuSK cysteine-rich domain (CRD)-Dishevelled (Dvl, scaffold protein) signaling acts to form AChR prepatterning with axonal guidance; (2) the neural agrin-Lrp4-MuSK (Ig1/2 domains) signaling acts to form rapsyn-anchored AChR clusters at the innervated stage of muscle; (3) adaptor protein Dok-7 acts on MuSK activation for AChR clustering from “inside” and also on cytoskeleton to stabilize AChR clusters by the downstream effector Sorbs1/2; (4) the trans-synaptic retrograde signaling contributes to the presynaptic organization via: (i) Wnt-MuSK CRD-Dvl-β catenin-Slit 2 pathway; (ii) Lrp4; and (iii) laminins. The presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis conditioning ACh release is modified by autoreceptors such as M1-type muscarinic AChR and A2A adenosine receptors. The post-synaptic structure is stabilized by: (i) laminin-network including the muscle-derived agrin; (ii) the extracellular matrix proteins (including collagen Q/perlecan and biglycan which link to MuSK Ig1 domain and CRD); and (iii) the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex. The study on MuSK ectodomains (Ig1/2 domains and CRD) recognized by antibodies suggested that the MuSK antibodies were pathologically heterogeneous due to their binding to multiple functional domains. Focussing one of the matrix proteins, biglycan which functions in the manner similar to collagen Q, our antibody assay showed the negative result in MG patients. However, the synaptic stability may be impaired by antibodies against MuSK ectodomains because of the linkage of biglycan with MuSK Ig1 domain and CRD. The pathogenic diversity of MG is discussed based on NMJ signaling molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Evoked Potentials and EEG Analysis in Rett Syndrome and Related Developmental Encephalopathies: Towards a Biomarker for Translational Research</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00030</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Rett syndrome is a debilitating neurodevelopmental disorder for which no disease-modifying treatment is available. Fortunately, advances in our understanding of the genetics and pathophysiology of Rett syndrome has led to the development of promising new therapeutics for the condition. Several of these therapeutics are currently being tested in clinical trials with others likely to progress to clinical trials in the coming years. The failure of recent clinical trials for Rett syndrome and other neurodevelopmental disorders has highlighted the need for electrophysiological or other objective biological markers of treatment response to support the success of clinical trials moving forward. The purpose of this review is to describe the existing studies of electroencephalography (EEG) and evoked potentials (EPs) in Rett syndrome and discuss the open questions that must be addressed before the field can adopt these measures as surrogate endpoints in clinical trials. In addition to summarizing the human work on Rett syndrome, we also describe relevant studies with animal models and the limited research that has been carried out on Rett-related disorders, particularly methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) duplication syndrome, CDKL5 deficiency disorder, and FOXG1 disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Distinct Insular Functional Connectivity Changes Related to Mood and Fatigue Improvements in Major Depressive Disorder Following Tai Chi Training: A Pilot Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00025</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Tai chi (TC), a contemplative practice combining slow movements and deep breathing, has been shown to be clinically effective in alleviating depressive symptoms. Feelings of fatigue or low vitality often accompany major depressive disorder (MDD) though they are commonly overlooked and not well understood neurologically. By using resting state functional connectivity (rs-FC) using the insula as the seed, this study examines the relationship between mood and vitality symptoms in MDD and how they are impacted by TC training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Patients (N = 16) with MDD participated in a 10-week TC intervention. Self-report scores of vitality (using the SF-36 scale) and depressed mood (using the Beck Depression Inventory) as well as rs-fMRI were collected pre- and post-intervention. A seed-to-voxel approach was used to test whether changes in insular rs-FC were related to therapeutic improvement in MDD-related symptoms resulting from TC practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We found decreased self-reported depressed mood and increased vitality following the TC intervention. Furthermore, decreases in depressed mood were associated with increased rs-FC between the right anterior insula (AIC) and superior temporal gyrus and caudate (cluster-corrected p &amp;lt; 0.05). Increased vitality was associated with increased rs-FC between the right posterior insula (PIC) and regions associated with sensorimotor processes (cluster-corrected p &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: These results provide support for differential changes in insula connectivity as neural correlates of symptom improvement in MDD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

To this end, combined transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography (TMS/EEG) provides a non-invasive tool to simultaneously perturb and measure neurophysiological correlates of cortical function, including oscillatory activity, cortical inhibition, connectivity, and synchronization. In this review, we summarize the findings from a variety of studies that apply TMS/EEG to understand the fundamental features of cortical dysfunction in schizophrenia. These results lend to future applications of TMS/EEG in understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: A New Statistical Framework for Corpus Callosum Sub-Region Characterization Based on LBP Texture in Patients With Parkinsonian Disorders: A Pilot Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00477</link>
	<content:encoded>Purpose&lt;p&gt;The study is conducted to identify the best corpus callosum (CC) sub-region that corresponds to highest callosal tissue alteration occurred due to Parkinsonism. In this regard the efficacy of local binary pattern (LBP) based texture analysis (TA) of CC is performed to quantify the changes in topographical distribution of callosal fiber connected to different regions of cortex. The extent of highest texture alteration in CC is used for differential diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;Materials and Methods&lt;p&gt;Study included subjects with Parkinson’s disease (PD) (n = 20), and atypical Parkinsonian disorders – multiple system atrophy (MSA) (n = 20), Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) (n = 20), and healthy controls (n = 20). For each subject, we have automated the ROI extraction within mid-sagittal CC, followed by LBP TA. Two-class support vector machine (SVM) classification for each disorder as against HC is performed using extracted LBP features like energy and entropy. Correct classification ratio (CCR) is computed as the fraction of correctly classified ROIs at each of the CC sub-regions based on well-known Witelson and Hofer schemes. Based on CCR values, the “Scatter Index (SI)” is proposed to capture how localized (closer to 0) or scattered (closer to 1) the textural changes are among the CC sub-regions, across all subjects per class. The CCR values are further utilized to classify the disease groups.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Highest alteration of texture is observed in mid-body of CC. The consistency of this finding is quantified using SI for all subjects in a specific class that results more localized textural changes in PSP (15%) and MSA (25%), in comparison to PD (47%). Classification among disease groups results maximum classification accuracy of 90% in classifying PSP from PD-NC.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our result demonstrates the efficacy of proposed methodology in analyzing tissue alteration in MRI of Parkinsonian disorders and thus has potential to become valuable tool in computer aided differential diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Adhesion Molecule L1 Agonist Mimetics Protect Against the Pesticide Paraquat-Induced Locomotor Deficits and Biochemical Alterations in Zebrafish</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00458</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Besides several endogenous elements, exogenous factors, including exposure to pesticides, have been recognized as putative factors contributing to the onset and development of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s disease (PD). Considering the availability, success rate, and limitations associated with the current arsenals to fight PD, there is an unmet need for novel therapeutic interventions. Therefore, based on the previously reported beneficial functions of the L1 cell adhesion molecule, we hypothesized that L1 mimetic compounds may serve to neutralize neurotoxicity triggered by the pesticide paraquat (PQ). In this study, we attempt to use PQ for inducing PD-like pathology and the L1 mimetic compounds phenelzine sulfate (PS) and tacrine (TC) as potential candidates for the amelioration of PD symptoms using zebrafish as a model system. Administration of PQ together with the L1 mimetic compounds PS or TC (250 nM) improved survival of zebrafish larvae, protected them from locomotor deficits, and increased their sensorimotor reflexes. Moreover, application of PQ together with PS (500 nM) or TC (1000 nM) in adult zebrafish counteracted PQ-induced toxicity, maintaining normal locomotor functions and spatial memory in an open field and T-maze task, respectively. Both L1 mimetic compounds prevented reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine levels, reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, protected against impairment of mitochondrial viability, improved the antioxidant enzyme system, and prevented a decrease in ATP levels. Altogether, our findings highlight the beneficial functions of the agonistic L1 mimetics PS and TC by improving several vital cell functions against PQ-triggered neurotoxicity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Theta-Nested Gamma Oscillations in Next Generation Neural Mass Models</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00047</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Theta-nested gamma oscillations have been reported in many areas of the brain and are believed to represent a fundamental mechanism to transfer information across spatial and temporal scales. In a series of recent experiments in vitro it has been possible to replicate with an optogenetic theta frequency stimulation several features of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) among theta and gamma rhythms observed in behaving animals. In order to reproduce the main findings of these experiments we have considered a new class of neural mass models able to reproduce exactly the macroscopic dynamics of spiking neural networks. In this framework, we have examined two set-ups able to support collective gamma oscillations: namely, the pyramidal interneuronal network gamma (PING) and the interneuronal network gamma (ING). In both set-ups we observe the emergence of theta-nested gamma oscillations by driving the system with a sinusoidal theta-forcing in proximity of a Hopf bifurcation. These mixed rhythms always display phase amplitude coupling. However, two different types of nested oscillations can be identified: one characterized by a perfect phase locking between theta and gamma rhythms, corresponding to an overall periodic behavior; another one where the locking is imperfect and the dynamics is quasi-periodic or even chaotic. From our analysis it emerges that the locked states are more frequent in the ING set-up. In agreement with the experiments, we find theta-nested gamma oscillations for forcing frequencies in the range [1:10] Hz, whose amplitudes grow proportionally to the forcing intensity and which are clearly modulated by the theta phase. Furthermore, analogously to the experiments, the gamma power and the frequency of the gamma-power peak increase with the forcing amplitude. At variance with experimental findings, the gamma-power peak does not shift to higher frequencies by increasing the theta frequency. This effect can be obtained, in our model, only by incrementing, at the same time, also the stimulation power. An effect achieved by increasing the amplitude either of the noise or of the forcing term proportionally to the theta frequency. On the basis of our analysis both the PING and the ING mechanism give rise to theta-nested gamma oscillations with almost identical features.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Stress-Related Neuronal Clusters in Sublenticular Extended Amygdala of Basal Forebrain Show Individual Differences of Positions</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00029</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;To understand functional neuronal circuits for emotion in the basal forebrain, patterns of neuronal activation were examined in mice by immunohistochemistry of immediate-early gene products (Zif268/Egr1 and c-Fos). In all mice examined, clusters of 30–50 neurons expressing Zif268 were found on both sides in the area between the extended amygdala (EA) and globus pallidus (GP), generally designated as sublenticular extended amygdala (SLEA). The clusters consisted of 79.9 ± 3.0% of GABAergic neurons in GAD65-mCherry mice. The expression of the cholinergic marker choline acetyltransferase and the GP markers parvalbumin, proenkephalin, and FoxP2 indicated that these neurons were different from known types of neurons in the EA and GP; therefore, we named them the sublenticular extended amygdalar Zif268/Egr1-expressing neuronal cluster (SLEA-zNC). Sublenticular extended amygdalar Zif268/Egr1-expressing neuronal clusters participated in stress processing because increasing numbers of cells were observed in SLEA-zNCs after exposure to restraint stress (RS), the induction of which was suppressed by diazepam treatment. Mapping SLEA-zNCs showed that their positions and arrangement varied individually; SLEA-zNCs were distributed asymmetrically and tended to be situated mainly in the middle region between the anterior commissure (AC) and posterior end of the GP. However, the total cell number in SLEA-zNCs was compatible between the right and left hemispheres after activation by RS. Therefore, SLEA-zNCs were distributed asymmetrically but were not lateralized. Because time courses of activation differed between the Zif268 and c-Fos, the sequential dual treatment of RSs enabled us to differentiate SLEA-zNCs activated by the first and second RS. The results supported that the same SLEA-zNCs responded to both the first and second RS, and this also applied for all SLEA-zNCs. Thus, we concluded that the cluster positions were invariable under RS in each mouse but were distributed differently between individual mice. We name these newly identified neuronal clusters as stress-related neuronal clusters, SLEA-zNCs, which are considered to be novel functional units of “islands of activation.” Moreover, SLEA-zNCs were situated at different positions in all mice examined, showing individual differences in their positions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Stimulus Contrast Information Modulates Sensorimotor Decision Making in Goldfish</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00023</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Animal survival relies on environmental information gathered by their sensory systems. We found that contrast information of a looming stimulus biases the type of defensive behavior that goldfish (Carassius auratus) perform. Low-contrast looms only evoke subtle alarm reactions whose probability is independent of contrast. As looming contrast increases, the probability of eliciting a fast escape maneuver, the C-start response, increases dramatically. Contrast information also modulates the decision of when to escape. Although response latency is known to depend on looming retinal size, we found that contrast acts as an additional parameter influencing this decision. When presenting progressively higher contrast stimuli, animals need shorter periods of stimulus processing to initiate the response. Our results comply with the notion that the decision to escape is a flexible process initiated with stimulus detection and followed by assessment of the perceived risk posed by the stimulus. Highly disruptive behaviors as the C-start are only observed when a multifactorial threshold that includes stimulus contrast is surpassed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Emerging genetically-encoded Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-indicators (GECIs) are intensiometric reporters that increase in fluorescence when bound to Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;; highly suited for studying calcium-signaling in many cell types, notably neurons. Today, major efforts are devoted toward optimizing red-emitting [red fluorescent protein (RFP)-based] GECIs (R-GECI), as these provide several advantages over GFP-based reporters, for instance, increased imaging depth, reduced photodamage by longer imaging wavelengths and, in principle, are better suited for use with prevalent blue-absorbing optogenetic tools (e.g., channelrhodopsin). However, excessive fluorescence from intersecting neighboring cells in very dense tissues, notably the brain, hinders the ability to collect signals from single cells and their processes. This challenge can be addressed by photoactivatable (PA) fluorescent proteins that can be rendered fluorescent on demand by user-defined targeted light. This allows activation and, thereby, collection of fluorescent signals exclusively from desired cells and their processes, while leaving all neighboring cells in the dark (i.e., non-fluorescent). Nevertheless, there are no PA R-GECIs. Here, we sought to develop PA-R-GECIs. To do so, we initially explored a recently discovered phenomenon of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-independent increases in fluorescence (i.e., artifacts) in an emerging R-GECI, which has led us to rationally engineer several functional PA-R-GECIs. We also take advantage of our findings to quickly engineer a novel PA-RFP, namely, PA-mRuby3.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Moths develop sophisticated olfactory systems to sense the airborne chemical cues from the environment. Understanding the structural basis in the neuronal center is a fundamental neuroethological step. Little is known about the emerging crop pest Athetis dissimilis with regard to its morphology or its neuronal organizations. Through antibody staining and digital 3D modeling, we re-constructed the primary olfactory center—the antennal lobe of A. dissimilis. In the antennal lobes 68.8 ± 3.1 male glomeruli and 70.8 ± 1.0 female glomeruli were identified with obvious sexual dimorphism. In particular, male adults of A. dissimilis contain a macroglomerular complex (MGC) that consists of three subunits, while the female lobe has four relatively enlarged glomeruli at the entrance of the antennal nerve. Glomeruli were later clustered with deviation and variance, and referring to reported olfactory related receptor family genes in seven different moth species, we found that glomerular counts of these insects are better related to the sum of odorant receptor and ionotropic receptor numbers, suggesting olfactory receptors and ionotropic receptors may both involved in olfaction of Noctuidae moths.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Genetic interactions, including synthetic lethal effects, can now be systematically identified in cancer cell lines using high-throughput genetic perturbation screens. Despite this advance, few genetic interactions have been reproduced across multiple studies and many appear highly context-specific. Here, by developing a new computational approach, we identified 220 robust driver-gene associated genetic interactions that can be reproduced across independent experiments and across non-overlapping cell line panels. Analysis of these interactions demonstrated that: (i) oncogene addiction effects are more robust than oncogene-related synthetic lethal effects; and (ii) robust genetic interactions are enriched among gene pairs whose protein products physically interact. Exploiting the latter observation, we used a protein-protein interaction network to identify robust synthetic lethal effects associated with passenger gene alterations and validated two new synthetic lethal effects. Our results suggest that protein-protein interaction networks can be used to prioritise therapeutic targets that will be more robust to tumour heterogeneity.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Phagocytic glia are obligatory intermediates in transmission of mutant huntingtin aggregates across neuronal synapses</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58499</link>
	<content:encoded>Emerging evidence supports the hypothesis that pathogenic protein aggregates associated with neurodegenerative diseases spread from cell to cell through the brain in a manner akin to infectious prions. Here, we show that mutant huntingtin (mHtt) aggregates associated with Huntington disease transfer anterogradely from presynaptic to postsynaptic neurons in the adult &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; olfactory system. Trans-synaptic transmission of mHtt aggregates is inversely correlated with neuronal activity and blocked by inhibiting caspases in presynaptic neurons, implicating synaptic dysfunction and cell death in aggregate spreading. Remarkably, mHtt aggregate transmission across synapses requires the glial scavenger receptor Draper and involves a transient visit to the glial cytoplasm, indicating that phagocytic glia act as obligatory intermediates in aggregate spreading between synaptically-connected neurons. These findings expand our understanding of phagocytic glia as double-edged players in neurodegeneration—by clearing neurotoxic protein aggregates, but also providing an opportunity for prion-like seeds to evade phagolysosomal degradation and propagate further in the brain.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58118</link>
	<content:encoded>The emergence of multicellularity in Animalia is associated with increase in ROS and expansion of tRNA-isodecoders. tRNA expansion leads to misselection resulting in a critical error of L-Ala mischarged onto tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Thr&lt;/sup&gt;, which is proofread by Animalia-specific-tRNA Deacylase (ATD) &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Here we show that in addition to ATD, threonyl-tRNA synthetase (ThrRS) can clear the error in cellular scenario. This two-tier functional redundancy for translation quality control breaks down during oxidative stress, wherein ThrRS is rendered inactive. Therefore, ATD knockout cells display pronounced sensitivity through increased mistranslation of threonine codons leading to cell death. Strikingly, we identify the emergence of ATD along with the error inducing tRNA species starting from Choanoflagellates thus uncovering an important genomic innovation required for multicellularity that occurred in unicellular ancestors of animals. The study further provides a plausible regulatory mechanism wherein the cellular fate of tRNAs can be switched from protein biosynthesis to non-canonical functions.</content:encoded>

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nucleus prethalamicus (PTh) receives fibers from the optic tectum and then projects to the dorsal telencephalon in the yellowfin goby &lt;i&gt;Acanthogobius flavimanus &lt;/i&gt;. However, it remained unclear whether the PTh is a visual relay nucleus, because the optic tectum receives not only visual but also other sensory modalities. Furthermore, precise telencephalic regions receiving prethalamic input remained unknown in the goby. We therefore investigated the full set of afferent and efferent connections of the PTh by direct tracer injections into the nucleus. Injections into the PTh labeled cells in the optic tectum, ventromedial thalamic nucleus, central and medial parts of the dorsal telencephalon, and caudal lobe of the cerebellum. We found that the somata of most tecto‐prethalamic neurons are present in the stratum periventriculare. Their dendrites ascend to reach the major retinorecipient layers of the tectum. The PTh is composed of two subnuclei (medial and lateral) and topographic organization was appreciated only for tectal projections to the lateral subnucleus (PTh‐l), which also receives sparse retinal projections. In contrast, the medial subnucleus receives fibers only from the medial tectum. We found that the PTh projects to nine subregions in the dorsal telencephalon and four in the ventral telencephalon. Furthermore, cerebellar injections revealed that cerebello‐prethalamic fibers cross the midline twice to innervate the PTh‐l on both sides. The present study is the first detailed report on the full set of the connections of PTh, which suggests that the PTh relays visual information from the optic tectum to the telencephalon.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Antagonism of peripheral opioid receptors by methylnaltrexone does not prevent morphine tolerance in rats&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/47abfe7a-6cd2-4707-8a38-afd9b5e0079b/jnr24638-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blockade of peripheral opioid receptors with the peripherally restricted antagonist, methylnaltrexone (MNTX), had no effect on acute morphine antinociception or development of tolerance. The results do not support the use of MNTX for preventing opioid tolerance and also suggest that morphine tolerance is mediated by central rather than peripheral opioid receptors in the rat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opioids are effective analgesics in the management of severe pain. However, tolerance, leading to dose escalation and adverse effects are significant limiting factors in their use. The role of peripheral opioid receptors in analgesia has been discussed especially under inflammatory conditions. The results from pharmacological and conditional knockout studies together do not provide a clear picture of the contribution of peripheral opioid receptors on antinociceptive tolerance and this needs to be evaluated. Therefore, we studied whether the peripherally restricted opioid receptor antagonist, methylnaltrexone (MNTX), could prevent morphine tolerance without attenuating the antinociceptive effect of morphine. Male Sprague‐Dawley rats were treated for 7 days with increasing subcutaneous doses of morphine (5–30 mg/kg) and were coadministered saline, MNTX (0.5 or 2 mg/kg), or naltrexone (NTX; 2 mg/kg). Nociception was assessed with tail‐flick, hotplate, and von Frey tests. Morphine, MNTX, and NTX concentrations in the plasma, brain, and spinal cord were measured by liquid chromatography‐tandem mass spectrometry. In acute coadministration, NTX, but not MNTX, abolished the acute antinociceptive effects of morphine in all nociceptive tests. The antinociceptive tolerance after repeated morphine administration was also prevented by NTX but not by MNTX. MNTX penetrated to the spinal cord and the brain to some extent after repeated administration. The results do not support the use of MNTX for preventing opioid tolerance and also suggest that morphine tolerance is mediated by central rather than peripheral opioid receptors in the rat.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Clinical and basic research investigations into the long‐term effects of prenatal opioid exposure on brain development</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coincident with the opioid epidemic in the United States has been a dramatic increase in the number of children born with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), a form of withdrawal resulting from opioid exposure during pregnancy. Many research efforts on NAS have focused on short‐term care, including acute symptom treatment and weaning of the infants off their drug dependency prior to authorizing their release. However, investigations into the long‐term effects of prenatal opioid exposure (POE) on brain development, from the cellular to the behavioral level, have not been as frequent. Given the importance of the perinatal period for human brain development, opioid‐induced disturbances in the formation and function of nascent synaptic networks and glia have the potential to impact brain connectivity and cognition long after the drug supply is cutoff shortly after birth. In this review, we will summarize the current state of NAS research, bringing together findings from human studies and preclinical animal models to highlight what is known about how POE can induce significant, prolonged deficits in brain structure and function. With rates of NAS continuing to rise, particularly in regions that already face substantial socioeconomic challenges, we speculate as to the most promising avenues for future research to alleviate this growing multigenerational threat.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Dysregulation of the Retromer Complex System in Down Syndrome</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25752?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the patients with Down syndrome (DS) develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology by age 40. Although this increased susceptibility to AD in DS is thought to be primarily due to triplication of the amyloid precursor protein located on chromosome 21, the precise molecular mechanisms are not well understood. Recent evidence has implicated defective protein sorting and trafficking secondary to deficiencies in retromer complex proteins in AD pathogenesis. Thus, the objective of the present study is to assess the retromer complex system in DS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human postmortem brain tissue and fibroblasts from subjects with DS and healthy controls were examined for the various retromer protein components using Western blot analysis and reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‐qPCR).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retromer recognition core proteins were significantly decreased in DS fibroblasts, and in both the hippocampi and cortices of young (age 15–40 years old) and aged (40–65 years old) subjects with DS compared with controls. Correlation analyses showed a significant inverse relationship between recognition core proteins and levels of soluble forms of Aβ 1–40 and 1–42 in both hippocampus (n = 33, Spearman = −0.59 to −0.38, &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; ≤ 0.03 for VPS35, VPS26, VPS29, and VPS26B) and cortex tissue (n = 57, Spearman = −0.46 to −0.27, &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; ≤ 0.04 for VPS35, VPS26, and VPS29) of the same patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conclude that dysregulation of the retromer complex system is an early event in the development of the AD‐like pathology and cognitive decline in DS, and for this reason the system could represent a novel potential therapeutic target for DS. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Physical Exercise May Increase Plasma Concentration of High-Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol in Patients With Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00532</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle factors have been shown to increase the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD) later in life. Specifically, an unfavorable cholesterol profile, and insulin resistance are associated with increased risk of developing AD. One way to non-pharmacologically affect the levels of plasma lipids is by exercise, which has been shown to be beneficial in cognitively healthy individuals. In this randomized controlled trial y, we therefore aimed to clarify the effect of physical exercise on the lipid profile, insulin and glucose in patients with AD. In addition, we investigated the effect of apolipoproteinE genotype on total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein–cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglycerides (TG) in plasma from patients with AD. Plasma samples from 172 patients who underwent 16 weeks of moderate-to-high intensity exercise (n = 90) or treatment as usual (n = 82) were analyzed change from baseline for the levels of total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, TG, glucose, and insulin. In addition, we analyzed those from the exercise group who adhered to the protocol with an attendance of 2/3 or more of the exercise session and who followed the protocol of an intensity of 70% of the maximum heart rate. We found a significant increase in plasma HDL-C levels between the “high exercise sub-group” compared to control group. After intervention HDL-C was increased by 4.3% in the high-exercise group, and decreased by 0.7% in the control group, after adjustment for statin use. In conclusion, short term physical activity may be beneficial on the cholesterol profile in patients with AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Functional Segregation of the Middle Temporal Visual Motion Area Revealed With Coactivation-Based Parcellation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00427</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, the visual motion area (MT) is considered as a brain region specialized for visual motion perception. However, accumulating evidence showed that MT is also related to various functions, suggesting that it is a complex functional area and different functional subregions might exist in this area. To delineate functional subregions of this area, left and right masks of MT were defined using meta-analysis in the BrainMap database, and coactivation-based parcellation was then performed on these two masks. Two dorsal subregions (Cl1 and Cl2) and one ventral subregion (Cl3) of left MT, as well as two dorsal-anterior subregions (Cl1 and Cl2), one ventral-anterior subregion (Cl3), and an additional posterior subregion (Cl4) of right MT were identified. In addition to vision motion, distinct and specific functions were identified in different subregions characterized by task-dependent functional connectivity mapping and forward/reverse inference on associated functions. These results not only were in accordance with the previous findings of a hemispheric asymmetry of MT, but also strongly confirmed the existence of subregions in this region with distinct and specific functions. Furthermore, our results extend the special role of visual motion perception on this area and might facilitate future cognitive study.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00182</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the last decades, several electrophysiological markers have been investigated to better understand how humans precede a signaled event. Among others, the pre-stimulus microstates’ topography, representing the whole brain activity, has been proposed as a promising index of the anticipatory period in several cognitive tasks. However, to date, a clear relationship between the metrics of the pre-stimulus microstates [i.e., the global explained variance (GEV) and the frequency of occurrence (FOO)] and well-known electroencephalography marker of the anticipation (i.e., the alpha power reduction) has not been investigated. Here, after extracting the microstates during the expectancy of the semantic memory task, we investigate the correlations between the microstate features and the anticipatory alpha (8–12 Hz) power reduction (i.e., the event-related de-synchronization of the alpha rhythms; ERD) that is widely interpreted as a functional correlate of brain activation. We report a positive correlation between the occurrence of the dominant, but not non-dominant, microstate and both the mean amplitude of high-alpha ERD and the magnitude of the alpha ERD peak so that the stronger the decrease (percentage) in the alpha power, the higher the FOO of the dominant microstate. Moreover, we find a positive correlation between the occurrence of the dominant microstate and the latency of the alpha ERD peak, suggesting that subjects with higher FOO present the stronger alpha ERD closely to the target. These correlations are not significant between the GEV and all anticipatory alpha ERD indices. Our results suggest that only the occurrence of the dominant, but not non-dominant, microstate should be considered as a useful electrophysiological correlate of the cortical activation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Reaching and Grasping Training Improves Functional Recovery After Chronic Cervical Spinal Cord Injury</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00110</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Previous studies suggest locomotion training could be an effective non-invasive therapy after spinal cord injury (SCI) using primarily acute thoracic injuries. However, the majority of SCI patients have chronic cervical injuries. Regaining hand function could significantly increase their quality of life. In this study, we used a clinically relevant chronic cervical contusion to study the therapeutic efficacy of rehabilitation in forelimb functional recovery. Nude rats received a moderate C5 unilateral contusive injury and were then divided into two groups with or without Modified Montoya Staircase (MMS) rehabilitation. For the rehabilitation group, rats were trained 5 days a week starting at 8 weeks post-injury (PI) for 6 weeks. All rats were assessed for skilled forelimb functions with MMS test weekly and for untrained gross forelimb locomotion with grooming and horizontal ladder (HL) tests biweekly. Our results showed that MMS rehabilitation significantly increased the number of pellets taken at 13 and 14 weeks PI and the accuracy rates at 12 to 14 weeks PI. However, there were no significant differences in the grooming scores or the percentage of HL missteps at any time point. Histological analyses revealed that MMS rehabilitation significantly increased the number of serotonergic fibers and the amount of presynaptic terminals around motor neurons in the cervical ventral horns caudal to the injury and reduced glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-immunoreactive astrogliosis in spinal cords caudal to the lesion. This study shows that MMS rehabilitation can modify the injury environment, promote axonal sprouting and synaptic plasticity, and importantly, improve reaching and grasping functions in the forelimb, supporting the therapeutic potential of task-specific rehabilitation for functional recovery after chronic SCI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Involvement of Frontal Functions in Pain Tolerance in Aging: Evidence From Neuropsychological Assessments and Gamma-Band Oscillations</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00131</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Reduced pain tolerance may be one of the possible explanations for high prevalence of chronic pain among older people. We hypothesized that age-related alterations in pain tolerance are associated with functioning deterioration of the frontal cortex during normal aging. Twenty-one young and 41 elderly healthy participants underwent a tonic heat pain test, during which cerebral activity was recorded using electroencephalography (EEG). Elderly participants were divided into two subgroups according to their scores on executive tests, high performers (HPs; n = 21) and low performers (LPs; n = 20). Pain measures [exposure times (ETs) and perceived pain ratings] and cerebral activity were compared among the three groups. ETs were significantly lower in elderly LPs than in young participants and elderly HPs. Electroencephalographic analyses showed that gamma-band oscillations (GBOs) were significantly increased in pain state for all subjects, especially in the frontal sites. Source analysis showed that GBO increase in elderly LPs was contributed not only by frontal but also by central, parietal, and occipital regions. These findings suggest that better preservation of frontal functions may result in better pain tolerance by elderly subjects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Microbial communities display alternative stable states in a fluctuating environment</title>

The effect of environmental fluctuations is a major question in ecology. While it is widely accepted that fluctuations and other types of disturbances can increase biodiversity, there are fewer examples of other types of outcomes in a fluctuating environment. Here we explore this question with laboratory microcosms, using cocultures of two bacterial species, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;putida&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;veronii&lt;/i&gt;. At low dilution rates we observe competitive exclusion of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;veronii&lt;/i&gt;, whereas at high dilution rates we observe competitive exclusion of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;putida&lt;/i&gt;. When the dilution rate alternates between high and low, we do not observe coexistence between the species, but rather alternative stable states, in which only one species survives and initial species’ fractions determine the identity of the surviving species. The Lotka-Volterra model with a fluctuating mortality rate predicts that this outcome is independent of the timing of the fluctuations, and that the time-averaged mortality would also lead to alternative stable states, a prediction that we confirm experimentally. Other pairs of species can coexist in a fluctuating environment, and again consistent with the model we observe coexistence in the time-averaged dilution rate. We find a similar time-averaging result holds in a three-species community, highlighting that simple linear models can in some cases provide powerful insight into how communities will respond to environmental fluctuations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TMfn7BB66D0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Chloride dynamics alter the input-output properties of neurons</title>

Fast synaptic inhibition is a critical determinant of neuronal output, with subcellular targeting of synaptic inhibition able to exert different transformations of the neuronal input-output function. At the receptor level, synaptic inhibition is primarily mediated by chloride-permeable Type A GABA receptors. Consequently, dynamics in the neuronal chloride concentration can alter the functional properties of inhibitory synapses. How differences in the spatial targeting of inhibitory synapses interact with intracellular chloride dynamics to modulate the input-output function of neurons is not well understood. To address this, we developed computational models of multi-compartment neurons that incorporate experimentally parametrised mechanisms to account for neuronal chloride influx, diffusion, and extrusion. We found that synaptic input (either excitatory, inhibitory, or both) can lead to subcellular variations in chloride concentration, despite a uniform distribution of chloride extrusion mechanisms. Accounting for chloride changes resulted in substantial alterations in the neuronal input-output function. This was particularly the case for peripherally targeted dendritic inhibition where dynamic chloride compromised the ability of inhibition to offset neuronal input-output curves. Our simulations revealed that progressive changes in chloride concentration mean that the neuronal input-output function is not static but varies significantly as a function of the duration of synaptic drive. Finally, we found that the observed effects of dynamic chloride on neuronal output were mediated by changes in the dendritic reversal potential for GABA. Our findings provide a framework for understanding the computational effects of chloride dynamics on dendritically targeted synaptic inhibition.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Xy9ZofIHwmU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is one of the most important enzyme substrates. It is vital for the function of various proteins, including large group of methyltransferases (MTs). Intriguingly, some bacterial and eukaryotic MTs, while catalysing the same reaction, possess significantly different topologies, with the former being a knotted one. Here, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of SAM conformational space and factors that affect its vastness. We investigated SAM in two forms: free in water (via NMR studies and explicit solvent simulations) and bound to proteins (based on all data available in the PDB and on all-atom molecular dynamics simulations in water). We identified structural descriptors—angles which show the major differences in SAM conformation between unknotted and knotted methyltransferases. Moreover, we report that this is caused mainly by a characteristic for knotted MTs compact binding site formed by the knot and the presence of adenine-binding loop. Additionally, we elucidate conformational restrictions imposed on SAM molecules by other protein groups in comparison to conformational space in water.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/m35Km0cNHrc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Predicting host taxonomic information from viral genomes: A comparison of feature representations</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Francesca Young, Simon Rogers, David L. Robertson&lt;/p&gt;

The rise in metagenomics has led to an exponential growth in virus discovery. However, the majority of these new virus sequences have no assigned host. Current machine learning approaches to predicting virus host interactions have a tendency to focus on nucleotide features, ignoring other representations of genomic information. Here we investigate the predictive potential of features generated from four different ‘levels’ of viral genome representation: nucleotide, amino acid, amino acid properties and protein domains. This more fully exploits the biological information present in the virus genomes. Over a hundred and eighty binary datasets for infecting versus non-infecting viruses at all taxonomic ranks of both eukaryote and prokaryote hosts were compiled. The viral genomes were converted into the four different levels of genome representation and twenty feature sets were generated by extracting k-mer compositions and predicted protein domains. We trained and tested Support Vector Machine, SVM, classifiers to compare the predictive capacity of each of these feature sets for each dataset. Our results show that all levels of genome representation are consistently predictive of host taxonomy and that prediction k-mer composition improves with increasing k-mer length for all k-mer based features. Using a phylogenetically aware holdout method, we demonstrate that the predictive feature sets contain signals reflecting both the evolutionary relationship between the viruses infecting related hosts, and host-mimicry. Our results demonstrate that incorporating a range of complementary features, generated purely from virus genome sequences, leads to improved accuracy for a range of virus host prediction tasks enabling computational assignment of host taxonomic information.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/A8a_FLHiaZs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Non-uniform distribution of myosin-mediated forces governs red blood cell membrane curvature through tension modulation</title>

The biconcave disk shape of the mammalian red blood cell (RBC) is unique to the RBC and is vital for its circulatory function. Due to the absence of a transcellular cytoskeleton, RBC shape is determined by the membrane skeleton, a network of actin filaments cross-linked by spectrin and attached to membrane proteins. While the physical properties of a uniformly distributed actin network interacting with the lipid bilayer membrane have been assumed to control RBC shape, recent experiments reveal that RBC biconcave shape also depends on the contractile activity of nonmuscle myosin IIA (NMIIA) motor proteins. Here, we use the classical Helfrich-Canham model for the RBC membrane to test the role of heterogeneous force distributions along the membrane and mimic the contractile activity of sparsely distributed NMIIA filaments. By incorporating this additional contribution to the Helfrich-Canham energy, we find that the RBC biconcave shape depends on the ratio of forces per unit volume in the dimple and rim regions of the RBC. Experimental measurements of NMIIA densities at the dimple and rim validate our prediction that (a) membrane forces must be non-uniform along the RBC membrane and (b) the force density must be larger in the dimple than the rim to produce the observed membrane curvatures. Furthermore, we predict that RBC membrane tension and the orientation of the applied forces play important roles in regulating this force-shape landscape. Our findings of heterogeneous force distributions on the plasma membrane for RBC shape maintenance may also have implications for shape maintenance in different cell types.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tdtlqFxkPn4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Balance between asymmetry and abundance in multi-domain DNA-binding proteins may regulate the kinetics of their binding to DNA</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Arumay Pal, Yaakov Levy&lt;/p&gt;

DNA sequences are often recognized by multi-domain proteins that may have higher affinity and specificity than single-domain proteins. However, the higher affinity to DNA might be coupled with slower recognition kinetics. In this study, we address this balance between stability and kinetics for multi-domain Cys&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;His&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;- (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-) type zinc-finger (ZF) proteins. These proteins are the most prevalent DNA-binding domain in eukaryotes and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; type zinc-finger proteins (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-ZFPs) constitute nearly one-half of all known and predicted transcription factors in human. Extensive contact with DNA via tandem ZF domains confers high stability on the sequence-specific complexes. However, this can limit target search efficiency, especially for low abundance ZFPs. Earlier, we found that asymmetrical distribution of electrostatic charge among the three ZF domains of the low abundance transcription factor Egr-1 facilitates its DNA search process. Here, on a diverse set of 273 human C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-ZFP comprised of 3–15 tandem ZF domains, we find that, in many cases, electrostatic charge and binding specificity are asymmetrically distributed among the ZF domains so that neighbouring domains have different DNA-binding properties. For proteins containing 3–6 ZF domains, we show that the low abundance proteins possess a higher degree of non-specific asymmetry and vice versa. Our findings suggest that where the electrostatics of tandem ZF domains are similar (i.e., symmetrical), the ZFPs are more abundant to optimize their DNA search efficiency. This study reveals new insights into the fundamental determinants of recognition by C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-ZFPs of their DNA binding sites in the cellular landscape. The importance of electrostatic asymmetry with respect to binding site recognition by C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-ZFPs suggests the possibility that it may also be important in other ZFP systems and reveals a new design feature for zinc finger engineering.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RUxYdMJWctY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Interactions between disordered proteins involve a wide range of changes in the structure and dynamics of the partners involved. These changes can be classified in terms of binding modes, which include disorder-to-order (DO) transitions, when proteins fold upon binding, as well as disorder-to-disorder (DD) transitions, when the conformational heterogeneity is maintained in the bound states. Furthermore, systematic studies of these interactions are revealing that proteins may exhibit different binding modes with different partners. Proteins that exhibit this context-dependent binding can be referred to as fuzzy proteins. Here we investigate amino acid code for fuzzy binding in terms of the Shannon entropy of the probabilities of transitions towards increasing or decreasing order (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;DO&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;DD&lt;/sub&gt;). We implement these entropy calculations into the FuzPred (http://protdyn-fuzpred.org) algorithm to predict the range of context-dependent binding modes of proteins from their amino acid sequences. As we illustrate through a variety of examples, this method identifies those binding sites that are sensitive to the cellular context or post-translational modifications, and may serve as regulatory points of cellular pathways.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/e5M5a9eOI4g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Neurons form complex networks that evolve over multiple time scales. In order to thoroughly characterize these networks, time dependencies must be explicitly modeled. Here, we present a statistical model that captures both the underlying structural and temporal dynamics of neuronal networks. Our model combines the class of Stochastic Block Models for community formation with Gaussian processes to model changes in the community structure as a smooth function of time. We validate our model on synthetic data and demonstrate its utility on three different studies using &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; cultures of dissociated neurons.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fyZwCKmAdv4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

T cell epitope candidates are commonly identified using computational prediction tools in order to enable applications such as vaccine design, cancer neoantigen identification, development of diagnostics and removal of unwanted immune responses against protein therapeutics. Most T cell epitope prediction tools are based on machine learning algorithms trained on MHC binding or naturally processed MHC ligand elution data. The ability of currently available tools to predict T cell epitopes has not been comprehensively evaluated. In this study, we used a recently published dataset that systematically defined T cell epitopes recognized in vaccinia virus (VACV) infected C57BL/6 mice (expressing H-2D&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; and H-2K&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;), considering both peptides predicted to bind MHC or experimentally eluted from infected cells, making this the most comprehensive dataset of T cell epitopes mapped in a complex pathogen. We evaluated the performance of all currently publicly available computational T cell epitope prediction tools to identify these major epitopes from all peptides encoded in the VACV proteome. We found that all methods were able to improve epitope identification above random, with the best performance achieved by neural network-based predictions trained on both MHC binding and MHC ligand elution data (NetMHCPan-4.0 and MHCFlurry). Impressively, these methods were able to capture more than half of the major epitopes in the top N = 277 predictions within the N = 767,788 predictions made for distinct peptides of relevant lengths that can theoretically be encoded in the VACV proteome. These performance metrics provide guidance for immunologists as to which prediction methods to use, and what success rates are possible for epitope predictions when considering a highly controlled system of administered immunizations to inbred mice. In addition, this benchmark was implemented in an open and easy to reproduce format, providing developers with a framework for future comparisons against new tools.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rmObXkJxGX4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: A unifying model for the propagation of prion proteins in yeast brings insight into the [&lt;i&gt;PSI&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] prion</title>

The use of yeast systems to study the propagation of prions and amyloids has emerged as a crucial aspect of the global endeavor to understand those mechanisms. Yeast prion systems are intrinsically multi-scale: the molecular chemical processes are indeed coupled to the cellular processes of cell growth and division to influence phenotypical traits, observable at the scale of colonies. We introduce a novel modeling framework to tackle this difficulty using impulsive differential equations. We apply this approach to the [&lt;i&gt;PSI&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] yeast prion, which is associated with the misconformation and aggregation of Sup35. We build a model that reproduces and unifies previously conflicting experimental observations on [&lt;i&gt;PSI&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] and thus sheds light onto characteristics of the intracellular molecular processes driving aggregate replication. In particular our model uncovers a kinetic barrier for aggregate replication at low densities, meaning the change between prion or prion-free phenotype is a bi-stable transition. This result is based on the study of prion curing experiments, as well as the phenomenon of colony sectoring, a phenotype which is often ignored in experimental assays and has never been modeled. Furthermore, our results provide further insight into the effect of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) on Sup35 aggregates. To qualitatively reproduce the GdnHCl curing experiment, aggregate replication must not be completely inhibited, which suggests the existence of a mechanism different than Hsp104-mediated fragmentation. Those results are promising for further development of the [&lt;i&gt;PSI&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] model, but also for extending the use of this novel framework to other yeast prion or amyloid systems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OH_VNX7H_U8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Modeling the effects of motivation on choice and learning in the basal ganglia</title>

Decision making relies on adequately evaluating the consequences of actions on the basis of past experience and the current physiological state. A key role in this process is played by the basal ganglia, where neural activity and plasticity are modulated by dopaminergic input from the midbrain. Internal physiological factors, such as hunger, scale signals encoded by dopaminergic neurons and thus they alter the motivation for taking actions and learning. However, to our knowledge, no formal mathematical formulation exists for how a physiological state affects learning and action selection in the basal ganglia. We developed a framework for modelling the effect of motivation on choice and learning. The framework defines the motivation to obtain a particular resource as the difference between the desired and the current level of this resource, and proposes how the utility of reinforcements depends on the motivation. To account for dopaminergic activity previously recorded in different physiological states, the paper argues that the prediction error encoded in the dopaminergic activity needs to be redefined as the difference between utility and expected utility, which depends on both the objective reinforcement and the motivation. We also demonstrate a possible mechanism by which the evaluation and learning of utility of actions can be implemented in the basal ganglia network. The presented theory brings together models of learning in the basal ganglia with the incentive salience theory in a single simple framework, and it provides a mechanistic insight into how decision processes and learning in the basal ganglia are modulated by the motivation. Moreover, this theory is also consistent with data on neural underpinnings of overeating and obesity, and makes further experimental predictions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ANuMWUesgU0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Structure of TBC1D23 N-terminus reveals a novel role for rhodanese domain</title>

Members of the Tre2-Bub2-Cdc16 (TBC) family often function to regulate membrane trafficking and to control signaling transductions pathways. As a member of the TBC family, TBC1D23 is critical for endosome-to-Golgi cargo trafficking by serving as a bridge between Golgi-bound golgin-97/245 and the WASH/FAM21 complex on endosomal vesicles. However, the exact mechanisms by which TBC1D23 regulates cargo transport are poorly understood. Here, we present the crystal structure of the N-terminus of TBC1D23 (D23&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt;), which consists of both the TBC and rhodanese domains. We show that the rhodanese domain is unlikely to be an active sulfurtransferase or phosphatase, despite containing a putative catalytic site. Instead, it packs against the TBC domain and forms part of the platform to interact with golgin-97/245. Using the zebrafish model, we show that impacting golgin-97/245-binding, but not the putative catalytic site, impairs neuronal growth and brain development. Altogether, our studies provide structural and functional insights into an essential protein that is required for organelle-specific trafficking and brain development.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/qu44YOJC4Bw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Anticipating an odor improves detection and perception, yet the underlying neural mechanisms of olfactory anticipation are not well understood. In this study, we used human intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) to show that anticipation resets the phase of delta oscillations in piriform cortex prior to odor arrival. Anticipatory phase reset correlates with ensuing odor-evoked theta power and improvements in perceptual accuracy. These effects were consistently present in each individual subject and were not driven by potential confounds of pre-inhale motor preparation or power changes. Together, these findings suggest that states of anticipation enhance olfactory perception through phase resetting of delta oscillations in piriform cortex.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/iuOKvySs354&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a nanomachine used by many bacteria to drive a toxin-laden needle into other bacterial cells. Although the potential to influence bacterial competition is clear, the fitness impacts of wielding a T6SS are not well understood. Here we present a new agent-based model that enables detailed study of the evolutionary costs and benefits of T6SS weaponry during competition with other bacteria. Our model identifies a key problem with the T6SS. Because of its short range, T6SS activity becomes self-limiting, as dead cells accumulate in its way, forming “corpse barriers” that block further attacks. However, further exploration with the model presented a solution to this problem: if injected toxins can quickly lyse target cells in addition to killing them, the T6SS becomes a more effective weapon. We tested this prediction with single-cell analysis of combat between T6SS-wielding &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter baylyi&lt;/i&gt; and T6SS-sensitive &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;. As predicted, delivery of lytic toxins is highly effective, whereas nonlytic toxins leave large patches of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; alive. We then analyzed hundreds of bacterial species using published genomic data, which suggest that the great majority of T6SS-wielding species do indeed use lytic toxins, indicative of a general principle underlying weapon evolution. Our work suggests that, in the T6SS, bacteria have evolved a disintegration weapon whose effectiveness often rests upon the ability to break up competitors. Understanding the evolutionary function of bacterial weapons can help in the design of probiotics that can both establish well and eliminate problem species.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/5_LHdCAMXds&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: HIV-1 Tat-mediated astrocytic amyloidosis involves the HIF-1α/lncRNA BACE1-AS axis</title>

Increased life expectancy of patients diagnosed with HIV in the current era of antiretroviral therapy is unfortunately accompanied with the prevalence of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HANDs) and risk of comorbidities such as Alzheimer-like pathology. HIV-1 transactivator of transcription (Tat) protein has been shown to induce the production of toxic neuronal amyloid protein and also enhance neurotoxicity. The contribution of astrocytes in Tat-mediated amyloidosis remains an enigma. We report here, in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)+ rhesus macaques and patients diagnosed with HIV, brain region–specific up-regulation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Aβ (40 and 42) in astrocytes. In addition, we find increased expression of β-site cleaving enzyme (BACE1), APP, and Aβ in human primary astrocytes (HPAs) exposed to Tat. Mechanisms involved up-regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1α), its translocation and binding to the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) BACE1‐antisense transcript (BACE1-AS), resulting, in turn, in the formation of the BACE1-AS/BACE1 RNA complex, subsequently leading to increased BACE1 protein, and activity and generation of Aβ-42. Gene silencing approaches confirmed the regulatory role of HIF-1α in BACE1-AS/BACE1 in Tat-mediated amyloidosis. This is the first report implicating the role of the HIF-1α/lncRNABACE1-AS/BACE1 axis in Tat-mediated induction of astrocytic amyloidosis, which could be targeted as adjunctive therapies for HAND-associated Alzheimer-like comorbidity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/xNuaoBeFtwk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Behavioral flexibility is associated with changes in structure and function distributed across a frontal cortical network in macaques</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/7bLSqR7cW90/article</link>

Bell, Mark J. Buckley, Léa Roumazeilles, Steven Cuell, Mark E. Walton, Kristine Krug, Rogier B. Mars, Matthew F. S. Rushworth&lt;/p&gt;

One of the most influential accounts of central orbitofrontal cortex—that it mediates behavioral flexibility—has been challenged by the finding that discrimination reversal in macaques, the classic test of behavioral flexibility, is unaffected when lesions are made by excitotoxin injection rather than aspiration. This suggests that the critical brain circuit mediating behavioral flexibility in reversal tasks lies beyond the central orbitofrontal cortex. To determine its identity, a group of nine macaques were taught discrimination reversal learning tasks, and its impact on gray matter was measured. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were taken before and after learning and compared with scans from two control groups, each comprising 10 animals. One control group learned discrimination tasks that were similar but lacked any reversal component, and the other control group engaged in no learning. Gray matter changes were prominent in posterior orbitofrontal cortex/anterior insula but were also found in three other frontal cortical regions: lateral orbitofrontal cortex (orbital part of area 12 [12o]), cingulate cortex, and lateral prefrontal cortex. In a second analysis, neural activity in posterior orbitofrontal cortex/anterior insula was measured at rest, and its pattern of coupling with the other frontal cortical regions was assessed. Activity coupling increased significantly in the reversal learning group in comparison with controls. In a final set of experiments, we used similar structural imaging procedures and analyses to demonstrate that aspiration lesion of central orbitofrontal cortex, of the type known to affect discrimination learning, affected structure and activity in the same frontal cortical circuit. The results identify a distributed frontal cortical circuit associated with behavioral flexibility.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/7bLSqR7cW90&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Predictive whisker kinematics reveal context-dependent sensorimotor strategies</title>

Animals actively move their sensory organs in order to acquire sensory information. Some rodents, such as mice and rats, employ cyclic scanning motions of their facial whiskers to explore their proximal surrounding, a behavior known as whisking. Here, we investigated the contingency of whisking kinematics on the animal’s behavioral context that arises from both internal processes (attention and expectations) and external constraints (available sensory and motor degrees of freedom). We recorded rat whisking at high temporal resolution in 2 experimental contexts—freely moving or head-fixed—and 2 spatial sensory configurations—a single row or 3 caudal whiskers on each side of the snout. We found that rapid sensorimotor twitches, called pumps, occurring during free-air whisking carry information about the rat’s upcoming exploratory direction, as demonstrated by the ability of these pumps to predict consequent head and body locomotion. Specifically, pump behavior during both voluntary motionlessness and imposed head fixation exposed a backward redistribution of sensorimotor exploratory resources. Further, head-fixed rats employed a wide range of whisking profiles to compensate for the loss of head- and body-motor degrees of freedom. Finally, changing the number of intact vibrissae available to a rat resulted in an alteration of whisking strategy consistent with the rat actively reallocating its remaining resources. In sum, this work shows that rats adapt their active exploratory behavior in a “homeostatic” attempt to preserve sensorimotor coverage under changing environmental conditions and changing sensory capacities, including those imposed by various laboratory conditions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/oarD9EsnT5I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Ultra‐early Blood Pressure Reduction Attenuates Hematoma Growth and Improves Outcome in Intracerebral Hemorrhage</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25793?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate whether intensive blood pressure treatment is associated with less hematoma growth and better outcome in ICH patients who received intravenous nicardipine treatment within 2 hrs after onset of symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A post‐hoc exploratory analysis of the Antihypertensive Treatment of Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage 2 (ATACH‐2) trial was performed. This was a multicenter, international, open‐label randomized clinical trial in which patients with primary ICH were allocated to intensive versus standard blood pressure treatment with nicardipine within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. We have included 913 patients with complete imaging and follow‐up data in the present analysis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the 913 included patients, 354 (38.7%) had intravenous nicardipine treatment initiated within 2 hours. In this subgroup of patients treated within 2 hours, the frequency of ICH expansion was significantly lower in the intensive blood pressure reduction group as compared with standard treatment group (P = 0.02). Multivariable analysis showed that ultra‐early intensive blood pressure treatment was associated with a decreased risk of hematoma growth (odds ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.34–0.92; P = 0.02), higher rate of functional independence (odds ratio, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.28–3.68; P = 0.004) and good outcome (OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.01–2.83; P = 0.048) at 90 days. Ultra‐early intensive blood pressure reduction was associated with a favorable shift in modified Rankin Scale score distribution at 3 months (p = 0.04).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a subgroup of ICH patients with elevated blood pressure given intravenous nicardipine within 2 hours of symptom onset, intensive blood pressure reduction was associated with reduced hematoma growth and improved functional outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

Here we report local (regional) differences in expression patterns that were also treatment specific. Both &lt;i&gt;BMP2 &lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;BMP4 &lt;/i&gt; genes showed the expected increased expression with imposed myopic defocus (+10 D lens) after 2 and 48 h, albeit limited to central and mid‐peripheral RPE zones. In contrast, the expected decrease in &lt;i&gt;BMP2 &lt;/i&gt; gene expression with imposed hyperopic defocus (‐10 D lens) was evident across all three zones after both 2 and 48 h, with similar patterns observed after 48 h with form‐deprivation. Similar but smaller changes were recorded for &lt;i&gt;BMP4 &lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;BMP7 &lt;/i&gt; gene expression with the latter myopia‐inducing treatments.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We previously reported bidirectional gene expression regulation of the Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (&lt;i&gt;BMP2, 4, &lt;/i&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;i&gt;7 &lt;/i&gt;) in chick retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in response to imposed optical defocus and form‐deprivation (FD). This study investigated whether there are local (regional) differences in these effects. 19‐day old White‐Leghorn chicks wore monocular +10 or − 10 D lenses, or diffusers (FD) for 2 or 48 h, after which RPE samples were collected from both eyes, from a central circular zone (3 mm radius), and 3 mm wide annular mid‐peripheral and peripheral zones in all cases. &lt;i&gt;BMP2, 4, &lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;7 &lt;/i&gt; gene expression levels in RPE from treated and fellow control eyes were compared as well as differences across zones. With the +10 D lens, increased expression of both &lt;i&gt;BMP2 &lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;BMP4 &lt;/i&gt; genes was observed in central and mid‐peripheral zones but not the peripheral zone after 2 and 48 h. In contrast, with the −10 D lens &lt;i&gt;BMP2 &lt;/i&gt; gene expression was significantly decreased in all three zones after 2 and 48 h. Similar patterns of &lt;i&gt;BMP2 &lt;/i&gt; gene expression were observed in all three zones after 48 h of FD. Smaller changes were recorded for &lt;i&gt;BMP4 &lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;BMP7 &lt;/i&gt; gene expression for both myopia‐inducing treatments. That optical defocus‐ and FD‐induced changes in &lt;i&gt;BMP &lt;/i&gt; gene expression in chick RPE show treatment‐dependent local (regional) differences suggest important differences in the nature and contributions of local retinal and underlying RPE regions to eye growth regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Nectin‐2α is localized at cholinergic neuron dendrites and regulates synapse formation in the medial habenula</title>

&lt;p&gt;Nectin‐2α, prominently expressed in the medial habenula (MHb), was localized at cholinergic neuron dendrites in synaptic regions of the MHb (clustered filled dots) in addition to the boundary between the adjacent somata of the clustered cholinergic neurons (edges of clustered open hexagons). This dendritic nectin‐2α formed puncta adherentia junctions cooperatively with afadin, cadherin‐8, p120‐catenin, β‐catenin, and αN‐catenin and regulated synapse formation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medial habenula (MHb) receives afferents from the triangular septum and the medial septal complex, projects efferents to the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) in the midbrain to regulate dopamine and serotonin levels, and is implicated in stress, depression, memory, and nicotine withdrawal syndrome. We previously showed that the cell adhesion molecule nectin‐2α is localized at the boundary between adjacent somata of clustered cholinergic neurons and regulates the voltage‐gated A‐type K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel Kv4.2 localization at membrane specializations in the MHb. This adhesion apparatus, named nectin‐2α spots, is not associated with the nectin‐binding protein afadin or any classic cadherins and their binding proteins p120‐catenin and β‐catenin. We showed here that nectin‐2α was additionally localized at cholinergic neuron dendrites in synaptic regions of the MHb. The genetic ablation of &lt;i&gt;nectin‐2 &lt;/i&gt; reduced the number of synapses in the MHb without affecting their morphology. Nectin‐2α was associated with afadin, cadherin‐8, p120‐catenin, β‐catenin, and αN‐catenin, forming puncta adherentia junctions (PAJs). Nectin‐2α was observed in the IPN, but not in the triangular septum or the medial septal complex. The genetic ablation of &lt;i&gt;nectin‐2 &lt;/i&gt; did not affect synapse formation in the IPN. These results indicate that nectin‐2α forms two types of adhesion apparatus in the MHb, namely nectin‐2α spots at neighboring somata and PAJs at neighboring dendrites, and that dendritic PAJs regulate synapse formation in the MHb.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Neonatal Ketamine Alters High-Frequency Oscillations and Synaptic Plasticity in the Subiculum But Does not Affect Sleep Macrostructure in Adolescent Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00026</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Exposure to sedative/hypnotic and anesthetic drugs, such as ketamine, during the critical period of synaptogenesis, causes profound neurotoxicity in the developing rodent and primate brains and is associated with poor cognitive outcomes later in life. The subiculum is especially vulnerable to acute neurotoxicity after neonatal exposure to sedative/hypnotic and anesthetic drugs. The subiculum acts as a relay center between the hippocampal complex and various cortical and subcortical brain regions and is also an independent generator of gamma oscillations. Gamma oscillations are vital in neuronal synchronization and play a role in learning and memory during wake and sleep. However, there has been little research examining long-term changes in subicular neurophysiology after neonatal exposure to ketamine. Here we explore the lasting effects of neonatal ketamine exposure on sleep macrostructure as well as subicular neuronal oscillations and synaptic plasticity in rats. During the peak of rodent synaptogenesis at postnatal day 7, rat pups were exposed to either 40 mg/kg of ketamine over 12 h or to volume matched saline vehicle. At weaning age, a subset of rats were implanted with a cortical and subicular electroencephalogram electrode, and at postnatal day 31, we performed in vivo experiments that included sleep macrostructure (divided into the wake, non-rapid eye movement, and rapid eye movement sleep) and electroencephalogram power spectra in cortex and subiculum. In a second subset of ketamine exposed animals, we conducted ex vivo studies of long-term potentiation (LTP) experiments in adolescent rats. Overall, we found that neonatal exposure to ketamine increased subicular gamma oscillations during non-rapid eye movement sleep but it did not alter sleep macrostructure. Also, we observed a significant decrease in subicular LTP. Gamma oscillations during non-rapid eye movement sleep are implicated in memory formation and consolidation, while LTP serves as a surrogate for learning and memory. Together these results suggest that lasting functional changes in subiculum circuitry may underlie neurocognitive impairments associated with neonatal exposure to anesthetic agents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Dysregulated Prefrontal Cortex Inhibition in Prepubescent and Adolescent Fragile X Mouse Model</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00088</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Changes in excitation and inhibition are associated with the pathobiology of neurodevelopmental disorders of intellectual disability and autism and are widely described in Fragile X syndrome (FXS). In the prefrontal cortex (PFC), essential for cognitive processing, excitatory connectivity and plasticity are found altered in the FXS mouse model, however, little is known about the state of inhibition. To that end, we investigated GABAergic signaling in the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) knock out (Fmr1-KO) mouse medial PFC (mPFC). We report changes at the molecular, and functional levels of inhibition at three (prepubescence) and six (adolescence) postnatal weeks. Functional changes were most prominent during early postnatal development, resulting in stronger inhibition, through increased synaptic inhibitory drive and amplitude, and reduction of inhibitory short-term synaptic depression. Noise analysis of prepubescent post-synaptic currents demonstrated an increased number of receptors opening during peak current in Fmr1-KO inhibitory synapses. During adolescence amplitudes and plasticity changes normalized, however, the inhibitory drive was now reduced in Fmr1-KO, while synaptic kinetics were prolonged. Finally, adolescent GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor subunit α2 and GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptor subtype B1 expression levels were different in Fmr1-KOs than WT littermate controls. Together these results extend the degree of synaptic GABAergic alterations in FXS, now to the mPFC of Fmr1-KO mice, a behaviourally relevant brain region in neurodevelopmental disorder pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Frequency-Dependent Intrinsic Electrophysiological Functional Architecture of the Human Verbal Language Network</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00027</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) allowed the spatial characterization of the resting-state verbal language network (vLN). While other resting-state networks (RSNs) were matched with their electrophysiological equivalents at rest and could be spectrally defined, such correspondence is lacking for the vLN. This magnetoencephalography (MEG) study aimed at defining the spatio-spectral characteristics of the neuromagnetic intrinsic functional architecture of the vLN. Neuromagnetic activity was recorded at rest in 100 right-handed healthy adults (age range: 18–41 years). Band-limited power envelope correlations were performed within and across frequency bands (θ, α, β, and low γ) from a seed region placed in the left Broca’s area, using static orthogonalization as leakage correction. K-means clustering was used to segregate spatio-spectral clusters of resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC). Remarkably, unlike other RSNs, within-frequency long-range rsFC from the left Broca’s area was not driven by one main carrying frequency but was characterized by a specific spatio-spectral pattern segregated along the ventral (predominantly θ and α) and dorsal (β and low-γ bands) vLN streams. In contrast, spatial patterns of cross-frequency vLN functional integration were spectrally more widespread and involved multiple frequency bands. Moreover, the static intrinsic functional architecture of the neuromagnetic human vLN involved clearly left-hemisphere-dominant vLN interactions as well as cross-network interactions with the executive control network and postero-medial nodes of the DMN. Overall, this study highlighted the involvement of multiple modes of within and cross-frequency power envelope couplings at the basis of long-range electrophysiological vLN functional integration. As such, it lays the foundation for future works aimed at understanding the pathophysiology of language-related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It may seem useless to propose preventive measures for a disease without established pathogenesis and successful therapy, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, we will show that ALS shares essential molecular mechanisms with aging and that established anti-aging strategies, such as healthy diet or individually adjusted exercise, may be successfully applied to ameliorate the condition of ALS patients. These strategies might be applied for prevention if persons at ALS risk could be identified early enough. Recent research advances indicate that this may happen soon.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Characterizing Motor Control of Mastication With Soft Actor-Critic</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00188</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The human masticatory system is a complex functional unit characterized by a multitude of skeletal components, muscles, soft tissues, and teeth. Muscle activation dynamics cannot be directly measured on live human subjects due to ethical, safety, and accessibility limitations. Therefore, estimation of muscle activations and their resultant forces is a longstanding and active area of research. Reinforcement learning (RL) is an adaptive learning strategy which is inspired by the behavioral psychology and enables an agent to learn the dynamics of an unknown system via policy-driven explorations. The RL framework is a well-formulated closed-loop system where high capacity neural networks are trained with the feedback mechanism of rewards to learn relatively complex actuation patterns. In this work, we are building on a deep RL algorithm, known as the Soft Actor-Critic, to learn the inverse dynamics of a simulated masticatory system, i.e., learn the activation patterns that drive the jaw to its desired location. The outcome of the proposed training procedure is a parametric neural model which acts as the brain of the biomechanical system. We demonstrate the model's ability to navigate the feasible three-dimensional (3D) envelope of motion with sub-millimeter accuracies. We also introduce a performance analysis platform consisting of a set of quantitative metrics to assess the functionalities of a given simulated masticatory system. This platform assesses the range of motion, metabolic efficiency, the agility of motion, the symmetry of activations, and the accuracy of reaching the desired target positions. We demonstrate how the model learns more metabolically efficient policies by integrating a force regularization term in the RL reward. We also demonstrate the inverse correlation between the metabolic efficiency of the models and their agility and range of motion. The presented masticatory model and the proposed RL training mechanism are valuable tools for the analysis of mastication and other biomechanical systems. We see this framework's potential in facilitating the functional analyses aspects of surgical treatment planning and predicting the rehabilitation performance in post-operative subjects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Shape of a Vehicle Windshield Affects Reaction Time and Brain Activity During a Target Detection Task</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00183</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Achieving clear visibility through a windshield is one of the crucial factors in manufacturing a safe and comfortable vehicle. The optic flow (OF) through the windshield has been reported to divert attention and could impair visibility. Although a growing number of behavioral and neuroimaging studies have assessed drivers’ attention in various driving scenarios, there is still little evidence of a relationship between OF, windshield shape, and driver’s attentional efficacy. The purpose of this research was to examine this relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: First, we quantified the OF across the windshield in a simulated driving scenario with either of two types of the windshield (a tilted or vertical pillar) at different speeds (60 km/h or 160 km/h) and found more upward OF along the tilted pillar than along the vertical pillar. Therefore, we hypothesized that the predominance of upward OF around the windshield along a tilted pillar could distract a driver and that we could observe the corresponding neural activity. Magnetic resonance scans were then obtained while the subjects performed a visual detection task while watching the driving scene used in the OF analysis. The subjects were required to press a button as rapidly as possible when a target appeared at one of five positions (leftmost, left, center, right, and rightmost).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We found that the reaction time (RT) on exposure to a tilted pillar was longer than that on exposure to a vertical pillar in the leftmost and rightmost conditions. Furthermore, there was more brain activity in the precuneus when the pillar was tilted than when it was vertical in the rightmost condition near the pillar. In a separate analysis, activation in the precuneus was found to reflect relative changes in the amount of upward OF when the target was at the rightmost position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Overall, these observations suggest that activation in the precuneus may reflect extraneous cognitive load driven by upward OF along the pillar and could distract visual attention. The findings of this study highlight the value of a cognitive neuroscientific approach to research and development in the motor vehicle manufacturing industry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00168</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sensorimotor communication is a form of communication instantiated through body movements that are guided by both instrumental, goal-directed intentions and communicative, social intentions. Depending on the social interaction context, sensorimotor communication can serve different functions. This article aims to disentangle three of these functions: (a) an informing function of body movements, to highlight action intentions for an observer; (b) a coordinating function of body movements, to facilitate real-time action prediction in joint action; and (c) a performing function of body movements, to elicit emotional or aesthetic experiences in an audience. We provide examples of research addressing these different functions as well as some influencing factors, relating to individual differences, task characteristics, and situational demands. The article concludes by discussing the benefits of a closer dialog between separate lines of research on sensorimotor communication across different social contexts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Early Engagement of Parietal Cortex for Subtraction Solving Predicts Longitudinal Gains in Behavioral Fluency in Children</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00163</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There is debate in the literature regarding how single-digit arithmetic fluency is achieved over development. While the Fact-retrieval hypothesis suggests that with practice, children shift from quantity-based procedures to verbally retrieving arithmetic problems from long-term memory, the Schema-based hypothesis claims that problems are solved through quantity-based procedures and that practice leads to these procedures becoming more automatic. To test these hypotheses, a sample of 46 typically developing children underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) when they were 11 years old (time 1), and 2 years later (time 2). We independently defined regions of interest (ROIs) involved in verbal and quantity processing using rhyming and numerosity judgment localizer tasks, respectively. The verbal ROIs consisted of left middle/superior temporal gyri (MTG/STG) and left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), whereas the quantity ROIs consisted of bilateral inferior/superior parietal lobules (IPL/SPL) and bilateral middle frontal gyri (MFG)/right IFG. Participants also solved a single-digit subtraction task in the scanner. We defined the extent to which children relied on verbal vs. quantity mechanisms by selecting the 100 voxels showing maximal activation at time 1 from each ROI, separately for small and large subtractions. We studied the brain mechanisms at time 1 that predicted gains in subtraction fluency and how these mechanisms changed over time with improvement. When looking at brain activation at time 1, we found that improvers showed a larger neural problem size effect in bilateral parietal cortex, whereas no effects were found in verbal regions. Results also revealed that children who showed improvement in behavioral fluency for large subtraction problems showed decreased activation over time for large subtractions in both parietal and frontal regions implicated in quantity, whereas non-improvers maintained similar levels of activation. All children, regardless of improvement, showed decreased activation over time for large subtraction problems in verbal regions. The greater parietal problem size effect at time 1 and the reduction in activation over time for the improvers in parietal and frontal regions implicated in quantity processing is consistent with the Schema-based hypothesis arguing for more automatic procedures with increasing skill. The lack of a problem size effect at time 1 and the overall decrease in verbal regions, regardless of improvement, is inconsistent with the Fact-retrieval hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Synaptic Diversity Suppresses Complex Collective Behavior in Networks of Theta Neurons</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00044</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Comprehending how the brain functions requires an understanding of the dynamics of neuronal assemblies. Previous work used a mean-field reduction method to determine the collective dynamics of a large heterogeneous network of uniformly and globally coupled theta neurons, which are a canonical formulation of Type I neurons. However, in modeling neuronal networks, it is unreasonable to assume that the coupling strength between every pair of neurons is identical. The goal in the present work is to analytically examine the collective macroscopic behavior of a network of theta neurons that is more realistic in that it includes heterogeneity in the coupling strength as well as in neuronal excitability. We consider the occurrence of dynamical structures that give rise to complicated dynamics via bifurcations of macroscopic collective quantities, concentrating on two biophysically relevant cases: (1) predominantly excitable neurons with mostly excitatory connections, and (2) predominantly spiking neurons with inhibitory connections. We find that increasing the synaptic diversity moves these dynamical structures to distant extremes of parameter space, leaving simple collective equilibrium states in the physiologically relevant region. We also study the node vs. focus nature of stable macroscopic equilibrium solutions and discuss our results in the context of recent literature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: A Modeling Study of the Emergence of Eye Position Gain Fields Modulating the Responses of Visual Neurons in the Brain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00030</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The responses of many cortical neurons to visual stimuli are modulated by the position of the eye. This form of gain modulation by eye position does not change the retinotopic selectivity of the responses, but only changes the amplitude of the responses. Particularly in the case of cortical responses, this form of eye position gain modulation has been observed to be multiplicative. Multiplicative gain modulated responses are crucial to encode information that is relevant to high-level visual functions, such as stable spatial awareness, eye movement planning, visual-motor behaviors, and coordinate transformation. Here we first present a hardwired model of different functional forms of gain modulation, including peaked and monotonic modulation by eye position. We use a biologically realistic Gaussian function to model the influence of the position of the eye on the internal activation of visual neurons. Next we show how different functional forms of gain modulation by eye position may develop in a self-organizing neural network model of visual neurons. A further contribution of our work is the investigation of the influence of the width of the eye position tuning curve on the development of a variety of forms of eye position gain modulation. Our simulation results show how the width of the eye position tuning curve affects the development of different forms of gain modulation of visual responses by the position of the eye.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Epothilone B Facilitates Peripheral Nerve Regeneration by Promoting Autophagy and Migration in Schwann Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00143</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The search for drugs that can facilitate axonal regeneration and elongation following peripheral nerve injury has been an area of increasing interest in recent years. Epothilone B (EpoB) is an FDA-approved antineoplastic agent, which shows the capacity to induce α-tubulin polymerization and to improve the stability of microtubules. Recently, it has been increasingly recognized that EpoB has a regenerative effect in the central nervous system. However, the information currently available regarding the potential therapeutic effect of EpoB on peripheral nerve regeneration is limited. Here, we used a rat sciatic crush injury model system to determine that EpoB strikingly improved axonal regeneration and recovery of function. Also, EpoB (1 nM) did not result in significant apoptosis in Schwann cells (SCs) and showed little effect on their viability either. Interestingly, EpoB (1 nM) significantly enhanced migration in SCs, which was inhibited by autophagy inhibitors 3-methyladenine (3-MA). Since PI3K/Akt signaling has been implicated in regulating autophagy, we further examined the involvement of PI3K/Akt in the process of EpoB-induced SC migration. We found that EpoB (1 nM) significantly inhibited phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt in SCs. Further studies showed that both EpoB-enhanced migration and autophagy were increased/inhibited by inhibition/activation of PI3K/Akt signaling with LY294002 or IGF-1. In conclusion, EpoB can promote axonal regeneration following peripheral nerve injury by enhancing the migration of SCs, with this activity being controlled by PI3K/Akt signaling-mediated autophagy in SCs. This underscores the potential therapeutic value of EpoB in enhancing regeneration and functional recovery in cases of peripheral nerve injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00136</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Embryonic exposure to the teratogen nicotine results in brain defects, by disrupting endogenous spatial pre patterns necessary for normal brain size and patterning. Extending prior work in Xenopus laevis that showed that misexpression of ion channels can rescue morphogenesis, we demonstrate and characterize a novel aspect of developmental bioelectricity: channel-dependent repair signals propagate long-range across the embryo. We show that distal HCN2 channel misexpression and distal transplants of HCN2-expressing tissue, non-cell-autonomously reverse profound defects, rescuing brain anatomy, gene expression, and learning. Moreover, such rescue can be induced by small-molecule HCN2 channel activators, even with delayed treatment initiation. We present a simple, versatile computational model of bioelectrical signaling upstream of key patterning genes such as OTX2 and XBF1, which predicts long-range repair induced by ion channel activity, and experimentally validate the predictions of this model. Our results and quantitative model identify a powerful morphogenetic control mechanism that could be targeted by future regenerative medicine exploiting ion channel modulating drugs approved for human use.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Induced Suppression of the Left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex Favorably Changes Interhemispheric Communication During Bimanual Coordination in Older Adults–A Neuronavigated rTMS Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00149</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) research indicated that the ability of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) to disinhibit the contralateral primary motor cortex (M1) during motor preparation is an important predictor for bimanual motor performance in both young and older healthy adults. However, this DLPFC-M1 disinhibition is reduced in older adults. Here, we transiently suppressed left DLPFC using repetitive TMS (rTMS) during a cyclical bimanual task and investigated the effect of left DLPFC suppression: (1) on the projection from left DLPFC to the contralateral M1; and (2) on motor performance in 21 young (mean age ± SD = 21.57 ± 1.83) and 20 older (mean age ± SD = 69.05 ± 4.48) healthy adults. As predicted, without rTMS, older adults showed compromised DLPFC-M1 disinhibition as compared to younger adults and less preparatory DLPFC-M1 disinhibition was related to less accurate performance, irrespective of age. Notably, rTMS-induced DLPFC suppression restored DLPFC-M1 disinhibition in older adults and improved performance accuracy right after the local suppression in both age groups. However, the rTMS-induced gain in disinhibition was not correlated with the gain in performance. In sum, this novel rTMS approach advanced our mechanistic understanding of how left DLPFC regulates right M1 and allowed us to establish the causal role of left DLPFC in bimanual coordination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00125</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The aim of this study is to explore functional and structural properties of abnormal brain networks associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD). &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG PET) and T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging from 20 patients with moderate-stage PD and 20 age-matched healthy controls were acquired to identify disease-related patterns in functional and structural networks. Dual-modal images from another prospective subject of 15 PD patients were used as the validation group. Scaled Subprofile Modeling based on principal component analysis method was applied to determine disease-related patterns in both modalities, and brain connectome analysis based on graph theory was applied to verify these patterns. The results showed that the expressions of the metabolic and structural patterns in PD patients were significantly higher than healthy controls (PD1-HC, p = 0.0039, p = 0.0058; PD2-HC, p &amp;lt; 0.001, p = 0.044). The metabolic pattern was characterized by relative increased metabolic activity in pallidothalamic, pons, putamen, and cerebellum, associated with metabolic decreased in parietal–occipital areas. The structural pattern was characterized by relative decreased gray matter (GM) volume in pons, transverse temporal gyrus, left cuneus, right superior occipital gyrus, and right superior parietal lobule, associated with preservation in GM volume in pallidum and putamen. In addition, both patterns were verified in the connectome analysis. The findings suggest that significant overlaps between metabolic and structural patterns provide new evidence for elucidating the neuropathological mechanisms of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) regulates cellular and synaptic properties in an activity‐dependent manner. Using unilateral cochlea removal as a method to deprive afferent input to the chicken cochlear neurons, we identified a persistent FMRP aggregation in a subset of neurons that undergo cell death. In addition, we found newly emerged or enhanced correlations of FMRP level with cellular and synaptic rearrangements in the surviving neurons after regaining their homeostasis. These results demonstrate that afferent input regulates FMRP expression and localization in ways associated with multiple types of neuronal responses and synaptic dynamics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afferent activity dynamically regulates neuronal properties and connectivity in the central nervous system. The Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is an RNA‐binding protein that regulates cellular and synaptic properties in an activity‐dependent manner. Whether and how FMRP level and localization are regulated by afferent input remains sparsely examined and how such regulation is associated with neuronal response to changes in sensory input is unknown. We characterized changes in FMRP level and localization in the chicken nucleus magnocellularis (NM), a primary cochlear nucleus, following afferent deprivation by unilateral cochlea removal. We observed rapid (within 2 hours) aggregation of FMRP immunoreactivity into large granular structures in a subset of deafferented NM neurons. Neurons that exhibited persistent FMRP aggregation at 12–24 hours eventually lost cytoplasmic Nissl substance, indicating cell death. A week later, FMRP expression in surviving neurons regained its homeostasis, with a slightly reduced immunostaining intensity and enhanced heterogeneity. Correlation analyses under the homeostatic status (7–14 days) revealed that neurons expressing relatively more FMRP had a higher capability of maintaining cell body size and ribosomal activity, as well as a better ability to detach inactive presynaptic terminals. Additionally, the intensity of an inhibitory postsynaptic protein, gephyrin, was reduced following deafferentation and was positively correlated with FMRP intensity, implicating an involvement of FMRP in synaptic dynamics in response to reduced afferent inputs. Collectively, this study demonstrates that afferent input regulates FMRP expression and localization in ways associated with multiple types of neuronal responses and synaptic rearrangements.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Neuroarchitecture of the central complex in the brain of the honeybee: Neuronal cell types</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.24941?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Neuroarchitecture of the central complex in the brain of the honeybee: Neuronal cell types&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/fd597998-2e93-4bbf-a20a-7da6104a8bcf/cne24941-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central complex in the insect brain is a higher order integration center and plays an important role in spatial orientation. Honeybees are excellent models to study the neuronal basis of orientation, due to their excellent homing skills. Here we present a catalogue of neurons in the honeybee central complex.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central complex (CX) in the insect brain is a higher order integration center that controls a number of behaviors, most prominently goal directed locomotion. The CX comprises the protocerebral bridge (PB), the upper division of the central body (CBU), the lower division of the central body (CBL), and the paired noduli (NO). Although spatial orientation has been extensively studied in honeybees at the behavioral level, most electrophysiological and anatomical analyses have been carried out in other insect species, leaving the morphology and physiology of neurons that constitute the CX in the honeybee mostly enigmatic. The goal of this study was to morphologically identify neuronal cell types of the CX in the honeybee &lt;i&gt;Apis mellifera &lt;/i&gt;. By performing iontophoretic dye injections into the CX, we traced 16 subtypes of neuron that connect a subdivision of the CX with other regions in the bee's central brain, and eight subtypes that mainly interconnect different subdivisions of the CX. They establish extensive connections between the CX and the lateral complex, the superior protocerebrum and the posterior protocerebrum. Characterized neuron classes and subtypes are morphologically similar to those described in other insects, suggesting considerable conservation in the neural network relevant for orientation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Nanoliposomes as a Therapeutic Tool for Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00020</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The accumulation of extracellular amyloid-beta (Aβ), denoted as senile plaques, and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (formed by hyperphosphorylated Tau protein) in the brain are two major neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The current and most accepted hypothesis proposes that the oligomerization of Aβ peptides triggers the polymerization and accumulation of amyloid, which leads to the senile plaques. Several strategies have been reported to target Aβ oligomerization/polymerization. Since it is thought that Aβ levels in the brain and peripheral blood maintain equilibrium, it has been hypothesized that enhancing peripheral clearance (by shifting this equilibrium towards the blood) might reduce Aβ levels in the brain, known as the sink effect. This process has been reported to be effective, showing a reduction in Aβ burden in the brain as a consequence of the peripheral reduction of Aβ levels. Nanoparticles (NPs) may have difficulty crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB), initially due to their size. It is not clear whether particles in the range of 50–100 nm should be able to cross the BBB without being specifically modified for it. Despite the size limitation of crossing the BBB, several NP derivatives may be proposed as therapeutic tools. The purpose of this review is to summarize some therapeutic approaches based on nanoliposomes using two complementary examples: First, unilamellar nanoliposomes containing Aβ generic ligands, such as sphingolipids, gangliosides or curcumin, or some sphingolipid bound to the binding domain of ApoE; and second, nanoliposomes containing monoclonal antibodies against Aβ. Following similar rationale NPs of poly(lactide-co-glycolide)-poly (ethylene glycol) conjugated with curcumin-derivate (PLGA-PEG-B6/Cur) were reported to improve the spatial learning and memory capability of APP/PS1 mice, compared with native curcumin treatment. Also, some new nanostructures such as exosomes have been proposed as a putative therapeutic and prevention strategies of AD. Although the unquestionable interest of this issue is beyond the scope of this review article. The potential mechanisms and significance of nanoliposome therapies for AD, which are still are in clinical trials, will be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Single-Cell RNA Analysis of Type I Spiral Ganglion Neurons Reveals a Lmx1a Population in the Cochlea</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00083</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the mature cochlea, each inner hair cell (IHC) is innervated by multiple spiral ganglion neurons of type I (SGNI). SGNIs are morphologically and electro-physiologically diverse. Also, they differ in their susceptibility to noise insult. However, the molecular underpinnings of their identity and physiological differences remain poorly understood. In this study, we developed a novel triple transgenic mouse, which enabled the isolation of pure populations of SGNIs and the analysis of a 96-gene panel via single-cell qPCR. We found three distinct populations of Type I SGNs, which were marked by their exclusive expression of Lmx1a, Slc4a4, or Mfap4/Fzd2, respectively, at postnatal days P3, P8, and P12. Our data suggest that afferent SGN subtypes are established genetically before the onset of hearing and that the expression of key physiological markers, such as ion channels, is heterogeneous and may be underlying the heterogeneous firing proprieties of SGNIs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The most evident phenotype of degenerative motoneuron disease is the loss of motor function which accompanies motoneuron death. In both amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), it is now clear that dysfunction is not restricted to motoneurons but is manifest in the spinal circuits in which motoneurons are embedded. As mounting evidence shows that motoneurons possess more elaborate and extensive connections within the spinal cord than previously realized, it is necessary to consider the role of this circuitry and its dysfunction in the disease process. In this review article, we ask if the selective vulnerability of the different motoneuron types and the relative disease resistance of distinct motoneuron groups can be understood in terms of their intraspinal connections.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Impaired Regeneration in Dystrophic Muscle—New Target for Therapy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00069</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Muscle stem cells (MuSCs), known as satellite cells (SCs) have an incredible ability to regenerate, which enables the maintenance and growth of muscle tissue. In response to damaging stimuli, SCs are activated, proliferate, differentiate, and fuse to repair or generate a new muscle fiber. However, dystrophic muscles are characterized by poor muscle regeneration along with chronic inflammation and fibrosis. Indications for SC involvement in muscular dystrophy pathologies are accumulating, but their contribution to muscle pathophysiology is not precisely understood. In congenital muscular dystrophy type 1A (LAMA2-CMD), mutations in Lama2 gene cause either complete or partial absence in laminin-211 protein. Laminin-211 functions as a link between muscle extracellular matrix (ECM) and two adhesion systems in the sarcolemma; one is the well-known dystrophin–glycoprotein complex (DGC), and the second is the integrin complex. Because of its protein interactions and location, laminin-211 has a crucial role in muscle function and survival by maintaining sarcolemma integrity. In addition, laminin-211 is expressed in SCs and suggested to have a role in SC proliferation and differentiation. Downstream to the primary defect in laminin-211, several secondary genes and pathways accelerate disease mechanism, while at the same time there are unsuccessful attempts to regenerate as compensation for the dystrophic process. Lately, next-generation sequencing platforms have advanced our knowledge about the secondary events occurring in various diseases, elucidate the pathophysiology, and characterize new essential targets for development of new treatment strategies. This review will mainly focus on SC contribution to impaired regeneration in muscular dystrophies and specifically new findings suggesting SC involvement in LAMA2-CMD pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Quantitative Measurements of LRRK2 in Human Cerebrospinal Fluid Demonstrates Increased Levels in G2019S Patients</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00526</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) mutations are among the most significant genetic risk factors for developing late onset Parkinson’s disease (PD). To understand whether a therapeutic can modulate LRRK2 levels as a potential disease modifying strategy, it is important to have methods in place to measure the protein with high sensitivity and specificity. To date, LRRK2 measurements in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have used extracellular vesicle enrichment via differential ultracentrifugation and western blot detection. Our goal was to develop a methodology which could be deployed in a clinical trial, therefore throughput, robustness and sensitivity were critical. To this end, we developed a Stable Isotope Standard Capture by Anti-peptide Antibody (SISCAPA) assay which is capable of detecting LRRK2 from 1 ml of human CSF. The assay uses a commercially available LRRK2 monoclonal antibody (N241A/34) and does not require extracellular vesicle enrichment steps. The assay includes stable isotope peptide addition which allows for absolute quantitation of LRRK2 protein. We determined that the assay performed adequately for CSF measurements and that blood contamination from traumatic lumbar puncture does not pose a serious analytical challenge. We then applied this technique to 106 CSF samples from the MJFF LRRK2 Cohort Consortium which includes healthy controls, sporadic PD patients and LRRK2 mutation carriers with and without PD. Of the 105 samples that had detectable LRRK2 signal, we found that the PD group with the G2019S LRRK2 mutation had significantly higher CSF LRRK2 levels compared to all other groups. We also found that CSF LRRK2 increased with the age of the participant. Taken together, this work represents a step forward in our ability to measure LRRK2 in a challenging matrix like CSF which has implications for current and future LRRK2 therapeutic clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Therapeutic Targeting of Proteostasis in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis—a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Preclinical Research</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00511</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressive fatal neurodegenerative condition. There are no effective treatments. The only globally licensed medication, that prolongs life by 2–3 months, was approved by the FDA in 1995. One reason for the absence of effective treatments is disease heterogeneity noting that ALS is clinically heterogeneous and can be considered to exist on a neuropathological spectrum with frontotemporal dementia. Despite this significant clinical heterogeneity, protein misfolding has been identified as a unifying pathological feature in these cases. Based on this shared pathophysiology, we carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the therapeutic efficacy of compounds that specifically target protein misfolding in preclinical studies of both ALS and FTD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Three databases: (i) PubMed, (ii) MEDLINE, and (iii) EMBASE were searched. All studies comparing the effect of treatments targeting protein misfolding in pre-clinical ALS or FTD models to a control group were retrieved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Systematic review identified 70 pre-clinical studies investigating the effects of therapies targeting protein misfolding on survival. Meta-analysis revealed that targeting protein misfolding did significantly improve survival compared to untreated controls (p &amp;lt; 0.001, df = 68, α = 0.05, CI 1.05–1.16), with no evidence of heterogeneity between studies (I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%). Further subgroup analyses, evaluating the effect of timing of these interventions, showed that, only treating prior to symptom onset (n = 33), significantly improved survival (p &amp;lt; 0.001, df = 31, α = 0.05, CI 1.08–1.29), although this likely reflects the inadequate sample size of later time points. Furthermore, arimoclomol was found to significantly reduce secondary outcome measures including: (i) histological outcomes, (ii) behavioral outcomes, and (iii) biochemical outcomes (p &amp;lt; 0.005).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: This analysis supports the hypothesis that protein misfolding plays an important role in the pathogenesis of ALS and FTD and that targeting protein misfolding, at least in pre-clinical models, can significantly improve survival, especially if such an intervention is administered prior to symptom onset.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: “LRRK2: Autophagy and Lysosomal Activity”</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00498</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It has been 15 years since the Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene was identified as the most common genetic cause for Parkinson’s disease (PD). The two most common mutations are the LRRK2-G2019S, located in the kinase domain, and the LRRK2-R1441C, located in the ROC-COR domain. While the LRRK2-G2019S mutation is associated with increased kinase activity, the LRRK2-R1441C exhibits a decreased GTPase activity and altered kinase activity. Multiple lines of evidence have linked the LRRK2 protein with a role in the autophagy pathway and with lysosomal activity in neurons. Neurons rely heavily on autophagy to recycle proteins and process cellular waste due to their post-mitotic state. Additionally, lysosomal activity decreases with age which can potentiate the accumulation of α-synuclein, the pathological hallmark of PD, and subsequently lead to the build-up of Lewy bodies (LBs) observed in this disorder. This review provides an up to date summary of the LRRK2 field to understand its physiological role in the autophagy pathway in neurons and related cells. Careful assessment of how LRRK2 participates in the regulation of phagophore and autophagosome formation, autophagosome and lysosome fusion, lysosomal maturation, maintenance of lysosomal pH and calcium levels, and lysosomal protein degradation are addressed. The autophagy pathway is a complex cellular process and due to the variety of LRRK2 models studied in the field, associated phenotypes have been reported to be seemingly conflicting. This review provides an in-depth discussion of different models to assess the normal and disease-associated role of the LRRK2 protein on autophagic function. Given the importance of the autophagy pathway in Parkinson’s pathogenesis it is particularly relevant to focus on the role of LRRK2 to discover novel therapeutic approaches that restore lysosomal protein degradation homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: A Novel Quantitative Spasticity Evaluation Method Based on Surface Electromyogram Signals and Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00462</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Stroke patients often suffer from spasticity. Before treatment of spasticity, there are often practical demands for objective and quantitative assessment of muscle spasticity. However, the common quantitative spasticity assessment method, the tonic stretch reflex threshold (TSRT), is time-consuming and complicated to implement due to the requirement of multiple passive stretches. To evaluate spasticity conveniently, a novel spasticity evaluation method based on surface electromyogram (sEMG) signals and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (i.e., the sEMG-ANFIS method) was presented in this paper. Eleven stroke patients with spasticity and four healthy subjects were recruited to participate in the experiment. During the experiment, the Modified Ashworth scale (MAS) scores of each subject was obtained and sEMG signals from four elbow flexors or extensors were collected from several times (4–5) repetitions of passive stretching. Four time-domain features (root mean square, the zero-cross rate, the wavelength and a 4th-order autoregressive model coefficient) and one frequency-domain feature (the mean power frequency) were extracted from the collected sEMG signals to reflect the spasticity information. Using the ANFIS classifier, excellent regression performance was achieved [mean accuracy = 0.96, mean root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 0.13], outperforming the classical TSRT method (accuracy = 0.88, RMSE = 0.28). The results showed that the sEMG-ANFIS method not only has higher accuracy but also is convenient to implement by requiring fewer repetitions (4–5) of passive stretches. The sEMG-ANFIS method can help stroke patients develop proper rehabilitation training programs and can potentially be used to provide therapeutic feedback for some new spasticity interventions, such as shockwave therapy and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Estimation of Involuntary Components of Human Arm Impedance in Multi-Joint Movements via Feedback Jerk Isolation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00459</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Stable and efficient coordination in physical human-robot interaction requires consideration of human feedback behavior. In unpredictable tasks, where voluntary cognitive feedback is too slow to guarantee desired task execution, the human must rely on involuntary intrinsic and reflexive feedback. The combined effects of these two feedback mechanisms and the inertial characteristics can be summarized in the involuntary impedance components. In this work, we present a method for the estimation of the involuntary impedance components of the human arm in multi-joint movements. We apply force perturbations to evoke feedback jerks that can be isolated using a high pass filter and limit the duration of the estimation interval to guarantee exclusion of voluntary cognitive feedback. Dynamic regressor representation of the rigid body dynamics of the arm and first order Taylor series expansion of the feedback behavior yield a model that is linear in the involuntary impedance components. The constant values of the inertial parameters are estimated in a static posture maintenance task and subsequently inserted to estimate the remaining components in a dynamic movement task. The method is validated with simulated data of a neuromechanical model of the human arm and its performance is compared to established methods from the literature. The results of the validation demonstrate superior estimation performance for moderate movement velocities, and less influence of the variability of the movements. The applicability to real data and the plausibility of the limited estimation interval are successfully demonstrated in an experiment with human participants.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: NICA: A Novel Toolbox for Near-Infrared Spectroscopy Calculations and Analyses</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.00026</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) measures the functional activity of the cerebral cortex. The concentration changes of oxygenated (oxy-Hb) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (deoxy-Hb) can be detected and associated with activation of the cortex in the investigated area (neurovascular coupling). Recorded signals of hemodynamic responses may contain influences from physiological signals (systemic influences, physiological artifacts) which do not originate from the cerebral cortex activity. The physiological artifacts contain the blood pressure (BP), respiratory patterns, and the pulsation of the heart. In order to perform a comprehensive analysis of recorded fNIRS data, a proper correction of these physiological artifacts is necessary. This article introduces NICA – a novel toolbox for near-infrared spectroscopy calculations and analyses based on MATLAB. With NICA it is possible to process and visualize fNIRS data, including different signal processing methods for physiological artifact correction. The artifact correction methods used in this toolbox are common average reference (CAR), independent component analysis (ICA), and transfer function (TF) models. A practical example provides results from a study, where NICA was used for analyzing the measurement data, in order to demonstrate the signal processing steps and the physiological artifact correction. The toolbox was developed for fNIRS data recorded with the NIRScout 1624 measurement device and the corresponding recording software NIRStar.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Beware (Surprisingly Common) Left-Right Flips in Your MRI Data: An Efficient and Robust Method to Check MRI Dataset Consistency Using AFNI</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.00018</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Knowing the difference between left and right is generally assumed throughout the brain MRI research community. However, we note widespread occurrences of left-right orientation errors in MRI open database repositories where volumes have contained systematic left-right flips between subject EPIs and anatomicals, due to having incorrect or missing file header information. Here we present a simple method in AFNI for determining the consistency of left and right within a pair of acquired volumes for a particular subject; the presence of EPI-anatomical inconsistency, for example, is a sign that dataset header information likely requires correction. The method contains both a quantitative evaluation as well as a visualizable verification. We test the functionality using publicly available datasets. Left-right flipping is not immediately obvious in most cases, so we also present visualization methods for looking at this problem (and other potential problems), using examples from both FMRI and DTI datasets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Primary Categorizing and Masking Cerebral Small Vessel Disease Based on “Deep Learning System”</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.00017</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;To supply the attending doctor’s diagnosis of the persisting of cerebral small vessel disease and speed up their work effectively, we developed a “deep learning system (DLS)” for cerebral small vessel disease predication. The reliability and the disease area segmentation accuracy, of the proposed DLS, was also investigated.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A deep learning model based on the convolutional neural network was designed and trained on 1,010 DWI b1000 images from 1010 patients diagnosed with segmentation of subcortical infarction, 359 T2&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; images from 359 patients diagnosed with segmentation of cerebral microbleed, as well as 824 T1-weighted and T2-FLAIR images from 824 patients diagnosed with segmentation of lacune and WMH. Dicw accuracy, recall, and f1-score were calculated to evaluate the proposed deep learning model. Finally, we also compared the DLS prediction capability with that of 6 doctors with 3 to 18 years’ clinical experience (8 ± 6 years).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The results support that an appropriately trained DLS can achieve a high-level dice accuracy, 0.598 in the training section over all these four classifications on 30 patients (0.576 for young neuroradiologists), validation accuracy is 0.496 in lacune, 0.666 in WMH, 0.728 in subcortical infarction, and 0.503 in cerebral microbleeds. It is comparable to attending doctor with a few years of experience, regardless of whether the emphasis is placed on the segmentation or detection of lesions with less time-spending compared with manual analysis, about 4.4 s/case, which is dramatically less than doctors about 634 s/case.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The results of our comparison lend support to the case that an appropriately trained DLS can be trusted to the same extent as one would trust an attending doctor with a few years of experience, regardless of whether the emphasis is placed on the segmentation or detection of lesions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Tilting Together: An Information-Theoretic Characterization of Behavioral Roles in Rhythmic Dyadic Interaction</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00185</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Every joint collaborative physical activity performed by a group of people, e.g., carrying a table, typically leads to the emergence of spatiotemporal coordination of individual motor behavior. Such interpersonal coordination can arise solely based on the observation of the partners' and/or the object's movements, without the presence of verbal communication. In this paper, we investigate how the social coupling between two individuals in a collaborative task translates into measured objective and subjective performance indicators recorded in two different studies. We analyse the trends in the dyadic interrelationship based on the information-theoretic measure of transfer entropy and identify emerging leader-follower roles. In our experimental paradigm, the actions of the pair of subjects are continuously and seamlessly fused, resulting in a joint control of an object simulated on a tablet computer. Subjects need to synchronize their movements with a 90° phase difference in order to keep the object (a ball) rotating precisely on a predefined circular or elliptic trajectory on a tablet device. Results demonstrate how the identification of causal dependencies in this social interaction task could reveal specific trends in human behavior and provide insights into the emergence of social sensorimotor contingencies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Cortical Auditory Event-Related Potentials and Categorical Perception of Voice Onset Time in Children With an Auditory Neuropathy Spectrum Disorder</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00184</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: This study evaluated cortical encoding of voice onset time (VOT) in quiet and noise, and their potential associations with the behavioral categorical perception of VOT in children with auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design: Subjects were 11 children with ANSD ranging in age between 6.4 and 16.2 years. The stimulus was an /aba/-/apa/ vowel-consonant-vowel continuum comprising eight tokens with VOTs ranging from 0 ms (voiced endpoint) to 88 ms (voiceless endpoint). For speech in noise, speech tokens were mixed with the speech-shaped noise from the Hearing In Noise Test at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of +5 dB. Speech-evoked auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) and behavioral categorization perception of VOT were measured in quiet in all subjects, and at an SNR of +5 dB in seven subjects. The stimuli were presented at 35 dB SL (re: pure tone average) or 115 dB SPL if this limit was less than 35 dB SL. In addition to the onset response, the auditory change complex (ACC) elicited by VOT was recorded in eight subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Speech evoked ERPs recorded in all subjects consisted of a vertex positive peak (i.e., P1), followed by a trough occurring approximately 100 ms later (i.e., N2). For results measured in quiet, there was no significant difference in categorical boundaries estimated using ERP measures and behavioral procedures. Categorical boundaries estimated in quiet using both ERP and behavioral measures closely correlated with the most-recently measured Phonetically Balanced Kindergarten (PBK) scores. Adding a competing background noise did not affect categorical boundaries estimated using either behavioral or ERP procedures in three subjects. For the other four subjects, categorical boundaries estimated in noise using behavioral measures were prolonged. However, adding background noise only increased categorical boundaries measured using ERPs in three out of these four subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: VCV continuum can be used to evaluate behavioral identification and the neural encoding of VOT in children with ANSD. In quiet, categorical boundaries of VOT estimated using behavioral measures and ERP recordings are closely associated with speech recognition performance in children with ANSD. Underlying mechanisms for excessive speech perception deficits in noise may vary for individual patients with ANSD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Immersive 3D Virtual Reality Cancellation Task for Visual Neglect Assessment: A Pilot Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00180</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Unilateral spatial neglectis an attention disorder frequently occurring after a right-hemispheric stroke. Neglect results in a reduction in qualityof life and performance in activities of daily living. With current technical improvements in virtual reality (VR) technology, trainingwith stereoscopic head-mounted displays (HMD) has become a promising new approach for the assessment and the rehabilitation of neglect. The focus of this pilot study was to develop and evaluate a simple visual search task in VR for HMD. The VR system was tested regarding feasibility, acceptance, and potential adverse effects in healthy controls and right-hemispheric stroke patients with and without neglect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: The VR system consisted of two main components, a head-mounted display to present the virtual environment, and a hand-held controller for the interaction with the latter. The task followed the rationale of diagnostic paper-pencil cancellation tasks; i.e., the participants were asked to search targets among distractors. However, instead of a two-dimensional setup, the targets and distractors were arranged in three dimensions, in a sphere around the subject inside its field of view. Usability and acceptance of the task, as well as the performance in the latter, were tested in 15 right-hemispheric subacute stroke patients (10 of whom with and five of whom without unilateral spatial neglect; mean age: 67.1 ± 10.5 years) and 35 age-matched healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: System usability and acceptance were rated as high both in stroke patients and healthy controls, close to the maximum score of the questionnaire scale. No relevant adverse effects occurred. There was a high correlation (r = 0.854, p = 0.002) between the Center of Cancellation [an objective neglect measure) calculated from a paper-pencil cancellation task (Sensitive Neglect Test (SNT)] and the newly developed VR cancellation task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Overall, the developed visual search task in the tested VR system is feasible, well-accepted, enjoyable, and does not evoke any significant negative effects, both for healthy controls and for stroke patients. Findings for task performance show that the ability of the VR cancellation to detect neglect in stroke patients is similar to paper-pencil cancellation tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Non-invasive Brain Stimulation in Alzheimer's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment—A State-of-the-Art Review on Methodological Characteristics and Stimulation Parameters</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00179</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have been proposed as a new therapeutic way to enhance the cognition of patients with dementia. However, serious methodological limitations appear to affect the estimates of their efficacy. We reviewed the stimulation parameters and methods of studies that used TMS or tDCS to alleviate the cognitive symptoms of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Moreover, we evaluated the risk of bias in these studies. Our aim was to highlight the current vulnerabilities of the field and to formulate recommendations on how to manage these issues when designing studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Electronic databases and citation searching were used to identify studies administering TMS or tDCS on patients with AD or MCI to enhance cognitive function. Data were extracted by one review author into summary tables with the supervision of the authors. The risk of bias analysis of randomized-controlled trials was conducted by two independent assessors with version 2 of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Overall, 36 trials were identified of which 23 randomized-controlled trials underwent a risk of bias assessment. More than 75% of randomized-controlled trials involved some levels of bias in at least one domain. Stimulation parameters were highly variable with some ranges of effectiveness emerging. Studies with low risk of bias indicated TMS to be potentially effective for patients with AD or MCI while questioned the efficacy of tDCS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The presence and extent of methodical issues affecting TMS and tDCS research involving patients with AD and MCI were examined for the first time. The risk of bias frequently affected the domains of the randomization process and selection of the reported data while missing outcome was rare. Unclear reporting was present involving randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding. Methodological awareness can potentially reduce the high variability of the estimates regarding the effectiveness of TMS and tDCS. Studies with low risk of bias delineate a range within TMS parameters seem to be effective but question the efficacy of tDCS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: A Mechanical Stimulation Glove to Induce Hebbian Plasticity at the Fingertip</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00177</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Repetitive sensory stimulation of the fingertip induces Hebbian plasticity in the sensorimotor cortex that benefits the tactile and motor behavior of the hand in healthy younger adults, older adults, and patients. To use this method outside the laboratory, robust and portable stimulation systems are needed that allow prolonged stimulation phases over several hours without compromising on signal intensity or personal mobility. Here, we introduce two stimulation gloves that apply finger- and frequency-specific mechanical stimulation to individual fingertips over prolonged periods. The stimulators are built into commercially available cotton gloves and apply stimulation either via loudspeaker membranes or via linear resonant actuators (LRAs). We tested the efficiency of both gloves to induce Hebbian plasticity in younger adults by using two established measures of tactile performance, the grating orientation task (GOT), and the two-point discrimination task (2PDT). Both tests were performed before and after 3 h of sensory finger stimulation using one of either glove system. As a control condition, a non-stimulated finger was tested in both tasks before and after stimulation. The results show no significant effect of sensory stimulation on GOT thresholds, but a significant decrease in the 2PDT thresholds after compared to before the training at the stimulated finger only. The loudspeaker membrane improved performance in the 2PDT in 10/16 participants, whereas the LRA improved performance in the 2PDT in 13/16 participants. Stimulation gloves with built-in modules may be used in future larger-scale cohort studies on sensorimotor plasticity, rehabilitation, and learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Brain Metabolism During A Lower Extremity Voluntary Movement Task in Children With Spastic Cerebral Palsy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00159</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Reduced selective voluntary motor control (SVMC) is a primary impairment due to corticospinal tract (CST) injury in spastic cerebral palsy (CP). There are few studies of brain metabolism in CP and none have examined brain metabolism during a motor task. Nine children with bilateral spastic CP [Age: 6-11 years, Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) Levels II–V] completed this study. SVMC was evaluated using Selective Control Assessment of the Lower Extremity (SCALE) ranging from 0 (absent) to 10 (normal). Brain metabolism was measured using positron emission tomography (PET) scanning in association with a selective ankle motor task. Whole brain activation maps as well as ROI averaged metabolic activity were correlated with SCALE scores. The contralateral sensorimotor and superior parietal cortex were positively correlated with SCALE scores (p &amp;lt; 0.0005). In contrast, a negative correlation of metabolic activity with SCALE was found in the cerebellum (p &amp;lt; 0.0005). Subsequent ROI analysis showed that both ipsilateral and contralateral cerebellar metabolism correlated with SCALE but the relationship for the ipsilateral cerebellum was stronger (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.80, p &amp;lt; 0.001 vs. R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.46, p = 0.045). Decreased cortical and increased cerebellar activation in children with less SVMC may be related to task difficulty, activation of new motor learning paradigms in the cerebellum and potential engagement of alternative motor systems when CSTs are focally damaged. These results support SCALE as a clinical correlate of neurological impairment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Ultradian Secretion of Growth Hormone in Mice: Linking Physiology With Changes in Synapse Parameters Using Super-Resolution Microscopy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00021</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuroendocrine circuits are orchestrated by the pituitary gland in response to hypothalamic hormone-releasing and inhibiting factors to generate an ultradian and/or circadian rhythm of hormone secretion. However, mechanisms that govern this rhythmicity are not fully understood. It has been shown that synaptic transmission in the rodent hypothalamus undergoes cyclical changes in parallel with rhythmic hormone secretion and a growing body of evidence suggests that rapid rewiring of hypothalamic neurons may be the source of these changes. For decades, structural synaptic studies have been utilizing electron microscopy, which provides the resolution suitable for visualizing synapses. However, the small field of view, limited specificity and manual analysis susceptible to bias fuel the search for a more quantitative approach. Here, we apply the fluorescence super-resolution microscopy approach direct Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (dSTORM) to quantify and structurally characterize excitatory and inhibitory synapses that contact growth hormone-releasing-hormone (GHRH) neurons during peak and trough values of growth hormone (GH) concentration in mice. This approach relies on a three-color immunofluorescence staining of GHRH and pre- and post-synaptic markers, and a quantitative analysis with a Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm. With this method we confirm our previous findings, using electron microscopy, of increased excitatory synaptic input to GHRH neurons during peak levels of GH. Additionally, we find a shift in synapse numbers during low GH levels, where more inhibitory synaptic inputs are detected. Lastly, we utilize dSTORM to study novel aspects of synaptic structure. We show that more excitatory (but not inhibitory) pre-synaptic clusters associate with excitatory post-synaptic clusters during peaks of GH secretion and that the numbers of post-synaptic clusters increase during high hormone levels. The results presented here provide an opportunity to highlight dSTORM as a valuable quantitative approach to study synaptic structure in the neuroendocrine circuit. Importantly, our analysis of GH circuitry sheds light on the potential mechanism that drives ultradian changes in synaptic transmission and possibly aids in GH pulse generation in mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background and objectives: Lower vitamin status has been linked to cognitive deficits, pending mechanistic elucidation. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], folate and cobalamin were explored against brain volumes and white matter integrity (WMI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Three prospective waves from Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity Across the Life Span (HANDLS) study were used [Baltimore, City, MD, 2004–2015, N = 183–240 urban adults (Age&lt;sub&gt;v1&lt;/sub&gt;: 30–64 years)]. Serum vitamin 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], folate and cobalamin concentrations were measured at visits 1 (v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;: 2004–2009) and 2 (v&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: 2009–2013), while structural and diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI/dMRI) outcomes were measured at v&lt;sub&gt;scan&lt;/sub&gt;: 2011–2015. Top 10 ranked adjusted associations were corrected for multiple testing using familywise Bonferroni (FWER &amp;lt;0.05) and false discovery rates (FDR, q-value &amp;lt; 0.10).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We found statistically significant (FWER &amp;lt; 0.05; β±SE) direct associations of 25(OH)D(v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) with WM volumes [overall: +910 ± 336/males: +2,054 ± 599], occipital WM; [overall: +140 ± 40, males: +261 ± 67 and Age&lt;sub&gt;v1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; 50 years: +205 ± 54]; parietal WM; [overall: +251 ± 77, males: +486 ± 129 and Age&lt;sub&gt;v1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; 50 years: +393 ± 108] and left occipital pole volume [overall: +15.70 ± 3.83 and above poverty: 19.0 ± 4.3], findings replicated for 25(OH)D (v&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) annualized exposure, which was also linked with greater WMI (fractional anisotropy, FA) in the anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC); FWER &amp;lt; 0.05 [Overall: +0.0020 ± 0.0004; Whites: +0.0024 ± 0.0004] and in the cingulum (hippocampus) [Overall: +0.0016 ± 0.0004]. Only trends were detected for cobalamin exposures (q &amp;lt; 0.10), while serum folate (v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) was associated with lower mean diffusivity (MD) in ALIC, reflecting greater WMI, overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Among urban adults, serum 25(OH)D status and increase were consistently linked to larger occipital and parietal WM volumes and greater region-specific WMI. Pending longitudinal replication of our findings, randomized controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation should be conducted against brain marker outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Hypotensive Role of Acupuncture in Hypertension: Clinical Study and Mechanistic Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00138</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As a component of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), acupuncture has the potential to lower blood pressure (BP) in patients with hypertension. Emerging evidence indicates that the acupuncture-induced inhibition of high BP occurs through the activation of the pathway in the afferent, central, and efferent pathways. An increasing number of studies have demonstrated that acupuncture not only activates distinct brain regions under conditions of hypertension caused by an imbalance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems but also modulates neurotransmitters in related brain regions to alleviate the autonomic response. The activity of these pathways can be assessed by injecting agonists or inhibitors or by performing neurotomy. This review focuses on the clinical and mechanistic studies of acupuncture in modulating BP, which might provide a neurobiological foundation for the effects of acupuncture. Although many mechanisms underlying the effects of acupuncture on cardiovascular function have been identified, further investigation is warranted.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Human Body as a Super Network: Digital Methods to Analyze the Propagation of Aging</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00136</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Biological aging is a complex process involving multiple biological processes. These can be understood theoretically though considering them as individual networks—e.g., epigenetic networks, cell-cell networks (such as astroglial networks), and population genetics. Mathematical modeling allows the combination of such networks so that they may be studied in unison, to better understand how the so-called “seven pillars of aging” combine and to generate hypothesis for treating aging as a condition at relatively early biological ages. In this review, we consider how recent progression in mathematical modeling can be utilized to investigate aging, particularly in, but not exclusive to, the context of degenerative neuronal disease. We also consider how the latest techniques for generating biomarker models for disease prediction, such as longitudinal analysis and parenclitic analysis can be applied to as both biomarker platforms for aging, as well as to better understand the inescapable condition. This review is written by a highly diverse and multi-disciplinary team of scientists from across the globe and calls for greater collaboration between diverse fields of research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Conditioning Electrical Stimulation Accelerates Regeneration in Nerve Transfers</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25796?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to the upper limb, lower limb distal nerve transfer (DNT) outcomes are poor, likely due to the longer length of regeneration required. DNT surgery to treat foot drop entails rerouting a tibial nerve branch to the denervated common fibular nerve stump to reinnervate the tibialis anterior muscle to ankle dorsiflexion. Conditioning electrical stimulation (CES) prior to a nerve repair surgery accelerates nerve regeneration and promotes sensorimotor recovery. We hypothesize that CES prior to DNT will promote nerve regeneration to restore ankle dorsiflexion.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One week following common fibular nerve crush, CES was delivered to the tibial nerve in half the animals and at two weeks, all animals received a DNT. To investigate the effects of CES on nerve regeneration, a series of kinetic, kinematic, skilled locomotion, electrophysiologic, and immunohistochemical outcomes were assessed. The effects of CES on the nerve were investigated.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CES treated animals had significantly accelerated nerve regeneration (p&amp;lt;0.001) and they had accelerated walking speed with improved skilled locomotion. The injured limb had greater vertical peak forces, with improved duty factor, near‐complete recovery of braking, propulsive forces and dorsiflexion (p&amp;lt;0.01). Reinnervation of the tibialis anterior muscle was confirmed with nerve conduction studies and immunohistochemical analysis of the neuromuscular junction. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that CES does not induce Wallerian degeneration nor does it cause macrophage infiltration of the distal tibial nerve.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tibial nerve CES prior to DNT significantly improved functional recovery of the common fibular nerve and its muscle targets without inducing injury to the donor nerve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phosphatidylinositol‐4,5‐bisphosphate (PI‐4,5‐P2) is critical for synaptic vesicle docking and fusion and is generated by either the type 1 phosphatidylinositol‐4‐phosphate 5‐kinases (PI4P5Ks) or the type 2 phosphatidylinositol‐5‐phosphate 4‐kinases (PI5P4Ks). In this study, we describe the neuro‐anatomical localization of PI5P4Kα and PI5P4Kβ in the normal brain.  PI5P4Kβ is expressed in both oligodendrocytes and some neurons, while PI5P4Kα is expressed solely in neurons. By electron microscopy, both kinases are located in a peri‐synaptic distribution in axon terminals and dendritic spines, suggesting a role in neuro‐transmission, possibly through synaptic vesicle docking, recycling, and/or fusion.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phosphatidylinositol‐4,5‐bisphosphate (PI‐4,5‐P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is critical for synaptic vesicle docking and fusion and generation of the second messengers, diacylglycerol and inositol‐1,4,5‐trisphosphate. PI‐4,5‐P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be generated by two families of kinases: type 1 phosphatidylinositol‐4‐phosphate 5‐kinases, encoded by PIP5K1A, PIP5K1B and PIP5K1C, and type 2 phosphatidylinositol‐5‐phosphate 4‐kinases, encoded by PIP4K2A, PIP4K2B, and PIP4K2C. While the roles of the type 1 enzymes in brain function have been extensively studied, the roles of the type 2 enzymes are poorly understood. Using selective antibodies validated by genetic deletion of pip4k2a or pip4k2b in mouse brain, we characterized the location of the enzymes, PI5P4Kα and PI5P4Kß, encoded by these genes. In mice, we demonstrate that PI5P4Kα is expressed in adulthood, whereas PI5P4Kß is expressed early in development. PI5P4Kα localizes to white matter tracts, especially the corpus callosum, and at a low level in neurons, while PI5P4Kß is expressed in neuronal populations, especially hippocampus and cortex. Dual labeling studies demonstrate that PI5P4Kα co‐localizes with the oligodendrocyte marker, Olig2, whereas PI5P4Kß co‐localizes with the neuronal marker, NeuN. Ultrastructural analysis demonstrates that both kinases are contained in axon terminals and dendritic spines adjacent to the synaptic membrane, which support a potential role in synaptic transmission. Immunoperoxidase analysis of macaque and human brain tissue demonstrate a conserved pattern for PI5P4Kα and PI5P4Kß. These results highlight the diverse cell‐autonomous expression of PI5P4Kα and PI5P4Kß and support further exploration into their role in synaptic function in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combination of ischemia and β‐amyloid (Aβ) toxicity has been shown to simultaneously increase neuro‐inflammation, endogenous Aβ deposition, and neurodegeneration. However, studies on the evolution of infarct and panorama of cellular degeneration as a synergistic or overlapping mechanism between ischemia and Aβ toxicity are lacking. Here, we compared fluorojade B (FJB) and hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;amp;E) stains primarily to examine the chronology of infarct, and the viability and morphological changes in neuroglia and neurons located in different brain regions on d1, d7 and d28 post Aβ toxicity and endothelin‐1 induced ischemia (ET1) in rats. We demonstrated a regional difference in cellular degeneration between cortex, corpus callosum, striatum, globus pallidus and thalamus after cerebral injury. Glial cells in the cortex and corpus callosum underwent delayed FJB staining from d7 to d28, but neurons in cortex disappeared within the first week of cerebral injury. Striatal lesion core and globus pallidus of Aβ+ET1 rats showed extensive degeneration of neuronal cells compared to ET1 rats alone starting from d1. Differential and exacerbated expressions of cyclooxygenase‐2 might be the cause of excessive neuronal demise in the striatum of Aβ+ET1 rats. Such an investigation may improve our understanding to identify and manipulate a critical therapeutic window post comorbid injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Gut microbiome signatures of risk and prodromal markers of Parkinson's disease</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25788?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alterations of the gut microbiome in Parkinson's disease (PD) have been repeatedly demonstrated. However, little is known about whether such alterations precede disease onset and how they relate to risk and prodromal markers of PD. We investigated associations of these features with gut microbiome composition.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Established risk and prodromal markers of PD as well as factors related to diet/lifestyle, bowel function and medication were studied in relation to bacterial α−/β‐diversity, enterotypes, and differential abundance in stool samples of 666 elderly TREND study participants.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among risk and prodromal markers, physical activity, occupational solvent exposure, and constipation showed associations with α‐diversity. Physical activity, sex, constipation, possible REM‐sleep behavior disorder (RBD), and smoking were associated with β‐diversity. Subthreshold parkinsonism and physical activity showed an interaction effect. Amongst other factors, age and urate‐lowering medication were associated with α‐ and β‐diversity. Physical inactivity and constipation were highest in individuals with the &lt;i&gt;Firmicutes &lt;/i&gt;‐enriched enterotype. Constipation was lowest and subthreshold parkinsonism least frequent in individuals with the &lt;i&gt;Prevotella &lt;/i&gt;‐enriched enterotype. Differentially abundant taxa were linked to constipation, physical activity, possible RBD, smoking, and subthreshold parkinsonism. Substantia nigra hyperechogenicity, olfactory loss, depression, orthostatic hypotension, urinary/erectile dysfunction, PD family history and the prodromal PD probability showed no significant microbiome associations.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several risk and prodromal markers of PD are associated with gut microbiome composition. However, the impact of the gut microbiome on PD risk and potential microbiome‐dependent subtypes in the prodrome of PD need further investigation based on prospective clinical and (multi)omics data in incident PD cases.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>eNeuro: Voltage Imaging of Cortical Oscillations in Layer 1 with Two-Photon Microscopy</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/3/ENEURO.0274-19.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Membrane voltage oscillations in layer 1 (L1) of primary sensory cortices might be important indicators of cortical gain control, attentional focusing, and signal integration. However, electric field recordings are hampered by the low seal resistance of electrodes close to the brain surface. To study L1 membrane voltage oscillations, we synthesized a new voltage-sensitive dye, di1-ANNINE (anellated hemicyanine)-6plus, that can diffuse into tissue. We applied it with a new surgery, leaving the dura intact but allowing injection of large quantities of staining solution, and imaged cortical membrane potential oscillations with two-photon microscopy depth-resolved (25–100 μm below dura) in anesthetized and awake mice. We found delta (0.5–4 Hz), theta (4–10 Hz), low beta (10–20 Hz), and low gamma (30–40 Hz) oscillations. All oscillations were stronger in awake animals. While the power of delta, theta, and low beta oscillations increased with depth, the power of low gamma was more constant throughout L1. These findings identify L1 as an important coordination hub for the dynamic binding process of neurons mediated by oscillations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro: Vitamin D Supplementation Rescues Aberrant NF-{kappa}B Pathway Activation and Partially Ameliorates Rett Syndrome Phenotypes in Mecp2 Mutant Mice</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/3/ENEURO.0167-20.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe, progressive X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the transcriptional regulator &lt;i&gt;MECP2&lt;/i&gt;. We previously identified aberrant NF-B pathway upregulation in brains of &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt;-null mice and demonstrated that genetically attenuating NF-B rescues some characteristic neuronal RTT phenotypes. These results raised the intriguing question of whether NF-B pathway inhibitors might provide a therapeutic avenue in RTT. Here, we investigate whether the known NF-B pathway inhibitor vitamin D ameliorates neuronal phenotypes in &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt;-mutant mice. Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent among RTT patients, and we find that &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt;-null mice similarly have significantly reduced 25(OH)D serum levels compared with wild-type littermates. We identify that vitamin D rescues aberrant NF-B pathway activation and reduced neurite outgrowth of &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; knock-down cortical neurons &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Further, dietary supplementation with vitamin D in early symptomatic male &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; hemizygous null and female &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous mice ameliorates reduced neocortical dendritic morphology and soma size phenotypes and modestly improves reduced lifespan of &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt;-nulls. These results elucidate fundamental neurobiology of RTT and provide foundation that NF-B pathway inhibition might be a therapeutic target for RTT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: The history of long‐term potentiation as a memory mechanism: Controversies, confirmation, and some lessons to remember</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23213?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery of long‐term potentiation (LTP) provided the first, direct evidence for long‐lasting synaptic plasticity in the living brain. Consequently, LTP was proposed to serve as a mechanism for information storage among neurons, thus providing the basis for the behavioral and psychological phenomena of learning and long‐term memory formation. However, for several decades, the LTP‐memory hypothesis remained highly controversial, with inconsistent and contradictory evidence providing a barrier to its general acceptance. This review summarizes the history of these early debates, challenges, and experimental strategies (successful and unsuccessful) to establish a link between LTP and memory. Together, the empirical evidence, gathered over a period of about four decades, strongly suggests that LTP serves as one of the mechanisms affording learning and memory storage in neuronal circuits. Notably, this body of work also offers some important lessons that apply to the broader fields of behavioral and cognitive neuroscience. As such, the history of LTP as a learning mechanism provides valuable insights to neuroscientists exploring the relations between brain and psychological states.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Natural Reading in Parkinson’s Disease With and Without Mild Cognitive Impairment</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00120</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) show eye movement abnormalities and frequently complain about difficulties in reading. So far, it is unclear whether basal ganglia dysfunction or cognitive impairment has a greater impact on eye movements during reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: To analyze eye movement behavior during a natural reading task with respect to cognitive state and dopaminergic therapy in PD and healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Eye movements of 59 PD patients and 29 age- and education-matched healthy controls were recorded during mute, self-paced reading of a text. 25 cognitively normal PD patients performed the task additionally in off medication state. Clinical assessment included a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery and the motor section of MDS—Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: PD-mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was diagnosed in 21 patients. Reading speed was significantly reduced in PD-MCI compared to healthy controls and PD patients without MCI due to higher numbers of progressive saccades. Cognitively intact PD patients showed no significant alterations of reading speed or eye movement pattern during reading. The fixation duration tended to be prolonged in PD compared to healthy controls and decreased significantly after levodopa intake. Scores for executive functions, attention, and language correlated with reading speed in the PD group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The present study is the first to reveal (1) reduced reading speed with altered reading pattern in PD with MCI and (2) a relevant impact of levodopa on fixation duration during reading in PD. Further research is needed to determine whether therapeutic interventions, e.g., levodopa or neuropsychological training, improve the subjective reading experience for patients with PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Author summary: Everything we do today is becoming more and more reliant on the use of computers. The field of biology is no exception; but most biologists receive little or no formal preparation for the increasingly computational aspects of their discipline. In consequence, informal training courses are often needed to plug the gaps; and the demand for such training is growing worldwide. To meet this demand, some training programs are being expanded, and new ones are being developed. Key to both scenarios is the creation of new course materials. Rather than starting from scratch, however, it’s sometimes possible to repurpose materials that already exist. Yet finding suitable materials online can be difficult: They’re often widely scattered across the internet or hidden in their home institutions, with no systematic way to find them. This is a common problem for all digital objects. The scientific community has attempted to address this issue by developing a set of rules (which have been called the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable [FAIR] principles) to make such objects more findable and reusable. Here, we show how to apply these rules to help make training materials easier to find, (re)use, and adapt, for the benefit of all.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XKbc_sdLRPQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro: Neural Differentiation is Moderated by Age in Scene-Selective, But Not Face-Selective, Cortical Regions</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/3/ENEURO.0142-20.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The aging brain is characterized by neural dedifferentiation, an apparent decrease in the functional selectivity of category-selective cortical regions. Age-related reductions in neural differentiation have been proposed to play a causal role in cognitive aging. Recent findings suggest, however, that age-related dedifferentiation is not equally evident for all stimulus categories and, additionally, that the relationship between neural differentiation and cognitive performance is not moderated by age. In light of these findings, in the present experiment, younger and older human adults (males and females) underwent fMRI as they studied words paired with images of scenes or faces before a subsequent memory task. Neural selectivity was measured in two scene-selective (parahippocampal place area (PPA) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC)] and two face-selective [fusiform face area (FFA) and occipital face area (OFA)] regions using both a univariate differentiation index and multivoxel pattern similarity analysis. Both methods provided highly convergent results, which revealed evidence of age-related reductions in neural dedifferentiation in scene-selective but not face-selective cortical regions. Additionally, neural differentiation in the PPA demonstrated a positive, age-invariant relationship with subsequent source memory performance (recall of the image category paired with each recognized test word). These findings extend prior findings suggesting that age-related neural dedifferentiation is not a ubiquitous phenomenon, and that the specificity of neural responses to scenes is predictive of subsequent memory performance independently of age.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro: RPE Cells Engulf Microvesicles Secreted by Degenerating Rod Photoreceptors</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/3/ENEURO.0507-19.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Rhodopsin is mislocalized to the inner segment plasma membrane (IS PM) in various blinding disorders including autosomal-dominant retinitis pigmentosa caused by class I rhodopsin mutations. In these disorders, rhodopsin-laden microvesicles are secreted into the extracellular milieu by afflicted photoreceptor cells. Using a &lt;i&gt;Xenopus laevis&lt;/i&gt; model expressing class I mutant rhodopsin or Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase (NKA) fused to Dendra2, we fluorescently labeled the microvesicles and found retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are capable of engulfing microvesicles containing rhodopsin. A unique sorting mechanism allows class I mutant rhodopsin, but not NKA, to be packaged into the microvesicles. Under normal physiological conditions, NKA is not shed as microvesicles to the extracellular space, but is degraded intracellularly. Those studies provide novel insights into protein homeostasis in the photoreceptor IS PM.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro: Hippocampal Synaptic Dysfunction in a Mouse Model of Huntington Disease Is Not Alleviated by Ceftriaxone Treatment</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/3/ENEURO.0440-19.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Glutamate transporters, particularly glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1), help to prevent the adverse effects associated with glutamate toxicity by rapidly clearing glutamate from the extracellular space. Since GLT-1 expression and/or function are reduced in many neurodegenerative diseases, upregulation of GLT-1 is a favorable approach to treat the symptoms of these diseases. Ceftriaxone, a β-lactam antibiotic reported to increase GLT-1 expression, can exert neuroprotective effects in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases; however, many of these diseases do not exhibit uniform brain pathology. In contrast, as a drug that readily crosses the blood–brain barrier, ceftriaxone administration is likely to increase GLT-1 levels globally throughout the neuroaxis. In Huntington disease (HD), low GLT-1 expression is observed in the striatum in postmortem tissue and animal models. While ceftriaxone was reported to increase striatal GLT-1 and ameliorate the motor symptoms in a mouse model of HD, the extrastriatal effects of ceftriaxone in HD are unknown. Using electrophysiology and high-speed imaging of the glutamate biosensor iGluSnFR, we quantified real-time glutamate dynamics and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus of the Q175FDN mouse model of HD, following intraperitoneal injections of either saline or ceftriaxone. We observed an activity-dependent increase in extracellular glutamate accumulation within the HD hippocampus, which was not the result of reduced GLT-1 expression. Surprisingly, ceftriaxone had little effect on glutamate clearance rates and negatively impacted synaptic plasticity. These data provide evidence for glutamate dysregulation in the HD hippocampus but also caution the use of ceftriaxone as a treatment for HD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro: ErbB4 Null Mice Display Altered Mesocorticolimbic and Nigrostriatal Dopamine Levels as well as Deficits in Cognitive and Motivational Behaviors</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/3/ENEURO.0395-19.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Natural genetic variants of Neuregulin1 (NRG1) and its cognate receptor ErbB4 are associated with a risk for schizophrenia. Whereas most studies on NRG1-ErbB4 signaling have focused on GABAergic interneurons, ErbB4 is also expressed by midbrain dopaminergic neurons where it modulates extracellular dopamine (DA) levels. Here, we report that extracellular steady-state levels of DA are reduced in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC; –65%), hippocampus (–53%) and nucleus accumbens (NAc; –35%), but are elevated in the dorsal striatum (+25%) of ErbB4 knock-out mice (ErbB4 KOs) relative to wild-type controls. This pattern of DA imbalance recapitulates the reported prefrontal cortical reduction and striatal increase of DA levels in schizophrenia patients. Next, we report on a battery of behavioral tasks used to evaluate locomotor, cognitive and motivational behaviors in ErbB4 KOs relative to controls. We found that ErbB4 KOs are hyperactive in a novel open field but not in their familiar home cage, are more sensitive to amphetamine, perform poorly in the T-maze and novel object recognition (NOR) tasks, exhibit reduced spatial learning and memory on the Barnes maze, and perform markedly worse in conditioned place preference (CPP) tasks when associating cued-reward palatable food with location. However, we found that the poor performance of ErbB4 KOs in CPP are likely due to deficits in spatial memory, instead of reward seeking, as ErbB4 KOs are more motivated to work for palatable food rewards. Our findings indicate that ErbB4 signaling affects tonic DA levels and modulates a wide array of behavioral deficits relevant to psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro: Depletion of the Microbiome Alters the Recruitment of Neuronal Ensembles of Oxycodone Intoxication and Withdrawal</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/3/ENEURO.0312-19.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Substance use disorders have a complex etiology. Genetics, the environment, and behavior all play a role in the initiation, escalation, and relapse of drug use. Recently, opioid use disorder has become a national health crisis. One aspect of opioid addiction that has yet to be fully examined is the effects of alterations of the microbiome and gut-brain axis signaling on central nervous system activity during opioid intoxication and withdrawal. The effect of microbiome depletion on the activation of neuronal ensembles was measured by detecting Fos-positive (Fos+) neuron activation during intoxication and withdrawal using a rat model of oxycodone dependence. Daily oxycodone administration (2 mg/kg) increased pain thresholds and increased Fos+ neurons in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) during intoxication, with a decrease in pain thresholds and increase in Fos+ neurons in the periaqueductal gray (PAG), central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), locus coeruleus (LC), paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT), agranular insular cortex (AI), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), and lateral habenula medial parvocellular region during withdrawal. Microbiome depletion produced widespread but region- and state-specific changes in neuronal ensemble activation. Oxycodone intoxication and withdrawal also increased functional connectivity among brain regions. Microbiome depletion resulted in a decorrelation of this functional network. These data indicate that microbiome depletion by antibiotics produces widespread changes in the recruitment of neuronal ensembles that are activated by oxycodone intoxication and withdrawal, suggesting that the gut microbiome may play a role in opioid use and dependence. Future studies are needed to better understand the molecular, neurobiological, and behavioral effects of microbiome depletion on addiction-like behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro: Rapid Adaptation to Changing Mechanical Load by Ordered Recruitment of Identified Motor Neurons</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/3/ENEURO.0016-20.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;As they interact with their environment and encounter challenges, animals adjust their behavior on a moment-to-moment basis to maintain task fitness. This dynamic process of adaptive motor control occurs in the nervous system, but an understanding of the biomechanics of the body is essential to properly interpret the behavioral outcomes. To study how animals respond to changing task conditions, we used a model system in which the functional roles of identified neurons and the relevant biomechanics are well understood and can be studied in intact behaving animals: feeding in the marine mollusc &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt;. We monitored the motor neuronal output of the feeding circuitry as intact animals fed on uniform food stimuli under unloaded and loaded conditions, and we measured the force of retraction during loaded swallows. We observed a previously undescribed pattern of force generation, which can be explained within the appropriate biomechanical context by the activity of just a few key, identified motor neurons. We show that, when encountering load, animals recruit identified retractor muscle motor neurons for longer and at higher frequency to increase retraction force duration. Our results identify a mode by which animals robustly adjust behavior to their environment, which is experimentally tractable to further mechanistic investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro: Action Video Gaming Does Not Influence Short-Term Ocular Dominance Plasticity in Visually Normal Adults</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/3/ENEURO.0006-20.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Action video gaming can promote neural plasticity. Short-term monocular patching drives neural plasticity in the visual system of human adults. For instance, short-term monocular patching of 0.5–5 h briefly enhances the patched eye’s contribution in binocular vision (i.e., short-term ocular dominance plasticity). In this study, we investigate whether action video gaming can influence this plasticity in adults with normal vision. We measured participants’ eye dominance using a binocular phase combination task before and after 2.5 h of monocular patching. Participants were asked to play action video games, watch action video game movies, or play non-action video games during the period of monocular patching. We found that participants’ change of ocular dominance after monocular patching was not significantly different either for playing action video games versus watching action video game movies (Comparison 1) or for playing action video games versus playing non-action video games (Comparison 2). These results suggest that action video gaming does not either boost or eliminate short-term ocular dominance plasticity, and that the neural site for this type of plasticity might be in the early visual pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Selective Expression of Nicotinic Receptor Sub-unit mRNA in Early Human Fetal Forebrain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00072</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Increasing evidence from animal and human studies indicate that exposure to nicotine during development, separated from the effects of smoking tobacco, can contribute to dysregulation of brain development including behavioral deficits. An RNAseq study of human fetal cerebral cortex demonstrated that 9 out of 16 genes for human nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor subunits are selectively expressed between 7.5 and 12 post-conceptional weeks (PCW). The most highly expressed subunit genes were CHNRA4 and CHNRB2, whose protein products combine to form the most ubiquitous functional receptor isoform expressed in the adult brain. They exhibited correlated expression in both RNAseq samples, and in tissue sections by in situ hybridization. Co-localization studies with other cortical markers suggest they are pre-dominantly expressed by post-mitotic glutamatergic neuron pre-cursors in both cortical plate and pre-subplate, rather than cortical progenitor cells or GABAergic interneuron pre-cursors. However, GABAergic interneuron progenitor cells in the ganglionic eminences do express these sub-units. CHNRA5 also showed moderate levels of expression and again favored post-mitotic neurons. Other subunits, e.g., CHRNA7, exhibited low but detectable levels of expression. CHRN genes found not to be expressed included genes for subunits usually considered muscle specific, e.g., CHNRA1, although some muscle specific gene expression was detected, for instance CHNRB1. Although there is little or no synthesis of acetylcholine by intrinsic cortical neurons, cholinergic fibers from basal forebrain innervate the cerebral cortex from 12 PCW at the latest. Acetylcholine may have a paracrine effect on radially migrating cortical neurons and GABAergic interneuron progenitors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Functional Neuroanatomy of the Human Accommodation Response to an “E” Target Varying from -3 to -6 Diopters</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00029</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: We aimed to identify the functional brain networks involved in the regulation of visual accommodation by contrasting the cortical functional areas evoked by foveal fixation to an “E” target, which were subservient to the accommodation responses to a -3/-6 diopter stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Neural activity was assessed in healthy volunteers by changes in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Twenty-five right-handed subjects viewed the “E” target presented in a hierarchical block design. They participated in two monocular tasks: (i) sustained foveal fixation upon an “E” target on a white background at 33 cm (-3.03D accommodative demand); and (ii) sustained fixation through an attached -3D concave lens (-6D accommodative demand) in front of the fixated eye; each condition cycled through a standard alternating 30-s eye open/30-s eye closed design to provide the BOLD contrast. The total sustained period was 480 s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The contrast between the -3D and the rest condition revealed activation in the occipital lobe (Lingual gyrus, Cuneus, Calcarine_L, and Calcarine_R); cerebellum (Cerebellum_Crus1_L and Cerebellum_6_L); precentral lobe (Precentral_R); frontal lobe (Frontal_Inf_Oper_R and Frontal_Mid_R); and cingulate cortex (Cingulum_Ant_L). With the -3D concave lenses (-6D accommodative demand) in front of the fixated eye, the voxel size and peak intensity of activation in the occipital lobe and cerebellum were greater than with the -3D accommodative demand; emergent activated brain areas included the parietal lobe (bilateral precuneus gyrus and right supramarginal gyrus); the precentral lobe and cingulate cortex failed to reach the threshold in the -6D vs. rest contrast. In the -3D and -6D contrast comparison, the frontal lobe (Frontal_Sup_Medial_L) and parietal lobe (Precuneus_L and Precuneus_R) passed the significance threshold of cluster-level family-wise error (FWE) correction. The mean activation in the -3D and -6D contrast revealed an incremental summation of the activations than that found in the previous -3D vs. rest and -6D vs. rest comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Neural circuits were selectively activated during the -3D/-6D accommodative response to blur cues. Cognitive-perceptual processing is involved in signal regulation of ocular accommodative functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurogenesis: Chronic Bumetanide Infusion Alters Young Neuron Morphology in the Dentate Gyrus Without Affecting Contextual Fear Memory</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00514</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Young neurons in the adult brain are key to some types of learning and memory. They integrate in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus contributing to such cognitive processes following timely developmental events. While experimentally impairing GABAergic transmission through the blockade or elimination of the ionic cotransporter NKCC1 leads to alterations in the proper maturation of young neurons, it is still unknown if the in vivo administration of common use diuretic drugs that block the cotransporter, alters the development of young hippocampal neurons and affects DG-related functions. In this study, we delivered chronically and intracerebroventricularly the NKCC1 blocker bumetanide to young-adult rats. We analyzed doublecortin density and development parameters (apical dendrite length and angle and dendritic arbor length) in doublecortin positive neurons from different subregions in the DG and evaluated the performance of animals in contextual fear learning and memory. Our results show that in bumetanide-treated subjects, doublecortin density is diminished in the infra and suprapyramidal blades of the DG; the length of primary dendrites is shortened in the infrapyramidal blade and; the growth angle of primary dendrites in the infrapyramidal blade is different from control animals. Behaviorally, treated animals showed the typical learning curve in a contextual fear task, and freezing-time displayed during contextual fear memory was not different from controls. Thus, in vivo icv delivery of bumetanide negatively alters DCX density associated to young neurons and its proper development but not to the extent of affecting a DG dependent task as aversive context learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00507</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a rare acquired autoimmune neuromuscular disease. Autoantibodies, cellular immunity, complement, and cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of MG. It is characterized by the dysfunction of neuromuscular junction transmission and skeletal muscle weakness. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding small molecule ribonucleic acids that regulate various biological processes (e.g., development, differentiation, and immunity) at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels of gene expression. miRNAs play an important regulatory role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, including MG. In recent studies, the functional mechanisms underlying the role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of MG have received increasing attention. miRNAs are highly stable and have high specificity in peripheral body fluids. Therefore, the miRNAs in body fluids may represent promising biomarkers for determining the prognosis of MG and the efficacy of treatment. This article reviews the role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of MG, highlights the potential of miRNAs as new biomarkers for the diagnosis of MG, and deepens our understanding of disease processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: LRRK2 at the Interface Between Peripheral and Central Immune Function in Parkinson’s</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00443</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It is becoming increasingly accepted that there is an interplay between the peripheral immune response and neuroinflammation in the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Mutations in the leucine-rich-repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are associated with familial and sporadic cases of PD but are also found in immune-related disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and leprosy. Furthermore, LRRK2 has been associated with bacterial infections such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Salmonella typhimurium. Recent evidence suggests a role of LRRK2 in the regulation of the immune system and modulation of inflammatory responses, at a systemic level, with LRRK2 functionally implicated in both the immune system of the central nervous system (CNS) and the periphery. It has therefore been suggested that peripheral immune signaling may play an important role in the regulation of neurodegeneration in LRRK2 as well as non-LRRK2-associated PD. This review will discuss the current evidence for this hypothesis and will provide compelling rationale for placing LRRK2 at the interface between peripheral immune responses and neuroinflammation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: A 3D Fully Convolutional Neural Network With Top-Down Attention-Guided Refinement for Accurate and Robust Automatic Segmentation of Amygdala and Its Subnuclei</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00260</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent advances in deep learning have improved the segmentation accuracy of subcortical brain structures, which would be useful in neuroimaging studies of many neurological disorders. However, most existing deep learning based approaches in neuroimaging do not investigate the specific difficulties that exist in segmenting extremely small but important brain regions such as the subnuclei of the amygdala. To tackle this challenging task, we developed a dual-branch dilated residual 3D fully convolutional network with parallel convolutions to extract more global context and alleviate the class imbalance issue by maintaining a small receptive field that is just the size of the regions of interest (ROIs). We also conduct multi-scale feature fusion in both parallel and series to compensate the potential information loss during convolutions, which has been shown to be important for small objects. The serial feature fusion enabled by residual connections is further enhanced by a proposed top-down attention-guided refinement unit, where the high-resolution low-level spatial details are selectively integrated to complement the high-level but coarse semantic information, enriching the final feature representations. As a result, the segmentations resulting from our method are more accurate both volumetrically and morphologically, compared with other deep learning based approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first deep learning-based approach that targets the subregions of the amygdala. We also demonstrated the feasibility of using a cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) to harmonize multi-site MRI data, and show that our method generalizes well to challenging traumatic brain injury (TBI) datasets collected from multiple centers. This appears to be a promising strategy for image segmentation for multiple site studies and increased morphological variability from significant brain pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Corticomotor Excitability Changes Associated With Freezing of Gait in People With Parkinson Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00190</link>
	<content:encoded>Background and Purpose&lt;p&gt;Freezing of gait (FOG) is a debilitating gait disorder in people with Parkinson’s disease (PD). While various neuroimaging techniques have been used to investigate the pathophysiology of FOG, changes in corticomotor excitability associated with FOG have yet to be determined. Research to date has not concluded if changes in corticomotor excitability are associated with gait disturbances in this patient population. This study aimed to use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to investigate corticomotor excitability changes associated with FOG. Furthermore, the relationship between corticomotor excitability and gait performances would be determined.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Eighteen participants with PD and FOG (PD + FOG), 15 without FOG (PD − FOG), and 15 non-disabled adults (Control) were recruited for this study. Single and paired-pulse TMS paradigms were used to assess corticospinal and intracortical excitability, respectively. Gait performance was measured by the 10-Meter-Walk test. Correlation analysis was performed to evaluate relationships between TMS outcomes and gait parameters.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Compared with the Control group, the PD + FOG group showed a significantly lower resting motor threshold and reduced short intracortical inhibition (SICI). Correlation analysis revealed a relationship between resting motor evoked potential and step length, and between SICI and walking velocity in the Control group. While the silent period correlated with step length in the PD − FOG group, no significant relationship was observed in the PD + FOG group.&lt;/p&gt;Discussion and Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Compared to the Control group, the PD + FOG group exhibited reduced corticomotor inhibition. Distinct correlations observed among the three groups suggest that the function of the corticomotor system plays an important role in mediating walking ability in non-disabled adults and people with PD − FOG, while people with PD + FOG may rely on neural networks other than the corticomotor system to control gait.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Empathy-Related Brain Activity in Somatosensory Cortex Protects From Tactile Priming Effects: A Pilot Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00142</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Empathy influences how we perceive, understand, and interact with our social environment. Previous studies suggested a network of different brain regions as a neural substrate for empathy, including, in particular, insula and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). In addition, a contribution of the somatosensory cortices for this empathy related network has been suggested. This is remarkable, given that other recent studies have revealed a role for the somatosensory cortex in various social tasks. For example, in experiments using tactile priming, incidental haptic sensations are found to influence judgment recommendations. Here, we aimed to test if this engagement of the somatosensory cortices during tactile priming can be predicted by the participant’s empathy personality traits. We assessed participant’s empathy and personality traits by means of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) and NEO-FFI and tested whether trait empathy is associated with the tactile priming effect in social judgments. Results revealed that empathy predicted the tactile priming effect negatively. This was accompanied by a reduced engagement of the somatosensory cortex, which has been shown to be associated with the priming effect. We conclude that empathy seems to protect people from tactile priming effects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor Acts on Distinctive Hypothalamic Arcuate Neurons and Promotes Leptin Entry Into and Action on the Mouse Hypothalamus</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00140</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In humans and experimental animals, the administration of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) reduces food intake and body weight. To gain further insights into the mechanism(s) underlying its satiety effect, we: (i) evaluated the CNTF-dependent activation of the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway in mouse models where neuropeptide Y (NPY) and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons can be identified by green fluorescent protein (GFP); and (ii) assessed whether CNTF promotes leptin signaling in hypothalamic feeding centers. Immunohistochemical experiments enabled us to establish that intraperitoneal injection of mouse recombinant CNTF activated the JAK2-STAT3 pathway in a substantial proportion of arcuate nucleus (ARC) NPY neurons (18.68% ± 0.60 in 24-h fasted mice and 25.50% ± 1.17 in fed mice) but exerted a limited effect on POMC neurons (4.15% ± 0.33 in 24-h fasted mice and 2.84% ± 0.45 in fed mice). CNTF-responsive NPY neurons resided in the ventromedial ARC, facing the median eminence (ME), and were surrounded by albumin immunoreactivity, suggesting that they are located outside the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In both normally fed and high-fat diet (HFD) obese animals, CNTF activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling in ME β1- and β2-tanycytes, an effect that has been linked to the promotion of leptin entry into the brain. Accordingly, compared to the animals treated with leptin, mice treated with leptin/CNTF showed: (i) a significantly greater leptin content in hypothalamic protein extracts; (ii) a significant increase in phospho-STAT3 (P-STAT3)-positive neurons in the ARC and the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus of normally fed mice; and (iii) a significantly increased number of P-STAT3-positive neurons in the ARC and dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus of HFD obese mice. Collectively, these data suggest that exogenously administered CNTF reduces food intake by exerting a leptin-like action on distinctive NPY ARC neurons and by promoting leptin signaling in hypothalamic feeding centers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: miR-142-3p Regulates BDNF Expression in Activated Rodent Microglia Through Its Target CAMK2A</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00132</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microglia, the innate immune effector cells of the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), are involved in the development, homeostasis, and pathology of CNS. Microglia become activated in response to various insults and injuries and protect the CNS by phagocytosing the invading pathogens, dead neurons, and other cellular debris. Recent studies have demonstrated that the epigenetic mechanisms ensure the coordinated regulation of genes involved in microglial activation. In this study, we performed a microRNA (miRNA) microarray in activated primary microglia derived from rat pup’s brain and identified differentially expressed miRNAs targeting key genes involved in cell survival, apoptosis, and inflammatory responses. Interestingly, miR-142-3p, one of the highly up-regulated miRNAs in microglia upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated activation, compared to untreated primary microglia cells was predicted to target Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin dependent kinase 2a (CAMK2A). Further, luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-142-3p targets the 3′UTR of Camk2a. CAMK2A has been implicated in regulating the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and long-term potentiation (LTP), a cellular mechanism underlying memory and learning. Given this, this study further focused on understanding the miR-142-3p mediated regulation of the CAMK2A-BDNF pathway via Cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) in activated microglia. The results revealed that CAMK2A was downregulated in activated microglia, suggesting an inverse relationship between miR-142-3p and Camk2a in activated microglia. Overexpression of miR-142-3p in microglia was found to decrease the expression of CAMK2A and subsequently BDNF through regulation of CREB phosphorylation. Functional analysis through shRNA-mediated stable knockdown of CAMK2A in microglia confirmed that the regulation of BDNF by miR-142-3p is via CAMK2A. Overall, this study provides a database of differentially expressed miRNAs in activated primary microglia and reveals that microglial miR-142-3p regulates the CAMK2A-CREB-BDNF pathway which is involved in synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Laser Lesion in the Mouse Visual Cortex Induces a Stem Cell Niche-Like Extracellular Matrix, Produced by Immature Astrocytes</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00102</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The mammalian central nervous system (CNS) is characterized by a severely limited regeneration capacity. Comparison with lower species like amphibians, which are able to restore even complex tissues after damage, indicates the presence of an inhibitory environment that restricts the cellular response in mammals. In this context, signals provided by the extracellular matrix (ECM) are important regulators of events like cell survival, proliferation, migration, differentiation or neurite outgrowth. Therefore, knowledge of the post-lesional ECM and of cells that produce these factors might support development of new treatment strategies for patients suffering from traumatic brain injury and other types of CNS damage. In the present study, we analyzed the surround of focal infrared laser lesions of the adult mouse visual cortex. This lesion paradigm avoids direct contact with the brain, as the laser beam passes the intact bone. Cell type-specific markers revealed a distinct spatial distribution of different astroglial subtypes in the penumbra after injury. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) as marker for reactive astrocytes was found broadly up-regulated, whereas the more immature markers vimentin and nestin were only expressed by a subset of cells. Dividing astrocytes could be identified via the proliferation marker Ki-67. Different ECM molecules, among others the neural stem cell-associated glycoprotein tenascin-C and the DSD-1 chondroitin sulfate epitope, were found on astrocytes in the penumbra. Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) and aggrecan as markers for perineuronal nets, a specialized ECM limiting synaptic plasticity, appeared normal in the vicinity of the necrotic lesion core. In sum, expression of progenitor markers by astrocyte subpopulations and the identification of proliferating astrocytes in combination with an ECM that contains components typically associated with neural stem/progenitor cells suggest that an immature cell fate is facilitated as response to the injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Safety and Efficacy of 630-nm Red Light on Cognitive Function in Older Adults With Mild to Moderate Alzheimer’s Disease: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00143</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Studies have shown that excess formaldehyde accumulation in the brain accelerates cognitive decline in people with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Recently, reports from our research team revealed that red light treatment (RLT) improved memory in AD mice by activating formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FDH) and thus reducing formaldehyde levels. Here, we developed a medical RLT device to investigate the safety and efficacy of this device in older adults with mild to moderate AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: This will be a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that will include 60 participants who will be recruited and randomly divided into an RLT group and a control group. The RLT group will receive RLT intervention 5 days a week for 30 min each time for 24 weeks while the control group will continue their routine treatments without RLT. All participants will undergo neuropsychological and functional assessments including the Mini-Mental State Examination, the AD assessment scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog), the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and the Barthel Index at baseline, 12 weeks and 24 weeks. All participants will undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning and blood/urine biomarkers tests at baseline and 24 weeks. The primary outcome will be the ADAS-cog score while the secondary outcomes will be the GDS and NPI scores. Adverse events will be recorded and treated when necessary. Both an intention-to-treat analysis and a per-protocol analysis will be performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of RLT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: This protocol outlines the objectives of the study and explained the RLT device developed by the research team. The study is designed as an RCT to evaluate the safety and effects of the RLT device on older adults with mild to moderate AD. This study will provide evidence for the clinical use of RLT on treatment for AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration:www.ClinicalTrials.gov, ChiCTR1800020163; Pre-results.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment Using Convolutional Neural Network: Temporal-Feature Maps of Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00141</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the clinical precursor of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is considered the most common neurodegenerative disease in the elderly. Some MCI patients tend to remain stable over time and do not evolve to AD. It is essential to diagnose MCI in its early stages and provide timely treatment to the patient. In this study, we propose a neuroimaging approach to identify MCI using a deep learning method and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). For this purpose, fifteen MCI subjects and nine healthy controls (HCs) were asked to perform three mental tasks: N-back, Stroop, and verbal fluency (VF) tasks. Besides examining the oxygenated hemoglobin changes (ΔHbO) in the region of interest, ΔHbO maps at 13 specific time points (i.e., 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, and 65 s) during the tasks and seven temporal feature maps (i.e., two types of mean, three types of slope, kurtosis, and skewness) in the prefrontal cortex were investigated. A four-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) was applied to identify the subjects into either MCI or HC, individually, after training the CNN model with ΔHbO maps and temporal feature maps above. Finally, we used the 5-fold cross-validation approach to evaluate the performance of the CNN. The results of temporal feature maps exhibited high classification accuracies: The average accuracies for the N-back task, Stroop task, and VFT, respectively, were 89.46, 87.80, and 90.37%. Notably, the highest accuracy of 98.61% was achieved from the ΔHbO slope map during 20–60 s interval of N-back tasks. Our results indicate that the fNIRS imaging approach based on temporal feature maps is a promising diagnostic method for early detection of MCI and can be used as a tool for clinical doctors to identify MCI from their patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Modelling the dynamics of tuberculosis lesions in a virtual lung: Role of the bronchial tree in endogenous reinfection</title>

Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease that still causes more than 1.5 million deaths annually. The World Health Organization estimates that around 30% of the world’s population is latently infected. However, the mechanisms responsible for 10% of this reserve (i.e., of the latently infected population) developing an active disease are not fully understood, yet. The dynamic hypothesis suggests that endogenous reinfection has an important role in maintaining latent infection. In order to examine this hypothesis for falsifiability, an agent-based model of growth, merging, and proliferation of TB lesions was implemented in a computational bronchial tree, built with an iterative algorithm for the generation of bronchial bifurcations and tubes applied inside a virtual 3D pulmonary surface. The computational model was fed and parameterized with computed tomography (CT) experimental data from 5 latently infected minipigs. First, we used CT images to reconstruct the virtual pulmonary surfaces where bronchial trees are built. Then, CT data about TB lesion’ size and location to each minipig were used in the parameterization process. The model’s outcome provides spatial and size distributions of TB lesions that successfully reproduced experimental data, thus reinforcing the role of the bronchial tree as the spatial structure triggering endogenous reinfection. A sensitivity analysis of the model shows that the final number of lesions is strongly related with the endogenous reinfection frequency and maximum growth rate of the lesions, while their mean diameter mainly depends on the spatial spreading of new lesions and the maximum radius. Finally, the model was used as an &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; experimental platform to explore the transition from latent infection to active disease, identifying two main triggering factors: a high inflammatory response and the combination of a moderate inflammatory response with a small breathing amplitude.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/48zZq2xcYt8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: GCNCDA: A new method for predicting circRNA-disease associations based on Graph Convolutional Network Algorithm</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/sxyqcAr41hA/article</link>

Numerous evidences indicate that Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are widely involved in the occurrence and development of diseases. Identifying the association between circRNAs and diseases plays a crucial role in exploring the pathogenesis of complex diseases and improving the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. However, due to the complex mechanisms between circRNAs and diseases, it is expensive and time-consuming to discover the new circRNA-disease associations by biological experiment. Therefore, there is increasingly urgent need for utilizing the computational methods to predict novel circRNA-disease associations. In this study, we propose a computational method called GCNCDA based on the deep learning Fast learning with Graph Convolutional Networks (FastGCN) algorithm to predict the potential disease-associated circRNAs. Specifically, the method first forms the unified descriptor by fusing disease semantic similarity information, disease and circRNA Gaussian Interaction Profile (GIP) kernel similarity information based on known circRNA-disease associations. The FastGCN algorithm is then used to objectively extract the high-level features contained in the fusion descriptor. Finally, the new circRNA-disease associations are accurately predicted by the Forest by Penalizing Attributes (Forest PA) classifier. The 5-fold cross-validation experiment of GCNCDA achieved 91.2% accuracy with 92.78% sensitivity at the AUC of 90.90% on circR2Disease benchmark dataset. In comparison with different classifier models, feature extraction models and other state-of-the-art methods, GCNCDA shows strong competitiveness. Furthermore, we conducted case study experiments on diseases including breast cancer, glioma and colorectal cancer. The results showed that 16, 15 and 17 of the top 20 candidate circRNAs with the highest prediction scores were respectively confirmed by relevant literature and databases. These results suggest that GCNCDA can effectively predict potential circRNA-disease associations and provide highly credible candidates for biological experiments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sxyqcAr41hA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: A computational model tracks whole-lung &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; infection and predicts factors that inhibit dissemination</title>

&lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; (Mtb), the causative infectious agent of tuberculosis (TB), kills more individuals per year than any other infectious agent. Granulomas, the hallmark of Mtb infection, are complex structures that form in lungs, composed of immune cells surrounding bacteria, infected cells, and a caseous necrotic core. While granulomas serve to physically contain and immunologically restrain bacteria growth, some granulomas are unable to control Mtb growth, leading to bacteria and infected cells leaving the granuloma and disseminating, either resulting in additional granuloma formation (local or non-local) or spread to airways or lymph nodes. Dissemination is associated with development of active TB. It is challenging to experimentally address specific mechanisms driving dissemination from TB lung granulomas. Herein, we develop a novel hybrid multi-scale computational model, &lt;i&gt;MultiGran&lt;/i&gt;, that tracks Mtb infection within multiple granulomas in an entire lung. &lt;i&gt;MultiGran&lt;/i&gt; follows cells, cytokines, and bacterial populations within each lung granuloma throughout the course of infection and is calibrated to multiple non-human primate (NHP) cellular, granuloma, and whole-lung datasets. We show that &lt;i&gt;MultiGran&lt;/i&gt; can recapitulate patterns of &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; local and non-local dissemination, predict likelihood of dissemination, and predict a crucial role for multifunctional CD8+ T cells and macrophage dynamics for preventing dissemination.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/s01vVoOJjxc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Developing methods for anticipating the emergence or reemergence of infectious diseases is both important and timely; however, traditional model-based approaches are stymied by uncertainty surrounding the underlying drivers. Here, we demonstrate an operational, mechanism-agnostic detection algorithm for disease (re-)emergence based on early warning signals (EWSs) derived from the theory of critical slowing down. Specifically, we used computer simulations to train a supervised learning algorithm to detect the dynamical footprints of (re-)emergence present in epidemiological data. Our algorithm was then challenged to forecast the slowly manifesting, spatially replicated reemergence of mumps in England in the mid-2000s and pertussis post-1980 in the United States. Our method successfully anticipated mumps reemergence 4 years in advance, during which time mitigation efforts could have been implemented. From 1980 onwards, our model identified resurgent states with increasing accuracy, leading to reliable classification starting in 1992. Additionally, we successfully applied the detection algorithm to 2 vector-transmitted case studies, namely, outbreaks of dengue serotypes in Puerto Rico and a rapidly unfolding outbreak of plague in 2017 in Madagascar. Taken together, these findings illustrate the power of theoretically informed machine learning techniques to develop early warning systems for the (re-)emergence of infectious diseases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/MMgEqDRtzdE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro: GAD2 Expression Defines a Class of Excitatory Lateral Habenula Neurons in Mice that Project to the Raphe and Pontine Tegmentum</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/3/ENEURO.0527-19.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The lateral habenula (LHb) sends complex projections to several areas of the mesopontine tegmentum, the raphe, and the hypothalamus. However, few markers have been available to distinguish subsets of LHb neurons that may serve these pathways. In order to address this complexity, we examined the mouse and rat LHb for neurons that express the GABA biosynthesis enzymes glutamate decarboxylase 1 (GAD1) and GAD2, and the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT). The mouse LHb contains a population of neurons that express GAD2, while the rat LHb contains discrete populations of neurons that express GAD1 and VGAT. However, we could not detect single neurons in either species that co-express a GABA synthetic enzyme and VGAT, suggesting that these LHb neurons do not use GABA for conventional synaptic transmission. Instead, all of the neuronal types expressing a GABAergic marker in both species showed co-expression of the glutamate transporter VGluT2. Anterograde tract-tracing of the projections of GAD2-expressing LHb neurons in &lt;i&gt;Gad2&lt;sup&gt;Cre&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice, combined with retrograde tracing from selected downstream nuclei, show that LHb-GAD2 neurons project selectively to the midline structures in the mesopontine tegmentum, including the median raphe (MnR) and nucleus incertus (NI), and only sparsely innervate the hypothalamus, rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg), and ventral tegmental area (VTA). Postsynaptic recording of LHb-GAD2 neuronal input to tegmental neurons confirms that glutamate, not GABA, is the fast neurotransmitter in this circuit. Thus, GAD2 expression can serve as a marker for functional studies of excitatory neurons serving specific LHb output pathways in mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro: Response-Related Signals Increase Confidence But Not Metacognitive Performance</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/3/ENEURO.0326-19.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Confidence judgments are a central tool in metacognition research. In a typical task, participants first perform perceptual (first-order) decisions and then rate their confidence in these decisions. The relationship between confidence and first-order accuracy is taken as a measure of metacognitive performance. Confidence is often assumed to stem from decision-monitoring processes alone, but processes that co-occur with the first-order decision may also play a role in confidence formation. In fact, some recent studies have revealed that directly manipulating motor regions in the brain, or the time of first-order decisions relative to second-order decisions, affects confidence judgments. This finding suggests that confidence could be informed by a readout of reaction times in addition to decision-monitoring processes. To test this possibility, we assessed the contribution of response-related signals to confidence and, in particular, to metacognitive performance (i.e., a measure of the adequacy of these confidence judgments). In human volunteers, we measured the effect of making an overt (vs covert) decision, as well as the effect of pairing an action to the stimulus about which the first-order decision is made. Against our expectations, we found no differences in overall confidence or metacognitive performance when first-order responses were covert as opposed to overt. Further, actions paired to visual stimuli presented led to higher confidence ratings, but did not affect metacognitive performance. These results suggest that confidence ratings do not always incorporate motor information.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
