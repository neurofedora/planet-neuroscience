	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: ClC-2-like Chloride Current Alterations in a Cell Model of Spinal and Bulbar Muscular Atrophy, a Polyglutamine Disease</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-020-01687-5</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a neuromuscular disease caused by expansions of a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the androgen receptor (AR) gene. SBMA is associated with the progressive loss of lower motor neurons, together with muscle weakness and atrophy. PolyQ-AR is converted to a toxic species upon binding to its natural ligands, testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Our previous patch-clamp studies on a motor neuron-derived cell model of SBMA showed alterations in voltage-gated ion currents. Here, we identified and characterized chloride currents most likely belonging to the chloride channel-2 (ClC-2) subfamily, which showed significantly increased amplitudes in the SBMA cells. The treatment with the pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), a neuropeptide with a proven protective effect in a mouse model of SBMA, recovered chloride channel current alterations in SBMA cells. These observations suggest that the CIC-2 currents are affected in SBMA, an alteration that may contribute and potentially determine the pathophysiology of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Identification of Key Genes and Pathways in Mouse Spinal Cord Involved in ddC-Induced Neuropathic Pain by Transcriptome Sequencing</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-020-01686-6</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) works effectively in inhibiting HIV replication in patients. However, the use of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) often causes side effects of neuropathic pain, and its mechanism remains to be elucidated. Therefore, we aim to explore the mechanism of NRTIs-induced neuropathic pain at the transcriptome level. C57BL/6 J mice were given intraperitoneal injection of zalcitabine (ddC) or saline (control) for 2 weeks, during which the mechanical pain threshold of the mice was detected by von Frey test. Then the L3~L5 spinal segments of the mice were isolated and subsequently used for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on the last day of treatment. The mechanical pain threshold of mice given ddC decreased significantly. Compared with the control group, ddC caused significant changes in the expression of 135 genes, of which 66 upregulated and 69 downregulated. Enrichment analysis showed that the functions of these genes are mainly enriched in regulation of transcription, multicellular organism development, and cell differentiation, and the pathway is mainly enriched in the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway and AMPK signaling pathway. Furthermore, key genes such as Gabrd, Kcnd3, Npcd, Insr, Lypd6, Scd2, and Mef2d were also identified. These may serve as drug targets for the prevention or treatment of NRTI-induced neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: The Effect of Optogenetic Inhibition of the Anterior Cingulate Cortex in Neuropathic Pain Following Sciatic Nerve Injury</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-020-01685-7</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cortical disinhibition is the underlying pathological alteration contributing to neuropathic pain associated with peripheral nerve injury. Nerve injury resulting in disinhibition of the anterior cingulate cortex has been reported. However, the effect of optogenetic inhibition of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) on the sensory component of nerve injury–induced neuropathic pain has not been well studied. To investigate the feasibility of optogenetic ACC modulation, we injected an optogenetic virus or a null virus into the ACC of a nerve injury–induced neuropathic pain model. The unilateral ACC was modulated, and the optogenetic effect was measured by mechanical and thermal sensitivity tests. The assessment was performed in “pre—light off,” “stimulation—yellow light on,” and “post—light off” states. Optogenetic inhibition of the ACC in injury models revealed improved mechanical and thermal latencies with profound pain-relieving effects against nerve injury–induced neuropathic pain. The sensory thalamic discharge in electrophysiological in vivo recordings was also altered during laser stimulation. This finding indicates that hyperactivity of the ACC in nerve injury increases output to the spinothalamic tract through direct or indirect pathways. The direct photoinhibition of ACC neurons could play a vital role in restoring equilibrium and provide novel insight into techniques that can assuage peripheral nerve injury–induced neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The choroid plexus (CP) constitutes a barrier between the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which regulates the exchange of substances between these two fluids through mechanisms that are not completely understood. Polyamines as spermine, spermidine and putrescine are produced by all cells and are present in the CSF. Interestingly, their levels are altered in some neuronal disorders as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, thus increasing the interest in their signalling in the central nervous system (CNS). Cadaverine, on the other hand, is synthetized by the intestinal microbiome, suggesting that the presence of this bacterial metabolite in the CSF requires that it is up taken to the CNS across brain barriers. We knew that polyamines are detected by the olfactory signalling cascade operating at the CP, but the receptor involved had not been identified. The zebrafish TAAR13c was the only receptor known to bind a polyamine-cadaverine. Thus, we searched for a human receptor with homology to TAAR13c and found that some human TAARs including TAAR1 showed great homology. Then, we confirmed the expression of TAAR1 mRNA and protein in a human cell line of the CP, and in human CP samples. Calcium imaging assays after TAAR1 knockdown in these cells with a specific siRNA against TAAR1 showed a consistent reduction in the responses of these cells to cadaverine and spermidine, but not to spermine, suggesting that TAAR1 is activated by cadaverine and spermidine, but not spermine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Different Activation of IL-10 in the Hippocampus and Prefrontal Cortex During Neurodegeneration Caused by Trimethyltin Chloride</title>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) plays a crucial role in controlling the resolution of inflammation. In this study, we aimed to assess gene expression and the level of IL-10 in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of rats, after a single injection of neurotoxicant trimethyltin chloride (TMT). It was shown that 4 weeks after the treatment with TMT, the level of IL-10 in the prefrontal cortex, but not in the hippocampus of TMT-treated rats, was increased. However, expression level of IL-10 mRNA was upregulated both in the hippocampus and in the prefrontal cortex 3 weeks after the injection. Concomitantly, within the same post-treatment period, the expression level of the cyclooxygenase-2 was upregulated in both brain structures, indicating the induction of neuroinflammation. Considering that TMT leads to the death of neurons mainly in the hippocampus, we assume that in contrast to the prefrontal cortex, the level of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in the hippocampus is not sufficiently increased to prevent the damaging effect of the neurotoxicant. Therefore, an exogenous increase in the level of IL-10 may be useful for the survival of neurons in conditions of neurotoxic damage to the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The previously reported cluster of variants in the last part of exon 30 and the beginning of exon 31 of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CREBBP&lt;/em&gt;, overlapping with the ZNF2 (zinc finger, ZZ-type; residues 1701 to 1744) and ZNF3 (zinc finger, TAZ-type; residues 1764 to 1853) domains, is associated with atypical RSTS. The main features include developmental delay, short stature, microcephaly, distinctive facial features, autistic behavior, feeding difficulties, recurrent upper airway infections, and hearing impairment. Here, we report a 2-year-7-month-old Chinese girl presenting mild cognitive impairments, developmental delay, short stature, recurrent upper airway infections, and facial dysmorphism that resembled the phenotypes of previously reported atypical RSTS patients. The characteristic facial and limb dysmorphism for RSTS was absent in our patient. In addition, our patient exhibited novel phenotypes including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), sleep problem, and abnormal walking posture. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) identified a novel de novo in-frame deletion variant in the beginning of exon 30 of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CREBBP&lt;/em&gt; (NM_004380:c.4897_4899delTTC, p.Phe1633del) in the HAT domain where no pathogenic variants have been previously reported to be responsible for atypical RSTS. Our case allows us to more accurately define the borders of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CREBBP&lt;/em&gt; coding sequence resulting in atypical RSTS, which are extended to the beginning of exon 30 (residue 1633) at the 5′ end of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CREBBP&lt;/em&gt; in the HAT domain, and reveals novel phenotypes observed in our atypical Chinese RSTS patient.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;KLF4 is a zinc-finger transcription factor that plays an essential role in many biological processes, including neuroinflammation, neuron regeneration, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Through effects on these processes, KLF4 has likely roles in Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and traumatic brain injury. However, little is known about the role of KLF4 in more immediate behavioral processes that similarly depend upon broad changes in brain excitability, such as the sleep process. Here, behavioral approaches, western blot, and immunohistochemical experiments were used to explore the role of KLF4 on sedation and the potential mechanisms of those effects. The results showed that overexpression of KLF4 prolonged loss of righting reflex (LORR) duration in pentobarbital-treated mice and increased c-Fos expression in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO), while it decreased c-Fos expression in the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN). Moreover, overexpression of KLF4 reduced the expression of p53 in the hypothalamus and increased the expression of STAT3 in the hypothalamus. Therefore, these results suggest that KLF4 exerts sedative effects through the regulation of p53 and STAT3 expression, and it indicates a role of KLF4 ligands in the treatment of sleep disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Microtubule Stabilization Promotes Microcirculation Reconstruction After Spinal Cord Injury</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Spinal cord microcirculation plays an important role in maintaining the function of spinal cord neurons and other cells. Previous studies have largely focused on the ability of microtubule stabilization to inhibit the fibroblast migration and promote axon regeneration after spinal cord injury (SCI). However, the effect of microtubule stabilization treatment on microcirculation reconstruction after SCI remains unclear. By using immunofluorescence, we found that microtubule stabilization treatment improved microcirculation reconstruction via increasing the number of microvessels, pericytes, and the perfused microvessels after SCI. To clarify the underlying mechanisms, rat brain microvascular endothelial cells and pericytes were subjected to glucose oxygen deprivation. By using flow cytometry and western blotting, we found that microtubule stabilization treatment inhibited apoptosis and migration of endothelial cells and pericytes but promoted proliferation and survival of endothelial cells and pericytes through upregulated expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), VEGF receptor 2, platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGFB), PDGF receptor β, and angiopoietin-1 after SCI. Taken together, this study provides evidence for the mechanisms underlying the promotion of microcirculation reconstruction after SCI by microtubule stabilization treatment. Importantly, this study suggests the potential of microtubule stabilization as a therapeutic target to reduce microcirculation dysfunction after SCI in the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative condition characterized by motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, resting tremor, and rigidity. PD diagnosis is based on medical history, review of signs, symptoms, neurological and physical examinations. Unfortunately, by the time the disease is diagnosed, dopamine (DA) neuronal loss is often extended, thereby resulting in ineffective therapies. Recent evidence suggests that neuroinflammation may be pivotal during PD onset and progression. However, suitable cellular models and biomarkers to detect early signs of neuroinflammation are still missing. In this study, we developed a well-differentiated DAergic neuronal cell line where we triggered a neuroinflammatory response to assess the temporal expression of the tissue- and urokinase plasminogen activators (tPA and uPA) and their endogenous inhibitor (PAI-1) along with that of pro-inflammatory mediators and the neuronal marker nNOS. Human neuroblastoma cells SH-SY5Y were differentiated into DAergic neuronal-like cells using a combination of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and serum depletion. Terminally-differentiated neurons were then exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for short (up to 24 h) or long term (up to 10 days) to mimic acute or chronic inflammation. Results demonstrated that uPA protein expression was stably upregulated during chronic inflammation, whereas the expression of nNOS protein better reflected the cellular response to acute inflammation. Additional studies revealed that the temporal induction of uPA was associated with increased AKT phosphorylation, but did not seem to involve cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) activation, nor the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. In conclusion, our in vitro data suggests that nNOS and uPA may serve as viable candidate biomarkers of acute and chronic neuroinflammation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: The Role of EZH2 Inhibitor, GSK-126, in Seizure Susceptibility</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;GSK-126 is recognized as an inhibitor of enhancer of zeste homolog-2 (EZH2) activity. Because of its inhibition of EZH2 activation, GSK-126 is considered a potential anti-tumor drug. EZH2 is a histone methyltransferase that catalyzes histone 3 tri-methylation at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), resulting in gene silencing. A previous report showed that decreased H3K27me3 levels in the hippocampus may promote seizure susceptibility, possibly restricting the clinical application of GSK-126. The role of GSK-126 in seizure susceptibility was investigated in this study. We first determined a critical concentration of pentamethazol (PTZ) under which mice exhibit no seizures. We then found that mice pretreated with GSK-126 and injected with the same concentration of PTZ experienced marked convulsions. Peripheral injections of GSK-126 decreased H3K27me3 levels in the hippocampus of mice, while some seizure-related genes (Oasl1, Sox7, armcx5, Ncx3, etc.) were found to be differentially expressed in the hippocampus of those mice . These differences in the expression levels might reflect the crucial role of these genes and related pathways in the promotion of seizure susceptibility. Our results suggest that GSK-126 promotes seizure susceptibility due to its role as an EZH2 inhibitor. These findings may provide evidence to support the development of GSK-126 as a clinical drug.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The mutation of the homeostatic iron regulatory genes (HFE) impaired the hepatic hepcidin transcription leading to the chronic excess of the iron pool, with the adverse consequences of free radical oxidative damages. We herein reported the findings of Thai family members who had the compound of uncommon HFE rs2794719, together with transferrin (TF) rs1867504, transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2) rs7385804, and hemojuvelin (HJV) rs16827043 genetic variants involved in the hepcidin transcriptional pathway. These compounded genetic variants could produce the spectrum of clinical phenotypes that spanned from mild to moderate symptoms of chronic anemia to an established motor neuron disorder. The feasible pathophysiologies were the impairment of the transferrin receptor functions, which affected the endocytic uptake of halo-transferrin into the erythroblast precursors. Such a defect left the erythropoiesis depleted of their iron supply. These alterations also promoted the TfR-independent uptake of iron into other target tissues and left the TrF2/BMP-dependent-hepcidin activation pathway unattended. We used the predicted molecular interactive proteomes to support our speculated dysregulated iron metabolism. During the early stage of an elevated ferritin level, there was no inhibition of ferroportin activities from hepcidin. These pathophysiological processes went on to the point of an iron overload threshold. After that, the hepcidin transcription started to kick in with the resulting decreased serum iron levels and deterioration of clinical symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Mechanisms and progression of ischemic injuries in the retina are still incompletely clarified. Therefore, the time course of microglia activation as well as resulting cytokine expression and downstream signaling were investigated. Ischemia was induced in one eye by transiently elevated intraocular pressure (60 min) followed by reperfusion; the other eye served as a control. Eyes were processed for RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry analyses at 2, 6, 12, and 24 h as well as at 3 and 7 days. Already 2 h after ischemia, more microglia/macrophages were in an active state in the ischemia group. This was accompanied by an upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, and TGFβ. Activation of TLR3, TLR2, and the adaptor molecule Myd88 was also observed after 2 h. NFκB revealed a wave-like activation pattern. In addition, an extrinsic caspase pathway activation was noted at early time points, while enhanced numbers of cleaved caspase 3&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells could be observed in ischemic retinae throughout the study. Retinal ischemia induced an early and strong microglia/macrophage response as well as cytokine and apoptotic activation processes. Moreover, in early and late ischemic damaging processes, TLR expression and downstream signaling were involved, suggesting an involvement in neuronal death in ischemic retinae.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The effective prevention of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) needs to be explored, and the effect of preoperative pain on POCD remains unclear. We established a chronic pain model induced by chronic constriction injury (CCI) and models of acute pain and anxiety without pain in mice that were subsequently subjected to partial hepatectomy surgery. Morris water maze (MWM) tests were performed to evaluate the learning and memory abilities of the mice. ELISA was used to measure IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in serum, and HPLC-MS was used to detect neurotransmitters in the prefrontal cortices and hippocampi of the mice. The results indicated that chronic pain induced by CCI might have significantly impaired the learning and memory abilities of mice, while acute pain and anxiety without pain only affected the memory abilities of mice. Perioperative acute pain increased the level of IL-1β in serum, and CCI might have increased the level of IL-6. CCI and acute pain increased dopamine (DA) levels in the cortex, similar to anxiety. Like anxiety, CCI increased 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Acute pain led to a decrease in the acetylcholine (ACH) level in the hippocampus. Our results suggest that acute pain and CCI-induced chronic pain might aggravate postoperative cognitive dysfunction via neurotransmitters and by changing the levels of inflammatory factors such as IL-1β and IL-6.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Even with increased understanding of immunology, the specific etiological trigger of MS remains unknown. Evidence suggests that oxidative/nitroxidative stress is an important contributor to MS etiology, progression, and clinical symptoms. A multifaceted treatment approach aimed at counteracting oxidative/nitroxidative stress including MS disease–modifying medications, Mediterranean style diet, stress-relieving activities, smoking and alcohol cessation, exercise, and peer support programs is the best way to treat the disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Due to molecular mimicry, maternal antibacterial antibodies are suspected to promote neurodevelopmental changes in the offspring that finally can cause disorders like autism and schizophrenia. Using a human first trimester prenatal brain multiprotein array (MPA), we demonstrate here that antibodies to the digestive tract bacteria &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Helicobacter pylori&lt;/em&gt; (α-&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;HPy&lt;/em&gt;) and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Campylobacter jejuni&lt;/em&gt; (α-&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CJe&lt;/em&gt;) interact with different synaptic proteins, including the calcium sensor synaptotagmin 5 (Syt5). Interactions of both antisera with Syt5 were confirmed by Western blot with a HEK293-cells overexpression lysate of this protein. Immunofluorescence and Western blotting revealed SiMa cells to express Syt5, which also co-migrated with a band/spot labeled by either α-&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;HPy&lt;/em&gt; or α-&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CJe&lt;/em&gt;. Functionally, a 12-h pretreatment of SiMa cells with 10 μg/ml of either α-&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;HPy&lt;/em&gt; or α-&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CJe&lt;/em&gt; resulted in a significant reduction of acetylcholine(ACh)-dependent calcium signals as compared to controls. Also ACh-dependent vesicle recycling was significantly reduced in cells pretreated with either α-&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;HPy&lt;/em&gt; or α-&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CJe&lt;/em&gt;. Similar effects were observed upon pretreatment of SiMa cells with Syt5-specific antibodies. In conclusion, the present study supports the view that prenatal maternal antibacterial immune responses towards &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;HPy&lt;/em&gt; and by this to Syt5 are able to cause functional changes, which in the end might contribute also to neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting the ventral midbrain dopaminergic neurons, resulting in motor defects mainly tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia along with a wide array of non-motor symptoms. The current study is focused on determining the potential druggable targets of PD by consolidating gene expression profiling and network methodology. Initially, the differentially expressed genes were established from which the central network was constructed by assimilating the interacting partners. Investigating the topological parameters of the network, the genes &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SYT1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CXCR4&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CDC42&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;KIT&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;RET&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;DRD2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;NTN1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PRKACB&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;KDR&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;NR4A2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SLC18A2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CCK&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TH&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;KCNJ6&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TAC1&lt;/em&gt; were identified as the hub genes and can be explored as potential candidate genes for PD therapeutics. Gene ontology and cluster analysis of the hub genes has provided further insights about the pathophysiology of the disease. Among the hub genes, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PRKACB&lt;/em&gt; is observed in relatively all the enriched pathways which are modulated by G protein-coupled receptors through protein kinases. Further, we noticed &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SYT1&lt;/em&gt; as a novel biomarker for PD. Moreover, the regulatory network was constructed with the hub genes as seed nodes with associated transcription factors (TFs) and microRNA (miRNAs). In this analysis, we identified MYC as the major TF and the miRNAs &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;miR-21&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;miR-155&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;miR-7&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;miR26A1&lt;/em&gt; have a significant role in modulating the hub genes. Briefly, these significant hub genes and their enriched pathways, TFs, and miRNAs have aided in the better understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying PD and its potential core target genes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Recent studies have shed light on the involvement of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the initiation and development of stroke. However, the regulatory function of many lncRNAs in large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) has not been fully elucidated. Based on the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) hypothesis recently proposed by Pandolfi, the present study was conducted using experimental techniques and bioinformatics to investigate the expression and regulatory function of a lncRNA involved in the development of LAA. The lncRNAs differentially expressed in stroke were obtained using meta-analysis, and one lncRNA was selected for experimental studies on patients with LAA (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 100) and healthy controls (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 100) using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The patients were also evaluated through meta-analysis to identify the function of the selected lncRNA, miRNAs, and mRNAs with altered expression in stroke. Finally, the experimental results and meta-analysis findings were integrated, and different functional groups were assigned. The results indicated that the level of lncRNA-RUNX1-IT1 was significantly lower in the patients with LAA compared to the healthy control subjects (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;gt; 0.05). Logistic regression analyses revealed that the expression of lncRNA-RUNX1-IT1 was inversely correlated with LAA (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 009, OR = 0.871, 95% CI: 0.786–0.965). In addition, a network of differentially expressed genes (DE genes) was created for miRNAs and mRNAs based on their association with lncRNA-RUNX1-IT1. Functional analysis showed that the DE genes in the network are involved in the apoptosis and alternative splicing of RNAs. The findings of the present study suggest that the downregulation of lncRNA-RUNX1-IT1 is associated with LAA development by interrupting the regulatory network of cells. The results of network analysis demonstrated that the lncRNA-RUNX1-IT1 could influence the expression of mRNAs and miRNAs involved in the apoptosis and alternative splicing of RNAs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Despite the putative advantages of MgSO&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as a neuroprotective agent in the preterm brain, the short- and long-term molecular function of MgSO&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as a neuroprotective agent has not been fully elucidated. Neuregulin (NRG1)-ErbB4 signaling plays a critical role in embryonic brain development, in the biology of dopaminergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic systems. We hypothesize that this pathway may be associated with the neuroprotective role of MgSO&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The current study aims to investigate the ability of MgSO&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to modulate the normal developing expression pattern of selected genes related to the NRG1-ErbB, dopaminergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic systems. We demonstrate that overall short-term treatment of dam rats with MgSO&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; affects the expression of fetal brain NRG1, NRG3, ErbB4, GAD67, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine D&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, GluN1, and GluN2B. More specifically, the administration of MgSO&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; alters the expression of NRG-ErbB, GAD67, TH, and D2R at early gestation day 16 (GD16) regardless of the activation of the maternal immune system by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Our data suggest that MgSO&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; treatment may affect the expression of major neuronal systems and pathways mostly at an early gestation day. These changes might be an initial clue (foundation stone) in the molecular mechanism that underlies the beneficial effect of MgSO&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as a neuroprotective agent for the developmental brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Psychosocial stress has been widely reported to contribute to psychiatric disturbances. Perturbations in the enzymes of GABAergic and cholinergic systems have been implicated as precursors in different stress-related neuropsychiatric diseases. Targeting glutamic acid decarboxylase-67 kDa (GAD67) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) via oxidative, nitrergic, and neuroinflammatory mechanisms have been recognized as prospective strategies for the prevention of psychosocial stress-induced behavioral impairments. Naringin, a neuro-active flavonoid compound isolated from citrus fruits, has been shown to produce memory-enhancing, antiepileptic, antidepressant, and anti-inflammatory activities similarly to ginseng, a very potent adaptogen. In this communication, we assessed the effect of naringin on social-defeat stress (SDS)-induced behavioral, GABAergic, cholinergic, oxidative, nitrergic, and neuroinflammatory changes in mice using the resident–intruder paradigm. The intruder male mice were culled into six groups. Groups 1 and 2 (normal- and SDS-controls) received sterile saline, groups 3–5 were given naringin (25-100 mg/kg, i.p.) whereas group 6 had ginseng (50 mg/kg, i.p.) daily for 14 days, but followed by 10 min SDS (physical and psychological) exposure to groups 2–6 with aggressor–resident mice. Behavioral effects using Y-maze, elevated-plus maze, sociability, and tail-suspension tests were assessed on day 14. GAD67, AChE enzymes, and biomarkers of oxidative, nitrergic, and neuroinflammatory changes were assayed in the striatum, prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus. Naringin and ginseng reversed all SDS-induced behavioral impairments. Naringin increased the levels of GAD67 and decreased AChE activities in the striatum, prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus. Furthermore, naringin reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6), malondialdehyde, nitrite concentrations, and increased glutathione levels in a region-dependent manner. Our study suggests that naringin attenuated SDS-induced behavioral endophenotypes of neuropsychiatric disease through increased GAD67 synthesis, inhibition of AChE activity, oxidative, nitrergic stress, and neuroinflammatory processes in stress-sensitive brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Combinatorial optimization is a well-established area in operations research
and computer science. Until recently, its methods have focused on solving
problem instances in isolation, ignoring the fact that they often stem from
related data distributions in practice. However, recent years have seen a surge
of interest in using machine learning, especially graph neural networks (GNNs),
as a key building block for combinatorial tasks, either as solvers or as helper
functions. GNNs are an inductive bias that effectively encodes combinatorial
and relational input due to their permutation-invariance and sparsity
awareness. This paper presents a conceptual review of recent key advancements
in this emerging field, aiming at both the optimization and machine learning

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain rhythms emerge as a result of synchronization among interconnected
spiking neurons. Key properties of such rhythms can be gleaned from the
phase-resetting curve (PRC). Inferring the macroscopic PRC and developing a
systematic phase reduction theory for emerging rhythms remains an outstanding
theoretical challenge. Here we present a practical theoretical framework to
compute the PRC of generic spiking networks with emergent collective
oscillations. To do so, we adopt a refractory density approach where neurons
are described by the time since their last action potential. In the
thermodynamic limit, the network dynamics are captured by a continuity equation
known as the refractory density equation. We develop an appropriate adjoint
method for this equation which in turn gives a semi-analytical expression of
the infinitesimal PRC. We confirm the validity of our framework for specific
examples of neural networks. Our theoretical findings highlight the
relationship between key biological properties at the individual neuron scale
and the macroscopic oscillatory properties assessed by the PRC.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We examine the dynamical evolution of the state of a neurone, with particular
care to the non-equilibrium nature of the forces influencing its movement in
state space. We combine non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and dynamical
systems theory to characterise the nature of the neural resting state, and its
relationship to firing. The stereotypical shape of the action potential arises
from this model, as well as bursting dynamics, and the non-equilibrium phase
transition from resting to spiking. Geometric properties of the system are
discussed, such as the birth and shape of the neural limit cycle, which provide
a complementary understanding of these dynamics. This provides a multiscale
model of the neural cell, from molecules to spikes, and explains various
phenomena in a unified manner. Some more general notions for damped
oscillators, birth-death processes, and stationary non-equilibrium systems are
included.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09124</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Self-organized criticality (SOC) refers to the ability of complex systems to
evolve towards a second-order phase transition at which interactions between
system components lead to scale-invariant events beneficial for system
performance. For the last two decades, considerable experimental evidence has
accumulated that the mammalian cortex with its diversity in cell types,
interconnectivity, and plasticity might exhibit SOC. Here we review
experimental findings of isolated, layered cortex preparations to self-organize
towards the four dynamical motifs of up-states, oscillations, neuronal
avalanches, and coherence potentials. During up-states, the synchronization
observed for nested theta/gamma-oscillations embeds scale-invariant neuronal
avalanches identified by robust power law scaling in avalanche sizes with a
slope of -3/2. This precise dynamical coordination can be tracked in negative
transients of the local field potential (nLFP), emerges autonomously in
superficial layers of organotypic cortex cultures, is homeostatically
regulated, exhibits separation of time scales, and reveals unique size vs.
quiet time dependencies. A subclass of avalanches, the coherence potential,
exhibits precise maintenance of temporal precision in propagated local
synchrony. Avalanches emerge in superficial cortex layers under conditions of
strong external driving. The balance of excitation and inhibition (E/I) and
neuromodulators such as dopamine establish powerful control parameters for
avalanche dynamics. This rich dynamical repertoire is not observed in
dissociated cortex cultures, which lack the differentiation into layered
components, suggesting that SOC in cortex requires essential components found
in superficial layers of cortex. The precise interaction between up-states,
nested oscillations and avalanches in layered cortex provides compelling
evidence for SOC in the brain.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09061</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a common tool used to understand brain
activities. The data are typically obtained by placing electrodes at the
surface of the scalp and recording the oscillations of currents passing through
the electrodes. These oscillations can sometimes lead to various
interpretations, depending on the subject's health condition, the experiment
carried out, the sensitivity of the tools used, human manipulations etc. The
data obtained over time can be considered a time series. There is evidence in
the literature that epilepsy EEG data may be chaotic. Either way, the embedding
theory in dynamical systems suggests that time series from a complex system
could be used to reconstruct its phase space under proper conditions. In this
paper, we propose an analysis of epilepsy electroencephalogram time series data
based on a novel approach dubbed complex geometric structurization. Complex
geometric structurization stems from the construction of strange attractors
using embedding theory from dynamical systems. The complex geometric structures
are themselves obtained using a geometry tool, namely the $\alpha$-shapes from
shape analysis. Initial analyses show a proof of concept in that these complex
structures capture the expected changes brain in lobes under consideration.
Further, a deeper analysis suggests that these complex structures can be used
as biomarkers for seizure changes.

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Phenotypic Characterization and Brain Structure Analysis of Calcium Channel Subunit α2δ-2 Mutant (Ducky) and α2δ Double Knockout Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2021.634412</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Auxiliary α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;δ subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels modulate channel trafficking, current properties, and synapse formation. Three of the four isoforms (α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;δ-1, α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;δ-2, and α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;δ-3) are abundantly expressed in the brain; however, of the available knockout models, only α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;δ-2 knockout or mutant mice display an obvious abnormal neurological phenotype. Thus, we hypothesize that the neuronal α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;δ isoforms may have partially specific as well as redundant functions. To address this, we generated three distinct α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;δ double knockout mouse models by crossbreeding single knockout (α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;δ-1 and -3) or mutant (α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;δ-2/ducky) mice. Here, we provide a first phenotypic description and brain structure analysis. We found that genotypic distribution of neonatal litters in distinct α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;δ-1/-2, α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;δ-1/-3, and α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;δ-2/-3 breeding combinations did not conform to Mendel’s law, suggesting premature lethality of single and double knockout mice. Notably, high occurrences of infant mortality correlated with the absence of specific α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;δ isoforms (α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Δ-2 &amp;gt; α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;δ-1 &amp;gt; α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;δ-3), and was particularly observed in cages with behaviorally abnormal parenting animals of α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;δ-2/-3 cross-breedings. Juvenile α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;δ-1/-2 and α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;δ-2/-3 double knockout mice displayed a waddling gate similar to ducky mice. However, in contrast to ducky and α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;δ-1/-3 double knockout animals, α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;δ-1/-2 and α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;δ-2/-3 double knockout mice showed a more severe disease progression and highly impaired development. The observed phenotypes within the individual mouse lines may be linked to differences in the volume of specific brain regions. Reduced cortical volume in ducky mice, for example, was associated with a progressively decreased space between neurons, suggesting a reduction of total synaptic connections. Taken together, our findings show that α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;δ subunits differentially regulate premature survival, postnatal growth, brain development, and behavior, suggesting specific neuronal functions in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Dosimetry Analysis in Non-brain Tissues During TMS Exposure of Broca’s and M1 Areas</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.644951</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For human protection, the internal electric field is used as a dosimetric quantity for electromagnetic fields lower than 5–10 MHz. According to international standards, in this frequency range, electrostimulation is the main adverse effect against which protection is needed. One of the topics to be investigated is the quantification of the internal electric field threshold levels of perception and pain. Pain has been reported as a side effect during transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), especially during stimulation of the Broca’s (speech) area of the brain. In this study, we designed an experiment to conduct a dosimetry analysis to quantify the internal electric field corresponding to perception and pain thresholds when targeting the Broca’s and M1 areas from magnetic stimulator exposure. Dosimetry analysis was conducted using a multi-scale analysis in an individualized head model to investigate electrostimulation in an axonal model. The main finding is that the stimulation on the primary motor cortex has higher perception and pain thresholds when compared to Broca’s area. Also, TMS-induced electric field applied to Broca’s area exhibited dependence on the coil orientation at lower electric field threshold which was found to be related to the location and thickness of pain fibers. The derived dosimetry quantities provide a scientific rationale for the development of human protection guidelines and the estimation of possible side effects of magnetic stimulation in clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Incidental Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging Findings and the Cognitive and Motor Performance in the Elderly: The Shanghai Changfeng Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.631087</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;The frequently discovered incidental findings (IFs) from imaging observations are increasing. The IFs show the potential clues of structural abnormalities underlying cognitive decline in elders. Detecting brain IFs and their relationship with cognitive and behavioral functions helps provide the information for clinical strategies.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Five hundred and seventy-nine participants were recruited in the Shanghai Changfeng Study. All participants performed the demographic, biochemical, and cognitive functions and gait speed assessment and underwent the high-resolution multimodal magnetic resonance imaging scans. We calculated the detection rate of brain IFs. The association between cardiovascular risk factors and IFs and the associations between IFs and cognitive and motor functions were assessed using regression models. The relationships among gray matter volume, cognitive function, and gait speed were assessed with/without adjusting the IFs to evaluate the effects of potential IFs confounders.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;IFs were found in a total of 578 subjects with a detection rate of 99.8%. Age and blood pressure were the most significant cardiovascular risk factors correlated with IFs. IFs were found to be negatively associated with Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Mini-Mental State Examination, and gait speed. The gray matter volume was found to be positively correlated with the cognitive function without adjusting the white matter hyperintensity but not if adjusted.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;IFs are commonly found in the elderly population and related to brain functions. The adequate intervention of IFs related cardiovascular risk factors that may slow down the progression of brain function decline. We also suggest that IFs should be considered as confounding factors that may affect cognitive issues on the structural neuroimaging researches in aging or diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Morphometric and Functional Brain Connectivity Differentiates Chess Masters From Amateur Players</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.629478</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A common task in brain image analysis includes diagnosis of a certain medical condition wherein groups of healthy controls and diseased subjects are analyzed and compared. On the other hand, for two groups of healthy participants with different proficiency in a certain skill, a distinctive analysis of the brain function remains a challenging problem. In this study, we develop new computational tools to explore the functional and anatomical differences that could exist between the brain of healthy individuals identified on the basis of different levels of task experience/proficiency. Toward this end, we look at a dataset of amateur and professional chess players, where we utilize resting-state functional magnetic resonance images to generate functional connectivity (FC) information. In addition, we utilize T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging to estimate morphometric connectivity (MC) information. We combine functional and anatomical features into a new connectivity matrix, which we term as the functional morphometric similarity connectome (FMSC). Since, both the FC and MC information is susceptible to redundancy, the size of this information is reduced using statistical feature selection. We employ off-the-shelf machine learning classifier, support vector machine, for both single- and multi-modality classifications. From our experiments, we establish that the saliency and ventral attention network of the brain is functionally and anatomically different between two groups of healthy subjects (chess players). We argue that, since chess involves many aspects of higher order cognition such as systematic thinking and spatial reasoning and the identified network is task-positive to cognition tasks requiring a response, our results are valid and supporting the feasibility of the proposed computational pipeline. Moreover, we quantitatively validate an existing neuroscience hypothesis that learning a certain skill could cause a change in the brain (functional connectivity and anatomy) and this can be tested via our novel FMSC algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: X-Vectors: New Quantitative Biomarkers for Early Parkinson's Disease Detection From Speech</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.578369</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many articles have used voice analysis to detect Parkinson's disease (PD), but few have focused on the early stages of the disease and the gender effect. In this article, we have adapted the latest speaker recognition system, called x-vectors, in order to detect PD at an early stage using voice analysis. X-vectors are embeddings extracted from Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), which provide robust speaker representations and improve speaker recognition when large amounts of training data are used. Our goal was to assess whether, in the context of early PD detection, this technique would outperform the more standard classifier MFCC-GMM (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients—Gaussian Mixture Model) and, if so, under which conditions. We recorded 221 French speakers (recently diagnosed PD subjects and healthy controls) with a high-quality microphone and via the telephone network. Men and women were analyzed separately in order to have more precise models and to assess a possible gender effect. Several experimental and methodological aspects were tested in order to analyze their impacts on classification performance. We assessed the impact of the audio segment durations, data augmentation, type of dataset used for the neural network training, kind of speech tasks, and back-end analyses. X-vectors technique provided better classification performances than MFCC-GMM for the text-independent tasks, and seemed to be particularly suited for the early detection of PD in women (7–15% improvement). This result was observed for both recording types (high-quality microphone and telephone).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: MindLink-Eumpy: An Open-Source Python Toolbox for Multimodal Emotion Recognition</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.621493</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Emotion recognition plays an important role in intelligent human–computer interaction, but the related research still faces the problems of low accuracy and subject dependence. In this paper, an open-source software toolbox called MindLink-Eumpy is developed to recognize emotions by integrating electroencephalogram (EEG) and facial expression information. MindLink-Eumpy first applies a series of tools to automatically obtain physiological data from subjects and then analyzes the obtained facial expression data and EEG data, respectively, and finally fuses the two different signals at a decision level. In the detection of facial expressions, the algorithm used by MindLink-Eumpy is a multitask convolutional neural network (CNN) based on transfer learning technique. In the detection of EEG, MindLink-Eumpy provides two algorithms, including a subject-dependent model based on support vector machine (SVM) and a subject-independent model based on long short-term memory network (LSTM). In the decision-level fusion, weight enumerator and AdaBoost technique are applied to combine the predictions of SVM and CNN. We conducted two offline experiments on the Database for Emotion Analysis Using Physiological Signals (DEAP) dataset and the Multimodal Database for Affect Recognition and Implicit Tagging (MAHNOB-HCI) dataset, respectively, and conducted an online experiment on 15 healthy subjects. The results show that multimodal methods outperform single-modal methods in both offline and online experiments. In the subject-dependent condition, the multimodal method achieved an accuracy of 71.00% in the valence dimension and an accuracy of 72.14% in the arousal dimension. In the subject-independent condition, the LSTM-based method achieved an accuracy of 78.56% in the valence dimension and an accuracy of 77.22% in the arousal dimension. The feasibility and efficiency of MindLink-Eumpy for emotion recognition is thus demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.608285</link>
	<content:encoded>Background and Objectives&lt;p&gt;Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is a type of malformations of cortical development and one of the leading causes of drug-resistant epilepsy. Postoperative results improve the diagnosis of lesions on structural MRIs. Advances in quantitative algorithms have increased the identification of FCD lesions. However, due to significant differences in size, shape, and location of the lesion in different patients and a big deal of time for the objective diagnosis of lesion as well as the dependence of individual interpretation, sensitive approaches are required to address the challenge of lesion diagnosis. In this research, a FCD computer-aided diagnostic system to improve existing methods is presented.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were collected from 58 participants (30 with histologically confirmed FCD type II and 28 without a record of any neurological prognosis). Morphological and intensity-based features were calculated for each cortical surface and inserted into an artificial neural network. Statistical examinations evaluated classifier efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Neural network evaluation metrics—sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy—were 96.7, 100, and 98.6%, respectively. Furthermore, the accuracy of the classifier for the detection of the lobe and hemisphere of the brain, where the FCD lesion is located, was 84.2 and 77.3%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Analyzing surface-based features by automated machine learning can give a quantitative and objective diagnosis of FCD lesions in presurgical assessment and improve postsurgical outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Transfer of Learning in the Convolutional Neural Networks on Classifying Geometric Shapes Based on Local or Global Invariants</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.637144</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a powerful tool of image classification that has been widely adopted in applications of automated scene segmentation and identification. However, the mechanisms underlying CNN image classification remain to be elucidated. In this study, we developed a new approach to address this issue by investigating transfer of learning in representative CNNs (AlexNet, VGG, ResNet-101, and Inception-ResNet-v2) on classifying geometric shapes based on local/global features or invariants. While the local features are based on simple components, such as orientation of line segment or whether two lines are parallel, the global features are based on the whole object such as whether an object has a hole or whether an object is inside of another object. Six experiments were conducted to test two hypotheses on CNN shape classification. The first hypothesis is that transfer of learning based on local features is higher than transfer of learning based on global features. The second hypothesis is that the CNNs with more layers and advanced architectures have higher transfer of learning based global features. The first two experiments examined how the CNNs transferred learning of discriminating local features (square, rectangle, trapezoid, and parallelogram). The other four experiments examined how the CNNs transferred learning of discriminating global features (presence of a hole, connectivity, and inside/outside relationship). While the CNNs exhibited robust learning on classifying shapes, transfer of learning varied from task to task, and model to model. The results rejected both hypotheses. First, some CNNs exhibited lower transfer of learning based on local features than that based on global features. Second the advanced CNNs exhibited lower transfer of learning on global features than that of the earlier models. Among the tested geometric features, we found that learning of discriminating inside/outside relationship was the most difficult to be transferred, indicating an effective benchmark to develop future CNNs. In contrast to the “ImageNet” approach that employs natural images to train and analyze the CNNs, the results show proof of concept for the “ShapeNet” approach that employs well-defined geometric shapes to elucidate the strengths and limitations of the computation in CNN image classification. This “ShapeNet” approach will also provide insights into understanding visual information processing the primate visual systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Neurophysiological Impact of Experimentally-Induced Pain on Direct Muscle Spindle Afferent Response: A Scoping Review</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.649529</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Musculoskeletal pain disorders are among the leading causes of years lived with disability worldwide representing a significant burden to society. Studies investigating a “nociceptive-fusimotor” relationship using experimentally-induced pain/noxious stimuli and muscle spindle afferent (MSA) response have been published over several decades. The purpose of this scoping review was to systematically identify and summarize research findings related to the impact of experimentally-induced pain or noxious stimulation on direct MSA discharge/response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane and Embase were searched from database inception to August 2020. Eligible studies were: (a) published in English; (b) clinical or pre-clinical studies; (c) original data studies; (d) included the investigation of MSA response to experimentally-induced pain or noxious stimulation; (e) included quantification of at least one direct physiological measure associated with MSA activity/response. Two-phase screening procedures were conducted by a pair of independent reviewers and data extracted from eligible studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The literature search resulted in 195 articles of which 23 met inclusion criteria. Six studies (26%) were classified as clinical and 17 (74%) as pre-clinical. Two clinical studies investigated the effects of sacral dermatome pin-pricking on MSA response, while the remaining 4 studies investigated the effects of tonic muscle and/or skin pain induced by injection/infusion of hypertonic saline into the tibialis anterior muscle or subdermal tissues. In pre-clinical studies, muscle pain was induced by injection of noxious substances or the surgical removal of the meniscus at the knee joint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Clinical studies in awake humans reported that experimentally-induced pain did not affect, or else slightly decreased MSA spontaneous discharge and/or response during weak dorsiflexor muscle contraction, thus failing to support an excitatory nociceptive-fusimotor relationship. However, a majority of pre-clinical studies indicated that ipsilateral and contralateral muscle injection of noxious substances altered MSA resting discharge and/or response to stretch predominately through static fusimotor reflex mechanisms. Methodological differences (use of anesthesia, stretch methodology, etc.) may ultimately be responsible for the discrepancies between clinical and pre-clinical findings. Additional investigative efforts are needed to reconcile these discrepancies and to clearly establish or refute the existence of nociceptive-fusimotor relationship in muscular pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Repeated Low-Level Blast Acutely Alters Brain Cytokines, Neurovascular Proteins, Mechanotransduction, and Neurodegenerative Markers in a Rat Model</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.636707</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Exposure to the repeated low-level blast overpressure (BOP) periodically experienced by military personnel in operational and training environments can lead to deficits in behavior and cognition. While these low-intensity blasts do not cause overt changes acutely, repeated exposures may lead to cumulative effects in the brain that include acute inflammation, vascular disruption, and other molecular changes, which may eventually contribute to neurodegenerative processes. To identify these acute changes in the brain following repeated BOP, an advanced blast simulator was used to expose rats to 8.5 or 10 psi BOP once per day for 14 days. At 24 h after the final BOP, brain tissue was collected and analyzed for inflammatory markers, astrogliosis (GFAP), tight junction proteins (claudin-5 and occludin), and neurodegeneration-related proteins (Aβ40/42, pTau, TDP-43). After repeated exposure to 8.5 psi BOP, the change in cytokine profile was relatively modest compared to the changes observed following 10 psi BOP, which included a significant reduction in several inflammatory markers. Reduction in the tight junction protein occludin was observed in both groups when compared to controls, suggesting cerebrovascular disruption. While repeated exposure to 8.5 psi BOP led to a reduction in the Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-related proteins amyloid-β (Aβ)40 and Aβ42, these changes were not observed in the 10 psi group, which had a significant reduction in phosphorylated tau. Finally, repeated 10 psi BOP exposures led to an increase in GFAP, indicating alterations in astrocytes, and an increase in the mechanosensitive ion channel receptor protein, Piezo2, which may increase brain sensitivity to injury from pressure changes from BOP exposure. Overall, cumulative effects of repeated low-level BOP may increase the vulnerability to injury of the brain by disrupting neurovascular architecture, which may lead to downstream deleterious effects on behavior and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Indolaminergic System in Adult Rat Testes: Evidence for a Local Serotonin System</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.570058</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Serotonin (5-HT) is member of a family of indolamine molecules that participate in a wide variety of biological processes. Despite its important role in the regulation of local blood systems, little is known about the physiological function of 5-HT in reproductive organs, its functional implications, and its role in the reproduction of mammals. In the present work, we evaluated the localization and distribution of 5-HT (using histochemical analysis of indolamines) and different components of the serotoninergic system in rat testes. We detected local synthesis and degradation through immunofluorescence and western blot analyses against the TPH1, MAO&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;, 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;, and VMAT1 serotonin transporters. We also identified the localization and distribution of the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1B&lt;/sub&gt;, 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;, and 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors. RT-PCR results showed the presence of the Tph1, Maoa, Slc6a4, and Htr3a genes in testes and in the brain stem (Tph1 was used as a negative control). High-performance liquid chromatography was used to determine the presence of 5-HT and the activity of tryptophan hydroxylase in testes homogenates in vitro. Our observations suggest that TPH1 activity and local 5-HT synthesis befall in rat testes. We propose that 5-HT could participate in the regulation of testosterone synthesis and in the spermatogenesis process via local serotoninergic system. However, more studies are needed before concluding that rat testes, or those of other mammals, contain an active form of tryptophan hydroxylase and produce 5-HT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Plasma neurofilaments light chain (pNfL) is a marker of axonal injury. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of pNfL as a predictive biomarker for post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A prospective single-center observational cohort study was conducted at the General Hospital of Western Theater Command between July 1, 2017 and December 31, 2019. Consecutive patients ≥18 years with first-ever acute ischemic stroke (AIS) of anterior circulation within 24 h of symptom onset were included. PSCI was defined by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) (MOCA &amp;lt; 26) at 90 days after stroke onset.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;A total of 1,694 patients [male, 893 (52.70%); median age, 64 (16) years] were enrolled in the cohort analysis, and 1,029 (60.70%) were diagnosed with PSCI. Patients with PSCI had significantly higher pNfL [median (IQR), 55.96 (36.13) vs. 35.73 (17.57) pg/ml; P &amp;lt; 0.001] than Non-PSCI. pNfL was valuable for the prediction of PSCI (OR 1.044, 95% CI 1.038–1.049, P &amp;lt; 0.001) after a logistic regression analysis, even after adjusting for conventional risk factors including age, sex, education level, NIHSS, TOAST classification, and infarction volume (OR 1.041, 95% CI 1.034–1.047, P &amp;lt; 0.001). The optimal cutoff value of the pNfL concentration was 46.12 pg/ml, which yielded a sensitivity of 71.0% and a specificity of 81.5%, with the area under the curve (AUC) at 0.785 (95% CI 0.762–0.808, P &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This prospective cohort study showed that the pNfL concentration within 48 h of onset was an independent risk factor for PSCI 90 days after an anterior circulation stroke, even after being adjusted for potential influencing factors regarded as clinically relevant.&lt;/p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration&lt;p&gt;www.chictr.org.cn, identifier ChiCTR1800020330.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Cerebral Small Vessel Disease Load Predicts Functional Outcome and Stroke Recurrence After Intracerebral Hemorrhage: A Median Follow-Up of 5 Years</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.628271</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Uncertainty exists over the long-term prognostic significance of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) in primary intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We performed a longitudinal analysis of CSVD and clinical outcomes in consecutive patients with primary ICH who had MRI. Baseline CSVD load (including white matter hyperintensities [WMH], cerebral microbleeds [CMBs], lacunes, and enlarged perivascular spaces [EPVS]) was evaluated. The cumulative CSVD score was calculated by combining the presence of each CSVD marker (range 0–4). We followed participants for poor functional outcome [modified Rankin scale [mRS] ≥ 4], stroke recurrence, and time-varying survival during a median follow-up of 4.9 [interquartile range [IQR] 3.1–6.0] years. Parsimonious and fuller multivariable logistic regression analysis and Cox-regression analysis were performed to estimate the association of CSVD markers, individually and collectively, with each outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A total of 153 patients were included in the analyses. CMBs ≥ 10 [adjusted OR [adOR] 3.252, 95% CI 1.181–8.956, p = 0.023] and periventricular WMH (PWMH) (adOR 2.053, 95% CI 1.220–3.456, p = 0.007) were significantly associated with poor functional outcome. PWMH (adOR 2.908, 95% CI 1.230–6.878, p = 0.015) and lobar CMB severity (adOR 1.811, 95% CI 1.039–3.157, p = 0.036) were associated with stroke recurrence. The cumulative CSVD score was associated with poor functional outcome (adOR 1.460, 95% CI 1.017–2.096) and stroke recurrence (adOR 2.258, 95% CI 1.080–4.723). Death occurred in 36.1% (13/36) of patients with CMBs ≥ 10 compared with 18.8% (22/117) in those with CMB &amp;lt; 10 (adjusted HR 2.669, 95% CI 1.248–5.707, p = 0.011). In addition, the cumulative CSVD score ≥ 2 was associated with a decreased survival rate (adjusted HR 3.140, 95% CI 1.066–9.250, p = 0.038).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Severe PWMH, CMB, or cumulative CSVD burden exert important influences on the long-term outcome of ICH.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Gauging Working Memory Capacity From Differential Resting Brain Oscillations in Older Individuals With A Wearable Device</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.625006</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Working memory is a core cognitive function and its deficits is one of the most common cognitive impairments. Reduced working memory capacity manifests as reduced accuracy in memory recall and prolonged speed of memory retrieval in older adults. Currently, the relationship between healthy older individuals’ age-related changes in resting brain oscillations and their working memory capacity is not clear. Eyes-closed resting electroencephalogram (rEEG) is gaining momentum as a potential neuromarker of mild cognitive impairments. Wearable and wireless EEG headset measuring key electrophysiological brain signals during rest and a working memory task was utilized. This research’s central hypothesis is that rEEG (e.g., eyes closed for 90 s) frequency and network features are surrogate markers for working memory capacity in healthy older adults. Forty-three older adults’ memory performance (accuracy and reaction times), brain oscillations during rest, and inter-channel magnitude-squared coherence during rest were analyzed. We report that individuals with a lower memory retrieval accuracy showed significantly increased alpha and beta oscillations over the right parietal site. Yet, faster working memory retrieval was significantly correlated with increased delta and theta band powers over the left parietal sites. In addition, significantly increased coherence between the left parietal site and the right frontal area is correlated with the faster speed in memory retrieval. The frontal and parietal dynamics of resting EEG is associated with the “accuracy and speed trade-off” during working memory in healthy older adults. Our results suggest that rEEG brain oscillations at local and distant neural circuits are surrogates of working memory retrieval’s accuracy and processing speed. Our current findings further indicate that rEEG frequency and coherence features recorded by wearable headsets and a brief resting and task protocol are potential biomarkers for working memory capacity. Additionally, wearable headsets are useful for fast screening of cognitive impairment risk.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Extracellular Vesicles From 3xTg-AD Mouse and Alzheimer’s Disease Patient Astrocytes Impair Neuroglial and Vascular Components</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.593927</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes are specialized glial cells that are essential components of the neurovascular unit (NVU) and are involved in neurodevelopment, brain maintenance and repair, and neurodegeneration. Astrocytes mediate these processes by releasing cellular mediators such as extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs are vehicles of cell-cell communication and have been proposed as mediators of damage in AD. However, the transcellular mechanism by which Alzheimer disease (AD) astrocytes impair the function of NVU components is poorly understood. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of adult PS1-KI and 3xTg-AD astrocyte conditioned media (CM) and EVs on NVU components (neuroglia and endothelium) in vitro. Additionally, SAD and FAD astrocyte-derived EVs (A-EVs) were characterized, and we evaluated their effects on NVU in cocultured cells in vitro and on intrahippocampal CA1 cells in vivo. Surprisingly, cultured 3xTg-AD astrocytes showed increased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) reactivity compared to PS1-KI astrocytes, which denotes astrocytic hyperreactivity. CM from adult mice 3xTg-AD astrocytes increased cell-cell gaps between endothelial cells, filopodia-like dendritic protrusions in neurons and neuronal and endothelial cell death. 3xTg-AD A-EVs induced neurotoxicity and increased astrocyte GFAP reactivity. Cultured human postmortem astrocytes from AD patients also increased GFAP reactivity and EVs release. No differences in the size or number of A-EVs were detected between AD and control samples; however, both SAD and FAD A-EVs showed increased expression of the surface marker aquaporin 4. A-EVs induced cytotoxicity and astrocyte hyperactivation: specifically, FAD A-EVs induced neuroglial cytotoxicity and increased gaps between the endothelium, while SAD A-EVs mainly altered the endothelium. Similarly, both AD A-EVs increased astrocyte GS reactivity and vascular deterioration in vivo. We associated this finding with perivascular reactive astrocytes and vascular deterioration in the human AD brain. In summary, these results suggest that AD A-EVs impair neuroglial and vascular components.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63747</link>
	<content:encoded>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) cause damage to DNA and proteins. Here we report that the RecA recombinase is itself oxidized by ROS. Genetic and biochemical analyses revealed that oxidation of RecA altered its DNA repair and DNA recombination activities. Mass spectrometry analysis showed that exposure to ROS converted 4 out of 9 Met residues of RecA to methionine sulfoxide. Mimicking oxidation of Met35 by changing it for Gln caused complete loss of function whereas mimicking oxidation of Met164 resulted in constitutive SOS activation and loss of recombination activity. Yet, all ROS-induced alterations of RecA activity were suppressed by methionine sulfoxide reductases MsrA and MsrB. These findings indicate that under oxidative stress, MsrA/B is needed for RecA homeostasis control. The implication is that, besides damaging DNA structure directly, ROS prevent repair of DNA damage by hampering RecA activity.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63524</link>
	<content:encoded>The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family contains thousands of members with diverse functions. Movement of the substrate, powered by ATP hydrolysis, can be outward (export) or inward (import). ABCA4 is a eukaryotic importer transporting retinal to the cytosol to enter the visual cycle. It also removes toxic retinoids from the disc lumen to the cytosol. Mutations in ABCA4 cause impaired vision or blindness. Despite decades of clinical, biochemical, and animal model studies, the molecular mechanism of ABCA4 is unknown. Here we report the structures of human ABCA4 in two conformations. In the absence of ATP, ABCA4 adopts an outward-facing conformation, poised to recruit substrate. The presence of ATP induces large conformational changes that could lead to substrate release. These structures provide a molecular basis to understand many disease-causing mutations and a rational guide for new experiments to uncover how ABCA4 recruits, flips, and releases retinoids.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63476</link>
	<content:encoded>Lamins form stable filaments at the nuclear periphery in metazoans. Unlike B-type lamins, lamins A and C localize also in the nuclear interior, where they interact with lamin-associated polypeptide 2 alpha (LAP2a). Using antibody labeling, we previously observed a depletion of nucleoplasmic A-type lamins in mouse cells lacking LAP2a. Here we show that loss of LAP2a actually causes formation of larger, biochemically stable lamin A/C structures in the nuclear interior that are inaccessible to lamin A/C antibodies. While nucleoplasmic lamin A forms from newly expressed pre-lamin A during processing and from soluble mitotic lamins in a LAP2a-independent manner, binding of LAP2a to lamins A/C during interphase inhibits formation of higher order structures, keeping nucleoplasmic lamin A/C in a mobile state independent of lamin A/C S22 phosphorylation. We propose that LAP2a is essential to maintain a mobile lamin A/C pool in the nuclear interior, which is required for proper nuclear functions.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Forests provide biodiversity, ecosystem and economic services. Information on individual trees is important for understanding forest ecosystems but obtaining individual-level data at broad scales is challenging due to the costs and logistics of data collection. While advances in remote sensing techniques allow surveys of individual trees at unprecedented extents, there remain technical challenges in turning sensor data into tangible information. Using deep learning methods, we produced an open-source dataset of individual-level crown estimates for 100 million trees at 37 sites across the United States surveyed by the National Ecological Observatory Network's Airborne Observation Platform. Each canopy tree crown is represented by a rectangular bounding box and includes information on the height, crown area, and spatial location of the tree. These data have the potential to drive significant expansion of individual-level research on trees by facilitating both regional analyses and cross-region comparisons encompassing forest types from most of the United States.</content:encoded>

N6-methyladenine (6mA) is an important DNA modification form associated with a wide range of biological processes. Identifying accurately 6mA sites on a genomic scale is crucial for under-standing of 6mA’s biological functions. However, the existing experimental techniques for detecting 6mA sites are cost-ineffective, which implies the great need of developing new computational methods for this problem. In this paper, we developed, without requiring any prior knowledge of 6mA and manually crafted sequence features, a deep learning framework named Deep6mA to identify DNA 6mA sites, and its performance is superior to other DNA 6mA prediction tools. Specifically, the 5-fold cross-validation on a benchmark dataset of rice gives the sensitivity and specificity of Deep6mA as 92.96% and 95.06%, respectively, and the overall prediction accuracy is 94%. Importantly, we find that the sequences with 6mA sites share similar patterns across different species. The model trained with rice data predicts well the 6mA sites of other three species: &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Fragaria vesca&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Rosa chinensis&lt;/i&gt; with a prediction accuracy over 90%. In addition, we find that (1) 6mA tends to occur at GAGG motifs, which means the sequence near the 6mA site may be conservative; (2) 6mA is enriched in the TATA box of the promoter, which may be the main source of its regulating downstream gene expression.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aVrzl3Vk1LE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Carlos Coronel-Oliveros, Rodrigo Cofré, Patricio Orio&lt;/p&gt;

Segregation and integration are two fundamental principles of brain structural and functional organization. Neuroimaging studies have shown that the brain transits between different functionally segregated and integrated states, and neuromodulatory systems have been proposed as key to facilitate these transitions. Although whole-brain computational models have reproduced this neuromodulatory effect, the role of local inhibitory circuits and their cholinergic modulation has not been studied. In this article, we consider a Jansen &amp;amp; Rit whole-brain model in a network interconnected using a human connectome, and study the influence of the cholinergic and noradrenergic neuromodulatory systems on the segregation/integration balance. In our model, we introduce a local inhibitory feedback as a plausible biophysical mechanism that enables the integration of whole-brain activity, and that interacts with the other neuromodulatory influences to facilitate the transition between different functional segregation/integration regimes in the brain.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8SzswQ18cJE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Positive interactions within and between populations decrease the likelihood of evolutionary rescue</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/nKaWTi7jDF8/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Yaron Goldberg, Jonathan Friedman&lt;/p&gt;

Positive interactions, including intraspecies cooperation and interspecies mutualisms, play crucial roles in shaping the structure and function of many ecosystems, ranging from plant communities to the human microbiome. While the evolutionary forces that form and maintain positive interactions have been investigated extensively, the influence of positive interactions on the ability of species to adapt to new environments is still poorly understood. Here, we use numerical simulations and theoretical analyses to study how positive interactions impact the likelihood that populations survive after an environment deteriorates, such that survival in the new environment requires quick adaptation via the rise of new mutants—a scenario known as evolutionary rescue. We find that the probability of evolutionary rescue in populations engaged in positive interactions is reduced significantly. In cooperating populations, this reduction is largely due to the fact that survival may require at least a minimal number of individuals, meaning that adapted mutants must arise and spread before the population declines below this threshold. In mutualistic populations, the rescue probability is decreased further due to two additional effects—the need for both mutualistic partners to adapt to the new environment, and competition between the two species. Finally, we show that the presence of cheaters reduces the likelihood of evolutionary rescue even further, making it extremely unlikely. These results indicate that while positive interactions may be beneficial in stable environments, they can hinder adaptation to changing environments and thereby elevate the risk of population collapse. Furthermore, these results may hint at the selective pressures that drove co-dependent unicellular species to form more adaptable organisms able to differentiate into multiple phenotypes, including multicellular life.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nKaWTi7jDF8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Sensing ecosystem dynamics via audio source separation: A case study of marine soundscapes off northeastern Taiwan</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/PZkO2rsGjXs/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Tzu-Hao Lin, Tomonari Akamatsu, Yu Tsao&lt;/p&gt;

Remote acquisition of information on ecosystem dynamics is essential for conservation management, especially for the deep ocean. Soundscape offers unique opportunities to study the behavior of soniferous marine animals and their interactions with various noise-generating activities at a fine temporal resolution. However, the retrieval of soundscape information remains challenging owing to limitations in audio analysis techniques that are effective in the face of highly variable interfering sources. This study investigated the application of a seafloor acoustic observatory as a long-term platform for observing marine ecosystem dynamics through audio source separation. A source separation model based on the assumption of source-specific periodicity was used to factorize time-frequency representations of long-duration underwater recordings. With minimal supervision, the model learned to discriminate source-specific spectral features and prove to be effective in the separation of sounds made by cetaceans, soniferous fish, and abiotic sources from the deep-water soundscapes off northeastern Taiwan. Results revealed phenological differences among the sound sources and identified diurnal and seasonal interactions between cetaceans and soniferous fish. The application of clustering to source separation results generated a database featuring the diversity of soundscapes and revealed a compositional shift in clusters of cetacean vocalizations and fish choruses during diurnal and seasonal cycles. The source separation model enables the transformation of single-channel audio into multiple channels encoding the dynamics of biophony, geophony, and anthropophony, which are essential for characterizing the community of soniferous animals, quality of acoustic habitat, and their interactions. Our results demonstrated the application of source separation could facilitate acoustic diversity assessment, which is a crucial task in soundscape-based ecosystem monitoring. Future implementation of soundscape information retrieval in long-term marine observation networks will lead to the use of soundscapes as a new tool for conservation management in an increasingly noisy ocean.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PZkO2rsGjXs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

We propose a developmental model inspired by the cortico-basal system (CX-BG) for vocal learning in babies and for solving the correspondence mismatch problem they face when they hear unfamiliar voices, with different tones and pitches. This model is based on the neural architecture INFERNO standing for Iterative Free-Energy Optimization of Recurrent Neural Networks. Free-energy minimization is used for rapidly exploring, selecting and learning the optimal choices of actions to perform (eg sound production) in order to reproduce and control as accurately as possible the spike trains representing desired perceptions (eg sound categories). We detail in this paper the CX-BG system responsible for linking causally the sound and motor primitives at the order of a few milliseconds. Two experiments performed with a small and a large audio database show the capabilities of exploration, generalization and robustness to noise of our neural architecture in retrieving audio primitives during vocal learning and during acoustic matching with unheared voices (different genders and tones).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/m86UNW7ETl4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Gene function annotation is important for a variety of downstream analyses of genetic data. But experimental characterization of function remains costly and slow, making computational prediction an important endeavor. Phylogenetic approaches to prediction have been developed, but implementation of a practical Bayesian framework for parameter estimation remains an outstanding challenge. We have developed a computationally efficient model of evolution of gene annotations using phylogenies based on a Bayesian framework using Markov Chain Monte Carlo for parameter estimation. Unlike previous approaches, our method is able to estimate parameters over many different phylogenetic trees and functions. The resulting parameters agree with biological intuition, such as the increased probability of function change following gene duplication. The method performs well on leave-one-out cross-validation, and we further validated some of the predictions in the experimental scientific literature.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/BQFcu6Vs_jY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: The plant metabolome guides fitness-relevant foraging decisions of a specialist herbivore</title>

Plants produce complex mixtures of primary and secondary metabolites. Herbivores use these metabolites as behavioral cues to increase their fitness. However, how herbivores combine and integrate different metabolite classes into fitness-relevant foraging decisions in planta is poorly understood. We developed a molecular manipulative approach to modulate the availability of sugars and benzoxazinoid secondary metabolites as foraging cues for a specialist maize herbivore, the western corn rootworm. By disrupting sugar perception in the western corn rootworm and benzoxazinoid production in maize, we show that sugars and benzoxazinoids act as distinct and dynamically combined mediators of short-distance host finding and acceptance. While sugars improve the capacity of rootworm larvae to find a host plant and to distinguish postembryonic from less nutritious embryonic roots, benzoxazinoids are specifically required for the latter. Host acceptance in the form of root damage is increased by benzoxazinoids and sugars in an additive manner. This pattern is driven by increasing damage to postembryonic roots in the presence of benzoxazinoids and sugars. Benzoxazinoid- and sugar-mediated foraging directly improves western corn rootworm growth and survival. Interestingly, western corn rootworm larvae retain a substantial fraction of their capacity to feed and survive on maize plants even when both classes of chemical cues are almost completely absent. This study unravels fine-grained differentiation and combination of primary and secondary metabolites into herbivore foraging and documents how the capacity to compensate for the lack of important chemical cues enables a specialist herbivore to survive within unpredictable metabolic landscapes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/6QKEQ21AX_M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Generative adversarial networks (GANs) exhibit training pathologies that can
lead to convergence-related degenerative behaviors, whereas
spatially-distributed, coevolutionary algorithms (CEAs) for GAN training, e.g.
Lipizzaner, are empirically robust to them. The robustness arises from
diversity that occurs by training populations of generators and discriminators
in each cell of a toroidal grid. Communication, where signals in the form of
parameters of the best GAN in a cell propagate in four directions: North,
South, West, and East, also plays a role, by communicating adaptations that are
both new and fit. We propose Lipi-Ring, a distributed CEA like Lipizzaner,
except that it uses a different spatial topology, i.e. a ring. Our central
question is whether the different directionality of signal propagation
(effectively migration to one or more neighbors on each side of a cell) meets
or exceeds the performance quality and training efficiency of Lipizzaner
Experimental analysis on different datasets (i.e, MNIST, CelebA, and COVID-19
chest X-ray images) shows that there are no significant differences between the
performances of the trained generative models by both methods. However,
Lipi-Ring significantly reduces the computational time (14.2%. . . 41.2%).
Thus, Lipi-Ring offers an alternative to Lipizzaner when the computational cost
of training matters.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The application of machine learning(ML) and genetic programming(GP) to the
image compression domain has produced promising results in many cases. The need
for compression arises due to the exorbitant size of data shared on the
internet. Compression is required for text, videos, or images, which are used
almost everywhere on web be it news articles, social media posts, blogs,
educational platforms, medical domain, government services, and many other
websites, need packets for transmission and hence compression is necessary to
avoid overwhelming the network. This paper discusses some of the
implementations of image compression algorithms that use techniques such as
Artificial Neural Networks, Residual Learning, Fuzzy Neural Networks,
Convolutional Neural Nets, Deep Learning, Genetic Algorithms. The paper also
describes an implementation of Vector Quantization using GA to generate
codebook which is used for Lossy image compression. All these approaches prove
to be very contrasting to the standard approaches to processing images due to
the highly parallel and computationally extensive nature of machine learning
algorithms. Such non-linear abilities of ML and GP make it widely popular for
use in multiple domains. Traditional approaches are also combined with
artificially intelligent systems, leading to hybrid systems, to achieve better
results.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08792</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Active Inference (ActInf) is an emerging theory that explains perception and
action in biological agents, in terms of minimizing a free energy bound on
Bayesian surprise. Goal-directed behavior is elicited by introducing prior
beliefs on the underlying generative model. In contrast to prior beliefs, which
constrain all realizations of a random variable, we propose an alternative
approach through chance constraints, which allow for a (typically small)
probability of constraint violation, and demonstrate how such constraints can
be used as intrinsic drivers for goal-directed behavior in ActInf. We
illustrate how chance-constrained ActInf weights all imposed (prior)
constraints on the generative model, allowing e.g., for a trade-off between
robust control and empirical chance constraint violation. Secondly, we
interpret the proposed solution within a message passing framework.
Interestingly, the message passing interpretation is not only relevant to the
context of ActInf, but also provides a general purpose approach that can
account for chance constraints on graphical models. The chance constraint
message updates can then be readily combined with other pre-derived message
update rules, without the need for custom derivations. The proposed
chance-constrained message passing framework thus accelerates the search for
workable models in general, and can be used to complement message-passing
formulations on generative neural models.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08634</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Since their inception, learning techniques under the Reservoir Computing
paradigm have shown a great modeling capability for recurrent systems without
the computing overheads required for other approaches. Among them, different
flavors of echo state networks have attracted many stares through time, mainly
due to the simplicity and computational efficiency of their learning algorithm.
However, these advantages do not compensate for the fact that echo state
networks remain as black-box models whose decisions cannot be easily explained
to the general audience. This work addresses this issue by conducting an
explainability study of Echo State Networks when applied to learning tasks with
time series, image and video data. Specifically, the study proposes three
different techniques capable of eliciting understandable information about the
knowledge grasped by these recurrent models, namely, potential memory, temporal
patterns and pixel absence effect. Potential memory addresses questions related
to the effect of the reservoir size in the capability of the model to store
temporal information, whereas temporal patterns unveils the recurrent
relationships captured by the model over time. Finally, pixel absence effect
attempts at evaluating the effect of the absence of a given pixel when the echo
state network model is used for image and video classification. We showcase the
benefits of our proposed suite of techniques over three different domains of
applicability: time series modeling, image and, for the first time in the
related literature, video classification. Our results reveal that the proposed
techniques not only allow for a informed understanding of the way these models
work, but also serve as diagnostic tools capable of detecting issues inherited
from data (e.g. presence of hidden bias).

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Almost all statistical and machine learning methods in analyzing brain
networks rely on distances and loss functions, which are mostly Euclidean or
matrix norms. The Euclidean or matrix distances may fail to capture underlying
subtle topological differences in brain networks. Further, Euclidean distances
are sensitive to outliers. A few extreme edge weights may severely affect the
distance. Thus it is necessary to use distances and loss functions that
recognize topology of data. In this review paper, we survey various topological
distance and loss functions from topological data analysis (TDA) and persistent
homology that can be used in brain network analysis more effectively. Although
there are many recent brain imaging studies that are based on TDA methods,
possibly due to the lack of method awareness, TDA has not taken as the
mainstream tool in brain imaging field yet. The main purpose of this paper is
provide the relevant technical survey of these powerful tools that are
immediately applicable to brain network data.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08578</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have extended deep learning to complex
generation and translation tasks across different data modalities. However,
GANs are notoriously difficult to train: Mode collapse and other instabilities
in the training process often degrade the quality of the generated results,
such as images. This paper presents a new technique called TaylorGAN for
improving GANs by discovering customized loss functions for each of its two
networks. The loss functions are parameterized as Taylor expansions and
optimized through multiobjective evolution. On an image-to-image translation
benchmark task, this approach qualitatively improves generated image quality
and quantitatively improves two independent GAN performance metrics. It
therefore forms a promising approach for applying GANs to more challenging
tasks in the future.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Applications of nonlinear control to a whole-brain network of FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators. (arXiv:2102.08524v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08524</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We apply the framework of optimal nonlinear control to steer the dynamics of
a whole-brain network of FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators. Its nodes correspond to
the cortical areas of an atlas-based segmentation of the human cerebral cortex,
and the inter-node coupling strengths are derived from Diffusion Tensor Imaging
data of the connectome of the human brain. Nodes are coupled using an additive
scheme without delays and are driven by background inputs with fixed mean and
additive Gaussian noise. Optimal control inputs to nodes are determined by
minimizing a cost functional that penalizes the deviations from a desired
network dynamic, the control energy, and spatially non-sparse control inputs.
Using the strength of the background input and the overall coupling strength as
order parameters, the network's state-space decomposes into regions of low and
high activity fixed points separated by a high amplitude limit cycle all of
which qualitatively correspond to the states of an isolated network node. Along
the borders, however, additional limit cycles, asynchronous states and
multistability can be observed. Optimal control is applied to several
state-switching and network synchronization tasks, and the results are compared
to controllability measures from linear control theory for the same connectome.
We find that intuitions from the latter about the roles of nodes in steering
the network dynamics, which are solely based on connectome features, do not
generally carry over to nonlinear systems, as had been previously implied.
Instead, the role of nodes under optimal nonlinear control critically depends
on the specified task and the system's location in state space. Our results
shed new light on the controllability of brain network states and may serve as
an inspiration for the design of new paradigms for non-invasive brain
stimulation.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08475</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A variety of methods have been applied to the architectural configuration and
learning or training of artificial deep neural networks (DNN). These methods
play a crucial role in the success or failure of the DNN for most problems and
applications. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are gaining momentum as a
computationally feasible method for the automated optimisation of DNNs.
Neuroevolution is a term which describes these processes of automated
configuration and training of DNNs using EAs. However, the automatic design
and/or training of these modern neural networks through evolutionary algorithms
is computanalli expensive. Kimura's neutral theory of molecular evolution
states that the majority of evolutionary changes at molecular level are the
result of random fixation of selectively neutral mutations. A mutation from one
gene to another is neutral if it does not affect the phenotype. This work
discusses how neutrality, given certain conditions, can help to speed up the
training/design of deep neural networks.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Finding the Gap: Neuromorphic Motion Vision in Cluttered Environments. (arXiv:2102.08417v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08417</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many animals meander in environments and avoid collisions. How the underlying
neuronal machinery can yield robust behaviour in a variety of environments
remains unclear. In the fly brain, motion-sensitive neurons indicate the
presence of nearby objects and directional cues are integrated within an area
known as the central complex. Such neuronal machinery, in contrast with the
traditional stream-based approach to signal processing, uses an event-based
approach, with events occurring when changes are sensed by the animal. Contrary
to von Neumann computing architectures, event-based neuromorphic hardware is
designed to process information in an asynchronous and distributed manner.
Inspired by the fly brain, we model, for the first time, a neuromorphic
closed-loop system mimicking essential behaviours observed in flying insects,
such as meandering in clutter and gap crossing, which are highly relevant for
autonomous vehicles. We implemented our system both in software and on
neuromorphic hardware. While moving through an environment, our agent perceives
changes in its surroundings and uses this information for collision avoidance.
The agent's manoeuvres result from a closed action-perception loop implementing
probabilistic decision-making processes. This loop-closure is thought to have
driven the development of neural circuitry in biological agents since the
Cambrian explosion. In the fundamental quest to understand neural computation
in artificial agents, we come closer to understanding and modelling biological
intelligence by closing the loop also in neuromorphic systems. As a closed-loop
system, our system deepens our understanding of processing in neural networks
and computations in biological and artificial systems. With these
investigations, we aim to set the foundations for neuromorphic intelligence in
the future, moving towards leveraging the full potential of neuromorphic
systems.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07764</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spatial memory, or the ability to remember and recall specific locations and
objects, is central to autonomous agents' ability to carry out tasks in real
environments. However, most existing artificial memory modules are not very
adept at storing spatial information. We propose a parameter-free module,
Egospheric Spatial Memory (ESM), which encodes the memory in an ego-sphere
around the agent, enabling expressive 3D representations. ESM can be trained
end-to-end via either imitation or reinforcement learning, and improves both
training efficiency and final performance against other memory baselines on
both drone and manipulator visuomotor control tasks. The explicit egocentric
geometry also enables us to seamlessly combine the learned controller with
other non-learned modalities, such as local obstacle avoidance. We further show
applications to semantic segmentation on the ScanNet dataset, where ESM
naturally combines image-level and map-level inference modalities. Through our
broad set of experiments, we show that ESM provides a general computation graph
for embodied spatial reasoning, and the module forms a bridge between real-time
mapping systems and differentiable memory architectures. Implementation at:

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02886</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We introduce Ivy, a templated Deep Learning (DL) framework which abstracts
existing DL frameworks such that their core functions all exhibit consistent
call signatures, syntax and input-output behaviour. Ivy allows high-level
framework-agnostic functions to be implemented through the use of framework
templates. The framework templates act as placeholders for the specific
framework at development time, which are then determined at runtime. The
portability of Ivy functions enables their use in projects of any supported
framework. Ivy currently supports TensorFlow, PyTorch, MXNet, Jax and NumPy.
Alongside Ivy, we release four pure-Ivy libraries for mechanics, 3D vision,
robotics, and differentiable environments. Through our evaluations, we show
that Ivy can significantly reduce lines of code with a runtime overhead of less
than 1% in most cases. We welcome developers to join the Ivy community by
writing their own functions, layers and libraries in Ivy, maximizing their
audience and helping to accelerate DL research through the creation of lifelong
inter-framework codebases. More information can be found at https://ivy-dl.org.

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Auditory neural impairment is a key clinical feature of Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA). We aimed to characterize the phenotypical spectrum of the auditory impairment in FRDA in order to facilitate early identification and timely management of auditory impairment in FRDA patients and to explore the relationship between the severity of auditory impairment with genetic variables (the expansion size of GAA trinucleotide repeats, GAA1 and GAA2), when controlled for variables such as disease duration, severity of the disease and cognitive status. Twenty-seven patients with genetically confirmed FRDA underwent baseline audiological assessment (pure-tone audiometry, otoacoustic emissions, auditory brainstem response). Twenty of these patients had additional psychophysical auditory processing evaluation including an auditory temporal processing test (gaps in noise test) and a binaural speech perception test that assesses spatial processing (Listening in Spatialized Noise-Sentences Test). Auditory spatial and auditory temporal processing ability were significantly associated with the repeat length of GAA1. Patients with GAA1 greater than 500 repeats had more severe auditory temporal and spatial processing deficits, leading to poorer speech perception. Furthermore, the spatial processing ability was strongly correlated with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate an association between genotype and auditory spatial processing phenotype in patients with FRDA. Auditory temporal processing, neural sound conduction, spatial processing and speech perception were more severely affected in patients with GAA1 greater than 500 repeats. The results of our study may indicate that auditory deprivation plays a role in the development of mild cognitive impairment in FRDA patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We aimed to characterize the central positional nystagmus (CPN) observed in lesions involving the inferior cerebellar peduncle (ICP). We analyzed the clinical and neurotologic findings in six patients with an isolated unilateral ICP infarction that had been diagnosed at a university hospital in South Korea from 2003 to 2019. Patients usually presented with acute vestibular syndrome in isolation (4/6, 67%). Ipsilesional spontaneous nystagmus was observed in five while supine (5/6, 83%). Four (4/6, 67%) patients showed CPN which included apogeotropic (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 3) or geotropic (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 1) during head turning to either side while supine, and vertical nystagmus during straight-head hanging, Dix-Hallpike maneuvers, or up-righting (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 3). Four patients showed contraversive ocular tilt reaction or tilt of the subjective visual vertical. Bedside and video head-impulse tests were normal in all patients. CPN is a usual finding in ICP lesions, and may be ascribed to damage of the fibers running from the nodulus/uvula onto the vestibular nucleus via the ICP.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The objective of this study is to analyze the differential protein expression profile in cerebral cortex of rats with middle cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (MCAO/R), explore the brain damage mechanism of MCAO/R at protein level, and provide experimental foundation for searching specific marker proteins of MCAO/R. Rat model of MCAO/R was established by modified suture-occluded method, and the model was evaluated by the results of brain 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) and hematoxylin–eosin (HE) staining. Cerebral cortex of rats from sham-operated group (Sham) and MCAO/R groups was used for FASP enzymatic hydrolysis, i-TRAQ quantitative labeling, and reverse-phase liquid chromatography purification and separation. Orbitrap Q Exactive mass spectrometry was used for qualitative and quantitative analyses of total differential protein expression profiles. MCAO/R rats had obvious cerebral infarction lesions, and the relative surface area of cerebral infarction was significantly different compared with sham rats, suggesting that MCAO/R rat model was successfully prepared. There were 199 significant difference proteins (MCAO/R vs Sham, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05, |fold change|&amp;gt; 1.2), including 104 up-regulated proteins and 95 down-regulated proteins. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that the up-regulated proteins were mainly concentrated in the biological processes of positive regulation of NF-κB transcription and I-κB kinase-NF-κB, etc. Down-regulated proteins were mainly concentrated in long-term synaptic potentiation, cellular response to DNA damage stimulus, etc. KEGG pathway analysis showed that the pathway involved in differential proteins includes oxidative phosphorylation, metabolic pathway, and Ras signaling pathway. Network analysis of differential proteins showed that Alb, ndufb5, ndufs7, ApoB, Cdc42, Ndufa3, Igf1r, P4hb, Mbp, Gc, Nme1, Akt2, and other proteins may play an important role in regulating oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammatory response in MCAO/R. Quantitative proteomics based on i-TRAQ labeling reveals the effect of inflammation and apoptosis in brain damage mechanism of MCAO/R. Besides, this research provide some experimental foundation for search and determination of potential therapeutic targets of MCAO/R.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Repetitive Peripheral Magnetic Stimulation of Wrist Extensors Enhances Cortical Excitability and Motor Performance in Healthy Individuals</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.632716</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation (rPMS) may improve motor function following central nervous system lesions, but the optimal parameters of rPMS to induce neural plasticity and mechanisms underlying its action remain unclear. We examined the effects of rPMS over wrist extensor muscles on neural plasticity and motor performance in 26 healthy volunteers. In separate experiments, the effects of rPMS on motor evoked potentials (MEPs), short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), intracortical facilitation (ICF), direct motor response (M-wave), Hoffmann-reflex, and ballistic wrist extension movements were assessed before and after rPMS. First, to examine the effects of stimulus frequency, rPMS was applied at 50, 25, and 10 Hz by setting a fixed total number of stimuli. A significant increase in MEPs of wrist extensors was observed following 50 and 25 Hz rPMS, but not 10 Hz rPMS. Next, we examined the time required to induce plasticity by increasing the number of stimuli, and found that at least 15 min of 50 and 25 Hz rPMS was required. Based on these parameters, lasting effects were evaluated following 15 min of 50 or 25 Hz rPMS. A significant increase in MEP was observed up to 60 min following 50 and 25 Hz rPMS; similarly, an attenuation of SICI and enhancement of ICF were also observed. The maximal M-wave and Hoffmann-reflex did not change, suggesting that the increase in MEP was due to plastic changes at the motor cortex. This was accompanied by increasing force and electromyograms during wrist ballistic extension movements following 50 and 25 Hz rPMS. These findings suggest that 15 min of rPMS with 25 Hz or more induces an increase in cortical excitability of the relevant area rather than altering the excitability of spinal circuits, and has the potential to improve motor output.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Systematic Review: Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) of Brain Iron Profile in Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.618435</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Iron has been increasingly implicated in the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases. In the past decade, development of the new magnetic resonance imaging technique, quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), has enabled for the more comprehensive investigation of iron distribution in the brain. The aim of this systematic review was to provide a synthesis of the findings from existing QSM studies in neurodegenerative diseases. We identified 80 records by searching MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and PsycInfo databases. The disorders investigated in these studies included Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Wilson's disease, Huntington's disease, Friedreich's ataxia, spinocerebellar ataxia, Fabry disease, myotonic dystrophy, pantothenate-kinase-associated neurodegeneration, and mitochondrial membrane protein-associated neurodegeneration. As a general pattern, QSM revealed increased magnetic susceptibility (suggestive of increased iron content) in the brain regions associated with the pathology of each disorder, such as the amygdala and caudate nucleus in Alzheimer's disease, the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease, motor cortex in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, basal ganglia in Huntington's disease, and cerebellar dentate nucleus in Friedreich's ataxia. Furthermore, the increased magnetic susceptibility correlated with disease duration and severity of clinical features in some disorders. Although the number of studies is still limited in most of the neurodegenerative diseases, the existing evidence suggests that QSM can be a promising tool in the investigation of neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Optimal Approach for Signal Detection in Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials in Humans Using Single-Channel EEG and Stereoscopic Stimuli</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.600543</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In EEG studies, one of the most common ways to detect a weak periodic signal in the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) is spectral evaluation, a process that detects peaks of power present at notable temporal frequencies. However, the presence of noise decreases the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which in turn lowers the probability of successful detection of these spectral peaks. In this paper, using a single EEG channel, we compare the detection performance of four different metrics to analyse the SSVEP: two metrics that use spectral power density, and two other metrics that use phase coherency. We employ these metrics find weak signals with a known temporal frequency hidden in the SSVEP, using both simulation and real data from a stereoscopic apparent depth movement perception task. We demonstrate that out of these metrics, the phase coherency analysis is the most sensitive way to find weak signals in the SSVEP, provided that the phase information of the stimulus eliciting the SSVEP is preserved.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: A Novel SOD1 Intermediate Oligomer, Role of Free Thiols and Disulfide Exchange</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.619279</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Wild-type human SOD1 forms a highly conserved intra-molecular disulfide bond between C57-C146, and in its native state is greatly stabilized by binding one copper and one zinc atom per monomer rendering the protein dimeric. Loss of copper extinguishes dismutase activity and destabilizes the protein, increasing accessibility of the disulfide with monomerization accompanying disulfide reduction. A further pair of free thiols exist at C6 and C111 distant from metal binding sites, raising the question of their function. Here we investigate their role in misfolding of SOD1 along a pathway that leads to formation of amyloid fibrils. We present the seeding reaction of a mutant SOD1 lacking free sulfhydryl groups (AS-SOD1) to exclude variables caused by these free cysteines. Completely reduced fibril seeds decreasing the kinetic barrier to cleave the highly conserved intramolecular disulfide bond, and accelerating SOD1 reduction and initiation of fibrillation. Presence or absence of the pair of free thiols affects kinetics of fibrillation. Previously, we showed full maturation with both Cu and Zn prevents this behavior while lack of Cu renders sensitivity to fibrillation, with presence of the native disulfide bond modulating this propensity much more strongly than presence of Zn or dimerization. Here we further investigate the role of reduction of the native C57-C146 disulfide bond in fibrillation of wild-type hSOD1, firstly through removal of free thiols by paired mutations C6A, C111S (AS-SOD1), and secondly in seeded fibrillation reactions modulated by reductant tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP). Fibrillation of AS-SOD1 was dependent upon disulfide reduction and showed classic lag and exponential growth phases compared with wild-type hSOD1 whose fibrillation trajectories were typically somewhat perturbed. Electron microscopy showed that AS-SOD1 formed classic fibrils while wild-type fibrillation reactions showed the presence of smaller “sausage-like” oligomers in addition to fibrils, highlighting the potential for mixed disulfides involving C6/C111 to disrupt efficient fibrillation. Seeding by addition of sonicated fibrils lowered the TCEP concentration needed for fibrillation in both wild-type and AS-SOD1 providing evidence for template-driven structural disturbance that elevated susceptibility to reduction and thus propensity to fibrillate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Constructing Brain Connectivity Model Using Causal Network Reconstruction Approach</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.619557</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Studying brain function is a challenging task. In the past, we could only study brain anatomical structures post-mortem, or infer brain functions from clinical data of patients with a brain injury. Nowadays technology, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), enable non-invasive brain activity observation. Several approaches have been proposed to interpret brain activity data. The brain connectivity model is a graphical tool that represents the interaction between brain regions, during certain states. It depicts how a brain region cause changes to other parts of the brain, which can be implied as information flow. This model can be used to help interpret how the brain works. There are several mathematical frameworks that can be used to infer the connectivity model from brain activity signals. Granger causality is one such approach and is one of the first that has been applied to brain activity data. However, due to the concept of the framework, such as the use of pairwise correlation, combined with the limitation of brain activity data such as low temporal resolution in case of fMRI signal, makes the interpretation of the connectivity difficult. We therefore propose the application of the Tigramite causal discovery framework on fMRI data. The Tigramite framework uses measures such as causal effect to analyze causal relations in the system. This enables the framework to identify both direct and indirect pathways or connectivities. In this paper, we applied the framework to the Human Connectome Project motor task-fMRI dataset. We then present the results and discuss how the framework improves interpretability of the connectivity model. We hope that this framework will help us understand more complex brain functions such as memory, consciousness, or the resting-state of the brain, in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Comparing the Electrophysiology and Morphology of Human and Mouse Layer 2/3 Pyramidal Neurons With Bayesian Networks</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.580873</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Pyramidal neurons are the most common neurons in the cerebral cortex. Understanding how they differ between species is a key challenge in neuroscience. We compared human temporal cortex and mouse visual cortex pyramidal neurons from the Allen Cell Types Database in terms of their electrophysiology and dendritic morphology. We found that, among other differences, human pyramidal neurons had a higher action potential threshold voltage, a lower input resistance, and larger dendritic arbors. We learned Gaussian Bayesian networks from the data in order to identify correlations and conditional independencies between the variables and compare them between the species. We found strong correlations between electrophysiological and morphological variables in both species. In human cells, electrophysiological variables were correlated even with morphological variables that are not directly related to dendritic arbor size or diameter, such as mean bifurcation angle and mean branch tortuosity. Cortical depth was correlated with both electrophysiological and morphological variables in both species, and its effect on electrophysiology could not be explained in terms of the morphological variables. For some variables, the effect of cortical depth was opposite in the two species. Overall, the correlations among the variables differed strikingly between human and mouse neurons. Besides identifying correlations and conditional independencies, the learned Bayesian networks might be useful for probabilistic reasoning regarding the morphology and electrophysiology of pyramidal neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Intraoperative Brain Mapping by Cortico-Cortical Evoked Potential</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.635453</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;To preserve postoperative brain function, it is important for neurosurgeons to fully understand the brain's structure, vasculature, and function. Intraoperative high-frequency electrical stimulation during awake craniotomy is the gold standard for mapping the function of the cortices and white matter; however, this method can only map the “focal” functions and cannot monitor large-scale cortical networks in real-time. Recently, an in vivo electrophysiological method using cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs) induced by single-pulse electrical cortical stimulation has been developed in an extraoperative setting. By using the CCEP connectivity pattern intraoperatively, mapping and real-time monitoring of the dorsal language pathway is available. This intraoperative CCEP method also allows for mapping of the frontal aslant tract, another language pathway, and detection of connectivity between the primary and supplementary motor areas in the frontal lobe network. Intraoperative CCEP mapping has also demonstrated connectivity between the frontal and temporal lobes, likely via the ventral language pathway. Establishing intraoperative electrophysiological monitoring is clinically useful for preserving brain function, even under general anesthesia. This CCEP technique demonstrates potential clinical applications for mapping and monitoring large-scale cortical networks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neural Signatures of Performance Feedback in the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT): An ERP Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.630468</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Research on cognitive control has sparked increasing interest in recent years, as it is an important prerequisite for goal oriented human behavior. The paced auditory serial addition task (PASAT) has been used to test and train cognitive control functions. This adaptive, challenging task includes continuous performance feedback. Therefore, additional cognitive control capacities are required to process this information along with the already high task-load. The underlying neural mechanisms, however, are still unclear. To explore the neural signatures of the PASAT and particularly the processing of distractive feedback information, feedback locked event-related potentials were derived from 24 healthy participants during an adaptive 2-back version of the PASAT. Larger neural activation after negative feedback was found for feedback related negativity (FRN), P300, and late positive potential (LPP). In early stages of feedback processing (i.e., FRN), a larger difference between positive and negative feedback responses was associated with poorer overall performance. This association was inverted in later stages (i.e., P300 and LPP). Together, our findings indicate stage-dependent associations between neural activation after negative information and cognitive functioning. Conceivably, increased early responses to negative feedback signify distraction, whereas higher activity at later stages reflects cognitive control processes to preserve ongoing performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Characterizing the Action-Observation Network Through Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy: A Review</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.627983</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a neuroimaging technique that has undergone tremendous growth over the last decade due to methodological advantages over other measures of brain activation. The action-observation network (AON), a system of brain structures proposed to have “mirroring” abilities (e.g., active when an individual completes an action or when they observe another complete that action), has been studied in humans through neural measures such as fMRI and electroencephalogram (EEG); however, limitations of these methods are problematic for AON paradigms. For this reason, fNIRS is proposed as a solution to investigating the AON in humans. The present review article briefly summarizes previous neural findings in the AON and examines the state of AON research using fNIRS in adults. A total of 14 fNIRS articles are discussed, paying particular attention to methodological choices and considerations while summarizing the general findings to aid in developing better protocols to study the AON through fNIRS. Additionally, future directions of this work are discussed, specifically in relation to researching AON development and potential multimodal imaging applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neuronal Actions of Transspinal Stimulation on Locomotor Networks and Reflex Excitability During Walking in Humans With and Without Spinal Cord Injury</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.620414</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This study investigated the neuromodulatory effects of transspinal stimulation on soleus H-reflex excitability and electromyographic (EMG) activity during stepping in humans with and without spinal cord injury (SCI). Thirteen able-bodied adults and 5 individuals with SCI participated in the study. EMG activity from both legs was determined for steps without, during, and after a single-pulse or pulse train transspinal stimulation delivered during stepping randomly at different phases of the step cycle. The soleus H-reflex was recorded in both subject groups under control conditions and following single-pulse transspinal stimulation at an individualized exactly similar positive and negative conditioning-test interval. The EMG activity was decreased in both subject groups at the steps during transspinal stimulation, while intralimb and interlimb coordination were altered only in SCI subjects. At the steps immediately after transspinal stimulation, the physiological phase-dependent EMG modulation pattern remained unaffected in able-bodied subjects. The conditioned soleus H-reflex was depressed throughout the step cycle in both subject groups. Transspinal stimulation modulated depolarization of motoneurons over multiple segments, limb coordination, and soleus H-reflex excitability during assisted stepping. The soleus H-reflex depression may be the result of complex spinal inhibitory interneuronal circuits activated by transspinal stimulation and collision between orthodromic and antidromic volleys in the peripheral mixed nerve. The soleus H-reflex depression by transspinal stimulation suggests a potential application for normalization of spinal reflex excitability after SCI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Asymmetries in Accessing Vowel Representations Are Driven by Phonological and Acoustic Properties: Neural and Behavioral Evidence From Natural German Minimal Pairs</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.612345</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In vowel discrimination, commonly found discrimination patterns are directional asymmetries where discrimination is faster (or easier) if differing vowels are presented in a certain sequence compared to the reversed sequence. Different models of speech sound processing try to account for these asymmetries based on either phonetic or phonological properties. In this study, we tested and compared two of those often-discussed models, namely the Featurally Underspecified Lexicon (FUL) model (Lahiri and Reetz, 2002) and the Natural Referent Vowel (NRV) framework (Polka and Bohn, 2011). While most studies presented isolated vowels, we investigated a large stimulus set of German vowels in a more naturalistic setting within minimal pairs. We conducted an mismatch negativity (MMN) study in a passive and a reaction time study in an active oddball paradigm. In both data sets, we found directional asymmetries that can be explained by either phonological or phonetic theories. While behaviorally, the vowel discrimination was based on phonological properties, both tested models failed to explain the found neural patterns comprehensively. Therefore, we additionally examined the influence of a variety of articulatory, acoustical, and lexical factors (e.g., formant structure, intensity, duration, and frequency of occurrence) but also the influence of factors beyond the well-known (perceived loudness of vowels, degree of openness) in depth via multiple regression analyses. The analyses revealed that the perceptual factor of perceived loudness has a greater impact than considered in the literature and should be taken stronger into consideration when analyzing preattentive natural vowel processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.572339</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Multiple mechanisms contribute to the generation, propagation, and coordination of the rhythmic patterns necessary for locomotion in Caenorhabditis elegans. Current experiments have focused on two possibilities: pacemaker neurons and stretch-receptor feedback. Here, we focus on whether it is possible that a chain of multiple network rhythmic pattern generators in the ventral nerve cord also contribute to locomotion. We use a simulation model to search for parameters of the anatomically constrained ventral nerve cord circuit that, when embodied and situated, can drive forward locomotion on agar, in the absence of pacemaker neurons or stretch-receptor feedback. Systematic exploration of the space of possible solutions reveals that there are multiple configurations that result in locomotion that is consistent with certain aspects of the kinematics of worm locomotion on agar. Analysis of the best solutions reveals that gap junctions between different classes of motorneurons in the ventral nerve cord can play key roles in coordinating the multiple rhythmic pattern generators.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Nicotine Enhances Amplitude and Consistency of Timing of Responses to Acoustic Trains in A1</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.597401</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Systemic nicotine enhances neural processing in primary auditory cortex (A1) as determined using tone-evoked, current-source density (CSD) measurements. For example, nicotine enhances the characteristic frequency (CF)-evoked current sink in layer 4 of A1, increasing amplitude and decreasing latency. However, since presenting auditory stimuli within a stream of stimuli increases the complexity of response dynamics, we sought to determine the effects of nicotine on CSD responses to trains of CF stimuli (one-second trains at 2–40 Hz; each train repeated 25 times). CSD recordings were obtained using a 16-channel multiprobe inserted in A1 of urethane/xylazine-anesthetized mice, and analysis focused on two current sinks in the middle (layer 4) and deep (layers 5/6) layers. CF trains produced adaptation of the layer 4 response that was weak at 2 Hz, stronger at 5–10 Hz and complete at 20–40 Hz. In contrast, the layer 5/6 current sink exhibited less adaptation at 2–10 Hz, and simultaneously recorded auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) showed no adaptation even at 40 Hz. Systemic nicotine (2.1 mg/kg) enhanced layer 4 responses throughout the one-second stimulus train at rates ≤10 Hz. Nicotine enhanced both response amplitude within each train and the consistency of response timing across 25 trials. Nicotine did not alter the degree of adaptation over one-second trials, but its effect to increase amplitudes revealed a novel, slower form of adaptation that developed over multiple trials. Nicotine did not affect responses that were fully adapted (20–40 Hz trains), nor did nicotine affect any aspect of the layer 5/6 current sink or ABRs. The overall effect of nicotine in layer 4 was to enhance all responses within each train, to emphasize earlier trials across multiple trials, and to improve the consistency of timing across all trials. These effects may improve processing of complex acoustic streams, including speech, that contain information in the 2–10 Hz range.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

During COVID-19 pathology, the central nervous system (CNS) is possibly affected by direct severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) invasion, exaggerated systemic inflammatory responses, or hypoxia. Psychosocial stress imposed by the pandemic further affects the CNS of COVID-19 patients, but also the non-infected population, potentially contributing to the emergence or exacerbation of various neurological or mental health disorders. Microglia are central players of the CNS homeostasis maintenance and inflammatory response that exert their crucial functions in coordination with other CNS cells. During homeostatic challenges to the brain parenchyma, microglia modify their density, morphology, and molecular signature, resulting in the adjustment of their functions. In this review, we discuss how microglia may be involved in the neuroprotective and neurotoxic responses against CNS insults deriving from COVID-19. We examine how these responses may explain, at least partially, the neurological and psychiatric manifestations reported in COVID-19 patients and the general population. Furthermore, we consider how microglia might contribute to increased CNS vulnerability in certain groups, such as aged individuals and people with pre-existing conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein 1 (LRP1) as a Novel Regulator of Early Astroglial Differentiation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.642521</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type within the central nervous system (CNS) with various functions. Furthermore, astrocytes show a regional and developmental heterogeneity traceable with specific markers. In this study, the influence of the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) on astrocytic maturation within the hippocampus was analyzed during development. Previous studies mostly focused on the involvement of LRP1 in the neuronal compartment, where the deletion caused hyperactivity and motor dysfunctions in knockout animals. However, the influence of LRP1 on glia cells is less intensively investigated. Therefore, we used a newly generated mouse model, where LRP1 is specifically deleted from GLAST-positive astrocytes co-localized with the expression of the reporter tdTomato to visualize recombination and knockout events in vivo. The influence of LRP1 on the maturation of hippocampal astrocytes was assessed with immunohistochemical stainings against stage-specific markers as well as on mRNA level with RT-PCR analysis. The examination revealed that the knockout induction caused a significantly decreased number of mature astrocytes at an early developmental timepoint compared to control animals. Additionally, the delayed maturation of astrocytes also caused a reduced activity of neurons within the hippocampus. As previous studies showed that the glial specification and maturation of astrocytes is dependent on the signaling cascades Ras/Raf/MEK/Erk and PI3K/Akt, the phosphorylation of the signaling molecules Erk1/2 and Akt was analyzed. The hippocampal tissue of LRP1-deficient animals at P21 showed a significantly decreased amount of activated Erk in comparison to control tissue leading to the conclusion that the activation of this signaling cascade is dependent on LRP1 in astrocytes, which in turn is necessary for proper maturation of astrocytes. Our results showed that the deletion of LRP1 at an early developmental timepoint caused a delayed maturation of astrocytes in the hippocampus based on an altered activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/Erk signaling pathway. However, with ongoing development these effects were compensated and the number of mature astrocytes was comparable as well as the activity of neurons. Therefore, LRP1 acts as an early regulator of the differentiation and maturation of astrocytes within the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Indoleamine-2,3-Dioxygenase 1 Deficiency Suppresses Seizures in Epilepsy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.638854</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is the initial and rate-limiting enzyme in the metabolism of tryptophan (TRP) to kynurenine (KYN). IDO1-dependent neurotoxic KYN metabolism plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative disorders. However, the function of IDO1 in epilepsy is still unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: In this study, we investigated whether IDO1 deficiency could affect epilepsy in a lithium-pilocarpine-induced model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Patients with epilepsy and controls were enrolled. Male C57BL/6 mice and IDO1 knockout (KO, IDO1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;) mice were subjected to intraperitoneal injection of lithium and pilocarpine to induce epilepsy. The levels of IDO1 and concentrations of TRP and KYN in patients with epilepsy and epileptic mice were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), respectively. Then, behavioral phenotypes related to epileptic seizures and neuronal damage were compared between KO and wild-type (WT) mice with lithium-pilocarpine-induced epilepsy. To explore the underlying pathways involved in the effects of IDO1 deficiency, the concentrations of kynurenic acid (KYNA) and quinolinic acid (QUIN), glial cell activation, the levels of major pro-inflammatory cytokines, and antioxidant enzyme activity were measured by LC-MS, immunohistochemistry, and ELISA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In this study, IDO1 levels and the KYN/TRP ratio in the sera and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were increased in patients with epilepsy. Also, IDO1 levels, the KYN/TRP ratio, and the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the sera and hippocampi were increased in mice during the acute phase and chronic phase after status epilepticus (SE). Furthermore, IDO1 was localized in microglial cells in epileptic mice. IDO1 deficiency delayed SE onset and attenuated the frequency, duration, and severity of spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRSs). Moreover, IDO1 deficiency improved neuronal survival. Additionally, IDO1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; epileptic mice showed progressive declines in QUIN production, glial cell activation and pro-inflammatory cytokines levels, and enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: IDO1 deletion suppressed seizures and alleviated neuronal damage by reducing the IDO1-dependent production of neurotoxic metabolites, which finally inhibited glial cell activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production and improved antioxidant enzyme activity. Our study demonstrates that IDO1 may be involved in the pathogenesis of epilepsy and has the potential to be a therapeutic target for epilepsy treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Endothelial Progenitor Cell-Derived Microvesicles Promote Angiogenesis in Rat Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cells In vitro</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.638351</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) are a major component of the blood-brain barrier that maintains brain homeostasis. Preserving and restoring the normal biological functions of BMECs can reverse or reduce brain injury. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) may promote brain vascular remodeling and restore normal endothelial function. As a novel vehicle for cell-cell communication, microvesicles (MVs) have varied biological functions. The present study investigated the biological effects of EPC-derived MVs (EPC-MVs) on BMECs in vitro. We isolated MVs from the supernatant of EPCs in a serum-depleted medium. BMECs were cultured alone or in the presence of EPC-MVs. BMEC viability and proliferation were evaluated with the Cell Counting Kit-8 and by flow cytometry, and the proangiogenic effect of EPC-MVs on BMECs was assessed with the transwell migration, wound healing, and tube formation assays. Our results showed that EPC-derived MVs labeled with DiI were internalized by cultured BMECs; this enhanced BMEC viability and promoted their proliferation. EPC-MVs also stimulated migration and tube formation in BMECs. These results demonstrate that EPC-derived MVs exert a proangiogenic effect on BMECs, which has potential applications in cell-free therapy for brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Emerging Perspectives on Dipeptide Repeat Proteins in C9ORF72 ALS/FTD</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.637548</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a hexanucleotide expansion in the chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 gene (C9ORF72). This hexanucleotide expansion consists of GGGGCC (G&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) repeats that have been implicated to lead to three main modes of disease pathology: loss of function of the C9ORF72 protein, the generation of RNA foci, and the production of dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs) through repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation. Five different DPRs are currently known to be formed: glycine–alanine (GA) and glycine–arginine (GR) from the sense strand, proline–alanine (PA), and proline–arginine (PR) from the antisense strand, and glycine–proline (GP) from both strands. The exact contribution of each DPR to disease pathology is currently under intense scrutiny and is still poorly understood. However, recent advances in both neuropathological and cellular studies have provided us with clues enabling us to better understand the effect of individual DPRs on disease pathogenesis. In this review, we compile the current knowledge of specific DPR involvement on disease development and highlight recent advances, such as the impact of arginine-rich DPRs on nucleolar protein quality control, the correlation of poly-GR with neurodegeneration, and the possible involvement of chimeric DPR species. Further, we discuss recent findings regarding the mechanisms of RAN translation, its modulators, and other promising therapeutic options.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Human ApoE4 Variant Reduces Functional Recovery and Neuronal Sprouting After Incomplete Spinal Cord Injury in Male Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.626192</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating form of neurotrauma. Patients who carry one or two apolipoprotein E (ApoE)4 alleles show worse functional outcomes and longer hospital stays after SCI, but the cellular and molecular underpinnings for this genetic link remain poorly understood. Thus, there is a great need to generate animal models to accurately replicate the genetic determinants of outcomes after SCI to spur development of treatments that improve physical function. Here, we examined outcomes after a moderate contusion SCI of transgenic mice expressing human ApoE3 or ApoE4. ApoE4 mice have worse locomotor function and coordination after SCI. Histological examination revealed greater glial staining in ApoE4 mice after SCI associated with reduced levels of neuronal sprouting markers. Bulk RNA sequencing revealed that subcellular processes (SCPs), such as extracellular matrix organization and inflammatory responses, were highly ranked among upregulated genes at 7 days after SCI in ApoE4 variants. Conversely, SCPs related to neuronal action potential and neuron projection development were increased in ApoE3 mice at 21 days. In summary, our results reveal a clinically relevant SCI mouse model that recapitulates the influence of ApoE genotypes on post SCI function in individuals who carry these alleles and suggest that the mechanisms underlying worse recovery for ApoE4 animals involve glial activation and loss of sprouting and synaptic activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Chronic and Acute Manipulation of Cortical Glutamate Transmission Induces Structural and Synaptic Changes in Co-cultured Striatal Neurons</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.569031</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the prenatal topographic development of sensory cortices, striatal circuit organization is slow and requires the functional maturation of cortical and thalamic excitatory inputs throughout the first postnatal month. While mechanisms regulating synapse development and plasticity are quite well described at excitatory synapses of glutamatergic neurons in the neocortex, comparatively little is known of how this translates to glutamate synapses onto GABAergic neurons in the striatum. Here we investigate excitatory striatal synapse plasticity in an in vitro system, where glutamate can be studied in isolation from dopamine and other neuromodulators. We examined pre-and post-synaptic structural and functional plasticity in GABAergic striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs), co-cultured with glutamatergic cortical neurons. After synapse formation, medium-term (24 h) TTX silencing increased the density of filopodia, and modestly decreased dendritic spine density, when assayed at 21 days in vitro (DIV). Spine reductions appeared to require residual spontaneous activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors. Conversely, chronic (14 days) TTX silencing markedly reduced spine density without any observed increase in filopodia density. Time-dependent, biphasic changes to the presynaptic marker Synapsin-1 were also observed, independent of residual spontaneous activity. Acute silencing (3 h) did not affect presynaptic markers or postsynaptic structures. To induce rapid, activity-dependent plasticity in striatal neurons, a chemical NMDA receptor-dependent “long-term potentiation (LTP)” paradigm was employed. Within 30 min, this increased spine and GluA1 cluster densities, and the percentage of spines containing GluA1 clusters, without altering the presynaptic signal. The results demonstrate that the growth and pruning of dendritic protrusions is an active process, requiring glutamate receptor activity in striatal projection neurons. Furthermore, NMDA receptor activation is sufficient to drive glutamatergic structural plasticity in SPNs, in the absence of dopamine or other neuromodulators.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Emerging Evidence Highlighting the Importance of Redox Dysregulation in the Pathogenesis of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.581950</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The cellular redox state, or balance between cellular oxidation and reduction reactions, serves as a vital antioxidant defence system that is linked to all important cellular activities. Redox regulation is therefore a fundamental cellular process for aerobic organisms. Whilst oxidative stress is well described in neurodegenerative disorders including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), other aspects of redox dysfunction and their contributions to pathophysiology are only just emerging. ALS is a fatal neurodegenerative disease affecting motor neurons, with few useful treatments. Hence there is an urgent need to develop more effective therapeutics in the future. Here, we discuss the increasing evidence for redox dysregulation as an important and primary contributor to ALS pathogenesis, which is associated with multiple disease mechanisms. Understanding the connection between redox homeostasis, proteins that mediate redox regulation, and disease pathophysiology in ALS, may facilitate a better understanding of disease mechanisms, and lead to the design of better therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Immunoreactivity of Vesicular Glutamate Transporter 2 Corresponds to Cytochrome Oxidase-Rich Subcompartments in the Visual Cortex of Squirrel Monkeys</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.629473</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cytochrome oxidase (CO) histochemistry has been used to reveal the cytoarchitecture of the primate brain, including blobs/puffs/patches in the striate cortex (V1), and thick, thin and pale stripes in the middle layer of the secondary visual cortex (V2). It has been suggested that CO activity is coupled with the spiking activity of neurons, implying that neurons in these CO-rich subcompartments are more active than surrounding regions. However, we have discussed possibility that CO histochemistry represents the distribution of thalamo-cortical afferent terminals that generally use vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2) as their main glutamate transporter, and not the activity of cortical neurons. In this study, we systematically compared the labeling patterns observed between CO histochemistry and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for VGLUT2 from the system to microarchitecture levels in the visual cortex of squirrel monkeys. The two staining patterns bore striking similarities at all levels of the visual cortex, including the honeycomb structure of V1 layer 3Bβ (Brodmann's layer 4A), the patchy architecture in the deep layers of V1, the superficial blobs of V1, and the V2 stripes. The microarchitecture was more evident in VGLUT2 IHC, as expected. VGLUT2 protein expression that produced specific IHC labeling is thought to originate from the thalamus since the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and the pulvinar complex both show high expression levels of VGLUT2 mRNA, but cortical neurons do not. These observations support our theory that the subcompartments revealed by CO histochemistry represent the distribution of thalamo-cortical afferent terminals in the primate visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.636653</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transient ischemic brain injury causes massive neuronal death in the hippocampus of both humans and animals. This was accompanied by progressive atrophy of the hippocampus, brain cortex, and white matter lesions. Furthermore, it has been noted that neurodegenerative processes after an episode of ischemia-reperfusion in the brain can continue well-beyond the acute stage. Rarefaction of white matter was significantly increased in animals at 2 years following ischemia. Some rats that survived 2 years after ischemia developed severe brain atrophy with dementia. The profile of post-ischemic brain neurodegeneration shares a commonality with neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, post-ischemic brain injury is associated with the deposition of folding proteins, such as amyloid and tau protein, in the intracellular and extracellular space. Recent studies on post-ischemic brain neurodegeneration have revealed the dysregulation of Alzheimer's disease-associated genes such as amyloid protein precursor, α-secretase, β-secretase, presenilin 1, presenilin 2, and tau protein. The latest data demonstrate that Alzheimer's disease-related proteins and their genes play a key role in the development of post-ischemic brain neurodegeneration with full-blown dementia in disease types such as Alzheimer's. Ongoing interest in the study of brain ischemia has provided evidence showing that ischemia may be involved in the development of the genotype and phenotype of Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that brain ischemia can be considered as a useful model for understanding the mechanisms responsible for the initiation of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Age-Related EEG Power Reductions Cannot Be Explained by Changes of the Conductivity Distribution in the Head Due to Brain Atrophy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.632310</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electroencephalogram (EEG) power reductions in the aging brain have been described by numerous previous studies. However, the underlying mechanism for the observed brain signal power reduction remains unclear. One possible cause for reduced EEG signals in elderly subjects might be the increased distance from the primary neural electrical currents on the cortex to the scalp electrodes as the result of cortical atrophies. While brain shrinkage itself reflects age-related neurological changes, the effects of changes in the distribution of electrical conductivity are often not distinguished from altered neural activity when interpreting EEG power reductions. To address this ambiguity, we employed EEG forward models to investigate whether brain shrinkage is a major factor for the signal attenuation in the aging brain. We simulated brain shrinkage in spherical and realistic brain models and found that changes in the conductor geometry cannot fully account for the EEG power reductions even when the brain was shrunk to unrealistic sizes. Our results quantify the extent of power reductions from brain shrinkage and pave the way for more accurate inferences about deficient neural activity and circuit integrity based on EEG power reductions in the aging population.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.630049</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Prior research has suggested that measurements of brain functioning and performance on dual tasks (tasks which require simultaneous performance) are promising candidate predictors of fall risk among older adults. However, no prior study has investigated whether brain function measurements during dual task performance could improve prediction of fall risks and whether the type of subtasks used in the dual task paradigm affects the strength of the association between fall characteristics and dual task performance. In this study, 31 cognitively normal, community-dwelling older adults provided a self-reported fall profile (number of falls and fear of falling), completed a gait dual task (spell a word backward while walking on a GaitRite mat), and completed a supine dual task (rhythmic finger tapping with one hand while completing the AX continuous performance task (AX-CPT) with the other hand) during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Gait performance, AX-CPT reaction time and accuracy, finger tapping cadence, and brain functioning in finger-tapping-related and AX-CPT-related brain regions all showed declines in the dual task condition compared to the single task condition. Dual-task gait, AX-CPT and finger tapping performance, and brain functioning were all independent predictors of fall profile. No particular measurement domain stood out as being the most strongly associated measure with fall variables. Fall characteristics are determined by multiple factors; brain functioning, motor task, and cognitive task performance in challenging dual-task conditions all contribute to the risk of falling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Voxel-Mirrored Homotopic Connectivity Associated With Change of Cognitive Function in Chronic Pontine Stroke</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.621767</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent neuroimaging studies have shown the possibility of cognitive impairment after pontine stroke. In this study, we aimed to use voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) to investigate changes in the cognitive function in chronic pontine stroke. Functional MRI (fMRI) and behavioral assessments of cognitive function were obtained from 56 patients with chronic pontine ischemic stroke [28 patients with left-sided pontine stroke (LP) and 28 patients with right-sided pontine stroke (RP)] and 35 matched healthy controls (HC). The one-way ANOVA test was performed for the three groups after the VMHC analysis. Results showed that there were significant decreases in the bilateral lingual gyrus (Lingual_L and Lingual_R) and the left precuneus (Precuneus_L) in patients with chronic pontine ischemic stroke compared to HCs. However, in a post-hoc multiple comparison test, this difference remained only between the HC and RP groups. Moreover, we explored the relationship between the decreased z-values in VMHC and the behavior-task scores using a Pearson's correlation test and found that both scores of short-term memory and long-term memory in the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test were positively correlated with z-values of the left lingual gyrus (Lingual_L), the right lingual gyrus (Lingual_R), and the left precuneus (Precuneus_L) in VMHC. Besides that, the z-values of Precuneus_L in VMHC were also negatively correlated with the reaction time for correct responses in the Flanker task and the spatial memory task. In conclusion, first, the lingual gyrus played an important role in verbal memory. Second, the precuneus influenced the working memory, both auditory-verbal memory and visual memory. Third, the right-sided stroke played a greater role in the results of this study. This study provides a basis for further elucidation of the characteristics and mechanisms of cognitive impairment after pontine stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria play a pivotal role in bioenergetics and respiratory functions, which are essential for the numerous biochemical processes underpinning cell viability. Mitochondrial morphology changes rapidly in response to external insults and changes in metabolic status via fission and fusion processes (so-called mitochondrial dynamics) that maintain mitochondrial quality and homeostasis. Damaged mitochondria are removed by a process known as mitophagy, which involves their degradation by a specific autophagosomal pathway. Over the last few years, remarkable efforts have been made to investigate the impact on the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) of various forms of mitochondrial dysfunction, such as excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondrial Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dyshomeostasis, loss of ATP, and defects in mitochondrial dynamics and transport, and mitophagy. Recent research suggests that restoration of mitochondrial function by physical exercise, an antioxidant diet, or therapeutic approaches can delay the onset and slow the progression of AD. In this review, we focus on recent progress that highlights the crucial role of alterations in mitochondrial function and oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of AD, emphasizing a framework of existing and potential therapeutic approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.609588</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: More and more elderly patients are being diagnosed with arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in this global aging society, while the treatment strategy remains controversial among these aging population. This study aimed to clarify the long-term outcomes of elderly AVMs after different management modalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: The authors retrospectively reviewed 71 elderly AVMs (&amp;gt;60 years) in two tertiary neurosurgery centers between 2011 and 2019. Patients were divided into four groups: conservation, microsurgery, embolization, and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). The perioperative complications, short-term and long-term neurological outcomes, obliteration rates, annualized rupture risk, and mortality rates were compared among different management modalities in the ruptured and unruptured subgroups. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was employed to compare the death-free survival rates among different management modalities. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for predictors of long-term unfavorable outcomes (mRS &amp;gt; 2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A total of 71 elderly AVMs were followed up for an average of 4.2 ± 2.3 years. Fifty-four (76.1%) presented with hemorrhage, and the preoperative annualized rupture risk was 9.4%. Among these patients, 21 cases (29.6%) received conservative treatment, 30 (42.3%) underwent microsurgical resection, 13 (18.3%) received embolization, and 7 (9.9%) underwent SRS. In the prognostic comparison, the short-term and long-term neurological outcomes were similar between conservation and intervention both in the ruptured and unruptured subgroups (ruptured: p = 0.096, p = 0.904, respectively; unruptured: p = 0.568, p = 0.306, respectively). In the ruptured subgroup, the intervention cannot reduce long-term mortality (p = 0.654) despite the significant reduction of subsequent hemorrhage than conservation (p = 0.014), and the main cause of death in the intervention group was treatment-related complications (five of seven, 71.4%). In the logistic regression analysis, higher admission mRS score (OR 3.070, 95% CI 1.559–6.043, p = 0.001) was the independent predictor of long-term unfavorable outcomes (mRS&amp;gt;2) in the intervention group, while complete obliteration (OR 0.146, 95% CI 0.026–0.828, p = 0.030) was the protective factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The long-term outcomes of elderly AVMs after different management modalities were similar. Intervention for unruptured elderly AVMs was not recommended. For those ruptured, we should carefully weigh the risk of subsequent hemorrhage and treatment-related complications. Besides, complete obliteration should be pursued once the intervention was initiated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration:http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Ongoing Oscillatory Electrophysiological Alterations in Frail Older Adults: A MEG Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.609043</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: The role of the central nervous system in the pathophysiology of frailty is controversial. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to search for abnormalities in the ongoing oscillatory neural activity of frail individuals without global cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Fifty four older (≥70 years) and cognitively healthy (Mini-Mental State Examination ≥24) participants were classified as robust (0 criterion, n = 34) or frail (≥ 3 criteria, n = 20) following Fried's phenotype. Memory, language, attention, and executive function were assessed through well-validated neuropsychological tests. Every participant underwent a resting-state MEG and a T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scan. We performed MEG power spectral analyses to compare the electrophysiological profiles of frail and robust individuals. We used an ensemble learner to investigate the ability of MEG spectral power to discriminate frail from robust participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We identified increased relative power in the frail group in the mu (p &amp;lt; 0.05) and sensorimotor (p &amp;lt; 0.05) frequencies across right sensorimotor, posterior parietal, and frontal regions. The ensemble learner discriminated frail from robust participants [area under the curve = 0.73 (95% CI = 0.49–0.98)]. Frail individuals performed significantly worse in the Trail Making Test, Digit Span Test (forward), Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure, and Semantic Fluency Test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: Frail individuals without global cognitive impairment showed ongoing oscillatory alterations within brain regions associated with aspects of motor control, jointly to failures in executive function. Our results suggest that some physical manifestations of frailty might partly arise from failures in central structures relevant to sensorimotor and executive processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Healthy Aging Alters the Functional Connectivity of Creative Cognition in the Default Mode Network and Cerebellar Network</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.607988</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Creativity is a higher-order neurocognitive process that produces unusual and unique thoughts. Behavioral and neuroimaging studies of younger adults have revealed that creative performance is the product of dynamic and spontaneous processes involving multiple cognitive functions and interactions between large-scale brain networks, including the default mode network (DMN), fronto-parietal executive control network (ECN), and salience network (SN). In this resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) study, group independent component analysis (group-ICA) and resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) measures were applied to examine whether and how various functional connected networks of the creative brain, particularly the default-executive and cerebro-cerebellar networks, are altered with advancing age. The group-ICA approach identified 11 major brain networks across age groups that reflected age-invariant resting-state networks. Compared with older adults, younger adults exhibited more specific and widespread dorsal network and sensorimotor network connectivity within and between the DMN, fronto-parietal ECN, and visual, auditory, and cerebellar networks associated with creativity. This outcome suggests age-specific changes in the functional connected network, particularly in the default-executive and cerebro-cerebellar networks. Our connectivity data further elucidate the critical roles of the cerebellum and cerebro-cerebellar connectivity in creativity in older adults. Furthermore, our findings provide evidence supporting the default-executive coupling hypothesis of aging and novel insights into the interactions of cerebro-cerebellar networks with creative cognition in older adults, which suggest alterations in the cognitive processes of the creative aging brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Loss of Integrity of Corpus Callosum White Matter Hyperintensity Penumbra Predicts Cognitive Decline in Patients With Subcortical Vascular Mild Cognitive Impairment</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.605900</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Loss of white matter (WM) integrity contributes to subcortical vascular mild cognitive impairment (svMCI). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has revealed damage beyond the area of WM hyperintensity (WMH) including in normal-appearing WM (NAWM); however, the functional significance of this observation is unclear. To answer this question, in this study we investigated the relationship between microstructural changes in the WMH penumbra (WMH-P) and cognitive function in patients with svMCI by regional tract-based analysis. A total of 111 patients with svMCI and 72 patients with subcortical ischemic vascular disease (SIVD) without cognitive impairment (controls) underwent DTI and neuropsychological assessment. WMH burden was determined before computing mean values of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) within WMHs and WMH-Ps. Pearson’s partial correlations were used to assess the relationship between measurements showing significant intergroup differences and composite Z-scores representing global cognitive function. Multiple linear regression analysis was carried out to determine the best model for predicting composite Z-scores. We found that WMH burden in the genu, body, and splenium of the corpus callosum (GCC, BCC, and SCC respectively); bilateral anterior, superior, and posterior corona radiata; left sagittal stratum was significantly higher in the svMCI group than in the control group (p &amp;lt; 0.05). The WMH burden of the GCC, BCC, SCC, and bilateral anterior corona radiata was negatively correlated with composite Z-scores. Among diffusion parameters showing significant differences across the 10 WM regions, mean FA values of WMH and WMH-P of the BCC were correlated with composite Z-scores in svMCI patients. The results of the multiple linear regression analysis showed that the FA of WMH-P of the BCC and WMH burden of the SCC and GCC were independent predictors of composite Z-score, with the FA of WMH-P of the BCC making the largest contribution. These findings indicate that disruption of the CC microstructure—especially the WMH-P of the BCC—may contribute to the cognitive deficits associated with SIVD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Repressing Ago2 mRNA translation by Trim71 maintains pluripotency through inhibiting let-7 microRNAs</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66288</link>
	<content:encoded>The regulation of stem cell fate is poorly understood. Genetic studies in &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; lead to the hypothesis that a conserved cytoplasmic double-negative feedback loop consisting of the RNA-binding protein Trim71 and the let-7 microRNA controls the pluripotency and differentiation of stem cells. Although let-7-microRNA-mediated inhibition of Trim71 promotes differentiation, whether and how Trim71 regulates pluripotency and inhibits the let-7 microRNA is still unknown. Here, we show that Trim71 represses &lt;i&gt;Ago2&lt;/i&gt; mRNA translation in mouse embryonic stem cells. Blocking this repression leads to a specific post-transcriptional increase of mature let-7 microRNAs, resulting in let-7-dependent stemness defects and accelerated differentiation in the stem cells. These results not only support the Trim71-let-7-microRNA bi-stable switch model in controlling stem cell fate, but also reveal that repressing the conserved pro-differentiation let-7 microRNAs at the mature microRNA level by Ago2 availability is critical to maintaining pluripotency.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63938</link>
	<content:encoded>Insect pests negatively affect crop quality and yield; identifying new methods to protect crops against insects therefore has important agricultural applications. Our analysis of transgenic &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; thaliana&lt;/i&gt; plants showed that overexpression of &lt;i&gt;PENTACYCLIC TRITERPENE SYNTHASE 1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;PEN1&lt;/i&gt;), encoding the key biosynthetic enzyme for the natural plant product (3E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT), led to significant resistance against a major insect pest, &lt;i&gt;Plustella xylostella&lt;/i&gt;. DMNT treatment severely damaged the peritrophic matrix (PM), a physical barrier isolating food and pathogens from the midgut wall cells. DMNT repressed the expression of &lt;i&gt;PxMucin&lt;/i&gt; in midgut cells and knocking down &lt;i&gt;PxMucin &lt;/i&gt;resulted in PM rupture and &lt;i&gt;P. xylostella&lt;/i&gt; death. A 16S RNA survey revealed that DMNT significantly disrupted midgut microbiota populations and that midgut microbes were essential for DMNT-induced killing. Therefore, we propose that the midgut microbiota assists DMNT in killing &lt;i&gt;P. xylostella&lt;/i&gt;. These findings may provide a novel approach for plant protection against &lt;i&gt;P. xylostella&lt;/i&gt;.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>In a context of ongoing biodiversity erosion, obtaining genomic resources from wildlife is essential for conservation. The thousands of yearly mammalian roadkill provide a useful source material for genomic surveys. To illustrate the potential of this underexploited resource, we used roadkill samples to study the genomic diversity of the bat-eared fox (&lt;i&gt;Otocyon megalotis&lt;/i&gt;) and the aardwolf (&lt;i&gt;Proteles cristatus&lt;/i&gt;), both having subspecies with similar disjunct distributions in Eastern and Southern Africa.

Then, we showed that the two subspecies of aardwolf might warrant species status (&lt;i&gt;P. cristatus &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;P. septentrionalis&lt;/i&gt;) by comparing their genome-wide genetic differentiation to pairs of well-defined species across Carnivora with a new Genetic Differentiation index (GDi) based on only a few resequenced individuals.

	<content:encoded>Across animal species, meals are terminated after ingestion of large food volumes, yet underlying mechanosensory receptors have so far remained elusive. Here, we identify an essential role for &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; Piezo in volume-based control of meal size. We discover a rare population of fly neurons that express Piezo, innervate the anterior gut and crop (a food reservoir organ), and respond to tissue distension in a Piezo-dependent manner. Activating Piezo neurons decreases appetite, while &lt;i&gt;Piezo&lt;/i&gt; knockout and Piezo neuron silencing cause gut bloating and increase both food consumption and body weight. These studies reveal that disrupting gut distension receptors changes feeding patterns, and identify a key role for &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; Piezo in internal organ mechanosensation.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) results from episodes of airway collapse and intermittent hypoxia (IH) and is associated with a host of health complications. Although the lung is the first organ to sense changes in oxygen levels, little is known about the consequences of IH to the lung hypoxia-inducible factor- (HIF)-responsive pathways. We hypothesized that exposure to IH would lead to cell-specific up and downregulation of diverse expression pathways. We identified changes in circadian and immune pathways in lungs from mice exposed to IH. Among all cell types, endothelial cells showed the most prominent transcriptional changes. Upregulated genes in myofibroblast cells were enriched for genes associated with pulmonary hypertension and included targets of several drugs currently used to treat chronic pulmonary diseases. A better understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying diseases associated with OSA could improve our therapeutic approaches, directing therapies to the most relevant cells and molecular pathways.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Treatment for many viral infections of the central nervous system (CNS) remains only supportive. Here we address a remaining gap in our knowledge regarding how the CNS and immune systems interact during viral infection. By examining the regulation of the immune and nervous system processes in a nonhuman primate model of West Nile virus neurological disease, we show that virus infection disrupts the homeostasis of the immune-neural-synaptic axis via induction of pleiotropic genes with distinct functions in each component of the axis. This pleiotropic gene regulation suggests an unintended off-target negative impact of virus-induced host immune responses on the neurotransmission, which may be a common feature of various viral infections of the CNS.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Behavioural studies differentiate the rodent dorsal striatum (DS) into lateral and medial regions; however, anatomical evidence suggests that it is a unified structure. To understand striatal dynamics and basal ganglia functions, it is essential to clarify the circuitry that supports this behavioural-based segregation. Here, we show that the mouse DS is made of two non-overlapping functional circuits divided by a boundary. Combining &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; optopatch-clamp and extracellular recordings of spontaneous and evoked sensory activity, we demonstrate different coupling of lateral and medial striatum to the cortex together with an independent integration of the spontaneous activity, due to particular corticostriatal connectivity and local attributes of each region. Additionally, we show differences in slow and fast oscillations and in the electrophysiological properties between striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons. In summary, these results demonstrate that the rodent DS is segregated in two neuronal circuits, in homology with the caudate and putamen nuclei of primates.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Sensitivity to repetitions in sound amplitude and frequency is crucial for sound perception. As with other aspects of sound processing, sensitivity to such patterns may change with age, and may help explain some age-related changes in hearing such as segregating speech from background sound. We recorded magnetoencephalography to characterize differences in the processing of sound patterns between younger and older adults. We presented tone sequences that either contained a pattern (made of a repeated set of tones) or did not contain a pattern. We show that auditory cortex in older, compared to younger, adults is hyperresponsive to sound onsets, but that sustained neural activity in auditory cortex, indexing the processing of a sound pattern, is reduced. Hence, the sensitivity of neural populations in auditory cortex fundamentally differs between younger and older individuals, overresponding to sound onsets, while underresponding to patterns in sounds. This may help to explain some age-related changes in hearing such as increased sensitivity to distracting sounds and difficulties tracking speech in the presence of other sound.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.431886v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>neurolib is a computational framework for whole-brain modeling written in Python. It provides a set of neural mass models that represent the average activity of a brain region on a mesoscopic scale. In a whole-brain network model, brain regions are connected with each other based on biologically informed structural connectivity, i.e. the connectome of the brain. neurolib can load structural and functional datasets, set up a whole-brain model, manage its parameters, simulate it, and organize its outputs for later analysis. The activity of each brain region can be converted into a simulated BOLD signal in order to calibrate the model against empirical data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Extensive model analysis is possible using a parameter exploration module, which allows one to characterize the model's behavior given a set of changing parameters. An optimization module can fit a model to multimodal empirical data using an evolutionary algorithm. neurolib is designed to be extendable such that custom neural mass models can be implemented easily, offering a versatile platform for computational neuroscientists for prototyping models, managing large numerical experiments, studying the structure-function relationship of brain networks, and for performing in-silico optimization of whole-brain models.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Itch is an unpleasant sensation that elicits robust scratching and active avoidance. However, the identity of the cells and neural circuits that organize this information remains elusive. Here we show the necessity and sufficiency of itch-activated neurons in the central amygdala (CeA) for both itch sensation and active avoidance. Further, we show that itch-activated CeA neurons play important roles in itch-related comorbidities, including anxiety-like behaviors, but not in some aversive and appetitive behaviors previously ascribed to CeA neurons. RNA-sequencing of itch-activated CeA neurons identified several differentially expressed genes as well as potential key signaling pathways in regulating pruritis. Finally, viral tracing experiments demonstrate that these neurons send a critical projection to the periaqueductal gray to mediate modulation of itch. These findings reveal a cellular and circuit signature of CeA neurons orchestrating behavioral and affective responses to pruritus in mice.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.431873v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Cortical excitability, the variable response to a given cortical input, is widely studied in neuroscience, from slice experiments and in silico modeling work to human clinical settings. However, a unifying definition and a translational approach to the phenomenon are currently lacking. For example, at the onset of epileptic seizures, cortical excitability may impair resilience to perturbations (external or endogenous). In this study, we tested in vivo whether changes in cortical excitability quantified as evoked response to small perturbation corresponded to changes in resilience to larger perturbations. To do so, we used both cell- type circuit specific optogenetic stimulation in mice and direct intracranial stimulation in one human subject and quantified 1) evoked cortical responses to single pulses of varying intensity, and 2) evoked cortical facilitation and suppression to paired pulses at varying intervals. In the presence of a gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist or antagonist, we found that 1) cortical response to single pulses and 2) cortical facilitation decreased and increased, respectively. Additionally, using trains of opto-pulses in mice in the presence of a GABA agonist, we found increased resilience to the induction of seizures. With this study, we provide evidence for a tight correlation between cortical excitability and resilience, exploring a range of cortical dynamics, from physiological excitability, to pathological discharges. Our study carried out with two different stimulation methods in two species suggests that varying cortical excitability can be tracked with simple protocols involving minute short-lived perturbative stimuli.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Even during sustained attention, enhanced processing of attended stimuli waxes and wanes rhythmically, with periods of enhanced and relatively diminished visual processing (and hit rates) alternating at 4 or 8 Hz in a sustained visual attention task. These alternating attentional states occur alongside alternating dynamical states, in which lateral intraparietal cortex (LIP), the frontal eye field (FEF), and the mediodorsal pulvinar exhibit different activity and connectivity at , {beta}, and {gamma} frequencies -- rhythms associated with visual processing, working memory, and motor suppression. To assess whether and how these multiple interacting rhythms contribute to periodicity in attention, we propose a detailed computational model of FEF and LIP that reproduces the rhythmic dynamics and behavioral consequences of observed attentional states, when driven by {theta}-rhythmic inputs simulating experimentally-observed pulvinar activity. This model reveals that the frequencies and mechanisms of the observed rhythms optimize sensitivity in visual target detection while maintaining functional flexibility.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Interoception - the physiological sense of our inner bodies - has risen to the forefront of psychological and psychiatric research. Much of this research utilizes tasks that attempt to measure the ability to accurately detect cardiac signals. Unfortunately, these approaches are confounded by well-known issues limiting their validity and interpretation. At the core of this controversy is the role of subjective beliefs about the heart rate in confounding measures of interoceptive accuracy. Here, we recast these beliefs as an important part of the causal machinery of interoception, and offer a novel psychophysical &quot;heart rate discrimination&quot; method to estimate their accuracy and precision. By applying this task in 218 healthy participants, we demonstrate that cardiac interoceptive beliefs are more biased, less precise, and are associated with poorer metacognitive insight relative to a matched exteroceptive control. Our task, provided as an open-source python package, offers users an intuitive, robust approach to quantifying cardiac beliefs.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.431868v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Hippocampal place cells are activated sequentially as an animal explores its environment. These activity sequences are internally recreated (&quot;replayed&quot;), either in the same or reversed order, during bursts of activity (sharp wave-ripples; SWRs) that occur in sleep and awake rest. SWR-associated replay is thought to be critical for the creation and maintenance of long-term memory. We sought to identify the cellular and network mechanisms of SWRs and replay by constructing and simulating a data-driven model of area CA3 of the hippocampus. Our results show that the structure of recurrent excitatory interactions established during learning not only determines the content of replay, but is essential for the generation of the SWRs as well. We find that bidirectional replay requires the interplay of the experimentally confirmed, temporally symmetric plasticity rule, and cellular adaptation. Our model provides a unifying framework for diverse phenomena involving hippocampal plasticity, representations, and dynamics.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The effect of hydrophobic gases on the nervous system of Daphnia magna</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.431860v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>It is well known that some hydrophobic atomic and molecular gases provoke anaesthetic effects in mammal animals. Depending on the gas, there is a Minimum Alveolar Concentration (MAC) to produce anaesthesia. The gas enters in the lungs, dissolve in the blood and reaches the brain. Where are the targets and which are the action mechanisms are subjects not fully understood yet. Very recently, we reported the effects of local anaesthetics on the swimming behaviour of the water flea Daphnia magna (STOTEN 691, 278-283, 2019). Our aim now is to report new studies on the behaviour of this aquatic invertebrate in the presence of three hydrophobic gases: xenon, nitrous oxide and krypton. However, if local anaesthetics easily dissolve in water, these gases do not. Therefore, we designed a chamber to dissolve the gases using pressures up to 50 atmospheres. Simultaneously, we were able to measure in real time the response of the animals through transparent windows able to support such high pressures. Xenon and nitrous oxide effectively induce lack of movement in the daphnids. The effective pressures EP50 for xenon and nitrous oxide were 6.3 and 5.2 atmospheres, respectively. Krypton does not present clear effects on the motile suppression, even after the exposure to 44 atmospheres. Our findings provide insight on the physiological effects important gases used in human medicine produce in aquatic invertebrate animals considered as potential models to study anesthesia.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Dopaminergic Ric GTPase activity impacts amphetamine sensitivity and sleep quality in a dopamine transporter-dependent manner in Drosophila melanogaster</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.431857v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Dopamine (DA) is required for movement, sleep, and reward, and DA signaling is tightly controlled by the presynaptic DA transporter (DAT). Therapeutic and addictive psychostimulants, including methylphenidate (Ritalin; MPH), cocaine, and amphetamine (AMPH), markedly elevate extracellular DA via their actions as competitive DAT inhibitors (MPH, cocaine) and substrates (AMPH). DAT silencing in mice and invertebrates results in hyperactivity, reduced sleep, and blunted psychostimulant responses, highlighting DAT's essential role in DA-dependent behaviors. DAT surface expression is not static; rather it is dynamically regulated by endocytic trafficking. PKC-stimulated DAT endocytosis requires the neuronal GTPase, Rit2, and Rit2 silencing in mouse DA neurons impacts psychostimulant sensitivity. However, it is unknown whether or not Rit2-mediated changes in psychostimulant sensitivity are DAT-dependent. Here, we leveraged Drosophila melanogaster to test whether the Drosophila Rit2 ortholog, Ric, impacts dDAT function, trafficking, and DA-dependent behaviors. Orthologous to hDAT and Rit2, dDAT and Ric directly interact, and the constitutively active Ric mutant Q117L increased dDAT surface levels and function in cell lines and ex vivo Drosophila brains. Moreover, DAergic RicQ117L expression caused sleep fragmentation in a DAT-dependent manner, but had no effect on total sleep and daily locomotor activity. Importantly, we found that Rit2 is required for AMPH-stimulated DAT internalization in mouse striatum, and that DAergic RicQ117L expression significantly increased Drosophila AMPH sensitivity in a DAT-dependent manner, suggesting a conserved impact of Ric-dependent DAT trafficking on AMPH sensitivity. These studies support that the DAT/Rit2 interaction impacts both baseline behaviors and AMPH sensitivity, potentially by regulating DAT trafficking.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Burst coding despite unimodal interval distributions</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.431851v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The burst coding hypothesis posits that the occurrence of sudden high-frequency patterns of action potentials constitutes a salient syllable of the neural code. Many neurons, however, do not produce clearly demarcated bursts, an observation invoked to rule out the pervasiveness of this coding scheme across brain areas and cell types. Here we ask how identifiable spike- timing patterns have to be to preserve potent transmission of information. Should we expect that neurons avoid ambiguous patterns that are neither clearly bursts nor isolated spikes? We addressed these questions using information theory and compu- tational simulations. By quantifying how information transmission depends on firing statistics, we found that the information transmitted is not strongly influenced by the presence of clearly demarcated modes in the interspike interval distribution, a feature often used to identify the presence of burst coding. Instead, we found that neurons having unimodal interval distributions were still able to ascribe different meanings to bursts and iso- lated spikes. In this regime, information transmission depends on properties of the synapses as well as the length and relative frequency of bursts. Furthermore, we found that common metrics used to quantify burstiness were also unable to predict the degree with which bursts could be used to carry information. Our results provide guiding principles for the implementation of coding strategies based on spike-timing patterns, and show that even unimodal firing statistics can be consistent with a bivariate neural code.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Biological convolutions improve DNN robustness to noise and generalisation</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.431827v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved superhuman accuracy on standard image classification benchmarks. Their success has reignited significant interest in their use as models of the primate visual system, bolstered by claims of their architectural and representational similarities. However, closer scrutiny of these models suggests that they rely on various forms of shortcut learning to achieve their impressive performance, such as using texture rather than shape information. Such superficial solutions to image recognition have been shown to make DNNs brittle in the face of more challenging tests such as noise-perturbed or out-of-domain images, casting doubt on their similarity to their biological counterparts. In the present work, we demonstrate that adding fixed biological filter banks, in particular banks of Gabor filters, helps to constrain the networks to avoid reliance on shortcuts, making them develop more structured internal representations and more tolerant to noise. Importantly, they also gained around 20-30% improved accuracy when generalising to our novel out-of-domain test image sets over standard end-to-end trained architectures. We take these findings to suggest that these properties of the primate visual system should be incorporated into DNNs to make them more able to cope with real-world vision and better capture some of the more impressive aspects of human visual perception such as generalisation.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Fast A-type currents shape a rapidly adapting form of delayed short latency firing of excitatory superficial dorsal horn neurons that express the NPY Y1 receptor</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.431823v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Neuroanatomical and behavioral evidence indicates that neuropeptide Y Y1 receptor-expressing interneurons (Y1-INs) in the superficial dorsal horn (SDH) are predominantly excitatory and contribute to chronic pain. Using an adult ex vivo spinal cord slice preparation from Y1eGFP reporter mice, we characterized firing patterns in response to steady state depolarizing current injection of GFP-positive cells in lamina II, the great majority of which expressed Y1 mRNA (88%). Randomly sampled and Y1eGFP neurons exhibited five firing patterns: tonic (TF), initial burst (IBF), phasic (PF), delayed short-latency &amp;lt;180 ms (DSLF), and delayed long-latency &amp;gt;180 ms (DLLF). When studied at resting membrane potential, most RS neurons exhibited delayed firing, while most Y1eGFP neurons exhibited phasic firing and not delayed firing. A preconditioning membrane hyperpolarization produced only subtle changes in the firing patterns of randomly sampled neurons, but dramatically shifted Y1eGFP neurons to DSLF (46%) and DLLF (24%). In contrast to randomly sampled DSLF neurons which rarely exhibited spike frequency adaptation, Y1eGFP DSLF neurons were almost always rapidly adapting, a characteristic of nociceptive-responsive SDH neurons. Rebound spiking was more prevalent in Y1eGFP neurons (6% RS vs 32% Y1eGFP), indicating enrichment of T-type calcium currents. Y1eGFP DSLF neurons exhibited fast A-type potassium currents that are known to delay or limit action potential firing, and these were of smaller current density as compared to randomly sampled DSLF neurons. Our results inspire future studies to determine whether tissue or nerve injury downregulates channels that contribute to A-currents, thus potentially unmasking T-type calcium channel activity and membrane hyperexcitability in Y1-INs, leading to persistent pain.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.431803v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Large, openly available datasets and current analytic tools promise the emergence of population neuroscience. The considerable diversity in personality traits and behaviour between individuals is reflected in the statistical variability of neural data collected in such repositories. This variability challenges the sensitivity and specificity of analysis methods. Yet, recent studies with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have concluded that patterns of resting-state functional connectivity can both successfully identify individuals within a cohort and predict their individual traits, yielding the notion of a neural fingerprint. Here, we aimed to clarify the neurophysiological foundations of individual differentiation from features of the rich and complex dynamics of magnetoencephalography (MEG) resting-state brain activity in 158 participants. The resulting neurophysiological functional connectomes enabled the identification of individuals with similar identifiability rates to fMRI. We also show that individual identification was equally successful from simpler measures of the spatial distribution of neurophysiological spectral signal power. Our data indicate that identifiability can be achieved from brain recordings as short as 30 seconds, and that it is robust over time: individuals remain identifiable from recordings performed weeks after their baseline reference data was collected. We can anticipate a vast range of diverse applications in personalized, clinical and basic neuroscience of individual differentiation from large-scale neural electrophysiology, in future longitudinal and cross-section studies.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Disrupting short-term memory in premotor but not visual cortex affects serial dependence in visuomotor integration</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.431802v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Human behavior is biased by past experience. For example, when intercepting a moving target, the speed of previous targets will bias responses in future trials. Neural mechanisms underlying this so-called serial dependence are still under debate. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the previous trial leaves a neural trace in brain regions associated with encoding task-relevant information at visual and/or motor regions. We reasoned that injecting noise by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over premotor and visual areas would degrade such memory traces and hence reduce serial dependence. To test this hypothesis, we applied bursts of TMS pulses to right visual motion processing region hV5/MT+ and to left dorsal premotor cortex during inter-trial intervals of a coincident timing task performed by twenty healthy human participants (15 female). Without TMS, participants presented a bias towards the speed of the previous trial when intercepting moving targets. TMS over dorsal premotor cortex decreased serial dependence in comparison to the control Vertex stimulation, whereas TMS applied over hV5/MT+ did not. In addition, TMS seems to have specifically affected the memory trace that leads to serial dependence, as we show no evidence that participants' behavior worsened after applying TMS. These results provide causal evidence that an implicit short-term memory mechanism in premotor cortex keeps information from one trial to the next, and that this information is blended with current trial information so that it biases behavior in a visuomotor integration task with moving objects.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.431791v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Mammalian neocortex is important for conscious processing of sensory information. Fundamental to this function is balanced glutamatergic and GABAergic signalling. Yet little is known about how this interaction arises in the developing forebrain despite increasing insight into early GABAergic interneuron (IN) circuits. To further study this, we assessed the contribution of specific INs to the development of sensory processing in the mouse whisker barrel cortex. Specifically we explored the role of INs in speed coding and sensory adaptation. In wild-type animals, both speed processing and adaptation were present as early as the layer 4 critical period of plasticity, and showed refinement over the period leading to active whisking onset. We then conditionally silenced action-potential-dependent GABA release in either somatostatin (SST) or vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) INs. These genetic manipulations influenced both spontaneous and sensory-evoked activity in an age and layer-dependent manner. Silencing SST+ INs reduced early spontaneous activity and abolished facilitation in sensory adaptation observed in control pups. In contrast, VIP+ IN silencing had an effect towards the onset of active whisking. Silencing either IN subtype had no effect on speed coding. Our results reveal how these IN subtypes differentially contribute to early sensory processing over the first few postnatal weeks.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Bilingualism and multilingualism are highly prevalent. Non-invasive brain imaging has been used to study the neural correlates of native (L1) and non-native (L2) speech and language production, mainly on the lexical and syntactic level. Here, we acquired continuous fast event-related FMRI during visually cued overt production of exclusively German and English vowels and syllables. We analyzed data from 13 university students, native speakers of German and sequential English bilinguals. The production of non-native English sounds was associated with increased activity of the left primary sensori-motor cortex, bilateral cerebellar hemispheres (lobule VI), left inferior frontal gyrus, and left anterior insula compared to native German sounds. The contrast German &amp;gt; English sounds was not statistically significant. Our results emphasize that the production of non-native speech requires additional neural resources already on a basic phonological level in sequential bilinguals.</content:encoded>

We show that in one such model, and in simple spatial memory tasks we have given to human subjects, short-term memory can be limited to similar low capacity by interference effects, in tasks terminated by errors, and can exhibit similar sublinear scaling, when errors are overlooked. The same mechanism can drive serial recall if combined with weak order-encoding plasticity. Finally, even when storing randomly correlated patterns of activity the network demonstrates correlation-driven latching waves, which are reflected at the outer extremes of pattern space.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.431771v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Our lives revolve around sharing stories with others. Expressing emotion (i.e., happy and sad) is an essential characteristic of sharing stories and could enhance the similarity of story comprehension across speaker and listener pairs. The Emotions as Social Information Model (EASI) suggests that emotional communication may influence interpersonal closeness, but the effect of sharing emotional (happy/sad) stories on interpersonal closeness remains poorly understood. Here, one speaker watched emotional videos and communicated the content of the videos to 22 listeners (happy/sad/neutral group). Both speaker and listeners' neural activities were recorded using EEG. After listening, we assessed the interpersonal closeness between the speaker and listeners. Compared to the sad group, sharing happy stories showed a better recall quality and a higher rating of interpersonal closeness. Meanwhile, the happy group showed higher interpersonal brain synchronization (IBS) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and temporal cortex (specifically TPJ) than the sad group. Moreover, such IBS mediated the relationship between the quality of sharing stories and interpersonal closeness, and happy emotion moderated this mediation model. The magnitude of IBS differentiated high interpersonal closeness from low interpersonal closeness. Exploratory analysis using support vector regression showed that the IBS could also predict the ratings of interpersonal closeness in left-out subjects. These results suggest that IBS could serve as an indicator of whether sharing emotional stories facilitate interpersonal closeness. These findings improve our understanding of sharing emotional information among individuals that guide behaviors during interpersonal interactions.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.431748v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The cocktail party phenomenon describes the ability of the human brain to focus auditory attention on a particular stimulus while ignoring other acoustic events. Selective auditory attention detection (SAAD) is an important issue in the development of brain-computer interface systems and cocktail party processors. This paper proposes a new dynamic attention detection system to process the temporal evolution of the input signal. In the proposed dynamic system, after preprocessing of the input signals, the probabilistic state space of the system is formed. Then, in the learning stage, different dynamic learning methods, including recurrent neural network (RNN) and reinforcement learning (Markov decision process (MDP) and deep Q-learning) are applied to make the final decision as to the attended speech. Among different dynamic learning approaches, the evaluation results show that the deep Q-learning approach (MDP+RNN) provides the highest classification accuracy (94.2%) with the least detection delay. The proposed SAAD system is advantageous, in the sense that the detection of attention is performed dynamically for the sequential inputs. Also, the system has the potential to be used in scenarios, where the attention of the listener might be switched in time in the presence of various acoustic events.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.431725v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Dendritic spines are membranous protrusions, with a bulbous head connected to the dendrite by a thin neck, and receive essentially all excitatory inputs in most mammalian neurons. Spines have a wide variety of morphologies that likely have a significant effect on their biochemical and electrical properties. The question of whether spines belong to distinct morphological or functional subtypes or constitute a continuum is still open. To discern this, it is important to measure spine necks objectively. Recent advances in electron microscopy enable automatic reconstructions of 3D spines with nanometer precision. Analyzing ultrastructural reconstructions from mouse neocortical neurons with computer vision algorithms, we demonstrate that the vast majority of spines can be rigorously separated into head and neck components. Analysis of the head and neck morphologies reveals a continuous distribution of parameters. The spine neck diameter, but not the neck length, was correlated with the head volume. Spines with larger head volumes often had a spine apparatus and pairs of spines in a postsynaptic cell contacted by the same axon had similar head volumes. Our data are consistent with a lack of morphological categories of spines and indicate that the morphologies of the spine neck and head are independently regulated. These results have repercussions for our understanding of the function of dendritic spines in neuronal circuits.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.431673v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Information is carried between brain regions through neurotransmitter release from axonal presynaptic terminals. Understanding the functional roles of defined neuronal projection pathways in cognitive and behavioral processes requires temporally precise manipulation of their activity in vivo. However, existing optogenetic tools have low efficacy and off-target effects when applied to presynaptic terminals, while chemogenetic tools are difficult to control in space and time. Here, we show that a targeting-enhanced mosquito homologue of the vertebrate encephalopsin (eOPN3) can effectively suppress synaptic transmission through the Gi/o signaling pathway. Brief illumination of presynaptic terminals expressing eOPN3 triggers a lasting suppression of synaptic output that recovers spontaneously within minutes in vitro as well as in vivo. In freely moving mice, eOPN3-mediated suppression of dopaminergic nigrostriatal afferents leads to an ipsiversive rotational bias. We conclude that eOPN3 can be used to selectively suppress neurotransmitter release at synaptic terminals with high spatiotemporal precision, opening new avenues for functional interrogation of long-range neuronal circuits in vivo.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>While the negative impacts of caffeinated soda on children's physical health have been well documented, it remains unexplored if habitual caffeinated soda intake is associated with intellectual capacities in children. Here, we investigated the behavioral and neural correlates of daily consumption of caffeinated soda on neurocognitive functions including working memory, impulsivity, and reward processing. We rigorously tested the link between caffeinated soda intake and the neurocognitive functions by applying machine learning and hierarchical linear regression to a large dataset from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (N=3,966; age=9-10 years). The results showed that daily consumption of caffeinated soda in children was associated with impaired working memory and higher impulsivity, and increased amygdala activation during the emotional working memory task. The machine learning results also showed hypoactivity in the nucleus accumbens and the posterior cingulate cortex during reward processing. These results findings have significant implications for public health recommendations.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Goal-Driven Recurrent Neural Network Models of the Ventral Visual Stream</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.431717v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The ventral visual stream (VVS) is a hierarchically connected series of cortical areas known to underlie core object recognition behaviors, enabling humans and non-human primates to effortlessly recognize objects across a multitude of viewing conditions. While recent feedforward convolutional neural networks (CNNs) provide quantitatively accurate predictions of temporally-averaged neural responses throughout the ventral pathway, they lack two ubiquitous neuroanatomical features: local recurrence within cortical areas and long-range feedback from downstream areas to upstream areas. As a result, such models are unable to account for the temporally-varying dynamical patterns thought to arise from recurrent visual circuits, nor can they provide insight into the behavioral goals that these recurrent circuits might help support. In this work, we augment CNNs with local recurrence and long-range feedback, developing convolutional RNN (ConvRNN) network models that more correctly mimic the gross neuroanatomy of the ventral pathway. Moreover, when the form of the recurrent circuit is chosen properly, ConvRNNs with comparatively small numbers of layers can achieve high performance on a core recognition task, comparable to that of much deeper feedforward networks. We then compared these models to temporally fine-grained neural and behavioral recordings from primates to thousands of images. We found that ConvRNNs better matched these data than alternative models, including the deepest feedforward networks, on two metrics: 1) neural dynamics in V4 and inferotemporal (IT) cortex at late timepoints after stimulus onset, and 2) the varying times at which object identity can be decoded from IT, including more challenging images that take longer to decode. Moreover, these results differentiate within the class of ConvRNNs, suggesting that there are strong functional constraints on the recurrent connectivity needed to match these phenomena. Finally, we find that recurrent circuits that attain high task performance while having a smaller network size as measured by number of units, rather than another metric such as the number of parameters, are overall most consistent with these data. Taken together, our results evince the role of recurrence and feedback in the ventral pathway to reliably perform core object recognition while subject to a strong total network size constraint.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.431702v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Astrocytes provide neurons with diffusible factors that promote synapse formation and maturation. In particular, glypican-4/GPC4 released from astrocytes promotes the maturation of excitatory synapses. Unlike other secreted factors, GPC4 contains the C-terminal GPI-anchorage signal. However, the mechanism by which membrane-tethered GPC4 is released from astrocytes is unknown. Using primary astrocyte cultures and a quantitative luciferase-based release assay, we show that GPC4 is expressed on the astrocyte surface exclusively via a GPI-anchorage. Soluble GPC4 is robustly released from the astrocytes predominantly by proteolytic shedding and, to a lesser extent, by GPI-anchor cleavage, but not by vesicular release. Pharmacological, overexpression, and loss of function screens showed that ADAM9 in part mediates the release of GPC4 from astrocytes. The released GPC4 contains the heparan sulfate side chain, suggesting that these release mechanisms provide the active form that promotes synapse maturation and function. Overall, our studies identified the release mechanisms and the major releasing enzyme of GPC4 in astrocytes and will provide insights into understanding how astrocytes regulate the synapse formation and maturation.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.431698v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Cortical processing depends on finely-tuned excitatory and inhibitory connections in neuronal microcircuits. In major depressive disorder (depression), a disrupted balance due to weaker inhibition by somatostatin-expressing interneurons is implicated in cognitive deficits and rumination symptoms. Here, we tested the impact of reduced somatostatin interneuron inhibition on cortical processing in human microcircuits in depression using a data-driven computational approach. We integrated human cellular, circuit and gene-expression data to generate detailed models of human cortical microcircuits in health and depression. We simulated microcircuit baseline and response activity and found reduced signal-to-noise ratio of cortical processing, and increased false/failed detection of stimuli, due to a higher baseline activity (noise) in depression. Our results demonstrate mechanistically how reduced inhibition in human neuronal microcircuits impairs cortical processing in depression, thus establishing a target mechanism for novel treatments and providing quantitative links between inhibition and cognitive deficits which could improve the diagnosis of depression.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.431688v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Sleep, the predominant state of early infancy, is divided into two sub-states: active sleep (AS; or REM sleep) and quiet sleep (QS; or non-REM sleep). Behaviorally, AS is distinguished from QS by the presence of rapid eye movements (REMs) and abundant twitches across the body. Here, in the early postnatal period in human infants, we report the unexpected developmental emergence of twitches during QS. These twitches are unaccompanied by REMs and occur synchronously with sleep spindles, a hallmark of QS. As QS-related twitching increases with age, sleep spindle rate also increases along the sensorimotor strip. The emerging synchrony between subcortically generated twitches and cortical oscillations suggests the development of functional connectivity among distant sensorimotor structures, with potential implications for more sensitive identification of atypical developmental trajectories.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Remyelination restores myelin content on distinct neuronal subtypes in the cerebral cortex</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.431685v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Axons in the cerebral cortex exhibit diverse patterns of myelination, with some axons devoid of myelin, some exhibiting discontinuous patches of myelin, and others continuous myelin that is interrupted only by nodes of Ranvier. Oligodendrocytes establish this pattern by sorting through a high density of potential targets to select a small cohort of axons for myelination; however, the myelination patterns established on distinct excitatory and inhibitory neurons within the cortex remain to be fully defined and little is known about the extent to which these patterns are restored after oligodendrocyte regeneration. Here we show that axons in layer I of the somatosensory cortex, a key region for integration of input from local and distant sources, exhibit an extraordinarily diverse range of myelination patterns, even among distinct neuronal subtypes. Although larger axons were more often selected for myelination, neuronal identity profoundly influenced the probability of myelination. The relative differences in myelination among neuron subtypes were preserved between cortical areas with widely varying myelin density, suggesting that regional differences in myelin abundance arises through local control of oligodendrogenesis, rather than selective reduction of myelin on distinct neuron subtypes. By following the loss and regeneration of myelin sheaths along defined neurons in vivo we show that even though the distribution of myelin on individual PV and VM neuron axons was altered following remyelination, the overall myelin content on these neurons was restored. The findings suggest that local changes in myelin can be tolerated, allowing opportunistic selection of available targets by newly formed oligodendrocytes to restore relative differences in myelin content between functionally distinct neurons.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The capacity to form and update mental representations of the type and timing of sensory events is a central tenet of adaptive behavior in a dynamically changing environment. An internal model of stimulus contingencies provides a means to optimize behavior through predictive adjustments based on past to future events. To this end, neural and cognitive processes rely on systematic relations between events and use these rules to optimize information processing. The P3 complex of the event-related potential of the electroencephalogram (ERP/EEG) is a well-established and extensively tested index of such mechanisms. Here we investigated the P3b sensitivity to auditory stimulus deviations associated with two updating operations: physical change (switching stimulus pitches) and rule change (switching additive and subtractive target stimulus counting). Participants listened to a variant of the classical oddball sequence consisting of frequent standard (600 Hz) and two equally probable less frequent deviant tones (660 Hz, 540 Hz), keeping count of the deviant tones and switching between addition and subtraction with a pitch change. The results indicate specific amplitude modulations, confirming the P3b as a context-sensitive marker of physical and cognitive components of an internal model. This suggests that the P3b can be used as a differential marker of predictive coding mechanisms.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.431646v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Attention to a stimulus feature prioritizes its processing while strongly suppressing the processing of similar features, a non-linear phenomenon called surround suppression. Here we investigated this phenomenon using neurophysiology and psychophysics. We recorded responses of motion direction-selective neurons in area MT/MST of monkeys in different conditions. When attention was allocated to a stimulus moving in the neurons' preferred direction responses to a distractor were strongly suppressed for directions nearby the preferred direction. These effects were modeled as the interaction between two Gaussian fields representing narrowly-tuned excitatory and widely-tuned inhibitory inputs into a neuron, with attention more strongly modulating the gain of the inhibitory inputs. We additionally demonstrated a corresponding behavioral effect in humans: Feature-based attention strongly reduced motion repulsion in the vicinity of the attended motion direction. Our results demonstrate that feature-based attention can induce non-linear changes in neuronal tuning curves via unbalanced gain changes to excitatory and inhibitory inputs into neurons ultimately translating into similar effects during behavior.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
In the hippocampus, spatial and nonspatial information are jointly represented as a neural map in which locations associated with salient features are over‐represented by increased densities of relevant place cells. Although we recently demonstrated that experience‐dependent establishment of these disproportionate maps is governed by selective stabilization of salient place cells following their conversion from non‐place cells, the underlying mechanism for pre‐established map reorganization remained to be understood. To this end, we investigated the changes in CA1 functional cellular maps imaged using two‐photon calcium imaging in mice performing a reward‐rearrangement task in virtual reality. Mice were pre‐trained on a virtual linear track with a visual landmark and a reward in two distinct locations. Then, they were re‐trained on the same track with the exception that the location of reward was shifted to match the landmark location. We found that, in contrast to de novo map formation, robust map reorganization occurred through parallel coordination of new place field formation, lateral shifting of existing place fields, and selective stabilization of place fields encoding salient locations. Our findings demonstrate that intricate interplay between multiple forms of cellular dynamics enables rapid updating of information stored in hippocampal maps.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Exercise interventions preserve hippocampal volume: A meta‐analysis</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23292?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Hippocampal volume is a marker of brain health and is reduced with aging and neurological disease. Exercise may be effective at increasing and preserving hippocampal volume, potentially serving as a treatment for conditions associated with hippocampal atrophy (e.g., dementia). This meta‐analysis aimed to identify whether exercise training has a positive effect on hippocampal volume and how population characteristics and exercise parameters moderate this effect. Studies met the following criteria: (a) controlled trials; (b) interventions of physical exercise; (c) included at least one time‐point of hippocampal volume data before the intervention and one after; (d) assessed hippocampal volume using either manual or automated segmentation algorithms. Animal studies, voxel‐based morphometry analyses, and multi‐modal interventions (e.g., cognitive training or meditation) were excluded. The primary analysis in n = 23 interventions from 22 published studies revealed a significant positive effect of exercise on total hippocampal volume. The overall effect was significant in older samples (65 years of age or older) and in interventions that lasted over 24 weeks and had less than 150 min per week of exercise. These findings suggest that moderate amounts of exercise for interventions greater than 6 months have a positive effect on hippocampal volume including in older populations vulnerable to hippocampal atrophy.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Hippocampal neurogenesis and memory in adolescence following intrauterine growth restriction</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23291?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is associated with hippocampal alterations that can increase the risk of short‐term memory impairments later in life. Despite the role of hippocampal neurogenesis in learning and memory, research into the long‐lasting impact of IUGR on these processes is limited. We aimed to determine the effects of IUGR on neuronal proliferation, differentiation and morphology, and on memory function at adolescent equivalent age. At embryonic day (E) 18 (term ∼E22), placental insufficiency was induced in pregnant Wistar rats via bilateral uterine vessel ligation to generate IUGR offspring (n = 10); control offspring (n = 11) were generated via sham surgery. From postnatal day (P) 36–44, spontaneous location recognition (SLR), novel object location and recognition (NOL, NOR), and open field tests were performed. Brains were collected at P45 to assess neurogenesis (immunohistochemistry), dendritic morphology (Golgi staining), and brain‐derived neurotrophic factor expression (BDNF; Western blot analysis). In IUGR versus control rats there was no difference in object preference in the NOL or NOR, the similar and dissimilar condition of the SLR task, or in locomotion and anxiety‐like behavior in the open field. There was a significant increase in the linear density of immature neurons (DCX+) in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG), but no difference in the linear density of proliferating cells (Ki67+) in the SGZ, nor in areal density of mature neurons (NeuN+) or microglia (Iba‐1+) in the DG in IUGR rats compared to controls. Dendritic morphology of dentate granule cells did not differ between groups. Protein expression of the BDNF precursor (pro‐BDNF), but not mature BDNF, was increased in the hippocampus of IUGR compared with control rats. These findings highlight that while the long‐lasting prenatal hypoxic environment may impact brain development, it may not impact hippocampal‐dependent learning and memory in adolescence.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Maximal aerobic capacity is associated with hippocampal cognitive reserve in older adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23290?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Maximal aerobic capacity (MAC) has been associated with preserved neural tissue or brain maintenance (BM) in healthy older adults, including the hippocampus. Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is considered a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease. While aMCI is characterized by hippocampal deterioration, the MAC‐hippocampal relationship in these patients is not well understood. In contrast to healthy individuals, neurocognitive protective effects in neurodegenerative populations have been associated with mechanisms of cognitive reserve (CR) altering the neuropathology‐cognition relationship. We investigated the MAC‐hippocampal relationship in aMCI (n = 29) from the perspectives of BM and CR mechanistic models with structural MRI and a memory fMRI paradigm using both group‐level (higher‐fit patients vs. lower‐fit patients) and individual level (continuous correlation) approaches. While MAC was associated with smaller hippocampal volume, contradicting the BM model, higher‐fit patients demonstrated statistically significant lower correlation between hippocampal volume and memory performance compared with the lower‐fit patients, supporting the model of CR. In addition, while there was no difference in brain activity between the groups during low cognitive demand (encoding of familiar stimuli), higher MAC level was associated with increased cortical and sub‐cortical activation during increased cognitive demand (encoding of novel stimuli) and also with bilateral hippocampal activity even when controlling for hippocampal volume, suggesting for an independent effect of MAC. Our results suggest that MAC may be associated with hippocampal‐related cognitive reserve in aMCI through altering the relationship between hippocampal‐related structural deterioration and cognitive function. In addition, MAC was found to be associated with increased capacity to recruit neural resources during increased cognitive demands.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Activation of ventral CA1 hippocampal neurons projecting to the lateral septum during feeding</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23289?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
A number of studies have reported the involvement of the ventral hippocampus (vHip) and the lateral septum (LS) in negative emotional responses. Besides these well‐documented functions, they are also thought to control feeding behavior. In particular, optogenetic and pharmacogenetic interventions to LS‐projecting vHip neurons have demonstrated that the vHip→LS neural circuit exerts an inhibition on feeding behavior. However, there have been no reports of vHip neuronal activity during feeding. Here, we focused on LS‐projecting vCA1 neurons (vCA1→LS) and monitored their activity during feeding behaviors in mice. vCA1→LS neurons were retrogradely labeled with adeno‐associated virus carrying a ratiometric Ca2+ indicator and measured compound Ca2+ dynamics by fiber photometry. We first examined vCA1→LS activity in random food‐exploring behavior and found that vCA1→LS activation seemed to coincide with food intake; however, our ability to visually confirm this during freely moving behaviors was not sufficiently reliable. We next examined vCA1→LS activity in a goal‐directed, food‐seeking lever‐press task which temporally divided the mouse state into preparatory, effort, and consummatory phases. We observed vCA1→LS activation in the postprandial period during the consummatory phase. Such timing‐ and pathway‐specific activation was not observed from pan‐vCA1 neurons. In contrast, reward omission eliminated this activity, indicating that vCA1→LS activation is contingent on the food reward. Sated mice pressed the lever significantly fewer times but still ate food; however, vCA1→LS neurons were not activated, suggesting that vCA1→LS neurons did not respond to habitual behavior. Combined, these results suggest that gastrointestinal interoception rather than food‐intake motions or external sensations are likely to coincide with vCA1→LS activity. Accordingly, we propose that vCA1→LS neurons discriminate between matched or unmatched predictive bodily states in which incoming food will satisfy an appetite. We also demonstrate that vCA1→LS neurons are activated in aversive/anxious situations in an elevated plus maze and tail suspension test. Future behavioral tests utilizing anxious conflict and food intake may reconcile the multiple functions of vCA1→LS neurons.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Prolactin enhances hippocampal synaptic plasticity in female mice of reproductive age</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23288?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Dynamic signaling between the endocrine system (ES) and the nervous system (NS) is essential for brain and body homeostasis. In particular, reciprocal interaction occurs during pregnancy and motherhood that may involve changes in some brain plasticity processes. Prolactin (PRL), a hormone with pleiotropic effects on the NS, promotes maternal behavior and has been linked to modifications in brain circuits during motherhood; however, it is unclear whether PRL may regulate synaptic plasticity. Therefore, the main aim of the present work was to determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms triggered by PRL that regulate synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. By analyzing extracellular recordings in CA3‐CA1 synapses of hippocampal slices, we report that PRL modifies short and long‐term synaptic plasticity in female mice of reproductive age, but not in sexually immature females or adult males. This effect is carried out through mechanisms that include participation of GABAA receptors and activation of the JAK2‐mediated signaling pathway. These findings show for the first time how PRL enhances the synaptic strength in hippocampal circuits and that this effect is sexually dimorphic, which would influence complex brain processes in physiological conditions like pregnancy and lactation.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: The effects of hippocampal and area parahippocampalis lesions on the processing and retention of serial‐order behavior, autoshaping, and spatial behavior in pigeons</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23287?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
We examined the role of the avian hippocampus and area parahippocampalis in serial‐order behavior and a variety of other tasks known to be sensitive to hippocampal damage in mammals. Damage to the hippocampus and area parahippocampalis caused impairments in autoshaping and performance on an analogue of a radial‐arm maze task, but had no effect on acquisition of 2‐item, 3‐item, and 4‐item serial‐order lists. Additionally, the lesions had no effect on the retention of 3‐items lists, or on the ability to perform novel derived lists composed of elements from lists they had previously learned. The impairments in autoshaping and spatial behavior are consistent with the findings in mammals. The absence of impairments on the serial‐order task may also be consistent once one considers that damage to the hippocampus in mammals seems to affect more internally‐organized rather than externally‐organized serial‐order tasks. Together, the findings support the view that the avian hippocampal complex serves a function very similar to the mammalian hippocampus, a finding that is interesting given that the architecture of the avian hippocampus differs dramatically from that of the mammalian hippocampus.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Hippocampal spatial memory representations in mice are heterogeneously stable</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23272?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
The population of hippocampal neurons actively coding space continually changes across days as mice repeatedly perform tasks. Many hippocampal place cells become inactive while other previously silent neurons become active, challenging the idea that stable behaviors and memory representations are supported by stable patterns of neural activity. Active cell replacement may disambiguate unique episodes that contain overlapping memory cues, and could contribute to reorganization of memory representations. How active cell replacement affects the evolution of representations of different behaviors within a single task is unknown. We trained mice to perform a delayed nonmatching to place task over multiple weeks, and performed calcium imaging in area CA1 of the dorsal hippocampus using head‐mounted miniature microscopes. Cells active on the central stem of the maze “split” their calcium activity according to the animal's upcoming turn direction (left or right), the current task phase (study or test), or both task dimensions, even while spatial cues remained unchanged. We found that, among reliably active cells, different splitter neuron populations were replaced at unequal rates, resulting in an increasing number of cells modulated by turn direction and a decreasing number of cells with combined modulation by both turn direction and task phase. Despite continual reorganization, the ensemble code stably segregated these task dimensions. These results show that hippocampal memories can heterogeneously reorganize even while behavior is unchanging.</content:encoded>

Surgical interventions in epileptic patients aimed at the removal of the epileptogenic zone have success rates at only 60-70%. This failure can be partly attributed to the insufficient spatial sampling by the implanted intracranial electrodes during the clinical evaluation, leading to an incomplete picture of spatio-temporal seizure organization in the regions that are not directly observed. Utilizing the partial observations of the seizure spreading through the brain network, complemented by the assumption that the epileptic seizures spread along the structural connections, we infer if and when are the unobserved regions recruited in the seizure. To this end we introduce a data-driven model of seizure recruitment and propagation across a weighted network, which we invert using the Bayesian inference framework. Using a leave-one-out cross-validation scheme on a cohort of 45 patients we demonstrate that the method can improve the predictions of the states of the unobserved regions compared to an empirical estimate that does not use the structural information, yet it is on the same level as the estimate that takes the structure into account. Furthermore, a comparison with the performed surgical resection and the surgery outcome indicates a link between the inferred excitable regions and the actual epileptogenic zone. The results emphasize the importance of the structural connectome in the large-scale spatio-temporal organization of epileptic seizures and introduce a novel way to integrate the patient-specific connectome and intracranial seizure recordings in a whole-brain computational model of seizure spread.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/b57wtduFEV0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Computational models of animal biosonar seek to identify critical aspects of echo processing responsible for the superior, real-time performance of echolocating bats and dolphins in target tracking and clutter rejection. The Spectrogram Correlation and Transformation (SCAT) model replicates aspects of biosonar imaging in both species by processing wideband biosonar sounds and echoes with auditory mechanisms identified from experiments with bats. The model acquires broadband biosonar broadcasts and echoes, represents them as time-frequency spectrograms using parallel bandpass filters, translates the filtered signals into ten parallel amplitude threshold levels, and then operates on the resulting time-of-occurrence values at each frequency to estimate overall echo range delay. It uses the structure of the echo spectrum by depicting it as a series of local frequency nulls arranged regularly along the frequency axis of the spectrograms after dechirping them relative to the broadcast. Computations take place entirely on the timing of threshold-crossing events for each echo relative to threshold-events for the broadcast. Threshold-crossing times take into account amplitude-latency trading, a physiological feature absent from conventional digital signal processing. Amplitude-latency trading transposes the profile of amplitudes across frequencies into a profile of time-registrations across frequencies. Target shape is extracted from the spacing of the object’s individual acoustic reflecting points, or glints, using the mutual interference pattern of peaks and nulls in the echo spectrum. These are merged with the overall range-delay estimate to produce a delay-based reconstruction of the object’s distance as well as its glints. Clutter echoes indiscriminately activate multiple parts in the null-detecting system, which then produces the equivalent glint-delay spacings in images, thus blurring the overall echo-delay estimates by adding spurious glint delays to the image. Blurring acts as an anticorrelation process that rejects clutter intrusion into perceptions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-Fv413WZkhU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide and is characterized by hijacking immune system for active growth and aggressive metastasis. Neutrophils, which in their original form should establish immune activities to the tumor as a first line of defense, are undermined by tumor cells to promote tumor invasion in several ways. In this study, we investigate the mutual interactions between the tumor cells and the neutrophils that facilitate tumor invasion by developing a mathematical model that involves taxis-reaction-diffusion equations for the critical components in the interaction. These include the densities of tumor and neutrophils, and the concentrations of signaling molecules and structure such as neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). We apply the mathematical model to a Boyden invasion assay used in the experiments to demonstrate that the tumor-associated neutrophils can enhance tumor cell invasion by secreting the neutrophil elastase. We show that the model can both reproduce the major experimental observation on NET-mediated cancer invasion and make several important predictions to guide future experiments with the goal of the development of new anti-tumor strategies. Moreover, using this model, we investigate the fundamental mechanism of NET-mediated invasion of cancer cells and the impact of internal and external heterogeneity on the migration patterning of tumour cells and their response to different treatment schedules.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xRo5UIhpPQA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has affected over 30 million globally to date. Although high rates of venous thromboembolism and evidence of COVID-19-induced endothelial dysfunction have been reported, the precise aetiology of the increased thrombotic risk associated with COVID-19 infection remains to be fully elucidated. Therefore, we assessed clinical platelet parameters and circulating platelet activity in patients with severe and nonsevere COVID-19. An assessment of clinical blood parameters in patients with severe COVID-19 disease (requiring intensive care), patients with nonsevere disease (not requiring intensive care), general medical in-patients without COVID-19, and healthy donors was undertaken. Platelet function and activity were also assessed by secretion and specific marker analysis. We demonstrated that routine clinical blood parameters including increased mean platelet volume (MPV) and decreased platelet:neutrophil ratio are associated with disease severity in COVID-19 upon hospitalisation and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Strikingly, agonist-induced ADP release was 30- to 90-fold higher in COVID-19 patients compared with hospitalised controls and circulating levels of platelet factor 4 (PF4), soluble P-selectin (sP-selectin), and thrombopoietin (TPO) were also significantly elevated in COVID-19. This study shows that distinct differences exist in routine full blood count and other clinical laboratory parameters between patients with severe and nonsevere COVID-19. Moreover, we have determined all COVID-19 patients possess hyperactive circulating platelets. These data suggest abnormal platelet reactivity may contribute to hypercoagulability in COVID-19 and confirms the role that platelets/clotting has in determining the severity of the disease and the complexity of the recovery path.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/FlVljqyi3zU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The oncogenic human herpesviruses Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) are the causative agents of multiple malignancies. A hallmark of herpesviruses is their biphasic life cycle consisting of latent and lytic infection. In this study, we identified that cellular nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), an evolutionarily conserved RNA degradation pathway, critically regulates the latent-to-lytic switch of EBV and KSHV infection. The NMD machinery suppresses EBV and KSHV Rta transactivator expression and promotes maintenance of viral latency by targeting the viral polycistronic transactivator transcripts for degradation through the recognition of features in their 3′ UTRs. Treatment with a small-molecule NMD inhibitor potently induced reactivation in a variety of EBV- and KSHV-infected cell types. In conclusion, our results identify NMD as an important host process that controls oncogenic herpesvirus reactivation, which may be targeted for the therapeutic induction of lytic reactivation and the eradication of tumor cells.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/qY9ePyHwHuI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
Spatial navigation is a crucial everyday skill, which when impaired leads to a significant decrease in quality of life. In humans, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has provided extensive insights into the neural underpinnings of navigation skills. Whereas the hippocampus has been recognized as the prime region underpinning navigation abilities, by providing a cognitive map of the environment, imaging studies have also implicated a range of other brain regions. In this review, we provide an overview of the fMRI evidence for extrahippocampal contributions to spatial navigation. We show that the parahippocampal cortex, retrosplenial cortex, dorsal striatum, and the posterior parietal cortex provide important complementary functions, and ultimately form part of a functional network that regulates successful way‐finding behavior.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Inhibition response function in patients with Parkinson's disease was improved by a training of time estimation, not distance estimation.

Abstract
Parkinson's disease (PD) impairs various cognitive functions, including time perception. Dysfunctional time perception in PD is poorly understood, and no study has investigated the rehabilitation of time perception in patients with PD. We aimed to induce the recovery of time perception in PD patients and investigated the potential relationship between recovery and cognitive functions/domains other than time perception. Sixty patients with PD (27 females) and 20 healthy controls (10 females) were recruited. The participants underwent a feedback training protocol for 4 weeks to improve the accuracy of subjective spatial distance or time duration using a ruler or stopwatch, respectively. They participated in three tests at weekly intervals, each comprising 10 types of cognitive tasks and assessments. After duration feedback training for 1 month, performance on the Go/No‐go task, Stroop task, and impulsivity assessment improved in patients with PD, while no effect was observed after distance feedback training. Additionally, the effect of training on duration production correlated with extended reaction time and improved accuracy in the Go/No‐go and Stroop tasks. These findings suggest that time perception is functionally linked to inhibitory systems. If the feedback training protocol can modulate and maintain time perception, it may improve various cognitive/psychiatric functions in patients with PD. It may also be useful in the treatment of diseases other than PD that cause dysfunctions in temporal processing.</content:encoded>

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: A Multi-disciplinary Ensemble Algorithm for Clustering Heterogeneous Datasets. (arXiv:2102.08361v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08361</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Clustering is a commonly used method for exploring and analysing data where
the primary objective is to categorise observations into similar clusters. In
recent decades, several algorithms and methods have been developed for
analysing clustered data. We notice that most of these techniques
deterministically define a cluster based on the value of the attributes,
distance, and density of homogenous and single-featured datasets. However,
these definitions are not successful in adding clear semantic meaning to the
clusters produced. Evolutionary operators and statistical and
multi-disciplinary techniques may help in generating meaningful clusters. Based
on this premise, we propose a new evolutionary clustering algorithm (ECAStar)
based on social class ranking and meta-heuristic algorithms for stochastically
analysing heterogeneous and multiple-featured datasets. The ECAStar is
integrated with recombinational evolutionary operators, Levy flight
optimisation, and some statistical techniques, such as quartiles and
percentiles, as well as the Euclidean distance of the K-means algorithm.
Experiments are conducted to evaluate the ECAStar against five conventional
approaches: K-means (KM), K-meansPlusPlus (KMPlusPlus), expectation
maximisation (EM), learning vector quantisation (LVQ), and the genetic
algorithm for clusteringPlusPlus (GENCLUSTPlusPlus).

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08288</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Data-driven evolutionary optimization has witnessed great success in solving
complex real-world optimization problems. However, existing data-driven
optimization algorithms require that all data are centrally stored, which is
not always practical and may be vulnerable to privacy leakage and security
threats if the data must be collected from different devices. To address the
above issue, this paper proposes a federated data-driven evolutionary
optimization framework that is able to perform data driven optimization when
the data is distributed on multiple devices. On the basis of federated
learning, a sorted model aggregation method is developed for aggregating local
surrogates based on radial-basis-function networks. In addition, a federated
surrogate management strategy is suggested by designing an acquisition function
that takes into account the information of both the global and local surrogate
models. Empirical studies on a set of widely used benchmark functions in the
presence of various data distributions demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

as an alternative to classic deep learning datasets, especially in algorithm-

smaller and therefore faster to learn, thereby being better suited for the
deployment on neuromorphic chips with limited network sizes. Second, it
exhibits a very clear gap between the accuracies achievable using shallow as

Hallucinations are known to be causally associated with some malfunctions
within the interaction of different areas of the brain involved in perception.
Focusing on visual hallucination and its underlying causes, we identify an
adversarial mechanism between different parts of the brain which are
responsible in the process of visual perception. We then show how the
characterized adversarial interactions in the brain can be modeled by a
generative adversarial network.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Stereotype and Skew: Quantifying Gender Bias in Pre-trained and Fine-tuned Language Models. (arXiv:2101.09688v2 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09688</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This paper proposes two intuitive metrics, skew and stereotype, that quantify
and analyse the gender bias present in contextual language models when tackling
the WinoBias pronoun resolution task. We find evidence that gender stereotype
correlates approximately negatively with gender skew in out-of-the-box models,
suggesting that there is a trade-off between these two forms of bias. We
investigate two methods to mitigate bias. The first approach is an online
method which is effective at removing skew at the expense of stereotype. The
second, inspired by previous work on ELMo, involves the fine-tuning of BERT
using an augmented gender-balanced dataset. We show that this reduces both skew
and stereotype relative to its unaugmented fine-tuned counterpart. However, we
find that existing gender bias benchmarks do not fully probe professional bias
as pronoun resolution may be obfuscated by cross-correlations from other
manifestations of gender prejudice. Our code is available online, at
https://github.com/12kleingordon34/NLP_masters_project.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05933</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This work studies approximation based on single-hidden-layer feedforward and
recurrent neural networks with randomly generated internal weights. These
methods, in which only the last layer of weights and a few hyperparameters are
optimized, have been successfully applied in a wide range of static and dynamic
learning problems. Despite the popularity of this approach in empirical tasks,
important theoretical questions regarding the relation between the unknown
function, the weight distribution, and the approximation rate have remained
open. In this work it is proved that, as long as the unknown function,
functional, or dynamical system is sufficiently regular, it is possible to draw
the internal weights of the random (recurrent) neural network from a generic
distribution (not depending on the unknown object) and quantify the error in
terms of the number of neurons and the hyperparameters. In particular, this
proves that echo state networks with randomly generated weights are capable of
approximating a wide class of dynamical systems arbitrarily well and thus
provides the first mathematical explanation for their empirically observed
success at learning dynamical systems.

Pain experiences have a high degree of variability depending on their context and prior anticipation. Viewing pain perception as a perceptual inference problem, we propose a predictive coding paradigm to characterize evoked and non-evoked pain. We record the local field potentials (LFPs) from the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of freely behaving rats—two regions known to encode the sensory-discriminative and affective-emotional aspects of pain, respectively. We further use predictive coding to investigate the temporal coordination of oscillatory activity between the S1 and ACC. Specifically, we develop a phenomenological predictive coding model to describe the macroscopic dynamics of bottom-up and top-down activity. Supported by recent experimental data, we also develop a biophysical neural mass model to describe the mesoscopic neural dynamics in the S1 and ACC populations, in both naive and chronic pain-treated animals. Our proposed predictive coding models not only replicate important experimental findings, but also provide new prediction about the impact of the model parameters on the physiological or behavioral read-out—thereby yielding mechanistic insight into the uncertainty of expectation, placebo or nocebo effect, and chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Feed-forward deep neural networks have better performance in object categorization tasks than other models of computer vision. To understand the relationship between feed-forward deep networks and the primate brain, we investigated representations of upright and inverted faces in a convolutional deep neural network model and compared them with representations by neurons in the monkey anterior inferior-temporal cortex, area TE. We applied principal component analysis to feature vectors in each model layer to visualize the relationship between the vectors of the upright and inverted faces. The vectors of the upright and inverted monkey faces were more separated through the convolution layers. In the fully-connected layers, the separation among human individuals for upright faces was larger than for inverted faces. The Spearman correlation between each model layer and TE neurons reached a maximum at the fully-connected layers. These results indicate that the processing of faces in the fully-connected layers might resemble the asymmetric representation of upright and inverted faces by the TE neurons. The separation of upright and inverted faces might take place by feed-forward processing in the visual cortex, and separations among human individuals for upright faces, which were larger than those for inverted faces, might occur in area TE.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: The Effects of Selective Inhibition of Histone Deacetylase 1 and 3 in Huntington’s Disease Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.616886</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Huntington’s disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease characterized by a late clinical onset of psychiatric, cognitive, and motor symptoms. Transcriptional dysregulation is an early and central disease mechanism which is accompanied by epigenetic alterations in HD. Previous studies demonstrated that targeting transcriptional changes by inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs), especially the class I HDACs, provides therapeutic effects. Yet, their exact mechanisms of action and the features of HD pathology, on which these inhibitors act remain to be elucidated. Here, using transcriptional profiling, we found that selective inhibition of HDAC1 and HDAC3 by RGFP109 alleviated transcriptional dysregulation of a number of genes, including the transcription factor genes Neurod2 and Nr4a2, and gene sets and programs, especially those that are associated to insulin-like growth factor pathway, in the striatum of R6/1 mice. RGFP109 treatment led to a modest improvement of the motor skill learning and coordination deficit on the RotaRod test, while it did not alter the locomotor and anxiety-like phenotypes in R6/1 animals. We also found, by volumetric MRI, a widespread brain atrophy in the R6/1 mice at the symptomatic disease stage, on which RGFP109 showed no significant effects. Collectively, our combined work suggests that specific HDAC1 and HDAC3 inhibition may offer benefits for alleviating the motor phenotypic deficits and transcriptional dysregulation in HD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.630502</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by extracellular amyloid β (Aβ) and intraneuronal tau protein aggregations. One risk factor for developing AD is the APOE gene coding for the apolipoprotein E protein (apoE). Humans have three versions of APOE gene: ε2, ε3, and ε4 allele. Carrying the ε4 allele is an AD risk factor while carrying the ε2 allele is protective. ApoE is a component of lipoprotein particles in the plasma at the periphery, as well as in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in the interstitial fluid (ISF) of brain parenchyma in the central nervous system (CNS). ApoE is a major lipid transporter that plays a pivotal role in the development, maintenance, and repair of the CNS, and that regulates multiple important signaling pathways. This review will focus on the critical role of apoE in AD pathogenesis and some of the currently apoE-based therapeutics developed in the treatment of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: No Impact of Stochastic Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation on Arterial Pressure and Heart Rate Variability in the Elderly Population</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.646127</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;Noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation (nGVS) is often used to improve postural stability in disorders, such as neurorehabilitation montage. For the safe use of nGVS, we investigated whether arterial pressure (AP) and heart rate vary during static supine and slow whole-body tilt with random nGVS (0.4 mA, 0.1–640 Hz, gaussian distribution) in a healthy elderly population.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;This study was conducted with a double-blind, sham-controlled, cross-over design. Seventeen healthy older adults were recruited. They were asked to maintain a static supine position on a bed for 10 min, and the bed was tilted up (TU) to 70 degrees within 30 s. After maintaining this position for 3 min, the bed was passively tilted down (TD) within 30 s. Real-nGVS or sham-nGVS was applied from 4 to 15 min. The time course of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and RR interval variability (RRIV) were analyzed to estimate the autonomic nervous activity.&lt;/p&gt;Result&lt;p&gt;nGVS and/or time, including pre-/post-event (nGVS-start, TU, and TD), had no impact on MAP and RRIV-related parameters. Further, there was no evidence supporting the argument that nGVS induces pain, vertigo/dizziness, and uncomfortable feeling.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;nGVS may not affect the AP and RRIV during static position and whole-body tilting or cause pain, vertigo/dizziness, and discomfort in the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Trajectories of Mother-Infant Communication: An Experiential Measure of the Impacts of Early Life Adversity</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.632702</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Caretaking stability in the early life environment supports neurobehavioral development, while instability and neglect constitute adverse environments that can alter maturational processes. Research in humans suggests that different types of early life adversity (ELA) can have differential effects on caretaker relationships and later cognitive and social development; however, identifying mechanistic underpinnings will require animal models with translational validity. Two common rodent models, maternal separation (MS) and limited bedding (LB), influence the mother-infant relationship during a critical window of development. We hypothesized that these paradigms may affect the development of communication strategies on the part of the pup. Ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are a care-eliciting mechanism and ethologically relevant response to stressors in the rat pup. USV emission rates and acoustic parameters change throughout early development, presenting the opportunity to define developmental milestones in USVs that would reflect neurobehavioral aberrations if disrupted. This study investigated the effects of MS or LB on the dam-pup relationship by quantifying pup USVs, maternal behavior, and the relationship between the two. First, we used a generalized additive model approach to establish typical developmental trajectories of USV acoustic properties and determine windows of change in MS or LB rearing. Additionally, we quantified maternal behaviors and the predictability of maternal care sequences using an entropy rate calculation. MS and LB each shifted the developmental trajectories of USV acoustic parameters and call types in a sex-specific manner. MS more often impacted male USVs, while LB impacted female USVs. MS dams spent more time passive nursing, and LB dams spent more time on the nest. The predictability of maternal care was associated with the rate of USV emissions exclusively in females. Taken together, findings demonstrate sex- and model-specific effects of rearing environments on a novel developmental trajectory involving the mother-infant relationship, facilitating the translation of animal ELA paradigms to assess later-life consequences.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Excitability of the Ipsilateral Primary Motor Cortex During Unilateral Goal-Directed Movement</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.617146</link>
	<content:encoded>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Previous transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies have revealed that the activity of the primary motor cortex ipsilateral to an active hand (ipsi-M1) plays an important role in motor control. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the ipsi-M1 excitability would be influenced by goal-directed movement and laterality during unilateral finger movements.&lt;/p&gt;Method&lt;p&gt;Ten healthy right-handed subjects performed four finger tapping tasks with the index finger: (1) simple tapping (Tap) task, (2) Real-word task, (3) Pseudoword task, and (4) Visually guided tapping (VT) task. In the Tap task, the subject performed self-paced simple tapping on a touch screen. In the real-word task, the subject tapped letters displayed on the screen one by one to create a Real-word (e.g., apple). Because the action had a specific purpose (i.e., creating a word), this task was considered to be goal-directed as compared to the Tap task. In the Pseudoword task, the subject tapped the letters to create a pseudoword (e.g., gdiok) in the same manner as in the Real-word task; however, the word was less meaningful. In the VT task, the subject was required to touch a series of illuminated buttons. This task was considered to be less goal-directed than the Pseudoword task. The tasks were performed with the right and left hand, and a rest condition was added as control. Single- and paired-pulse TMS were applied to the ipsi-M1 to measure corticospinal excitability and short- and long-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI and LICI) in the resting first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;We found the smaller SICI in the ipsi-M1 during the VT task compared with the resting condition. Further, both SICI and LICI were smaller in the right than in the left M1, regardless of the task conditions.&lt;/p&gt;Discussion&lt;p&gt;We found that SICI in the ipsi-M1 is smaller during visual illumination-guided finger movement than during the resting condition. Our finding provides basic data for designing a rehabilitation program that modulates the M1 ipsilateral to the moving limb, for example, for post-stroke patients with severe hemiparesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Phonological Underspecification: An Explanation for How a Rake Can Become Awake</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.585817</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural markers, such as the mismatch negativity (MMN), have been used to examine the phonological underspecification of English feature contrasts using the Featurally Underspecified Lexicon (FUL) model. However, neural indices have not been examined within the approximant phoneme class, even though there is evidence suggesting processing asymmetries between liquid (e.g., /ɹ/) and glide (e.g., /w/) phonemes. The goal of this study was to determine whether glide phonemes elicit electrophysiological asymmetries related to [consonantal] underspecification when contrasted with liquid phonemes in adult English speakers. Specifically, /ɹɑ/ is categorized as [+consonantal] while /wɑ/ is not specified [i.e., (–consonantal)]. Following the FUL framework, if /w/ is less specified than /ɹ/, the former phoneme should elicit a larger MMN response than the latter phoneme. Fifteen English-speaking adults were presented with two syllables, /ɹɑ/ and /wɑ/, in an event-related potential (ERP) oddball paradigm in which both syllables served as the standard and deviant stimulus in opposite stimulus sets. Three types of analyses were used: (1) traditional mean amplitude measurements; (2) cluster-based permutation analyses; and (3) event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) analyses. The less specified /wɑ/ elicited a large MMN, while a much smaller MMN was elicited by the more specified /ɹɑ/. In the standard and deviant ERP waveforms, /wɑ/ elicited a significantly larger negative response than did /ɹɑ/. Theta activity elicited by /ɹɑ/ was significantly greater than that elicited by /wɑ/ in the 100–300 ms time window. Also, low gamma activation was significantly lower for /ɹɑ/ vs. /wɑ/ deviants over the left hemisphere, as compared to the right, in the 100–150 ms window. These outcomes suggest that the [consonantal] feature follows the underspecification predictions of FUL previously tested with the place of articulation and voicing features. Thus, this study provides new evidence for phonological underspecification. Moreover, as neural oscillation patterns have not previously been discussed in the underspecification literature, the ERSP analyses identified potential new indices of phonological underspecification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Fast Simulations of Highly-Connected Spiking Cortical Models Using GPUs</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.627620</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade there has been a growing interest in the development of parallel hardware systems for simulating large-scale networks of spiking neurons. Compared to other highly-parallel systems, GPU-accelerated solutions have the advantage of a relatively low cost and a great versatility, thanks also to the possibility of using the CUDA-C/C++ programming languages. NeuronGPU is a GPU library for large-scale simulations of spiking neural network models, written in the C++ and CUDA-C++ programming languages, based on a novel spike-delivery algorithm. This library includes simple LIF (leaky-integrate-and-fire) neuron models as well as several multisynapse AdEx (adaptive-exponential-integrate-and-fire) neuron models with current or conductance based synapses, different types of spike generators, tools for recording spikes, state variables and parameters, and it supports user-definable models. The numerical solution of the differential equations of the dynamics of the AdEx models is performed through a parallel implementation, written in CUDA-C++, of the fifth-order Runge-Kutta method with adaptive step-size control. In this work we evaluate the performance of this library on the simulation of a cortical microcircuit model, based on LIF neurons and current-based synapses, and on balanced networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, using AdEx or Izhikevich neuron models and conductance-based or current-based synapses. On these models, we will show that the proposed library achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of simulation time per second of biological activity. In particular, using a single NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU board, the full-scale cortical-microcircuit model, which includes about 77,000 neurons and 3 · 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; connections, can be simulated at a speed very close to real time, while the simulation time of a balanced network of 1,000,000 AdEx neurons with 1,000 connections per neuron was about 70 s per second of biological activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Sensory Detection by the Vomeronasal Organ Modulates Experience-Dependent Social Behaviors in Female Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.638800</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In mice, social behaviors are largely controlled by the olfactory system. Pheromone detection induces naïve virgin females to retrieve isolated pups to the nest and to be sexually receptive to males, but social experience increases the performance of both types of innate behaviors. Whether animals are intrinsically sensitive to the smell of conspecifics, or the detection of olfactory cues modulates experience for the display of social responses is currently unclear. Here, we employed mice with an olfactory-specific deletion of the G protein Gαi2, which partially eliminates sensory function in the vomeronasal organ (VNO), to show that social behavior in female mice results from interactions between intrinsic mechanisms in the vomeronasal system and experience-dependent plasticity. In pup- and sexually-naïve females, Gαi2 deletion elicited a reduction in pup retrieval behavior, but not in sexual receptivity. By contrast, experienced animals showed normal maternal behavior, but the experience-dependent increase in sexual receptivity was incomplete. Further, lower receptivity was accompanied by reduced neuronal activity in the anterior accessory olfactory bulb and the rostral periventricular area of the third ventricle. Therefore, neural mechanisms utilize intrinsic sensitivity in the mouse vomeronasal system and enable plasticity to display consistent social behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Subcortical ischemic vascular disease (SIVD) is a major cause of vascular cognitive impairment (CI) and features extensive atrophy in the cerebral cortex. We aimed to test the hypothesis that cognitive deficits in SIVD are linked to decreased cortical thickness in specific brain regions, which may constitute neuroimaging biomarkers of CI. Sixty-seven SIVD patients without (SIVD-NC, n = 35) and with (SIVD-CI, n = 32) CI and a group of healthy controls (HCs, n = 36) underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cognitive functional assessments. FreeSurfer was used to preprocess structural MRI data and to calculate and compare cortical thickness. The correlation between cortical thickness and cognitive scores was examined in SIVD patients. Significantly altered cortical thickness in the bilateral insula, middle and inferior temporal lobes, precuneus, and medial temporal lobe (MTL) was identified among the three groups (p &amp;lt; 0.05, Monte Carlo simulation corrected). Post hoc results showed significantly decreased thickness in the bilateral insula and temporal lobe in SIVD-NC and SIVD-CI patients compared with HCs. However, the areas with reduced cortical thickness were larger in SIVD-CI than SIVD-NC patients. SIVD-CI patients had significantly reduced thickness in the bilateral precuneus and left MTL (Bonferroni corrected) compared with SIVD-NC patients when we extracted the mean thickness for each region of interest. In SIVD patients, the thicknesses of the left MTL and bilateral precuneus were positively correlated with immediate recall in the memory test. SIVD might lead to extensive cerebral cortical atrophy, while atrophy in the MTL and precuneus might be associated with memory deficits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64145</link>
	<content:encoded>Life in a three-dimensional biofilm is typical for many bacteria, yet little is known about how strains interact in this context. Here, we created essential-gene CRISPRi knockdown libraries in biofilm-forming &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis &lt;/i&gt;and measured competitive fitness during colony co-culture with wild type. Partial knockdown of some translation-related genes reduced growth rates and led to out-competition. Media composition led some knockdowns to compete differentially as biofilm versus non-biofilm colonies. Cells depleted for the alanine racemase AlrA died in monoculture but survived in a biofilm-colony co-culture via nutrient sharing. Rescue was enhanced in biofilm-colony co-culture with a matrix-deficient parent, due to a mutualism involving nutrient and matrix sharing. We identified several examples of mutualism involving matrix sharing that occurred in three-dimensional biofilm colonies but not when cultured in two dimensions. Thus, growth in a three-dimensional colony can promote genetic diversity through sharing of secreted factors and may drive evolution of mutualistic behavior.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>In the context of a generative model, such as predictive coding, pain and heat perception can be construed as the integration of expectation and input with their difference denoted as a prediction error. In a previous neuroimaging study (Geuter et al., 2017) we observed an important role of the insula in such a model, but could not establish its temporal aspects. Here we employed electroencephalography to investigate neural representations of predictions and prediction errors in heat and pain processing. Our data show that alpha-to-beta activity was associated with stimulus intensity expectation, followed by a negative modulation of gamma band activity by absolute prediction errors. This is in contrast to prediction errors in visual and auditory perception, which are associated with increased gamma band activity, but is in agreement with observations in working memory and word matching, which show gamma band activity for correct, rather than violated predictions.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Living cells often need to measure chemical concentrations that vary in time, yet how accurately they can do so is poorly understood. Here, we present a theory that fully specifies, without any adjustable parameters, the optimal design of a canonical sensing system, in terms of two elementary design principles: (1) there exists an optimal integration time, which is determined by the input statistics and the number of receptors; (2) in the optimally designed system, the number of independent concentration measurements as set by the number of receptors and the optimal integration time, equals the number of readout molecules that store these measurements, and equals the work to store these measurements reliably; no resource is then in excess and hence wasted. Applying our theory to the E.coli chemotaxis system indicates that its integration time is not only optimal for sensing shallow gradients, but also necessary to enable navigation in these gradients.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/62548</link>
	<content:encoded>While comparative functional genomic studies have shown that inter-species differences in gene expression can be explained by corresponding inter-species differences in genetic and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms, co-transcriptional mechanisms, such as alternative polyadenylation (APA), have received little attention. We characterized APA in lymphoblastoid cell lines from six humans and six chimpanzees by identifying and estimating usage for 44,432 polyadenylation sites (PAS) in 9,518 genes. Although APA is largely conserved, 1,705 genes showed significantly different PAS usage (FDR 0.05) between species. Genes with divergent APA also tend to be differentially expressed, are enriched among genes showing differences in protein translation, and can explain a subset of observed inter-species protein expression differences that do not differ at the transcript level. Finally, we found that genes with a dominant PAS, which is used more often than other PAS, are particularly enriched for differentially expressed genes.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/62329</link>
	<content:encoded>Speech processing is built upon encoding by the auditory nerve and brainstem, yet we know very little about how these processes unfold in specific subcortical structures. These structures are deep and respond quickly, making them difficult to study during ongoing speech. Recent techniques begin to address this problem, but yield temporally broad responses with consequently ambiguous neural origins. Here we describe a method that pairs re-synthesized 'peaky' speech with deconvolution analysis of EEG recordings. We show that in adults with normal hearing, the method quickly yields robust responses whose component waves reflect activity from distinct subcortical structures spanning auditory nerve to rostral brainstem. We further demonstrate the versatility of peaky speech by simultaneously measuring bilateral and ear-specific responses across different frequency bands, and discuss important practical considerations such as talker choice. The peaky speech method holds promise as a tool for investigating speech encoding and processing, and for clinical applications.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/62243</link>
	<content:encoded>Cohesin helps mediate sister chromatid cohesion, chromosome condensation, DNA repair and transcription regulation. We exploited proximity-dependent labeling to define the &lt;i&gt;in vivo &lt;/i&gt;interactions of cohesin domains with DNA or with other cohesin domains that lie within the same or in different cohesin complexes. Our results suggest both cohesin's head and hinge domains bind to DNA, and cohesin structure is dynamic with differential folding of its coiled coil regions to generate butterfly confirmations. This method also reveals that cohesins form ordered clusters on and off DNA. The levels of cohesin clusters and their distribution on chromosomes are cell cycle-regulated. Cohesin clustering is likely necessary for cohesion maintenance because clustering and maintenance uniquely require the same subset of cohesin domains and the auxiliary cohesin factor Pds5p. These conclusions provide important new mechanistic and biological insights into the architecture of the cohesin complex, cohesin-cohesin interactions, and cohesin's tethering and loop extruding activities.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: HAT cofactor TRRAP modulates microtubule dynamics via SP1 signaling to prevent neurodegeneration</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61531</link>
	<content:encoded>Brain homeostasis is regulated by the viability and functionality of neurons. HAT (histone acetyltransferase) and HDAC (histone deacetylase) inhibitors have been applied to treat neurological deficits in humans; yet, the epigenetic regulation in neurodegeneration remains elusive. Mutations of HAT cofactor TRRAP (Transformation/translation domain-associated protein) cause human neuropathies, including psychosis, intellectual disability, autism and epilepsy, with unknown mechanism. Here we show that Trrap deletion in Purkinje neurons results in neurodegeneration of old mice. Integrated transcriptomics, epigenomics and proteomics reveal that TRRAP via SP1 conducts a conserved transcriptomic program. TRRAP is required for SP1 binding at the promoter proximity of target genes, especially microtubule dynamics. The ectopic expression of Stathmin3/4 ameliorates defects of TRRAP-deficient neurons, indicating that the microtubule dynamics is particularly vulnerable to the action of SP1 activity. This study unravels a network linking three well-known, but up-to-date unconnected, signaling pathways, namely TRRAP, HAT and SP1 with microtubule dynamics, in neuroprotection.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61409</link>
	<content:encoded>Blood cells arise from diverse pools of stem and progenitor cells. Understanding progenitor heterogeneity is a major challenge. The &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; larval lymph gland is a well-studied model to understand blood progenitor maintenance and recapitulates several aspects of vertebrate hematopoiesis. However in-depth analysis has focused on the anterior lobe progenitors (AP), ignoring the posterior progenitors (PP) from the posterior lobes. Using &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; expression mapping, developmental and transcriptome analysis we reveal PP heterogeneity and identify molecular-genetic tools to study this abundant progenitor population. Functional analysis shows that PP resist differentiation upon immune challenge, in a JAK-STAT-dependent manner. Upon wasp parasitism, AP downregulate JAK-STAT signaling and form lamellocytes. In contrast, we show that PP activate STAT92E and remain undifferentiated, promoting survival. &lt;i&gt;Stat92E &lt;/i&gt;knockdown or genetically reducing JAK-STAT signaling permits PP lamellocyte differentiation. We discuss how heterogeneity and compartmentalization allow functional segregation in response to systemic cues and could be widely applicable.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61406</link>
	<content:encoded>The kinase PDK1 is a crucial regulator for immune cell development by connecting PI3K to downstream AKT signaling. However, the roles of PDK1 in CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell differentiation, especially in T follicular helper (Tfh) cell, remain obscure. Here we reported PDK1 intrinsically promotes the Tfh cell differentiation and germinal center responses upon acute infection by using conditional knockout mice. PDK1 deficiency in T cells caused severe defects in both early differentiation and late maintenance of Tfh cells. The expression of key Tfh regulators was remarkably downregulated in PDK1-deficient Tfh cells, including &lt;i&gt;Tcf7&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Bcl6&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Icos&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Cxcr5&lt;/i&gt;. Mechanistically, ablation of PDK1 led to impaired phosphorylation of AKT and defective activation of mTORC1, resulting in substantially reduced expression of Hif1α and p-STAT3. Meanwhile, decreased p-AKT also suppresses mTORC2-associated GSK3β activity in PDK1-deficient Tfh cells. These integrated effects contributed to the dramatical reduced expression of TCF1 and ultimately impaired the Tfh cell differentiation.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>A vast portion of the mammalian genome is transcribed as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) acting in the cytoplasm with largely unknown functions. Surprisingly, lncRNAs have been shown to interact with ribosomes, encode peptides, or act as ribosome sponges. These functions still remain mostly undetected and understudied owing to the lack of efficient tools for genome-wide simultaneous identification of ribosome-associated and peptide-producing lncRNAs. Here we present AHARIBO, a method for the detection of lncRNAs either untranslated, but associated with ribosomes, or encoding small peptides. Using AHARIBO in mouse embryonic stem cells during neuronal differentiation, we isolated ribosome-protected RNA fragments, translated RNAs and corresponding &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; synthesized peptides. Besides identifying mRNAs under active translation and associated ribosomes, we found and distinguished lncRNAs acting as ribosome sponges or encoding micropeptides, laying the ground for a better functional understanding of hundreds lncRNAs.</content:encoded>

Evolutionary branching occurs when a population with a unimodal phenotype distribution diversifies into a multimodally distributed population consisting of two or more strains. Branching results from frequency-dependent selection, which is caused by interactions between individuals. For example, a population performing a social task may diversify into a cooperator strain and a defector strain. Branching can also occur in multi-dimensional phenotype spaces, such as when two tasks are performed simultaneously. In such cases, the strains may diverge in different directions: possible outcomes include division of labor (with each population performing one of the tasks) or the diversification into a strain that performs both tasks and another that performs neither. Here we show that the shape of the population’s phenotypic distribution plays a role in determining the direction of branching. Furthermore, we show that the shape of the distribution is, in turn, contingent on the direction of approach to the evolutionary branching point. This results in a distribution–selection feedback that is not captured in analytical models of evolutionary branching, which assume monomorphic populations. Finally, we show that this feedback can influence long-term evolutionary dynamics and promote the evolution of division of labor.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vePGOwAaJPk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Spectral similarity is used as a proxy for structural similarity in many tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) based metabolomics analyses such as library matching and molecular networking. Although weaknesses in the relationship between spectral similarity scores and the true structural similarities have been described, little development of alternative scores has been undertaken. Here, we introduce Spec2Vec, a novel spectral similarity score inspired by a natural language processing algorithm—Word2Vec. Spec2Vec learns fragmental relationships within a large set of spectral data to derive abstract spectral embeddings that can be used to assess spectral similarities. Using data derived from GNPS MS/MS libraries including spectra for nearly 13,000 unique molecules, we show how Spec2Vec scores correlate better with structural similarity than cosine-based scores. We demonstrate the advantages of Spec2Vec in library matching and molecular networking. Spec2Vec is computationally more scalable allowing structural analogue searches in large databases within seconds.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_ocscd6oNk0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Contemporary accounts of the initiation of cardiac arrhythmias typically rely on after-depolarizations as the trigger for reentrant activity. The after-depolarizations are usually triggered by calcium entry or spontaneous release within the cells of the myocardium or the conduction system. Here we propose an alternative mechanism whereby arrhythmias are triggered autonomously by cardiac cells that fail to repolarize after a normal heartbeat. We investigated the proposal by representing the heart as an excitable medium of FitzHugh-Nagumo cells where a proportion of cells were capable of remaining depolarized indefinitely. As such, those cells exhibit bistable membrane dynamics. We found that heterogeneous media can tolerate a surprisingly large number of bistable cells and still support normal rhythmic activity. Yet there is a critical limit beyond which the medium is persistently arrhythmogenic. Numerical analysis revealed that the critical threshold for arrhythmogenesis depends on both the strength of the coupling between cells and the extent to which the abnormal cells resist repolarization. Moreover, arrhythmogenesis was found to emerge preferentially at tissue boundaries where cells naturally have fewer neighbors to influence their behavior. These findings may explain why atrial fibrillation typically originates from tissue boundaries such as the cuff of the pulmonary vein.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GZThKKbT5Ss&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Estimating the extrinsic incubation period of malaria using a mechanistic model of sporogony</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Isaac J. Stopard, Thomas S. Churcher, Ben Lambert&lt;/p&gt;

During sporogony, malaria-causing parasites infect a mosquito, reproduce and migrate to the mosquito salivary glands where they can be transmitted the next time blood feeding occurs. The time required for sporogony, known as the extrinsic incubation period (EIP), is an important determinant of malaria transmission intensity. The EIP is typically estimated as the time for a given percentile, &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;, of infected mosquitoes to develop salivary gland sporozoites (the infectious parasite life stage), which is denoted by EIP&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;. Many mechanisms, however, affect the observed sporozoite prevalence including the human-to-mosquito transmission probability and possibly differences in mosquito mortality according to infection status. To account for these various mechanisms, we present a mechanistic mathematical model, which explicitly models key processes at the parasite, mosquito and observational scales. Fitting this model to experimental data, we find greater variation in the EIP than previously thought: we estimated the range between EIP&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; and EIP&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt; (at 27°C) as 4.5 days compared to 0.9 days using existing statistical methods. This pattern holds over the range of study temperatures included in the dataset. Increasing temperature from 21°C to 34°C decreased the EIP&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; from 16.1 to 8.8 days. Our work highlights the importance of mechanistic modelling of sporogony to (1) improve estimates of malaria transmission under different environmental conditions or disease control programs and (2) evaluate novel interventions that target the mosquito life stages of the parasite.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/P_9bHRHfPkU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Developmental mechanisms that canalize or compensate perturbations of organismal development (targeted or compensatory growth) are widely considered a prerequisite of individual health and the evolution of complex life, but little is known about the nature of these mechanisms. It is even unclear if and how a “target trajectory” of individual development is encoded in the organism’s genetic-developmental system or, instead, emerges as an epiphenomenon. Here we develop a statistical model of developmental canalization based on an extended autoregressive model. We show that under certain assumptions the strength of canalization and the amount of canalized variance in a population can be estimated, or at least approximated, from longitudinal phenotypic measurements, even if the target trajectories are unobserved. We extend this model to multivariate measures and discuss reifications of the ensuing parameter matrix. We apply these approaches to longitudinal geometric morphometric data on human postnatal craniofacial size and shape as well as to the size of the frontal sinuses. Craniofacial size showed strong developmental canalization during the first 5 years of life, leading to a 50% reduction of cross-sectional size variance, followed by a continual increase in variance during puberty. Frontal sinus size, by contrast, did not show any signs of canalization. Total variance of craniofacial shape decreased slightly until about 5 years of age and increased thereafter. However, different features of craniofacial shape showed very different developmental dynamics. Whereas the relative dimensions of the nasopharynx showed strong canalization and a reduction of variance throughout postnatal development, facial orientation continually increased in variance. Some of the signals of canalization may owe to independent variation in developmental timing of cranial components, but our results indicate evolved, partly mechanically induced mechanisms of canalization that ensure properly sized upper airways and facial dimensions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4y09YcAbHEY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Short QT (SQT) syndrome is a genetic cardiac disorder characterized by an abbreviated QT interval of the patient’s electrocardiogram. The syndrome is associated with increased risk of arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death and can arise from a number of ion channel mutations. Cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells generated from SQT patients (SQT hiPSC-CMs) provide promising platforms for testing pharmacological treatments directly in human cardiac cells exhibiting mutations specific for the syndrome. However, a difficulty is posed by the relative immaturity of hiPSC-CMs, with the possibility that drug effects observed in SQT hiPSC-CMs could be very different from the corresponding drug effect &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. In this paper, we apply a multistep computational procedure for translating measured drug effects from these cells to human QT response. This process first detects drug effects on individual ion channels based on measurements of SQT hiPSC-CMs and then uses these results to estimate the drug effects on ventricular action potentials and QT intervals of adult SQT patients. We find that the procedure is able to identify IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values in line with measured values for the four drugs quinidine, ivabradine, ajmaline and mexiletine. In addition, the predicted effect of quinidine on the adult QT interval is in good agreement with measured effects of quinidine for adult patients. Consequently, the computational procedure appears to be a useful tool for helping predicting adult drug responses from pure &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; measurements of patient derived cell lines.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sl_Dbunfe48&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Sweating is a basic skin function in body temperature control. In sweat glands, salt excretion and reabsorption are regulated to avoid electrolyte imbalance. To date, the mechanism underlying such regulation is not fully understood. Corin is a transmembrane protease that activates atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), a cardiac hormone essential for normal blood volume and pressure. Here, we report an unexpected role of corin in sweat glands to promote sweat and salt excretion in regulating electrolyte homeostasis. In human and mouse eccrine sweat glands, corin and ANP are expressed in the luminal epithelial cells. In corin-deficient mice on normal- and high-salt diets, sweat and salt excretion is reduced. This phenotype is associated with enhanced epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) activity that mediates Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and water reabsorption. Treatment of amiloride, an ENaC inhibitor, normalizes sweat and salt excretion in corin-deficient mice. Moreover, treatment of aldosterone decreases sweat and salt excretion in wild-type (WT), but not corin-deficient, mice. These results reveal an important regulatory function of corin in eccrine sweat glands to promote sweat and salt excretion.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/sT336htC_cM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Calcitonin gene‐related peptide (CGRP) and the purinergic receptor P2X3 (P2X3R) label relatively distinct populations of nociceptors in the rodent dorsal root ganglion (DRG). These two unique populations, known as the peptidergic and non‐peptidergic nociceptors, innervate different lamina of the rodent spinal dorsal horn. However, contrary to previous reports in rodent, we find that CGRP and P2X3R are highly co‐expressed in the human DRG and terminate in the same laminae (laminae 1–2) of the spinal dorsal horn. Additionally, we find that other markers such as TrpV1 and Nav1.7 are more widely expressed in human and innervate laminae 1–2 of the spinal dorsal horn. Our findings are consistent with the known polymodal nature of most primate nociceptors and indicate that sensory neurons and their central projections are different between mice and humans.







Abstract
Peripheral sensory neurons are characterized by their size, molecular profiles, and physiological responses to specific stimuli. In mouse, the peptidergic and non‐peptidergic subsets of nociceptors are distinct and innervate different lamina of the spinal dorsal horn. The unique molecular signature and neuroanatomical organization of these neurons supports a labeled line theory for certain types of nociceptive stimuli. However, long‐standing evidence supports the polymodal nature of nociceptors in many species. We have recently shown that the peptidergic marker, CGRP, and the non‐peptidergic marker, P2X3R, show largely overlapping expression at the mRNA level in human dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Herein, our aim was to assess the protein distribution of nociceptor markers, including their central projections, in the human DRG and spinal cord. Using DRGs obtained from organ donors, we observed that CGRP and P2X3R were co‐expressed by approximately 33% of human DRG neurons and TrpV1 was expressed in ~60% of human DRG neurons. In the dorsal spinal cord, CGRP, P2X3R, TrpV1, and Nav1.7 proteins stained the entirety of lamina 1–2, with only P2XR3 showing a gradient of expression. This was confirmed by measuring the size of the substantia gelatinosa using Hematoxylin and Eosin staining of adjacent sections. Our findings are consistent with the known polymodal nature of most primate nociceptors and indicate that the central projection patterns of nociceptors are different between mice and humans. Elucidating how human nociceptors connect to subsets of dorsal horn neurons will be important for understanding the physiological consequences of these species differences.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Insider threats are the cyber attacks from within the trusted entities of an
organization. Lack of real-world data and issue of data imbalance leave insider
threat analysis an understudied research area. To mitigate the effect of skewed
class distribution and prove the potential of multinomial classification
algorithms for insider threat detection, we propose an approach that combines
generative model with supervised learning to perform multi-class classification
using deep learning. The generative adversarial network (GAN) based insider
detection model introduces Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) to
enrich minority class samples to provide data for multi-class anomaly
detection. The comprehensive experiments performed on the benchmark dataset
demonstrates the effectiveness of introducing GAN derived synthetic data and
the capability of multi-class anomaly detection in insider activity analysis.
Moreover, the method is compared with other existing methods against different

projected gradient descent over the space of balanced networks; (2)
neuron-specific updates, where the step size sets the angle through which each
neuron's hyperplane turns. The paper concludes by discussing how this geometric
connection between architecture and optimisation may impact theories of
generalisation in deep learning.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: EEGs disclose significant brain activity correlated with synaptic fickleness. (arXiv:2102.07036v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07036</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We here study a network of synaptic relations mingling excitatory and
inhibitory neuron nodes that displays oscillations quite similar to
electroencephalogram (EEG) brain waves, and identify abrupt variations brought
about by swift synaptic mediations. We thus conclude that corresponding changes
in EEG series surely come from the slowdown of the activity in neuron
populations due to synaptic restrictions. The latter happens to generate an
imbalance between excitation and inhibition causing a quick explosive increase
of excitatory activity, which turns out to be a (first-order) transition among
dynamic mental phases. Besides, near this phase transition, our model system
exhibits waves with a strong component in the so-called \textit{delta-theta
domain} that coexist with fast oscillations. These findings provide a simple
explanation for the observed \textit{delta-gamma} and \textit{theta-gamma
modulation} in actual brains, and open a serious and versatile path to
understand deeply large amounts of apparently erratic, easily accessible brain
data.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Widespread Decoding of Tactile Input Patterns Among Thalamic Neurons</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.640085</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Whereas, there is data to support that cuneothalamic projections predominantly reach a topographically confined volume of the rat thalamus, the ventroposterior lateral (VPL) nucleus, recent findings show that cortical neurons that process tactile inputs are widely distributed across the neocortex. Since cortical neurons project back to the thalamus, the latter observation would suggest that thalamic neurons could contain information about tactile inputs, in principle regardless of where in the thalamus they are located. Here we use a previously introduced electrotactile interface for producing sets of highly reproducible tactile afferent spatiotemporal activation patterns from the tip of digit 2 and record neurons throughout widespread parts of the thalamus of the anesthetized rat. We find that a majority of thalamic neurons, regardless of location, respond to single pulse tactile inputs and generate spike responses to such tactile stimulation patterns that can be used to identify which of the inputs that was provided, at above-chance decoding performance levels. Thalamic neurons with short response latency times, compatible with a direct tactile afferent input via the cuneate nucleus, were typically among the best decoders. Thalamic neurons with longer response latency times as a rule were also found to be able to decode the digit 2 inputs, though typically at a lower decoding performance than the thalamic neurons with presumed direct cuneate inputs. These findings provide support for that tactile information arising from any specific skin area is widely available in the thalamocortical circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Beta2 Oscillations in Hippocampal-Cortical Circuits During Novelty Detection</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.617388</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Novelty detection is a core feature of behavioral adaptation and involves cascades of neuronal responses—from initial evaluation of the stimulus to the encoding of new representations—resulting in the behavioral ability to respond to unexpected inputs. In the past decade, a new important novelty detection feature, beta2 (~20–30 Hz) oscillations, has been described in the hippocampus (HC). However, the interactions between beta2 and the hippocampal network are unknown, as well as the role—or even the presence—of beta2 in other areas involved with novelty detection. In this work, we combined multisite local field potential (LFP) recordings with novelty-related behavioral tasks in mice to describe the oscillatory dynamics associated with novelty detection in the CA1 region of the HC, parietal cortex, and mid-prefrontal cortex. We found that transient beta2 power increases were observed only during interaction with novel contexts and objects, but not with familiar contexts and objects. Also, robust theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling was observed during the exploration of novel environments. Surprisingly, bursts of beta2 power had strong coupling with the phase of delta-range oscillations. Finally, the parietal and mid-frontal cortices had strong coherence with the HC in both theta and beta2. These results highlight the importance of beta2 oscillations in a larger hippocampal-cortical circuit, suggesting that beta2 plays a role in the mechanism for detecting and modulating behavioral adaptation to novelty.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.616163</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This study adopted diffusion tensor imaging to detect alterations in the diffusion parameters of the white matter fiber in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and used quantitative susceptibility mapping to detect changes in magnetic susceptibility. However, whether the changes of susceptibility values due to excessive iron in the basal ganglia have correlations with the alterations of the diffusion properties of the white matter in patients with AD are still unknown. We aim to investigate the correlations among magnetic susceptibility values of the basal ganglia, diffusion indexes of the white matter, and cognitive function in patients with AD. Thirty patients with AD and nineteen healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. Diffusion indexes of the whole brain were detected using tract-based spatial statistics. The caudate nucleus, putamen, and globus pallidus were selected as regions of interest, and their magnetic susceptibility values were measured. Compared with HCs, patients with AD showed that there were significantly increased axial diffusivity (AxD) in the internal capsule, superior corona radiata (SCR), and right anterior corona radiata (ACR); increased radial diffusivity (RD) in the right anterior limb of the internal capsule, ACR, and genu of the corpus callosum (GCC); and decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the right ACR and GCC. The alterations of RD values, FA values, and susceptibility values of the right caudate nucleus in patients with AD were correlated with cognitive scores. Besides, AxD values in the right internal capsule, ACR, and SCR were positively correlated with the magnetic susceptibility values of the right caudate nucleus in patients with AD. Our findings revealed that the magnetic susceptibility of the caudate nucleus may be an MRI-based biomarker of the cognitive dysfunction of AD and abnormal excessive iron distribution in the basal ganglia had adverse effects on the diffusion properties of the white matter.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Early- and late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients often exhibit distinct features. We sought to compare overall white matter connectivity and evaluate the pathological factors (amyloid, tau, and vascular pathologies) that affect the disruption of connectivity in these two groups. A total of 50 early- and 38 late-onset AD patients, as well as age-matched cognitively normal participants, were enrolled and underwent diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging to construct fractional anisotropy-weighted white matter connectivity maps. [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]-THK5351 PET, [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]-Flutemetamol PET, and magnetic resonance imaging were used for the evaluation of tau and related astrogliosis, amyloid, and small vessel disease markers (lacunes and white matter hyperintensities). Cluster-based statistics was performed for connectivity comparisons and correlation analysis between connectivity disruption and the pathological markers. Both patient groups exhibited significantly disrupted connectivity compared to their control counterparts with distinct patterns. Only THK retention was related to connectivity disruption in early-onset AD patients, and this disruption showed correlations with most cognitive scores, while late-onset AD patients had disrupted connectivity correlated with amyloid deposition, white matter hyperintensities, and lacunes in which only a few cognitive scores showed associations. These findings suggest that the pathogenesis of connectivity disruption and its effects on cognition are distinct between EOAD and LOAD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Effects of Ocular Direct Current Stimulation on Full Field Electroretinogram</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.606557</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Studies on weak current stimulation (1–2 mA) examine effects on neuronal cells for the treatment of neurological diseases, like depression. Ocular current stimulation showed positive effects on retinal nerve cells which indicate that neurodegenerative ocular diseases, e.g., glaucoma, can be treated with current stimulation of the eye. However, up to now it remains unclear which exact retinal cells can be influenced. During an ocular direct current stimulation, a significant reduction of the characteristic P50 amplitude of a pattern-reversal electroretinogram (PERG) was found for an anodal and a cathodal stimulation. This current stimulation effect could originate from the modulation of pre-ganglion cell activity or by changes in local ON and OFF responses of ganglion cells. For clarification, we investigate acute direct current stimulation effects on a full field electroretinogram (ERG), which represents the activity of pre-ganglion cells (specifically cones and bipolar cells). The ERG from 15 subjects was evaluated before (ERG 1) and during (ERG 2) an ocular direct current stimulation with 800 μA over 5 min. The current was applied through a ring rubber electrode placed around the eye and a 25 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; rubber electrode placed at the ipsilateral temple. For ERG measurements, sintered Ag/AgCl skin-electrodes were positioned on the lower eyelid (active), the earlobe (reference), and the forehead (ground). The volunteers were stimulated in three independent sessions, each with a different current application (randomized order): cathodal polarity, anodal polarity (referred to the electrode around the eye), or sham stimulation. The changes between the two ERG measurements of the characteristic full field ERG amplitudes, a-wave, b-wave, and b′-wave (b-wave measured from zero line) were tested with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (α = 0.05). Comparing before to during the current stimulation for all applications, the ERG waves showed no effects on amplitudes or latencies. Furthermore, no significant difference between the cathodal, anodal, and sham stimulation could be found by a Friedman test. These results indicate an unlikely contribution of pre-ganglion cells to the previously reported stimulation effect on PERG signals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.625232</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment (naMCI), and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) are regarded to be at high risk of converting to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) can reflect functional deterioration while diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is capable of detecting white matter integrity. Our study aimed to investigate the structural and functional alterations to further reveal convergence and divergence among SCD, naMCI, and aMCI and how these contribute to cognitive deterioration.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We analyzed ALFF under slow-4 (0.027–0.073 Hz) and slow-5 (0.01–0.027 Hz) bands and white matter fiber integrity among normal controls (CN), SCD, naMCI, and aMCI groups. Correlation analyses were further utilized among paired DTI alteration, ALFF deterioration, and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;For ALFF calculation, ascended ALFF values were detected in the lingual gyrus (LING) and superior frontal gyrus (SFG) within SCD and naMCI patients, respectively. Descended ALFF values were presented mainly in the LING, SFG, middle frontal gyrus, and precuneus in aMCI patients compared to CN, SCD, and naMCI groups. For DTI analyses, white matter alterations were detected within the uncinate fasciculus (UF) in aMCI patients and within the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) in naMCI patients. SCD patients presented alterations in both fasciculi. Correlation analyses revealed that the majority of these structural and functional alterations were associated with complicated cognitive decline. Besides, UF alterations were correlated with ALFF deterioration in the SFG within aMCI patients.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusions&lt;p&gt;SCD shares structurally and functionally deteriorative characteristics with aMCI and naMCI, and tends to convert to either of them. Furthermore, abnormalities in white matter fibers may be the structural basis of abnormal brain activation in preclinical AD stages. Combined together, it suggests that structural and functional integration may characterize the preclinical AD progression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Preserving Right Pre-motor and Posterior Prefrontal Cortices Contribute to Maintaining Overall Basic Emotion</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.612890</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Basic emotions such as happiness, sadness, and anger are universal, regardless of the human species, and are governed by specific brain regions. A recent report revealed that mentalizing, which is the ability to estimate other individuals’ emotional states via facial expressions, can be preserved with the help of awake surgery. However, it is still questionable whether we can maintain the ability to understand others’ emotions by preserving the positive mapping sites of intraoperative assessment. Here, we demonstrated the cortical regions related to basic emotions via awake surgery for patients with frontal glioma and investigated the usefulness of functional mapping in preserving basic emotion. Of the 56 consecutive patients with right cerebral hemispheric glioma who underwent awake surgery at our hospital, intraoperative assessment of basic emotion could be successfully performed in 22 patients with frontal glioma and were included in our study. During surgery, positive responses were found in 18 points in 12 patients (54.5%). Of these, 15 points from 11 patients were found at the cortical level, mainly the premotor and posterior part of the prefrontal cortices. Then, we focused on cortical 15 positive mappings with 40 stimulations and investigated the types of emotions that showed errors by every stimulation. There was no specific rule for the region-emotional type, which was beyond our expectations. In the postoperative acute phase, the test score of basic emotion declined in nine patients, and of these, it decreased under the cut-off value (Z-score ≤ −1.65) in three patients. Although the total score declined significantly just after surgery (p = 0.022), it recovered within 3 months postoperatively. Our study revealed that through direct electrical stimulation (DES), the premotor and posterior parts of the prefrontal cortices are related to various kinds of basic emotion, but not a single one. When the region with a positive mapping site is preserved during operation, basic emotion function might be maintained although it declines transiently after surgery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Brain Inspired Sequences Production by Spiking Neural Networks With Reward-Modulated STDP</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.612041</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Understanding and producing embedded sequences according to supra-regular grammars in language has always been considered a high-level cognitive function of human beings, named “syntax barrier” between humans and animals. However, some neurologists recently showed that macaques could be trained to produce embedded sequences involving supra-regular grammars through a well-designed experiment paradigm. Via comparing macaques and preschool children's experimental results, they claimed that human uniqueness might only lie in the speed and learning strategy resulting from the chunking mechanism. Inspired by their research, we proposed a Brain-inspired Sequence Production Spiking Neural Network (SP-SNN) to model the same production process, followed by memory and learning mechanisms of the multi-brain region cooperation. After experimental verification, we demonstrated that SP-SNN could also handle embedded sequence production tasks, striding over the “syntax barrier.” SP-SNN used Population-Coding and STDP mechanism to realize working memory, Reward-Modulated STDP mechanism for acquiring supra-regular grammars. Therefore, SP-SNN needs to simultaneously coordinate short-term plasticity (STP) and long-term plasticity (LTP) mechanisms. Besides, we found that the chunking mechanism indeed makes a difference in improving our model's robustness. As far as we know, our work is the first one toward the “syntax barrier” in the SNN field, providing the computational foundation for further study of related underlying animals' neural mechanisms in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

In this study, we have designed an EEG paradigm well suited for deployment “in the wild.” The paradigm is tested in repeated recordings on 20 subjects, on eight different occasions (4 in the laboratory, 4 in the subject's own home). By calculating the inter subject, intra subject and inter location variance, we find that the inter location variation for this paradigm is considerably less than the inter subject variation. We believe the paradigm is representative of a large group of other relevant paradigms. This means that given the positive results in this study, we find that if a research paradigm would benefit from being performed in less controlled environments, we expect limited problems in doing so.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The ability to identify and avoid environmental stimuli that signal danger is essential to survival. Our understanding of how the brain encodes aversive behaviors has been primarily focused on roles for the amygdala, hippocampus (HIPP), prefrontal cortex, ventral midbrain, and ventral striatum. Relatively little attention has been paid to contributions from the dorsal striatum (DS) to aversive learning, despite its well-established role in stimulus-response learning. Here, we review studies exploring the role of DS in aversive learning, including different roles for the dorsomedial and dorsolateral striatum in Pavlovian fear conditioning as well as innate and inhibitory avoidance (IA) behaviors. We outline how future investigation might determine specific contributions from DS subregions, cell types, and connections that contribute to aversive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Neuroprotective Effects of Exercise Postconditioning After Stroke via SIRT1-Mediated Suppression of Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) Stress</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.598230</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;While it is well-known that pre-stroke exercise conditioning reduces the incidence of stroke and the development of comorbidities, it is unclear whether post-stroke exercise conditioning is also neuroprotective. The present study investigated whether exercise postconditioning (PostE) induced neuroprotection and elucidated the involvement of SIRT1 regulation on the ROS/ER stress pathway. Adult rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by either: (1) resting; (2) mild exercise postconditioning (MPostE); or (3) intense exercise postconditioning (IPostE). PostE was initiated 24 h after reperfusion and performed on a treadmill. At 1 and 3 days thereafter, we determined infarct volumes, neurological defects, brain edema, apoptotic cell death through measuring pro- (BAX and Caspase-3) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2) proteins, and ER stress through the measurement of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), inositol-requiring 1α (IRE1α), protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), Caspase-12, and SIRT1. Proteins were measured by Western blot. ROS production was detected by flow cytometry.Compared to resting rats, both MPostE and IPostE significantly decreased brain infarct volumes and edema, neurological deficits, ROS production, and apoptotic cell death. MPostE further increased Bcl-2 expression and Bcl-2/BAX ratio as well as BAX and Caspase-3 expressions and ROS production (*p &amp;lt; 0.05). Both PostE groups saw decreases in ER stress proteins, while MPostE demonstrated a further reduction in GRP78 (***p &amp;lt; 0.001) and Caspase-12 (*p &amp;lt; 0.05) expressions at 1 day and IRE1α (**p &amp;lt; 0.01) and CHOP (*p &amp;lt; 0.05) expressions at 3 days. Additionally, both PostE groups saw significant increases in SIRT1 expression.In this study, both mild and intense PostE levels induced neuroprotection after stroke through SIRT1 and ROS/ER stress pathway. Additionally, the results may provide a base for our future study regarding the regulation of SIRT1 on the ROS/ER stress pathway in the biochemical processes underlying post-stroke neuroprotection. The results suggest that mild exercise postconditioning might play a similar neuroprotective role as intensive exercise and could be an effective exercise strategy as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Multiple Regionalized Genes and Their Putative Networks in the Interpeduncular Nucleus Suggest Complex Mechanisms of Neuron Development and Axon Guidance</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.643320</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) is a highly conserved limbic structure in the vertebrate brain, located in the isthmus and rhombomere 1. It is formed by various populations that migrate from different sites to the distinct domains within the IPN: the prodromal, rostral interpeduncular, and caudal interpeduncular nuclei. The aim here was to identify genes that are differentially expressed across these domains, characterizing their putative functional roles and interactions. To this end, we screened the 2,038 genes in the Allen Developing Mouse Brain Atlas database expressed at E18.5 and we identified 135 genes expressed within the IPN. The functional analysis of these genes highlighted an overrepresentation of gene families related to neuron development, cell morphogenesis and axon guidance. The interactome analysis within each IPN domain yielded specific networks that mainly involve members of the ephrin/Eph and Cadherin families, transcription factors and molecules related to synaptic neurotransmission. These results bring to light specific mechanisms that might participate in the formation, molecular regionalization, axon guidance and connectivity of the different IPN domains. This genoarchitectonic model of the IPN enables data on gene expression and interactions to be integrated and interpreted, providing a basis for the further study of the connectivity and function of this poorly understood nuclear complex under both normal and pathological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Accruing positron emission tomography (PET) studies have suggested that dopaminergic functioning and metabolic changes are correlated with cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Yet, the relationship between dopaminergic or cerebral metabolism and different cognitive domains in PD is poorly understood. To address this scarcity, we aimed to investigate the interactions among dopaminergic bindings, metabolic network changes, and the cognitive domains in PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We recruited 41 PD patients, including PD patients with no cognitive impairment (PD-NC; n = 21) and those with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI; n = 20). All patients underwent clinical evaluations and a schedule of neuropsychological tests and underwent both 11C-N-2-carbomethoxy-3-(4-fluorophenyl)-tropane (11C-CFT) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET imaging.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;11C-CFT imaging revealed a significant positive correlation between executive function and striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) binding at both the voxel and regional levels. Metabolic imaging revealed that executive function correlated with 18F-FDG uptake, mainly in inferior frontal gyrus, putamen, and insula. Further analysis indicated that striatal DAT binding correlated strictly with metabolic activity in the temporal gyrus, medial frontal gyrus, and cingulate gyrus.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our findings might promote the understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.589299</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;It has been suggested that physical inactivity and lack of stimulating cognitive activity are the two most significant modifiable risk factors to impair cognitive function. Although many studies that investigated the cognitive effects of physical exercise and cognitive stimuli in dual-task conditions showed improved cognitive performance, others have not confirmed these findings. The main aim of the present work is to analyze the effects of a dual-task multimodal physical exercise training, at moderate intensity, and cognitive stimulation on cognitive and physical function in healthy older adults.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;This clinical trial was registered on the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (RBR-9zrx3d). Here we tested the effects of a dual-task multimodal physical exercise training, at moderate intensity, on cognitive and physical function and quality of life in community dwelling older adults. The training protocol included 24 group sessions, 2/week, per 75 min. Cognition was assessed using CANTAB automated neuropsychological tests and Functional Capacity to Exercise tests. Performance was compared from baseline to post intervention and to a non-exercise control group using Mixed Linear Model for repeated measures.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Control (CG) and dual-task (DTEx) groups progressed differentially over time on performance of episodic memory, sustained visual attention, functional mobility, cardiorespiratory fitness, lower limbs strength resistance, agility, quality of life and dual-task performance with significant improved DTEx performance. Control group did not show any significant changes on these tests except for showing a reduction in dual-task performance.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;We suggest that the dual-task combination of multisensory cognitive stimulation and multimodal moderate physical exercise training, twice a week, may be adopted as an effective program to reduce progression of age-related cognitive decline and improve physical fitness and quality of life on healthy older adults.&lt;/p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration&lt;p&gt;Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials: https://ensaiosclinicos.gov.br/rg/RBR-9zrx3d -UTN code: U1111-1233-6349.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Structural basis of Stu2 recruitment to yeast kinetochores</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65389</link>
	<content:encoded>Chromosome segregation during cell division requires engagement of kinetochores of sister chromatids with microtubules emanating from opposite poles. As the corresponding microtubules shorten, these 'bioriented' sister kinetochores experience tension-dependent stabilization of microtubule attachments. The yeast XMAP215 family member and microtubule polymerase, Stu2, associates with kinetochores and contributes to tension-dependent stabilization in vitro. We show here that a C-terminal segment of Stu2 binds the four-way junction of the Ndc80 complex (Ndc80c) and that residues conserved both in yeast Stu2 orthologs and in their metazoan counterparts make specific contacts with Ndc80 and Spc24. Mutations that perturb this interaction prevent association of Stu2 with kinetochores, impair cell viability, produce biorientation defects, and delay cell cycle progression. Ectopic tethering of the mutant Stu2 species to the Ndc80c junction restores wild-type function in vivo. These findings show that the role of Stu2 in tension-sensing depends on its association with kinetochores by binding with Ndc80c.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64693</link>
	<content:encoded>While beige adipocytes have been found to associate with dense sympathetic neurites in mouse inguinal subcutaneous white fat (iWAT), little is known about when and how this patterning is established. Here, we applied whole-tissue imaging to examine the development of sympathetic innervation in iWAT. We found that parenchymal neurites actively grow between postnatal day 6 (P6) and P28, overlapping with early postnatal beige adipogenesis. Constitutive deletion of &lt;i&gt;Prdm16&lt;/i&gt; in adipocytes led to a significant reduction in early postnatal beige adipocytes and sympathetic density within this window. Using an inducible, adipocyte-specific &lt;i&gt;Prdm16&lt;/i&gt; knockout model, we found that &lt;i&gt;Prdm16&lt;/i&gt; is required for guiding sympathetic growth during early development. Deleting &lt;i&gt;Prdm16&lt;/i&gt; in adult animals, however, did not affect sympathetic structure in iWAT. Together, these findings highlight that beige adipocyte-sympathetic neurite communication is crucial to establish sympathetic structure during the early postnatal period but may be dispensable for its maintenance in mature animals.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The mitochondrial carrier family protein SLC25A3 transports both copper and phosphate in mammals yet in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; the transport of these substrates is partitioned across two paralogs: PIC2 and MIR1. To understand the ancestral state of copper and phosphate transport in mitochondria, we explored the evolutionary relationships of PIC2 and MIR1 orthologs across the eukaryotic tree of life. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that PIC2-like and MIR1-like orthologs are present in all major eukaryotic supergroups, indicating an ancient gene duplication created these paralogs. To link this phylogenetic signal to protein function, we used structural modelling and site-directed mutagenesis to identify residues involved in copper and phosphate transport. Based on these analyses, we generated a L175A variant of mouse SLC25A3 that retains the ability to transport copper but not phosphate. This work highlights the utility of using an evolutionary framework to uncover amino acids involved in substrate recognition by mitochondrial carrier family proteins.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64684</link>
	<content:encoded>The mature cerebellum controls motor skill precision and participates in other sophisticated brain functions that include learning, cognition, and speech. Different types of GABAergic and glutamatergic cerebellar neurons originate in temporal order from two progenitor niches, the ventricular zone and rhombic lip, which express the transcription factors Ptf1a and Atoh1, respectively. However, the molecular machinery required to specify the distinct neuronal types emanating from these progenitor zones is still unclear. Here, we uncover the transcription factor Olig3 as a major determinant in generating the earliest neuronal derivatives emanating from both progenitor zones in mice. In the rhombic lip, Olig3 regulates progenitor cell proliferation. In the ventricular zone, Olig3 safeguards Purkinje cell specification by curtailing the expression of Pax2, a transcription factor that suppresses the Purkinje cell differentiation program. Our work thus defines Olig3 as a key factor in early cerebellar development.</content:encoded>

However, the elucidation of protein interactions occurring within highly specialised cells and tissues is challenging. Here we describe the development, and application, of a new method for proximity-dependent biotin labelling in whole zebrafish. Using a conditionally stabilised GFP-binding nanobody to target a biotin ligase to GFP-labelled proteins of interest, we show tissue-specific proteomic profiling using existing GFP-tagged transgenic zebrafish lines. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach, termed BLITZ (Biotin Labelling In Tagged Zebrafish), in diverse cell types such as neurons and vascular endothelial cells. We applied this methodology to identify interactors of caveolar coat protein, cavins, in skeletal muscle. Using this system, we defined specific interaction networks within &lt;i&gt;in vivo &lt;/i&gt;muscle cells for the closely related but functionally distinct Cavin4 and Cavin1 proteins.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64400</link>
	<content:encoded>Benzodiazepines (BZDs) are a class of widely prescribed psychotropic drugs that modulate activity of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;Rs), neurotransmitter-gated ion channels critical for synaptic transmission. However, the physical basis of this modulation is poorly understood. We explore the role of an important gating domain, the a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;M2-M3 linker, in linkage between the BZD site and pore gate. To probe energetics of this coupling without complication from bound agonist we use a gain of function mutant (a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;L9'Tb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;g&lt;sub&gt;2L&lt;/sub&gt;) directly activated by BZDs. We identify a specific residue whose mutation (a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;V279A) more than doubles the energetic contribution of the BZD positive modulator diazepam (DZ) to pore opening and also enhances DZ-potentiation of GABA-evoked currents in a wild-type background. In contrast, other linker mutations have little effect on DZ efficiency, but generally impair unliganded pore opening. Our observations reveal an important residue regulating BZD-pore linkage, thereby shedding new light on the molecular mechanism of these drugs.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Before the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic began, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) was among the top priorities for global public health. Already a complex challenge, AMR now needs to be addressed in a changing healthcare landscape. Here, we analyse how changes due to COVID-19 in terms of antimicrobial usage, infection prevention, and health systems affect the emergence, transmission, and burden of AMR. Increased hand hygiene, decreased international travel, and decreased elective hospital procedures may reduce AMR pathogen selection and spread in the short term. However, the opposite effects may be seen if antibiotics are more widely used as standard healthcare pathways break down. Over 6 months into the COVID-19 pandemic, the dynamics of AMR remain uncertain. We call for the AMR community to keep a global perspective while designing finely tuned surveillance and research to continue to improve our preparedness and response to these intersecting public health challenges.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The unique structure of the Achilles tendon, combining three smaller sub-tendons, enhances movement efficiency by allowing individual control from connected muscles. This requires compliant interfaces between sub-tendons, but compliance decreases with age and may account for increased injury frequency. Current understanding of sub-tendon sliding and its role in the whole Achilles tendon function is limited. Here we show changing the degree of sliding greatly affects the tendon mechanical behaviour. Our in vitro testing discovered distinct sub-tendon mechanical properties in keeping with their mechanical demands. In silico study based on measured properties, subject-specific tendon geometry, and modified sliding capacity demonstrated age-related displacement reduction similar to our in vivo ultrasonography measurements. Peak stress magnitude and distribution within the whole Achilles tendon are affected by individual tendon geometries, the sliding capacity between sub-tendons, and different muscle loading conditions. These results suggest clinical possibilities to identify patients at risk and design personalised rehabilitation protocols.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23308?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
While total white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been associated with hippocampal atrophy, less is known about how the regional distribution of WMH volume may differentially affect the hippocampus in healthy aging. Additionally, apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carriers may be at an increased risk for greater WMH volumes and hippocampal atrophy in aging. The present study sought to investigate whether regional WMH volume mediates the relationship between age and hippocampal volume and if this association is moderated by APOE ε4 status in a group of 190 cognitively healthy adults (APOE ε4 status [carrier/non‐carrier] = 59/131), ages 50–89. Analyses revealed that temporal lobe WMH volume significantly mediated the relationship between age and average bilateral hippocampal volume, and this effect was moderated by APOE ε4 status (−0.020 (SE = 0.009), 95% CI, [−0.039, −0.003]). APOE ε4 carriers, but not non‐carriers, showed negative indirect effects of age on hippocampal volume through temporal lobe WMH volume (APOE ε4 carriers: −0.016 (SE = 0.007), 95% CI, [−0.030, −0.003]; APOE ε4 non‐carriers: .005 (SE = 0.006), 95% CI, [−0.006, 0.017]). These findings remained significant after additionally adjusting for sex, years of education, hypertension status and duration, cholesterol status, diabetes status, Body Mass Index, history of smoking, and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale‐IV Full Scale IQ. There were no significant moderated mediation effects for frontal, parietal, and occipital lobe WMH volumes, with or without covariates. Our findings indicate that in cognitively healthy older adults, elevated WMH volume regionally localized to the temporal lobes in APOE ε4 carriers is associated with reduced hippocampal volume, suggesting greater vulnerability to brain aging and the risk for Alzheimer's disease.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>In neonatal piglets with encephalopathy from excitotoxic brain injury, fractional anisotropy from diffusion tensor imaging correlates with swollen astrocytes immunophenotyped by glutamate transporter‐1 (GLT‐1) and normal neurons with perineuronal GLT‐1+ astrocyte decorations in the striatum.







Abstract
The specific cytopathology that causes abnormal fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) after neonatal hypoxia‐ischemia (HI) is not completely understood. The panoply of cell types in the brain might contribute differentially to changes in DTI metrics. Because glia are the predominant cell type in brain, we hypothesized that changes in FA and MD would signify perturbations in glial microstructure. Using a 3‐Tesla clinical scanner, we conducted in vivo DTI MRI in nine neonatal piglets at 20–96 h after excitotoxic brain injury from striatal quinolinic acid injection or global HI. FA and MD from putamen, caudate, and internal capsule in toto were correlated with astrocyte swelling, neuronal excitotoxicity, and white matter injury. Low FA correlated with more swollen astrocytes immunophenotyped by aquaporin‐4 (AQP4), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and glutamate transporter‐1 (GLT‐1). Low FA was also related to the loss of neurons with perineuronal GLT‐1+ astrocyte decorations, large myelin swellings, lower myelin density, and oligodendrocyte cell death identified by 2′,3′‐cyclic nucleotide 3′‐phosphodiesterase, bridging integrator‐1, and nuclear morphology. MD correlated with degenerating oligodendrocytes and depletion of normal GFAP+ astrocytes but not with astrocyte or myelin swelling. We conclude that FA is associated with cytotoxic edema in astrocytes and oligodendrocyte processes as well as myelin injury at the cellular level. MD can detect glial cell death and loss, but it may not discern subtle pathology in swollen astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, or myelin. This study provides a cytopathologic basis for interpreting DTI in the neonatal brain after HI.</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Long‐term Safety and Efficacy of Eculizumab in Aquaporin‐4 IgG‐Positive NMOSD</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26049?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
During PREVENT (NCT01892345), eculizumab significantly reduced relapse risk versus placebo in patients with aquaporin‐4 immunoglobulin G‐positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (AQP4‐IgG+ NMOSD). We report an interim analysis of PREVENT's ongoing open‐label extension (OLE; NCT02003144) evaluating eculizumab's long‐term safety and efficacy.


Methods
Patients who completed PREVENT could enroll in the OLE to receive eculizumab (maintenance dose, 1200 mg/2 weeks, after a blinded induction phase). Safety and efficacy data from PREVENT and its OLE (interim data cut, July 31, 2019) were combined for this analysis.


Results
Across PREVENT and the OLE, 137 patients received eculizumab and were monitored for a median (range) of 133.3 (5.1–276.9) weeks, for a combined total of 362.3 patient‐years (PY). Treatment‐related adverse event (AE) and serious adverse event (SAE) rates were 183.5/100 PY and 8.6/100 PY, respectively. Serious infection rates were 10.2/100 PY in eculizumab‐treated patients versus 15.1/100 PY in the PREVENT placebo group. No patient developed a meningococcal infection. At 192 weeks (3.7 years), 94.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 88.6–97.3) of patients remained adjudicated relapse‐free. The adjudicated annualized relapse rate was 0.025 (95% CI, 0.013–0.048) in all eculizumab‐treated patients versus 0.350 (95% CI, 0.199–0.616) in the PREVENT placebo group. During the OLE, 37% of patients (44/119) stopped or decreased background immunosuppressive therapy use.


Interpretation
This analysis demonstrates that eculizumab's long‐term safety profile in NMOSD is consistent with its established profile across other indications. This analysis also demonstrated the sustained ability of long‐term eculizumab treatment to reduce relapse risk in patients with AQP4‐IgG+ NMOSD.

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: New Insights Into the Intricacies of Proneural Gene Regulation in the Embryonic and Adult Cerebral Cortex</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.642016</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Historically, the mammalian brain was thought to lack stem cells as no new neurons were found to be made in adulthood. That dogma changed ∼25 years ago with the identification of neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult rodent forebrain. However, unlike rapidly self-renewing mature tissues (e.g., blood, intestinal crypts, skin), the majority of adult NSCs are quiescent, and those that become ‘activated’ are restricted to a few neurogenic zones that repopulate specific brain regions. Conversely, embryonic NSCs are actively proliferating and neurogenic. Investigations into the molecular control of the quiescence-to-proliferation-to-differentiation continuum in the embryonic and adult brain have identified proneural genes encoding basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors (TFs) as critical regulators. These bHLH TFs initiate genetic programs that remove NSCs from quiescence and drive daughter neural progenitor cells (NPCs) to differentiate into specific neural cell subtypes, thereby contributing to the enormous cellular diversity of the adult brain. However, new insights have revealed that proneural gene activities are context-dependent and tightly regulated. Here we review how proneural bHLH TFs are regulated, with a focus on the murine cerebral cortex, drawing parallels where appropriate to other organisms and neural tissues. We discuss upstream regulatory events, post-translational modifications (phosphorylation, ubiquitinylation), protein–protein interactions, epigenetic and metabolic mechanisms that govern bHLH TF expression, stability, localization, and consequent transactivation of downstream target genes. These tight regulatory controls help to explain paradoxical findings of changes to bHLH activity in different cellular contexts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Insights Into the Mechanism of Tyrosine Nitration in Preventing β-Amyloid Aggregation in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.619836</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Nitration of tyrosine at the tenth residue (Tyr10) in amyloid-β (Aβ) has been reported to reduce its aggregation and neurotoxicity in our previous studies. However, the exact mechanism remains unclear. Here, we used Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; peptide with differently modified forms at Tyr10 to investigate the molecular mechanism to fill this gap. By using immunofluorescent assay, we confirmed that nitrated Aβ was found in the cortex of 10-month-old female triple transgenic mice of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). And then, we used the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) method and circular dichroism (CD) to demonstrate that the modification and mutation of Tyr10 in Aβ have little impact on conformational changes. Then, with the aids of fluorescence assays of thioflavin T and 4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and dynamic light scattering (DLS), we found that adding a large group to the phenolic ring of Tyr10 of Aβ could not inhibit Aβ fibrilization and aggregation. Nitration of Aβ reduces its aggregation mainly because it could induce the deprotonation of the phenolic hydroxyl group of Tyr10 of Aβ at physiological pH. We proposed that the negatively charged Tyr10 caused by nitration at physiological pH could interact with the salt bridge between Glu11 and His6 or His13 and block the kink around Tyr10, thereby preventing Aβ fibrilization and aggregation. These findings provide us new insights into the relationship between Tyr10 nitration and Aβ aggregation, which would help to further understand that keeping the balance of nitric oxide in vivo is important for preventing AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Common and Specific Alterations of Amygdala Subregions in Major Depressive Disorder With and Without Anxiety: A Combined Structural and Resting-State Functional MRI Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.634113</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Anxious major depressive disorder is a common subtype of major depressive disorder; however, its unique neural mechanism is not well-understood currently. Using multimodal MRI data, this study examined common and specific alterations of amygdala subregions between patients with and without anxiety. No alterations were observed in the gray matter volume or intra-region functional integration in either patient group. Compared with the controls, both patient groups showed decreased functional connectivity between the left superficial amygdala and the left putamen, and between the right superficial amygdala and the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex and medial orbitofrontal cortex, while only patients with anxiety exhibited decreased activity in the bilateral laterobasal and superficial amygdala. Moreover, the decreased activity correlated negatively with the Hamilton depression scale scores in the patients with anxiety. These findings provided insights into the pathophysiologic processes of anxious major depressive disorder and may help to develop new and effective treatment programs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: “Mickey Mousing” in the Brain: Motion-Sound Synesthesia and the Subcortical Substrate of Audio-Visual Integration</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.605166</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Motion-sound synesthesia is characterized by illusory auditory sensations linked to the pattern and rhythms of motion (dubbed “Mickey Mousing” as in cinema) of visually experienced but soundless object, like an optical flow array, a ball bouncing or a horse galloping. In an MRI study with a group of three synesthetes and a group of eighteen control participants, we found structural changes in the brains of synesthetes in the subcortical multisensory areas of the superior and inferior colliculi. In addition, functional magnetic resonance imaging data showed activity in motion-sensitive regions, as well as temporal and occipital areas, and the cerebellum. However, the synesthetes had a higher activation within the left and right cuneus, with stronger activations when viewing optical flow stimuli. There was also a general difference in connectivity of the colliculi with the above mentioned regions between the two groups. These findings implicate low-level mechanisms within the human neuroaxis as a substrate for local connectivity and cross activity between perceptual processes that are “distant” in terms of cortical topography. The present findings underline the importance of considering the role of subcortical systems and their connectivity to multimodal regions of the cortex and they strengthen a parsimonious account of synesthesia, at the least of the visual-auditory type.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Non-peptide Angiotensin-(1–7) Mimic AVE 0991 Attenuates Delayed Neurocognitive Recovery After Laparotomy by Reducing Neuroinflammation and Restoring Blood-Brain Barrier Integrity in Aged Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.624387</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Delayed neurocognitive recovery (dNCR) after surgery is a common postoperative complication in older adult patients. Our previous studies have demonstrated that cognitive impairment after surgery involves an increase in the brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activity, including overactivation of the angiotensin 2/angiotensin receptor-1 (Ang II/AT1) axis, which provokes the disruption of the hippocampal blood-brain barrier (BBB). Nevertheless, the potential role of the counter-regulatory RAS axis, the Ang-(1–7)/Mas pathway, in dNCR remains unknown. Using an aged rat model of dNCR, we dynamically investigated the activity of both axes of the RAS following laparotomy. AVE 0991, a nonpeptide analog of Ang-(1–7), was administered intranasally immediately after laparotomy. We found that the elevation of Ang II, induced by surgery was accompanied by a decrease of Ang-(1–7) in the hippocampus, but not in the circulation. Surgery also significantly downregulated hippocampal Mas receptor expression at 24 h postsurgery. Mas activation with intranasal AVE 0991 treatment significantly improved hippocampus-dependent learning and memory deficits induced by surgery. Furthermore, it attenuated hippocampal neuroinflammation, as shown by the decreased level of the microglial activation marker cluster of differentiation 11b (CD11b) and the decreased production of several inflammatory molecules. Along with these beneficial effects, the AVE 0991 treatment also alleviated the imbalance between matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP-3), modulated the expression of occludin, and alleviated the IgG extravasation, thereby restoring the integrity of the BBB. In conclusion, these data indicate that activation of Mas by AVE 0991 attenuates dNCR after surgery by reducing neuroinflammation and restoring BBB integrity. Our findings suggest that the Ang-(1–7)/Mas pathway may be a novel therapeutic target for treating dNCR after surgery in older adult patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Working Memory Training in Amnestic and Non-amnestic Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment: Preliminary Findings From Genotype Variants on Training Effects</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.624253</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Working memory training (WMT) effects may be modulated by mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subtypes, and variations in APOE-epsilon (APOE-ε) and LMX1A genotypes. Sixty-one individuals (41 men/20 women, mean age 66 years) diagnosed with MCI (31 amnestic/30 non-amnestic) and genotyped for APOE-ε and LMX1A completed 4 weeks/20–25 sessions of WMT. Cognitive functions were assessed before, 4 weeks and 16 weeks after WMT. Except for Processing Speed, the non-amnestic MCI group (naMCI) outperformed the amnestic MCI (aMCI) group in all cognitive domains across all time-points. At 4 weeks, working memory function improved in both groups (p &amp;lt; 0.0001), but at 16 weeks the effects only remained in the naMCI group. Better performance was found after training for the naMCI patients with LMX1A-AA genotype and for the APOE-ε4 carriers. Only the naMCI-APOE-ε4 group showed improved Executive Function at 16 weeks. WMT improved working memory and some non-trained cognitive functions in individuals with MCI. The naMCI group had greater training gain than aMCI group, especially in those with LMX1A-AA genotype and among APOE-ε4-carriers. Further research with larger sample sizes for the subgroups and longer follow-up evaluations is warranted.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Basal Forebrain Atrophy Is Associated With Allocentric Navigation Deficits in Subjective Cognitive Decline</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.596025</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) are at higher risk of incipient Alzheimer's disease (AD). Spatial navigation (SN) impairments in AD dementia and mild cognitive impairment patients have been well-documented; however, studies investigating SN deficits in SCD subjects are still lacking. This study aimed to explore whether basal forebrain (BF) and entorhinal cortex (EC) atrophy contribute to spatial disorientation in the SCD stage. In total, 31 SCD subjects and 24 normal controls were enrolled and administered cognitive scales, a 2-dimensional computerized SN test, and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning. We computed the differences in navigation distance errors and volumes of BF subfields, EC, and hippocampus between the SCD and control groups. The correlations between MRI volumetry and navigation distance errors were also calculated. Compared with the controls, the SCD subjects performed worse in both egocentric and allocentric navigation. The SCD group showed volume reductions in the whole BF (p &amp;lt; 0.05, uncorrected) and the Ch4p subfield (p &amp;lt; 0.05, Bonferroni corrected), but comparable EC and hippocampal volumes with the controls. In the SCD cohort, the allocentric errors were negatively correlated with total BF (r = −0.625, p &amp;lt; 0.001), Ch4p (r = −0.625, p &amp;lt; 0.001), total EC (r = −0.423, p = 0.031), and left EC volumes (r = −0.442, p = 0.024), adjusting for age, gender, years of education, total intracranial volume, and hippocampal volume. This study demonstrates that SN deficits and BF atrophy may be promising indicators for the early detection of incipient AD patients. The reduced BF volume, especially in the Ch4p subfield, may serve as a structural basis for allocentric disorientation in SCD subjects independent of hippocampal atrophy. Our findings may have further implications for the preclinical diagnosis and intervention for potential AD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Integrity of the Prefronto-striato-thalamo-prefrontal Loop Predicts Tai Chi Chuan Training Effects on Cognitive Task-switching in Middle-aged and Older Adults</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.602191</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tai Chi Chuan (TCC) exercise has been shown to improve cognitive task-switching performance in older adults, but the extent of this positive effect varies among individuals. Past research also shows that brain white matter integrity could predict behavioral gains of cognitive and motor learning. Therefore, in this randomized controlled trial (NCT02270320), we examined whether baseline integrity of three target white matter tract groups was predictive of task-switching improvement after 12-week TCC training in middle-aged and older adults. Thirty-eight eligible participants were randomly assigned to a TCC group (n = 19) and a control group (n = 19). Cognitive task-switching and physical performances were collected before and after training. Brain diffusion spectrum MR images were acquired before training and the general fractional anisotropy (GFA) of each target white matter tract group was calculated to indicate baseline white matter integrity of that group. Correlation and regression analyses between these GFAs and post-training task-switching improvement were analyzed using adjusted p-values. After 12 weeks, significant task-switching and physical performance improvements were found only in the TCC group. Moreover, higher baseline GFA of the prefronto-striato-thalamo-prefrontal loop fibers (r = −0.63, p = 0.009), but not of the prefronto-parietal/occipital (r = −0.55, p = 0.026) and callosal (r = −0.35, p = 0.189) fiber groups, was associated with greater reductions of task-switching errors after the TCC training. Multiple regression analysis revealed that baseline GFA of the prefronto-striato-thalamo-prefrontal loop fibers was the only independent white matter integrity predictor of task-switching error reductions after TCC training (β = −0.620, adjusted R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; change = 0.265, p = 0.009). These findings not only highlight the important role of baseline integrity of the prefronto-striatal circuits in influencing the extent of positive cognitive task-switching effects from short-term TCC training, but also implicate that preserving good white matter integrity in the aging process may be crucial in order to gain the best cognitive effects of exercise interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Common X‐chromosome variants are associated with Parkinson's disease risk</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26051?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Identify genetic variants on the X‐chromosome associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) risk.


Methods
We performed an X‐chromosome‐wide association study (XWAS) of PD risk by meta‐analyzing results from sex‐stratified analyses. To avoid spurious associations, we designed a specific harmonization pipeline for the X‐chromosome and focused on a European ancestry sample. We included 11,142 cases, 280,164 controls, and 5,379 proxy cases, based on parental history of PD. Additionally, we tested the association of significant variants with: (i) PD risk in an independent replication with 1,561 cases and 2,465 controls, and (ii) putamen volume in 33,360 individuals from the UK Biobank.


Results
In the discovery meta‐analysis, we identified: rs7066890 (OR=1.10 [1.06‐1.14]; P=2.2x10‐9) intron of GPM6B, and rs28602900 (OR=1.10 [1.07‐1.14]; P=1.6x10‐8) in a high gene density region including RPL10, ATP6A1, FAM50A, PLXNA3. The rs28602900 association with PD was replicated (OR=1.16 [1.03‐1.30]; P=0.016) and shown to colocalize with a significant expression quantitative locus (eQTL) regulating RPL10 expression in the putamen and other brain tissues in GTEx. Additionally, the rs28602900 locus was found to be associated with reduced brain putamen volume. No results reached genome‐wide significance in the sex‐stratified analyses.


Interpretation
We report the first XWAS of PD and identify two genome‐wide significant loci. The rs28602900 association replicated in an independent PD dataset and showed concordant effects in its association with putamen volume. Critically, rs26802900 is a significant eQTL of RPL10.These results support a role for ribosomal proteins in PD pathogenesis and show that the X‐chromosome contributes to PD genetic risk.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: LUZP4 autoantibody: A novel germ cell tumor and paraneoplastic biomarker</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26050?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
To describe a novel biomarker of germ‐cell tumor and associated paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS).


Methods
Archival sera from patients with germ‐cell tumor associated PNS were evaluated. We identified a common autoantigen in a human testicular‐cancer cell line (TCam‐2) by western blot and mass spectrometry. Its identity was confirmed by recombinant‐protein western blot, ELISA and cell based assay. Autoantibody specificity was confirmed by analyzing assorted control sera/CSF.


Results
Leucine zipper 4 (LUZP4)‐IgG was detected in 28 patients’ sera, 26 of whom (93%) were men. The median age at neurological symptom onset was 45 years (range 28‐84). Median titer (ELISA) was 1:300 (1:50 to &amp;gt;1:6400; normal value &amp;lt;1:50). Co‐existent Kelch‐like protein 11‐IgG was identified in 18 cases (64%). The most common presenting phenotype was rhombencephalitis (17/28; 61%). Other presentations included limbic encephalitis (n=5, 18%), seizures and/or encephalitis (n=2, 7%) and motor neuronopathy/polyradiculopathy (n=4, 14%). The most common malignancy among cancer‐evaluated PNS patients was seminoma (21/27; 78%). Nine of the 21 seminomas detected by whole‐body FDG‐PET scan (43%) were extra‐testicular. Both female patients had ovarian teratoma. Regressed testicular germ‐cell tumors were found in four patients. Exposure of T‐cell‐dendritic‐cell co‐cultures from chronic immunosuppression naïve LUZP4‐IgG‐seropositive patients to recombinant LUZP4 protein evoked a marked increase in CD69‐expression on both CD4+ and CD8+ T‐cells when compared to vehicle‐exposed and healthy control cultures.


Interpretation
LUZP4‐IgG represents a novel serological biomarker of PNS and has high predictive value for germ‐cell tumors. The demonstrated antigen‐specific T‐cell responses support a CD8+T‐cell‐mediated cytotoxic paraneoplastic and anti‐tumor potential.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: The onset of preclinical Alzheimer's disease in monozygotic twins</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26048?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
To study the genetic contribution to the start of Alzheimer's disease with amyloid and tau biomarkers in cognitively intact older identical twins.


Methods
We studied in 96 monozygotic twin‐pairs relationships between Aβ aggregation as measured by the ratio Aβ1‐42/1‐40 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, n=126) and positron emission tomography (PET, n=194), and CSF markers for Aβ production (BACE1, Aβ1‐40 and 1‐38) and CSF tau. Associations amongst markers were tested with Generalized Estimating Equations including a random effect for twin status, adjusted for age, gender, and APOE ε4 genotype. We used twin analyses to determine relative contributions of genetic and/or environmental factors to AD pathophysiological processes.


Results
Twenty‐seven individuals (14%) had an abnormal amyloid‐PET, and 14 twin‐pairs (15%) showed discordant amyloid‐PET scans. Within twin‐pairs, Aβ production markers and total‐tau (t‐tau) levels strongly correlated (r range 0.73, 0.86; all p&amp;lt;0.0001), and Aβ aggregation markers and 181‐phosphorylated‐tau (p‐tau) levels correlated moderately strong (r range 0.50, 0.64; all p&amp;lt;0.0001). Cross‐twin cross‐trait analysis showed that Aβ1‐38 in one twin correlated with Aβ1‐42/1‐40 ratios, t‐tau and p‐tau levels in their co‐twins (r range ‐0.28, 0.58; all p&amp;lt;.007). Within‐pair differences in Aβ production markers related to differences in tau levels (r range 0.49, 0.61; all p&amp;lt;0.0001). Twin discordance analyses suggest that Aβ production and tau levels show coordinated increases in very early AD.


Interpretation
Our results suggest a substantial genetic/shared environmental background contributes to both Aβ and tau increases, suggesting that modulation of environmental risk factors may aid in delaying the onset of AD pathophysiological processes.

	<content:encoded>Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a severe neuropsychiatric complication of live cirrhosis. We identified the typical patterns of increased regional activity in the fronto‐striato‐cerebellar network and decreased activity in the visuo‐sensorimotor network and cingulate gyrus in HE patient.

Abstract
Neuropsychiatric deficits are common in patients with liver cirrhosis (LC), especially in those with hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Previous studies reveal abnormalities in brain activity underlying the neuropsychiatric deficits in LC patients; however, the results are inconsistent. We conducted a meta‐analysis of resting‐state functional magnetic resonance imaging studies using anisotropic effect‐size signed differential mapping software on LC patients to characterize the most consistent regional activity alterations, and to evaluate the potential effect of liver transplantation (LT) on brain function. Meta‐regression analyses were performed to explore the relationship between brain alterations and clinical variables. Compared with healthy controls, the typical patterns of increased regional activity in the fronto‐striato‐cerebellar network and decreased activity in the visuo‐sensorimotor network and cingulate gyrus were identified in LC patients, which remained significant in the subgroup meta‐analyses of minimal HE (MHE) and overt HE (OHE) patients. Functional deficits in the default mode network (DMN) were found in OHE patients compared with MHE patients. Ammonia level positively correlated with brain activity in the right middle temporal gyrus, and the completion time of number connection test A negatively correlated with brain activity in the left anterior cingulate gyrus. In addition, patients showed increased activity in the visuo‐sensorimotor network and precuneus after LT. Our study suggests that alterations in the fronto‐striato‐cerebellar and visuo‐sensorimotor networks may be the potential pathophysiological mechanisms underlying HE, and deficits in the DMN may indicate the progression of HE. LT may improve brain function in the visuo‐sensorimotor network. This study has registered in the PROSPERO (CRD42020212758).</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: The beneficial role of the synthetic microneurotrophin BNN20 in a focal demyelination model</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24809?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>This study provides data showing the beneficial role of BNN20 during demyelination. Our results showed that BNN20 increases the number of mature OLs in the lesion site of the LPC‐induced demyelination mouse model, while it reduces astrocytic accumulation, leading to a faster remyelination process. It does not significantly alter OPC recruitment or microglia/macrophages accumulation. Furthermore, our in vitro studies showed that BNN20 acts directly on OLs by enhancing their maturation. In addition, BNN20 treatment increased the number of LPC‐treated mature OLs and this beneficial effect was TrkA‐dependent. Moreover, BNN20 reduces microglial activation and their transition to the pro‐inflammatory state upon LPS stimulation in vitro. In conclusion, our results indicate that BNN20 is a multifaceted agent against demyelinating conditions by being able to affect all glial populations.

Abstract
BNN20, a C17‐spiroepoxy derivative of the neurosteroid dehydroepiandrosterone, has been shown to exhibit strong neuroprotective properties but its role in glial populations has not been assessed. Our aim was to investigate the effect of BNN20 on glial populations by using in vitro and in vivo approaches, taking advantage of the well‐established lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)‐induced focal demyelination mouse model. Our in vivo studies, performed in male mice, showed that BNN20 treatment leads to an increased number of mature oligodendrocytes (OLs) in this model. It diminishes astrocytic accumulation during the demyelination phase leading to a faster remyelination process, while it does not affect oligodendrocyte precursor cell recruitment or microglia/macrophage accumulation. Additionally, our in vitro studies showed that BNN20 acts directly to OLs and enhances their maturation even after they were treated with LPC. This beneficial effect of BNN20 is mediated, primarily, through the neurotrophin receptor TrkA. In addition, BNN20 reduces microglial activation and their transition to their pro‐inflammatory state upon lipopolysaccharides stimulation in vitro. Taken together our results suggest that BNN20 could serve as an important molecule to develop blood–brain barrier‐permeable synthetic agonists of neurotrophin receptors that could reduce inflammation, protect and increase the number of functional OLs by promoting their differentiation/maturation.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Microfluidic techniques have enabled in vitro neuronal circuits and blood–brain barrier (BBB) models with increasing physiological relevance. This review summarizes how these systems are now being used to study disease processes from synaptic transmission to BBB breakdown, opening up new possibilities to model neurological diseases using human cells.

Abstract
Neurological disorders are the leading cause of disability and the second largest cause of death worldwide. Despite significant research efforts, neurology remains one of the most failure‐prone areas of drug development. The complexity of the human brain, boundaries to examining the brain directly in vivo, and the significant evolutionary gap between animal models and humans, all serve to hamper translational success. Recent advances in microfluidic in vitro models have provided new opportunities to study human cells with enhanced physiological relevance. The ability to precisely micro‐engineer cell‐scale architecture, tailoring form and function, has allowed for detailed dissection of cell biology using microphysiological systems (MPS) of varying complexities from single cell systems to “Organ‐on‐chip” models. Simplified neuronal networks have allowed for unique insights into neuronal transport and neurogenesis, while more complex 3D heterotypic cellular models such as neurovascular unit mimetics and “Organ‐on‐chip” systems have enabled new understanding of metabolic coupling and blood–brain barrier transport. These systems are now being developed beyond MPS toward disease specific micro‐pathophysiological systems, moving from “Organ‐on‐chip” to “Disease‐on‐chip.” This review gives an outline of current state of the art in microfluidic technologies for neurological disease research, discussing the challenges and limitations while highlighting the benefits and potential of integrating technologies. We provide examples of where such toolsets have enabled novel insights and how these technologies may empower future investigation into neurological diseases.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Sodium salicylate enhances neural excitation via reducing GABAergic transmission in the dentate gyrus area of rat hippocampus in vivo</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23312?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Sodium salicylate, one of the non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, is widely prescribed in the clinic, but a high dose of usage can cause hyperactivity in the central nervous system, including the hippocampus. At present, the neural mechanism underlying the induced hyperactivity is not fully understood, in particular, in the hippocampus under an in vivo condition. In this study, we found that systemic administration of sodium salicylate increased the field excitatory postsynaptic potential slope and the population spike amplitude in a dose‐dependent manner in the hippocampal dentate gyrus area of rats with in vivo field potential extracellular recordings, which indicates that sodium salicylate enhances basal synaptic transmission and neural excitation. In the presence of picrotoxin, a GABA‐A receptor antagonist, sodium salicylate failed to increase the initial slope of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential and the amplitude of the population spike in vivo. To further explore how sodium salicylate enhances the neural excitation, we made whole‐cell patch‐clamp recordings from hippocampal slices. We found that perfusion of the slice with sodium salicylate decreased electrically evoked GABA receptor‐mediated currents, increased paired‐pulse ratio, and lowered frequency and amplitude of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents. Together, these results demonstrate that sodium salicylate enhances the neural excitation through suppressing GABAergic synaptic transmission in presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms in the hippocampal dentate gyrus area. Our findings may help understand the side effects caused by sodium salicylate in the central nervous system.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The orientation of radial glia in the dorsal telencephalon of teleost fish follows a morphogenetic process called eversion. We studied the radial glia in the cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni and found that glial processes get increasingly displaced by central pallial areas during growth. New cells are added to the growing brain subventricularly consistent with a stacking growth pattern (Cell Addition I). In addition, our data suggest that radial glial cells give rise to migrating astroglial cells providing new neurons and glia to deeper pallial regions (Cell Addition II).







Abstract
In the brain of teleost fish, radial glial cells are the main astroglial cell type. To understand how radial glia structures are adapting to continuous growth of the brain, we studied the astroglial cells in the telencephalon of the cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni in small fry to large specimens. These animals grow to a standard length of 10–12 cm in this fish species, corresponding to a more than 100‐fold increase in brain volume. Focusing on the telencephalon where glial cells are arranged radially in the everted (dorsal) pallium, immunocytochemistry for glial markers revealed an aberrant pattern of radial glial fibers in the central division of the dorsal pallium (DC, i.e. DC4 and DC5). The main glial processes curved around these nuclei, especially in the posterior part of the telencephalon. This was verified in tissue‐cleared brains stained for glial markers. We further analyzed the growth of radial glia by immunocytochemically applied stem cell (PCNA, Sox2) and differentiation marker (doublecortin), and found that these markers were expressed at the ventricular surface consistent with a stacking growth pattern. In addition, we detected doublecortin and Sox2 positive cells in deeper nuclei of DC areas. Our data suggest that radial glial cells give rise to migrating cells providing new neurons and glia to deeper pallial regions. This results in expansion of the central pallial areas and displacement of existing radial glial. In summary we show that radial glial cells can adapt to morphological growth processes in the adult fish brain, and contribute to this growth.

The voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) is a critical β-barrel membrane protein of the mitochondrial outer membrane, which regulates the transport of ions and ATP between mitochondria and the cytoplasm. In addition, VDAC plays a central role in the control of apoptosis and is therefore of great interest in both cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Although not fully understood, it is presumed that the gating mechanism of VDAC is governed by its N-terminal region which, in the open state of the channel, exhibits an α-helical structure positioned midway inside the pore and strongly interacting with the β-barrel wall. In the present work, we performed molecular simulations with a recently developed force field for disordered systems to shed new light on known experimental results, showing that the N-terminus of VDAC is an intrinsically disordered region (IDR). First, simulation of the N-terminal segment as a free peptide highlighted its disordered nature and the importance of using an IDR-specific force field to properly sample its conformational landscape. Secondly, accelerated dynamics simulation of a double cysteine VDAC mutant under applied voltage revealed metastable low conducting states of the channel representative of closed states observed experimentally. Related structures were characterized by partial unfolding and rearrangement of the N-terminal tail, that led to steric hindrance of the pore. Our results indicate that the disordered properties of the N-terminus are crucial to properly account for the gating mechanism of VDAC.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Vq74hJpoero&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

In this work, we introduce an entirely data-driven and automated approach to reveal disease-associated biomarker and risk factor networks from heterogeneous and high-dimensional healthcare data. Our workflow is based on Bayesian networks, which are a popular tool for analyzing the interplay of biomarkers. Usually, data require extensive manual preprocessing and dimension reduction to allow for effective learning of Bayesian networks. For heterogeneous data, this preprocessing is hard to automatize and typically requires domain-specific prior knowledge. We here combine Bayesian network learning with hierarchical variable clustering in order to detect groups of similar features and learn interactions between them entirely automated. We present an optimization algorithm for the adaptive refinement of such group Bayesian networks to account for a specific target variable, like a disease. The combination of Bayesian networks, clustering, and refinement yields low-dimensional but disease-specific interaction networks. These networks provide easily interpretable, yet accurate models of biomarker interdependencies. We test our method extensively on simulated data, as well as on data from the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP-TREND), and demonstrate its effectiveness using non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and hypertension as examples. We show that the group network models outperform available biomarker scores, while at the same time, they provide an easily interpretable interaction network.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jkNdrJc6Bg4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Intratumour heterogeneity is increasingly recognized as a frequent problem for cancer treatment as it allows for the evolution of resistance against treatment. While cancer genotyping becomes more and more established and allows to determine the genetic heterogeneity, less is known about the phenotypic heterogeneity among cancer cells. We investigate how phenotypic differences can impact the efficiency of therapy options that select on this diversity, compared to therapy options that are independent of the phenotype. We employ the ecological concept of trait distributions and characterize the cancer cell population as a collection of subpopulations that differ in their growth rate. We show in a deterministic model that growth rate-dependent treatment types alter the trait distribution of the cell population, resulting in a delayed relapse compared to a growth rate-independent treatment. Whether the cancer cell population goes extinct or relapse occurs is determined by stochastic dynamics, which we investigate using a stochastic model. Again, we find that relapse is delayed for the growth rate-dependent treatment type, albeit an increased relapse probability, suggesting that slowly growing subpopulations are shielded from extinction. Sequential application of growth rate-dependent and growth rate-independent treatment types can largely increase treatment efficiency and delay relapse. Interestingly, even longer intervals between decisions to change the treatment type may achieve close-to-optimal efficiencies and relapse times. Monitoring patients at regular check-ups may thus provide the temporally resolved guidance to tailor treatments to the changing cancer cell trait distribution and allow clinicians to cope with this dynamic heterogeneity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aYkw248ZmSs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Drug combinations have demonstrated great potential in cancer treatments. They alleviate drug resistance and improve therapeutic efficacy. The fast-growing number of anti-cancer drugs has caused the experimental investigation of all drug combinations to become costly and time-consuming. Computational techniques can improve the efficiency of drug combination screening. Despite recent advances in applying machine learning to synergistic drug combination prediction, several challenges remain. First, the performance of existing methods is suboptimal. There is still much space for improvement. Second, biological knowledge has not been fully incorporated into the model. Finally, many models are lack interpretability, limiting their clinical applications. To address these challenges, we have developed a knowledge-enabled and self-attention transformer boosted deep learning model, TranSynergy, which improves the performance and interpretability of synergistic drug combination prediction. TranSynergy is designed so that the cellular effect of drug actions can be explicitly modeled through cell-line gene dependency, gene-gene interaction, and genome-wide drug-target interaction. A novel Shapley Additive Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (SA-GSEA) method has been developed to deconvolute genes that contribute to the synergistic drug combination and improve model interpretability. Extensive benchmark studies demonstrate that TranSynergy outperforms the state-of-the-art method, suggesting the potential of mechanism-driven machine learning. Novel pathways that are associated with the synergistic combinations are revealed and supported by experimental evidence. They may provide new insights into identifying biomarkers for precision medicine and discovering new anti-cancer therapies. Several new synergistic drug combinations have been predicted with high confidence for ovarian cancer which has few treatment options.

For practical reasons, many forecasts of case, hospitalization, and death counts in the context of the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are issued in the form of central predictive intervals at various levels. This is also the case for the forecasts collected in the &lt;i&gt;COVID-19 Forecast Hub&lt;/i&gt; (https://covid19forecasthub.org/). Forecast evaluation metrics like the logarithmic score, which has been applied in several infectious disease forecasting challenges, are then not available as they require full predictive distributions. This article provides an overview of how established methods for the evaluation of quantile and interval forecasts can be applied to epidemic forecasts in this format. Specifically, we discuss the computation and interpretation of the weighted interval score, which is a proper score that approximates the continuous ranked probability score. It can be interpreted as a generalization of the absolute error to probabilistic forecasts and allows for a decomposition into a measure of sharpness and penalties for over- and underprediction.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/W7lxFydOLE0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

We present OpenAWSEM and Open3SPN2, new cross-compatible implementations of coarse-grained models for protein (AWSEM) and DNA (3SPN2) molecular dynamics simulations within the OpenMM framework. These new implementations retain the chemical accuracy and intrinsic efficiency of the original models while adding GPU acceleration and the ease of forcefield modification provided by OpenMM’s Custom Forces software framework. By utilizing GPUs, we achieve around a 30-fold speedup in protein and protein-DNA simulations over the existing LAMMPS-based implementations running on a single CPU core. We showcase the benefits of OpenMM’s Custom Forces framework by devising and implementing two new potentials that allow us to address important aspects of protein folding and structure prediction and by testing the ability of the combined OpenAWSEM and Open3SPN2 to model protein-DNA binding. The first potential is used to describe the changes in effective interactions that occur as a protein becomes partially buried in a membrane. We also introduced an interaction to describe proteins with multiple disulfide bonds. Using simple pairwise disulfide bonding terms results in unphysical clustering of cysteine residues, posing a problem when simulating the folding of proteins with many cysteines. We now can computationally reproduce Anfinsen’s early Nobel prize winning experiments by using OpenMM’s Custom Forces framework to introduce a multi-body disulfide bonding term that prevents unphysical clustering. Our protein-DNA simulations show that the binding landscape is funneled towards structures that are quite similar to those found using experiments. In summary, this paper provides a simulation tool for the molecular biophysics community that is both easy to use and sufficiently efficient to simulate large proteins and large protein-DNA systems that are central to many cellular processes. These codes should facilitate the interplay between molecular simulations and cellular studies, which have been hampered by the large mismatch between the time and length scales accessible to molecular simulations and those relevant to cell biology.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LCxJndAzN8w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Skilled behavior often displays signatures of Bayesian inference. In order for the brain to implement the required computations, neuronal activity must carry accurate information about the uncertainty of sensory inputs. Two major approaches have been proposed to study neuronal representations of uncertainty. The first one, the Bayesian decoding approach, aims primarily at decoding the posterior probability distribution of the stimulus from population activity using Bayes’ rule, and indirectly yields uncertainty estimates as a by-product. The second one, which we call the correlational approach, searches for specific features of neuronal activity (such as tuning-curve width and maximum firing-rate) which correlate with uncertainty. To compare these two approaches, we derived a new normative model of sound source localization by Interaural Time Difference (ITD), that reproduces a wealth of behavioral and neural observations. We found that several features of neuronal activity correlated with uncertainty on average, but none provided an accurate estimate of uncertainty on a trial-by-trial basis, indicating that the correlational approach may not reliably identify which aspects of neuronal responses represent uncertainty. In contrast, the Bayesian decoding approach reveals that the activity pattern of the entire population was required to reconstruct the trial-to-trial posterior distribution with Bayes’ rule. These results suggest that uncertainty is unlikely to be represented in a single feature of neuronal activity, and highlight the importance of using a Bayesian decoding approach when exploring the neural basis of uncertainty.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tRxROqEkr3o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Collective behavior is an emergent property of numerous complex systems, from financial markets to cancer cells to predator-prey ecological systems. Characterizing modes of collective behavior is often done through human observation, training generative models, or other supervised learning techniques. Each of these cases requires knowledge of and a method for characterizing the macro-state(s) of the system. This presents a challenge for studying novel systems where there may be little prior knowledge. Here, we present a new unsupervised method of detecting emergent behavior in complex systems, and discerning between distinct collective behaviors. We require only metrics, &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(1)&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(2)&lt;/sup&gt;, defined on the set of agents, &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;, which measure agents’ nearness in variables of interest. We apply the method of diffusion maps to the systems (&lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(i)&lt;/sup&gt;) to recover efficient embeddings of their interaction networks. Comparing these geometries, we formulate a measure of similarity between two networks, called the map alignment statistic (MAS). A large MAS is evidence that the two networks are codetermined in some fashion, indicating an emergent relationship between the metrics &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(1)&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(2)&lt;/sup&gt;. Additionally, the form of the macro-scale organization is encoded in the covariances among the two sets of diffusion map components. Using these covariances we discern between different modes of collective behavior in a data-driven, unsupervised manner. This method is demonstrated on a synthetic flocking model as well as empirical fish schooling data. We show that our state classification subdivides the known behaviors of the school in a meaningful manner, leading to a finer description of the system’s behavior.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Y2ws0d9jEAE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Conservation and dimorphism in androgen receptor distribution in Alston's singing mouse (Scotinomys teguina)</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25108?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>We used immunohistochemistry to qualitatively and quantitatively characterize the nuclear androgen receptor (AR) in the brain of the Alston's singing mouse (Scotinomys teguina).







Abstract
Because of their roles in courtship and intrasexual competition, sexual displays are often sexually dimorphic, but we know little about the mechanisms that produce such dimorphism. Among mammals, one example is the vocalization of Alston's singing mouse (Scotinomys teguina), which consists of a series of rapidly repeated, frequency‐modulated notes. The rate and duration of songs is sexually dimorphic and androgen responsive. To understand the neuronal mechanisms underlying this sexual dimorphism, we map the sites of androgen sensitivity throughout the brain, focusing analysis along a pathway that spans from limbic structures to vocal motor regions. We find widespread expression of AR immunoreactivity (AR‐ir) throughout limbic structures important for social behavior and vocalization, including the lateral septum, extended amygdala, preoptic area and hypothalamus. We also find extensive AR staining along previously documented vocal motor pathways, including the periaqueductal gray, parabrachial nucleus, and nucleus ambiguus, the last of which innervates intrinsic laryngeal muscles. Lastly, AR‐ir is also evident in sensory areas such as the medial geniculate, inferior, and superior colliculi. A quantitative analysis revealed that males exhibited more AR‐ir than females, a pattern that was most pronounced in the hypothalamus. Despite the elaboration of vocalization in singing mice, comparison with prior literature suggests that the broad pattern of AR‐ir may be conserved across a wide range of rodents. Together these data identify brain nuclei well positioned to shape the sexually dimorphic vocalization of S. teguina and suggest that such androgen modulation of vocalization is evolutionary conserved among rodents.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25127?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>At the peak of the critical period, immersion into complete darkness for 10 days significantly reduces the number of perineuronal nets (PNN) in the primary visual cortex of cats but does not alter the number of parvalbumin (PV) cells that they usually surround. Further, darkness reduces the size of PV cells even if they are surrounded by a PNN, indicating that PNNs do not inhibit all forms of neural plasticity.







Abstract
During development the visual system maintains a high capacity for modification by expressing characteristics permissive for plasticity, enabling neural circuits to be refined by visual experience to achieve their mature form. This period is followed by the emergence of characteristics that stabilize the brain to consolidate for a lifetime connections that were informed by experience. Attenuation of plasticity potential is thought to derive from an accumulation of plasticity‐inhibiting characteristics that appear at ages beyond the peak of plasticity. Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are molecular aggregations that primarily surround fast‐spiking inhibitory neurons called parvalbumin (PV) cells, which exhibit properties congruent with a plasticity inhibitor. In this study we examined the development of PNNs and PV cells in the primary visual cortex of a highly visual mammal, and assessed the impact that 10 days of darkness had on both characteristics. Here we show that labeling for PV expression emerges earlier and reaches adult levels sooner than PNNs. We also demonstrate that darkness, a condition known to enhance plasticity, significantly reduces the density of PNNs and the size of PV cell somata but does not alter the number of PV cells in visual cortex. The darkness‐induced reduction of PV cell size occurred irrespective of whether neurons were surrounded by a PNN, suggesting that PNNs have a restricted capacity to inhibit plasticity. Finally, we show that PV cells surrounded by a PNN were significantly larger than those without one, supporting the view that PNNs may mediate trophic support to the cells they surround.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Assessing Dysferlinopathy Patients Over Three Years With A New Motor Scale</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26044?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Dysferlinopathy is a muscular dystrophy with a highly variable clinical presentation and currently unpredictable progression. This variability and unpredictability presents difficulties for prognostication and clinical trial design. The Jain Clinical Outcomes Study of Dysferlinopathy aims to establish the validity of the North Star Assessment for Limb Girdle Type Muscular Dystrophies (NSAD) scale and identify factors that influence the rate of disease progression using NSAD.


Methods
We collected a longitudinal series of functional assessments from 187 dysferlinopathy patients over three years. Rasch analysis was used to develop the NSAD, a motor performance scale suitable for ambulant and non‐ambulant patients. Generalized estimating equations were used to evaluate the impact of patient factors on outcome trajectories.


Results
The NSAD detected significant change in clinical progression over 1 year. The steepest functional decline occurred during the first 10 years after symptom onset, with more rapid decline noted in patients who developed symptoms at a younger age (p = 0.04). The most rapidly deteriorating group over the study was patients 3–8 years post symptom onset at baseline.


Interpretation
The NSAD is the first validated limb girdle specific scale of motor performance, suitable for use in clinics practice and clinical trials. Longitudinal analysis showed it may be possible to identify patient factors associated with greater functional decline both across the disease course and in the short‐term for clinical trial preparation. Through further work and validation in this cohort, we anticipate that a disease model incorporating functional performance will allow for more accurate prognosis for patients with dysferlinopathy.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: The Prognostic Value of Homocysteine in Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.600582</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: This comprehensive meta-analysis aimed to assess whether an increased homocysteine (Hcy) level is an independent predictor of unfavorable outcomes in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted up to August 1, 2020 to collect studies reporting Hcy levels in AIS patients. We analyzed all the data using Review Manager 5.3 software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Seventeen studies with 15,636 AIS patients were selected for evaluation. A higher Hcy level was associated with a poorer survival outcome (OR 1.43, 95% CI: 1.25–1.63). Compared with the AIS group, Hcy levels were significantly lower in the healthy control patients, with an SMD of 5.11 and 95% CI (1.87–8.35). Analysis of the different subgroups of AIS demonstrated significant associations between high Hcy levels and survival outcomes only in Caucasian and Asian patients. Moreover, whereas high Hcy levels were closely associated with gender, B12 deficiency, smoking, and patients who received tissue plasminogen activator treatment, no significant difference was found between increased Hcy levels and age, drinking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. In addition, the cut-off value (20.0 μmol/L) might be an optimum cut-off index for AIS patients in clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: This meta-analysis reveals that the Hcy level may serve as an independent predictor for unfavorable survival outcomes in AIS patients, particularly in Caucasian and Asian AIS patients. Further studies can be conducted to clarify this relationship.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Protein Aggregation Inhibitors as Disease-Modifying Therapies for Polyglutamine Diseases</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.621996</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases are a group of inherited neurodegenerative diseases caused by the abnormal expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat that are translated into an expanded polyQ stretch in the disease-causative proteins. The expanded polyQ stretch itself plays a critical disease-causative role in the pathomechanisms underlying polyQ diseases. Notably, the expanded polyQ stretch undergoes a conformational transition from the native monomer into the β-sheet-rich monomer, followed by the formation of soluble oligomers and then insoluble aggregates with amyloid fibrillar structures. The intermediate soluble species including the β-sheet-rich monomer and oligomers exhibit substantial neurotoxicity. Therefore, protein conformation stabilization and aggregation inhibition that target the upstream of the insoluble aggregate formation would be a promising approach toward the development of disease-modifying therapies for polyQ diseases. PolyQ aggregation inhibitors of different chemical categories, such as intrabodies, peptides, and small chemical compounds, have been identified through intensive screening methods. Among them, recent advances in the brain delivery methods of several peptides and the screening of small chemical compounds have brought them closer to clinical utility. Notably, the recent discovery of arginine as a potent conformation stabilizer and aggregation inhibitor of polyQ proteins both in vitro and in vivo have paved way to the clinical trial for the patients with polyQ diseases. Meanwhile, expression reduction of expanded polyQ proteins per se would be another promising approach toward disease modification of polyQ diseases. Gene silencing, especially by antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), have succeeded in reducing the expression of polyQ proteins in the animal models of various polyQ diseases by targeting the aberrant mRNA with expanded CAG repeats. Of note, some of these ASOs have recently been translated into clinical trials. Here we overview and discuss these recent advances toward the development of disease modifying therapies for polyQ diseases. We envision that combination therapies using aggregation inhibitors and gene silencing would meet the needs of the patients with polyQ diseases and their caregivers in the near future to delay or prevent the onset and progression of these currently intractable diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Therapeutic Hypothermia Inhibits the Classical Complement Pathway in a Rat Model of Neonatal Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.616734</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;Complement activation is instrumental in the pathogenesis of Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), a significant cause of neonatal mortality and disability worldwide. Therapeutic hypothermia (HT), the only available treatment for HIE, only modestly improves outcomes. Complement modulation as a therapeutic adjunct to HT has been considered, but is challenging due to the wide-ranging role of the complement system in neuroinflammation, homeostasis and neurogenesis in the developing brain. We sought to identify potential therapeutic targets by measuring the impact of treatment with HT on complement effector expression in neurons and glia in neonatal HIE, with particular emphasis on the interactions between microglia and C1q.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The Vannucci model was used to induce HIE in term-equivalent rat pups. At P10-12, pups were randomly assigned to three different treatment groups: Sham (control), normothermia (NT), and hypothermia (HT) treatment. Local and systemic complement expression and neuronal apoptosis were measured by ELISA, TUNEL and immunofluorescence labeling, and differences compared between groups.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Treatment with HT is associated with decreased systemic and microglial expression of C1q, decreased systemic C5a levels, and decreased microglial and neuronal deposition of C3 and C9. The effect of HT on cytokines was variable with decreased expression of pro and anti-inflammatory effectors. HT treatment was associated with decreased C1q binding on cells undergoing apoptosis.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our data demonstrate the extreme complexity of the immune response in neonatal HIE. We propose modulation of downstream effectors C3a and C5a as a therapeutic adjunct to HT to enhance neuroprotection in the developing brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: A New Apparatus for Recording Evoked Responses to Painful and Non-painful Sensory Stimulation in Freely Moving Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.613801</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Experiments on pain processing in animals face several methodological challenges including the reproducible application of painful stimuli. Ideally, behavioral and physiological correlates of pain should be assessed in freely behaving mice, avoiding stress, fear or behavioral restriction as confounding factors. Moreover, the time of pain-evoked brain activity should be precisely related to the time of stimulation, such that pain-specific neuronal activity can be unambiguously identified. This can be achieved with laser-evoked heat stimuli which are also well established for human pain research. However, laser-evoked neuronal potentials are rarely investigated in awake unrestrained rodents, partially due to the practical difficulties in precisely and reliably targeting and triggering stimulation. In order to facilitate such studies we have developed a versatile stimulation and recording system for freely moving mice. The custom-made apparatus can provide both laser- and mechanical stimuli with simultaneous recording of evoked potentials and behavioral responses. Evoked potentials can be recorded from superficial and deep brain areas showing graded pain responses which correlate with pain-specific behavioral reactions. Non-painful mechanical stimuli can be applied as a control, yielding clearly different electrophysiological and behavioral responses. The apparatus is suited for simultaneous acquisition of precisely timed electrophysiological and behavioral evoked responses in freely moving mice. Besides its application in pain research it may be also useful in other fields of sensory physiology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Quantifying Signal Quality From Unimodal and Multimodal Sources: Application to EEG With Ocular and Motion Artifacts</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.566004</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;With prevalence of electrophysiological data collected outside of the laboratory from portable, non-invasive modalities growing at a rapid rate, the quality of these recorded data, if not adequate, could affect the effectiveness of medical devices that depend of them. In this work, we propose novel methods to evaluate electrophysiological signal quality to determine how much of the data represents the physiological source of interest. Data driven models are investigated through Bayesian decision and deep learning-based methods to score unimodal (signal and noise recorded on same device) and multimodal (signal and noise each recorded from different devices) data, respectively. We validate these methods and models on three electroencephalography (EEG) data sets (N = 60 subjects) to score EEG quality based on the presence of ocular artifacts with our unimodal method and motion artifacts with our multimodal method. Further, we apply our unimodal source method to compare the performance of two different artifact removal algorithms. Our results show we are able to effectively score EEG data using both methods and apply our method to evaluate the performance of other artifact removal algorithms that target ocular artifacts. Methods developed and validated here can be used to assess data quality and evaluate the effectiveness of certain noise-reduction algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Evaluation of Task fMRI Decoding With Deep Learning on a Small Sample Dataset</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.577451</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recently, several deep learning methods have been applied to decoding in task-related fMRI, and their advantages have been exploited in a variety of ways. However, this paradigm is sometimes problematic, due to the difficulty of applying deep learning to high-dimensional data and small sample size conditions. The difficulties in gathering a large amount of data to develop predictive machine learning models with multiple layers from fMRI experiments with complicated designs and tasks are well-recognized. Group-level, multi-voxel pattern analysis with small sample sizes results in low statistical power and large accuracy evaluation errors; failure in such instances is ascribed to the individual variability that risks information leakage, a particular issue when dealing with a limited number of subjects. In this study, using a small-size fMRI dataset evaluating bilingual language switch in a property generation task, we evaluated the relative fit of different deep learning models, incorporating moderate split methods to control the amount of information leakage. Our results indicated that using the session shuffle split as the data folding method, along with the multichannel 2D convolutional neural network (M2DCNN) classifier, recorded the best authentic classification accuracy, which outperformed the efficiency of 3D convolutional neural network (3DCNN). In this manuscript, we discuss the tolerability of within-subject or within-session information leakage, of which the impact is generally considered small but complex and essentially unknown; this requires clarification in future studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: A Study on the Effect of Mental Practice Using Motor Evoked Potential-Based Neurofeedback</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.637401</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to investigate whether the effect of mental practice (motor imagery training) can be enhanced by providing neurofeedback based on transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-induced motor evoked potentials (MEP). Twenty-four healthy, right-handed subjects were enrolled in this study. The subjects were randomly allocated into two groups: a group that was given correct TMS feedback (Real-FB group) and a group that was given randomized false TMS feedback (Sham-FB group). The subjects imagined pushing the switch with just timing, when the target circle overlapped a cross at the center of the computer monitor. In the Real-FB group, feedback was provided to the subjects based on the MEP amplitude measured in the trial immediately preceding motor imagery. In contrast, the subjects of the Sham-FB group were provided with a feedback value that was independent of the MEP amplitude. TMS was applied when the target, moving from right to left, overlapped the cross at the center of the screen, and the MEP amplitude was measured. The MEP was recorded in the right first dorsal interosseous muscle. We evaluated the pre-mental practice and post-mental practice motor performance in both groups. As a result, a significant difference was observed in the percentage change of error values between the Real-FB group and the Sham-FB group. Furthermore, the MEP was significantly different between the groups in the 4th and 5th sets. Therefore, it was suggested that TMS-induced MEP-based neurofeedback might enhance the effect of mental practice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.635304</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Pre-natal exposure to acute maternal trauma or chronic maternal distress can confer increased risk for psychiatric disorders in later life. Acute maternal trauma is the result of unforeseen environmental or personal catastrophes, while chronic maternal distress is associated with anxiety or depression. Animal studies investigating the effects of pre-natal stress have largely used brief stress exposures during pregnancy to identify critical periods of fetal vulnerability, a paradigm which holds face validity to acute maternal trauma in humans. While understanding these effects is undoubtably important, the literature suggests maternal stress in humans is typically chronic and persistent from pre-conception through gestation. In this review, we provide evidence to this effect and suggest a realignment of current animal models to recapitulate this chronicity. We also consider candidate mediators, moderators and mechanisms of maternal distress, and suggest a wider breadth of research is needed, along with the incorporation of advanced -omics technologies, in order to understand the neurodevelopmental etiology of psychiatric risk.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Personalized Virtual Reality Human-Computer Interaction for Psychiatric and Neurological Illnesses: A Dynamically Adaptive Virtual Reality Environment That Changes According to Real-Time Feedback From Electrophysiological Signal Responses</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.596980</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Virtual reality (VR) constitutes an alternative, effective, and increasingly utilized treatment option for people suffering from psychiatric and neurological illnesses. However, the currently available VR simulations provide a predetermined simulative framework that does not take into account the unique personality traits of each individual; this could result in inaccurate, extreme, or unpredictable responses driven by patients who may be overly exposed and in an abrupt manner to the predetermined stimuli, or result in indifferent, almost non-existing, reactions when the stimuli do not affect the patients adequately and thus stronger stimuli are recommended. In this study, we present a VR system that can recognize the individual differences and readjust the VR scenarios during the simulation according to the treatment aims. To investigate and present this dynamically adaptive VR system we employ an Anxiety Disorder condition as a case study, namely arachnophobia. This system consists of distinct anxiety states, aiming to dynamically modify the VR environment in such a way that it can keep the individual within a controlled, and appropriate for the therapy needs, anxiety state, which will be called “desired states” for the study. This happens by adjusting the VR stimulus, in real-time, according to the electrophysiological responses of each individual. These electrophysiological responses are collected by an external electrodermal activity biosensor that serves as a tracker of physiological changes. Thirty-six diagnosed arachnophobic individuals participated in a one-session trial. Participants were divided into two groups, the Experimental Group which was exposed to the proposed real-time adaptive virtual simulation, and the Control Group which was exposed to a pre-recorded static virtual simulation as proposed in the literature. These results demonstrate the proposed system’s ability to continuously construct an updated and adapted virtual environment that keeps the users within the appropriately chosen state (higher or lower intensity) for approximately twice the time compared to the pre-recorded static virtual simulation. Thus, such a system can increase the efficiency of VR stimulations for the treatment of central nervous system dysfunctions, as it provides numerically more controlled sessions without unexpected variations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: The Connectivity Fingerprints of Highly-Skilled and Disordered Reading Persist Across Cognitive Domains</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.590093</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The capacity to produce and understand written language is a uniquely human skill that exists on a continuum, and foundational to other facets of human cognition. Multivariate classifiers based on support vector machines (SVM) have provided much insight into the networks underlying reading skill beyond what traditional univariate methods can tell us. Shallow models like SVM require large amounts of data, and this problem is compounded when functional connections, which increase exponentially with network size, are predictors of interest. Data reduction using independent component analyses (ICA) mitigates this problem, but conventionally assumes linear relationships. Multilayer feedforward networks, in contrast, readily find optimal low-dimensional encodings of complex patterns that include complex nonlinear or conditional relationships. Samples of poor and highly-skilled young readers were selected from two open access data sets using rhyming and mental multiplication tasks, respectively. Functional connectivity was computed for the rhyming task within a functionally-defined reading network and used to train multilayer feedforward classifier models to simultaneously associate functional connectivity patterns with lexicality (word vs. pseudoword) and reading skill (poor vs. highly-skilled). Classifiers identified validation set lexicality with significantly better than chance accuracy, and reading skill with near-ceiling accuracy. Critically, a series of replications used pre-trained rhyming-task models to classify reading skill from mental multiplication task participants' connectivity with near-ceiling accuracy. The novel deep learning approach presented here provides the clearest demonstration to date that reading-skill dependent functional connectivity within the reading network influences brain processing dynamics across cognitive domains.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.618658</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The hippocampal place cell system in rodents has provided a major paradigm for the scientific investigation of memory function and dysfunction. Place cells have been observed in area CA1 of the hippocampus of both freely moving animals, and of head-fixed animals navigating in virtual reality environments. However, spatial coding in virtual reality preparations has been observed to be impaired. Here we show that the use of a real-world environment system for head-fixed mice, consisting of an air-floating track with proximal cues, provides some advantages over virtual reality systems for the study of spatial memory. We imaged the hippocampus of head-fixed mice injected with the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6s while they navigated circularly constrained or open environments on the floating platform. We observed consistent place tuning in a substantial fraction of cells despite the absence of distal visual cues. Place fields remapped when animals entered a different environment. When animals re-entered the same environment, place fields typically remapped over a time period of multiple days, faster than in freely moving preparations, but comparable with virtual reality. Spatial information rates were within the range observed in freely moving mice. Manifold analysis indicated that spatial information could be extracted from a low-dimensional subspace of the neural population dynamics. This is the first demonstration of place cells in head-fixed mice navigating on an air-lifted real-world platform, validating its use for the study of brain circuits involved in memory and affected by neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: NGN2 mmRNA-Based Transcriptional Programming in Microfluidic Guides hiPSCs Toward Neural Fate With Multiple Identities</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.602888</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent advancements in cell engineering have succeeded in manipulating cell identity with the targeted overexpression of specific cell fate determining transcription factors in a process named transcriptional programming. Neurogenin2 (NGN2) is sufficient to instruct pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) to acquire a neuronal identity when delivered with an integrating system, which arises some safety concerns for clinical applications. A non-integrating system based on modified messenger RNA (mmRNA) delivery method, represents a valuable alternative to lentiviral-based approaches. The ability of NGN2 mmRNA to instruct PSC fate change has not been thoroughly investigated yet. Here we aimed at understanding whether the use of an NGN2 mmRNA-based approach combined with a miniaturized system, which allows a higher transfection efficiency in a cost-effective system, is able to drive human induced PSCs (hiPSCs) toward the neuronal lineage. We show that NGN2 mRNA alone is able to induce cell fate conversion. Surprisingly, the outcome cell population accounts for multiple phenotypes along the neural development trajectory. We found that this mixed population is mainly constituted by neural stem cells (45% ± 18 PAX6 positive cells) and neurons (38% ± 8 βIIITUBULIN positive cells) only when NGN2 is delivered as mmRNA. On the other hand, when the delivery system is lentiviral-based, both providing a constant expression of NGN2 or only a transient pulse, the outcome differentiated population is formed by a clear majority of neurons (88% ± 1 βIIITUBULIN positive cells). Altogether, our data confirm the ability of NGN2 to induce neuralization in hiPSCs and opens a new point of view in respect to the delivery system method when it comes to transcriptional programming applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Association Between the Gut Microbiota and Parkinson's Disease, a Meta-Analysis</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) were often observed with gastrointestinal symptoms, which preceded the onset of motor symptoms. Neuropathology of PD has also been found in the enteric nervous system (ENS). Many studies have reported significant PD-related alterations of gut microbiota. This meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the differences of gut microbiota between patients with PD and healthy controls (HCs) across different geographical regions. We conducted a systematic online search for case-control studies detecting gut microbiota in patients with PD and HCs. Mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to access alterations in the abundance of certain microbiota families in PD. Fifteen case-control studies were included in this meta-analysis study. Our results showed significant lower abundance levels of Prevotellaceae (MD = −0.37, 95% CI = −0.62 to −0.11), Faecalibacterium (MD = −0.41, 95% CI: −0.57 to −0.24), and Lachnospiraceae (MD = −0.34, 95% CI = −0.59 to −0.09) in patients with PD compared to HCs. Significant higher abundance level of Bifidobacteriaceae (MD = 0.38, 95%; CI = 0.12 to 0.63), Ruminococcaceae (MD = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.07 to 1.10), Verrucomicrobiaceae (MD = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.21 to 0.69), and Christensenellaceae (MD = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.07 to 0.34) was also found in patients with PD. Thus, shared alterations of certain gut microbiota were detected in patients with PD across different geographical regions. These PD-related gut microbiota dysbiosis might lead to the impairment of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) producing process, lipid metabolism, immunoregulatory function, and intestinal permeability, which contribute to the pathogenesis of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.631770</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A wide range of comorbid diseases is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide. Evidence from clinical and molecular studies suggest that chronic diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, depression, and inflammatory bowel disease, may be associated with an increased risk of AD in different populations. Disruption in several shared biological pathways has been proposed as the underlying mechanism for the association between AD and these comorbidities. Notably, inflammation is a common dysregulated pathway shared by most of the comorbidities associated with AD. Some drugs commonly prescribed to patients with diabetes and cardiovascular disease have shown promising results in AD patients. Systems-based biology studies have identified common genetic factors and dysregulated pathways that may explain the relationship of comorbid disorders in AD. Nonetheless, the precise mechanisms for the occurrence of disease comorbidities in AD are not entirely understood. Here, we discuss the impact of the most common comorbidities in the clinical management of AD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Increased Plasma Heme Oxygenase-1 Levels in Patients With Early-Stage Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.621508</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is a 32 kDa stress-response protein implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Biliverdin is derived from heme through a reaction mediated by HO-1 and protects cells from oxidative stress. However, iron and carbon monoxide produced by the catabolism of HO-1 exert detrimental effects on patients with PD. The purpose of this study was to determine whether plasma HO-1 levels represent a biomarker of PD and to further explore the underlying mechanism of increased HO-1 levels by applying voxel-based morphometry (VBM).Methods: We measured plasma HO-1 levels using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 156 subjects, including 81 patients with early- and advanced-stage PD and 75 subjects without PD. The analyses were adjusted to control for confounders such as age, sex, and medication. We analyzed T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 74 patients with PD using VBM to elucidate the association between altered brain volumes and HO-1 levels. Then, we compared performance on MMSE sub-items between PD patients with low and high levels of HO-1 using Mann-Whitney U tests.Results: Plasma HO-1 levels were significantly elevated in PD patients, predominantly those with early-stage PD, compared with controls (p &amp;lt; 0.05). The optimal cutoff value for patients with early PD was 2.245 ng/ml HO-1 [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.654]. Plasma HO-1 levels were unaffected by sex, age, and medications (p &amp;gt; 0.05). The right hippocampal volume was decreased in the subset of PD patients with high HO-1 levels (p &amp;lt; 0.05). A weak correlation was observed between right hippocampal volume and plasma HO-1 levels (r = −0.273, p = 0.018). There was no difference in total MMSE scores between the low- and high-HO-1 groups (p &amp;gt; 0.05), but the high-HO-1 group had higher language scores than the low-HO-1 group (p &amp;lt; 0.05).Conclusions: Plasma HO-1 levels may be a promising biomarker of early PD. Moreover, a high plasma concentration of the HO-1 protein is associated with a reduction in right hippocampal volume.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Body Temperature Is Associated With Cognitive Performance in Older Adults With and Without Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Cross-sectional Analysis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.585904</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Wearable devices for remote and continuous health monitoring in older populations frequently include sensors for body temperature measurements (i.e., skin and core body temperatures). Healthy aging is associated with core body temperatures that are in the lower range of age-related normal values (36.3 ± 0.6°C, oral temperature), while patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) exhibit core body temperatures above normal values (up to 0.2°C). However, the relation of body temperature measures with neurocognitive health in older adults remains unknown. This study aimed to explore the association of body temperature with cognitive performance in older adults with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Eighty community-dwelling older adults (≥65 years) participated, of which 54 participants were cognitively healthy and 26 participants met the criteria for MCI. Skin temperatures at the rib cage and the scapula were measured in the laboratory (single-point measurement) and neuropsychological tests were conducted to assess general cognitive performance, episodic memory, verbal fluency, executive function, and processing speed. In a subgroup (n = 15, nine healthy, six MCI), skin and core body temperatures were measured continuously during 12 h of habitual daily activities (long-term measurement). Spearman’s partial correlation analyses, controlled for age, revealed that lower median body temperature and higher peak-to-peak body temperature amplitude was associated with better general cognitive performance and with better performance in specific domains of cognition; [e.g., rib median skin temperature (single-point) vs. processing speed: r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.33, p = 0.002; rib median skin temperature (long-term) vs. executive function: r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.56, p = 0.023; and peak-to-peak core body temperature amplitude (long-term) vs. episodic memory: r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.51, p = 0.032]. Additionally, cognitively healthy older adults showed lower median body temperature and higher peak-to-peak body temperature amplitude compared to older adults with MCI (e.g., rib median skin temperature, single-point: p = 0.035, r = 0.20). We conclude that both skin and core body temperature measures are potential early biomarkers of cognitive decline and preclinical symptoms of MCI/AD. It may therefore be promising to integrate body temperature measures into multi-parameter systems for the remote and continuous monitoring of neurocognitive health in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

MIGNON is a workflow for the analysis of RNA-Seq experiments, which not only efficiently manages the estimation of gene expression levels from raw sequencing reads, but also calls genomic variants present in the transcripts analyzed. Moreover, this is the first workflow that provides a framework for the integration of transcriptomic and genomic data based on a mechanistic model of signaling pathway activities that allows a detailed biological interpretation of the results, including a comprehensive functional profiling of cell activity. MIGNON covers the whole process, from reads to signaling circuit activity estimations, using state-of-the-art tools, it is easy to use and it is deployable in different computational environments, allowing an optimized use of the resources available.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lbrtDEw9EwA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The correct identification of metabolic activity in tissues or cells under different conditions can be extremely elusive due to mechanisms such as post-transcriptional modification of enzymes or different rates in protein degradation, making difficult to perform predictions on the basis of gene expression alone. Context-specific metabolic network reconstruction can overcome some of these limitations by leveraging the integration of multi-omics data into genome-scale metabolic networks (GSMN). Using the experimental information, context-specific models are reconstructed by extracting from the generic GSMN the sub-network most consistent with the data, subject to biochemical constraints. One advantage is that these context-specific models have more predictive power since they are tailored to the specific tissue, cell or condition, containing only the reactions predicted to be active in such context. However, an important limitation is that there are usually many different sub-networks that optimally fit the experimental data. This set of optimal networks represent alternative explanations of the possible metabolic state. Ignoring the set of possible solutions reduces the ability to obtain relevant information about the metabolism and may bias the interpretation of the true metabolic states. In this work we formalize the problem of enumerating optimal metabolic networks and we introduce DEXOM, an unified approach for diversity-based enumeration of context-specific metabolic networks. We developed different strategies for this purpose and we performed an exhaustive analysis using simulated and real data. In order to analyze the extent to which these results are biologically meaningful, we used the alternative solutions obtained with the different methods to measure: 1) the improvement of in silico predictions of essential genes in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; using ensembles of metabolic network; and 2) the detection of alternative enriched pathways in different human cancer cell lines. We also provide DEXOM as an open-source library compatible with COBRA Toolbox 3.0, available at https://github.com/MetExplore/dexom.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v2GUBLx6oK4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Adoptive Transfer of JC Virus‐Specific T Lymphocytes for the Treatment of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26020?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is still burdened by high mortality in a subset of patients, such as those affected by hematological malignancies. The aim of this study was to analyze the safety and carry out preliminary evaluation of the efficacy of polyomavirus JC (JCPyV)‐specific T cell therapy in a cohort of hematological patients with PML.


Methods
Between 2014 and 2019, 9 patients with a diagnosis of “definite PML” according to the 2013 consensus who were showing progressive clinical deterioration received JCPyV‐specific T cells. Cell lines were expanded from autologous or allogenic peripheral blood mononuclear cells by stimulation with JCPyV antigen‐derived peptides.


Results
None of the patients experienced treatment‐related adverse events. In the evaluable patients, an increase in the frequency of circulating JCPyV‐specific lymphocytes was observed, with a decrease or clearance of JCPyV viral load in cerebrospinal fluid. In responsive patients, transient appearance of punctate areas of contrast enhancement within, or close to, PML lesions was observed, which was interpreted as a sign of immune control and which regressed spontaneously without the need for steroid treatment. Six of 9 patients achieved PML control, with 5 alive and in good clinical condition at their last follow‐up.


Interpretation
Among other novel treatments, T cell therapy is emerging as a viable treatment option in patients with PML, particularly for those not amenable to restoration of specific immunity. Neurologists should be encouraged to refer PML patients to specialized centers to allow access to this treatment strategy. ANN NEUROL 2021</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: The Mysterious Island: Insula and Its Dual Function in Sleep and Wakefulness</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.592660</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the recent sleep studies, it was shown that afferentation of many cortical areas switches during sleep to the interoceptive one. However, it was unclear whether the insular cortex, which is often considered as the main cortical visceral representation, maintains the same effective connectivity in both states of vigilance, or processes interoceptive information predominantly in one state. We investigated neuronal responses of the cat insular cortex to electrical stimulations of the intestinal wall delivered during wakefulness and natural sleep. Marked increase was observed in the number of insular neurons responding to this stimulation in sleep comparing to wakefulness, and enlarged amplitudes of evoked local field potentials were found as well. Moreover, most of the cells responding to intestinal stimulation in wakefulness never responded to identical stimuli during sleep and vice versa. It was also shown that applied low intensity intestinal stimulations had never compromised sleep quality. In addition, experiments with microstimulation of the insular cortex and recording of intestinal myoelectric activity demonstrated that effective insula-to-gut propagation also happened only during sleep. On the other hand, the same insular stimulations in wakefulness led to contractions of orofacial muscles. The evoked face movements gradually disappeared in the course of sleep development. These findings demonstrate that pattern of efficient afferent and efferent connections of the insular cortex changes with transition from wakefulness to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Isoliquiritigenin Confers Neuroprotection and Alleviates Amyloid-β42-Induced Neuroinflammation in Microglia by Regulating the Nrf2/NF-κB Signaling</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.638772</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Neuroinflammation and oxidative stress are two major pathological characteristics of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Amyloid-β oligomers (AβO), a toxic form of Aβ, promote the neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in the development of AD. Isoliquiritigenin (ISL), a natural flavonoid isolated from the root of liquorice, has been shown to exert inhibitory effects on inflammatory response and oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;Objectives&lt;p&gt;The main purpose of this study is to assess the influence of ISL on inflammatory response and oxidative stress in BV2 cells stimulated with AβO, and to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2, 5-diphenyl-2-H- tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) cytotoxicity assays were used to assess the toxic or protective effects of ISL. The expression levels of interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α were assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Morphological changes in BV2 cells were assessed by immunofluorescence method. Nitric oxide (NO) assay kit was used to determinate the NO production. Western blot, qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence were used to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;ISL treatment reduced the production of inflammatory cytokines and NO, and alleviated the morphological changes in BV2 cells induced by AβO. ISL treatment further protected N2a cells from the toxic medium of AβO-stimulated BV2 cells. ISL activated nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling and suppressed nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling in BV2 cells.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;ISL suppresses AβO-induced inflammation and oxidative stress in BV2 cells via the regulation of Nrf2/NF-κB signaling. Therefore, ISL indirectly protects neurons from the damage of toxic conditioned media.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Clear and Consistent Imaging of Hippocampal Internal Architecture With High Resolution Multiple Image Co-registration and Averaging (HR-MICRA)</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.546312</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging of hippocampal internal architecture (HIA) at 3T is challenging. HIA is defined by layers of gray and white matter that are less than 1 mm thick in the coronal plane. To visualize HIA, conventional MRI approaches have relied on sequences with high in-plane resolution (≤0.5 mm) but comparatively thick slices (2–5 mm). However, thicker slices are prone to volume averaging effects that result in loss of HIA clarity and blurring of the borders of the hippocampal subfields in up to 61% of slices as has been reported. In this work we describe an approach to hippocampal imaging that provides consistently high HIA clarity using a commonly available sequence and post-processing techniques that is flexible and may be applicable to any MRI platform. We refer to this approach as High Resolution Multiple Image Co-registration and Averaging (HR-MICRA). This approach uses a variable flip angle turbo spin echo sequence to repeatedly acquire a whole brain T2w image volume with high resolution in three dimensions in a relatively short amount of time, and then co-register the volumes to correct for movement and average the repeated scans to improve SNR. We compared the averages of 4, 9, and 16 individual scans in 20 healthy controls using a published HIA clarity rating scale. In the body of the hippocampus, the proportion of slices with good or excellent HIA clarity was 90%, 83%, and 67% for the 16x, 9x, and 4x HR-MICRA images, respectively. Using the 4x HR-MICRA images as a baseline, the 9x HR-MICRA images were 2.6 times and 16x HR-MICRA images were 3.2 times more likely to have high HIA ratings (p &amp;lt; 0.001) across all hippocampal segments (head, body, and tail). The thin slices of the HR-MICRA images allow reformatting in any plane with clear visualization of hippocampal dentation in the sagittal plane. Clear and consistent visualization of HIA will allow application of this technique to future hippocampal structure research, as well as more precise manual or automated segmentation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Enlarged Area of Mesencephalic Iron Deposits in Adults Who Stutter</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.639269</link>
	<content:encoded>Purpose&lt;p&gt;Childhood onset speech fluency disorder (stuttering) is possibly related to dopaminergic dysfunction. Mesencephalic hyperechogenicity (ME) detected by transcranial ultrasound (TCS) might be seen as an indirect marker of dopaminergic dysfunction. We here determined whether adults who stutter since childhood (AWS) show ME.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We performed TCS in ten AWS and ten matched adults who never stuttered. We also assessed motor performance in finger tapping and in the 25 Foot Walking test.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Compared to controls, AWS showed enlarged ME on either side. Finger tapping was slower in AWS. Walking cadence, i.e., the ratio of number of steps by time, tended to be higher in AWS than in control participants.&lt;/p&gt;Discussion&lt;p&gt;The results demonstrate a motor deficit in AWS linked to dopaminergic dysfunction and extending beyond speech. Since iron deposits evolve in childhood and shrink thereafter, ME might serve as an easily quantifiable biomarker helping to predict the risk of persistency in children who stutter.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: 7T MRI and Computational Modeling Supports a Critical Role of Lead Location in Determining Outcomes for Deep Brain Stimulation: A Case Report</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.631778</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established therapy for Parkinson’s disease motor symptoms. The ideal site for implantation within STN, however, remains controversial. While many argue that placement of a DBS lead within the sensorimotor territory of the STN yields better motor outcomes, others report similar effects with leads placed in the associative or motor territory of the STN, while still others assert that placing a DBS lead “anywhere within a 6-mm-diameter cylinder centered at the presumed middle of the STN (based on stereotactic atlas coordinates) produces similar clinical efficacy.” These discrepancies likely result from methodological differences including targeting preferences, imaging acquisition and the use of brain atlases that do not account for patient-specific anatomic variability. We present a first-in-kind within-patient demonstration of severe mood side effects and minimal motor improvement in a Parkinson’s disease patient following placement of a DBS lead in the limbic/associative territory of the STN who experienced marked improvement in motor benefit and resolution of mood side effects following repositioning the lead within the STN sensorimotor territory. 7 Tesla (7 T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were used to generate a patient-specific anatomical model of the STN with parcellation into distinct functional territories and computational modeling to assess the relative degree of activation of motor, associative and limbic territories.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Neural Correlates of Cued Reward Omission</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.615313</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Compared to our understanding of positive prediction error signals occurring due to unexpected reward outcomes, less is known about the neural circuitry in humans that drives negative prediction errors during omission of expected rewards. While classical learning theories such as Rescorla–Wagner or temporal difference learning suggest that both types of prediction errors result from a simple subtraction, there has been recent evidence suggesting that different brain regions provide input to dopamine neurons which contributes to specific components of this prediction error computation. Here, we focus on the brain regions responding to negative prediction error signals, which has been well-established in animal studies to involve a distinct pathway through the lateral habenula. We examine the activity of this pathway in humans, using a conditioned inhibition paradigm with high-resolution functional MRI. First, participants learned to associate a sensory stimulus with reward delivery. Then, reward delivery was omitted whenever this stimulus was presented simultaneously with a different sensory stimulus, the conditioned inhibitor (CI). Both reward presentation and the reward-predictive cue activated midbrain dopamine regions, insula and orbitofrontal cortex. While we found significant activity at an uncorrected threshold for the CI in the habenula, consistent with our predictions, it did not survive correction for multiple comparisons and awaits further replication. Additionally, the pallidum and putamen regions of the basal ganglia showed modulations of activity for the inhibitor that did not survive the corrected threshold.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Developmental Origins of Opioid Use Disorder and Its Comorbidities</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.601905</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Opioid use disorder (OUD) rarely presents as a unitary psychiatric condition, and the comorbid symptoms likely depend upon the diverse risk factors and mechanisms by which OUD can arise. These factors are heterogeneous and include genetic predisposition, exposure to prescription opioids, and environmental risks. Crucially, one key environmental risk factor for OUD is early life adversity (ELA). OUD and other substance use disorders are widely considered to derive in part from abnormal reward circuit function, which is likely also implicated in comorbid mental illnesses such as depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. ELA may disrupt reward circuit development and function in a manner predisposing to these disorders. Here, we describe new findings addressing the effects of ELA on reward circuitry that lead to OUD and comorbid disorders, potentially via shared neural mechanisms. We discuss some of these OUD-related problems in both humans and animals. We also highlight the increasingly apparent, crucial contribution of biological sex in mediating the range of ELA-induced disruptions of reward circuitry which may confer risk for the development of OUD and comorbid neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Crossed Entorhino-Dentate Projections Form and Terminate With Correct Layer-Specificity in Organotypic Slice Cultures of the Mouse Hippocampus</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.637036</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The entorhino-dentate projection, i.e., the perforant pathway, terminates in a highly ordered and laminated fashion in the rodent dentate gyrus (DG): fibers arising from the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) terminate in the middle molecular layer, whereas fibers arising from the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) terminate in the outer molecular layer of the DG. In rats and rabbits, a crossed entorhino-dentate projection exists, which originates from the entorhinal cortex (EC) and terminates in the contralateral DG. In contrast, in mice, such a crossed projection is reportedly absent. Using single and double mouse organotypic entorhino-hippocampal slice cultures, we studied the ipsi- and crossed entorhino-dentate projections. Viral tracing revealed that entorhino-dentate projections terminate with a high degree of lamina-specificity in single as well as in double cultures. Furthermore, in double cultures, entorhinal axons arising from one slice freely intermingled with entorhinal axons originating from the other slice. In single as well as in double cultures, entorhinal axons exhibited a correct topographical projection to the DG: medial entorhinal axons terminated in the middle and lateral entorhinal axons terminated in the outer molecular layer. Finally, entorhinal neurons were virally transduced with Channelrhodopsin2-YFP and stimulated with light, revealing functional connections between the EC and dentate granule cells. We conclude from our findings that entorhino-dentate projections form bilaterally in the mouse hippocampus in vitro and that the mouse DG provides a permissive environment for crossed entorhinal fibers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Mild Motor Signs Matter in Typical Brain Aging: The Value of the UPDRS Score Within a Functionally Intact Cohort of Older Adults</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.594637</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objectives: To characterize the clinical correlates of subclinical Parkinsonian signs, including longitudinal cognitive and neural (via functional connectivity) outcomes, among functionally normal older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Participants included 737 functionally intact community-dwelling older adults who performed prospective comprehensive evaluations at ~15-months intervals for an average of 4.8 years (standard deviation 3.2 years). As part of these evaluations, participants completed the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) longitudinally and measures of processing speed, executive functioning and verbal episodic memory. T1-weighted structural scans and task-free functional MRI scans were acquired on 330 participants. We conducted linear mixed-effects models to determine the relationship between changes in UPDRS with cognitive and neural changes, using age, sex, and education as covariates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Cognitive outcomes were processing speed, executive functioning, and episodic memory. Greater within-person increases in UPDRS were associated with more cognitive slowing over time. Although higher average UPDRS scores were significantly associated with overall poorer executive functions, there was no association between UPDRS and executive functioning longitudinally. UPDRS scores did not significantly relate to longitudinal memory performances. Regarding neural correlates, greater increases in UPDRS scores were associated with reduced intra-subcortical network connectivity over time. There were no relationships with intra-frontoparietal or inter-subcortical-frontoparietal connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Our findings add to the aging literature by indicating that mild motor changes are negatively associated with cognition and network connectivity in functionally intact adults.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26047?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), early diagnosis is essential for both current and potential treatments. To find a supportive approach for the diagnosis, we constructed an artificial intelligence‐based prediction model of ALS using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Images of spinal motor neurons derived from healthy control and ALS patient iPSCs were analyzed by a deep convolutional neural network, and the algorithm achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.97 for classifying healthy control and ALS. This prediction model by deep learning algorithm with iPSC technology could support the diagnosis and may provide proactive treatment of ALS by future prospective research.

The diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains problematic, with current diagnostic criteria (revised El Escorial [rEEC] and Awaji) being complex and prone to error. Consequently, diagnostic utility of the recently proposed Gold Coast criteria was determined in ALS.


Methods
We retrospectively reviewed 506 patients (302 males, 204 females) to compare the diagnostic accuracy of the Gold Coast criteria to the Awaji and rEEC criteria (defined by the proportion of patients categorized as definite, probable or possible ALS) in accordance with standards of reporting of diagnostic accuracy criteria.


Results
The sensitivity of Gold Coast criteria (92%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 88.7‐94.6%) was comparable to Awaji (90.3%, 95%CI 86.69‐93.2% ) and rEEC (88.6, 95%CI 84.8‐91.7%) criteria. Additionally, the Gold Coast criteria sensitivity was maintained across different subgroups, defined by site of onset, disease duration, and functional disability. In atypical ALS phenotypes, the Gold Coast criteria exhibited greater sensitivity and specificity.


Interpretation
The present study established the diagnostic utility of the Gold Coast criteria in ALS, with benefits evident in bulbar and limb‐onset disease patients, as well as atypical phenotypes. The Gold Coast criteria should be considered in clinical practice and therapeutic trials.

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.631377</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Winfree oscillators are phase oscillator models of neurons, characterized by their phase response curve and pulsatile interaction function. We use the Ott/Antonsen ansatz to study large heterogeneous networks of Winfree oscillators, deriving low-dimensional differential equations which describe the evolution of the expected state of networks of oscillators. We consider the effects of correlations between an oscillator's in-degree and out-degree, and between the in- and out-degrees of an “upstream” and a “downstream” oscillator (degree assortativity). We also consider correlated heterogeneity, where some property of an oscillator is correlated with a structural property such as degree. We finally consider networks with parameter assortativity, coupling oscillators according to their intrinsic frequencies. The results show how different types of network structure influence its overall dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Prediction of Transmembrane Regions, Cholesterol, and Ganglioside Binding Sites in Amyloid-Forming Proteins Indicate Potential for Amyloid Pore Formation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.619496</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Besides amyloid fibrils, amyloid pores (APs) represent another mechanism of amyloid induced toxicity. Since hypothesis put forward by Arispe and collegues in 1993 that amyloid-beta makes ion-conducting channels and that Alzheimer's disease may be due to the toxic effect of these channels, many studies have confirmed that APs are formed by prefibrillar oligomers of amyloidogenic proteins and are a common source of cytotoxicity. The mechanism of pore formation is still not well-understood and the structure and imaging of APs in living cells remains an open issue. To get closer to understand AP formation we used predictive methods to assess the propensity of a set of 30 amyloid-forming proteins (AFPs) to form transmembrane channels. A range of amino-acid sequence tools were applied to predict AP domains of AFPs, and provided context on future experiments that are needed in order to contribute toward a deeper understanding of amyloid toxicity. In a set of 30 AFPs we predicted their amyloidogenic propensity, presence of transmembrane (TM) regions, and cholesterol (CBM) and ganglioside binding motifs (GBM), to which the oligomers likely bind. Noteworthy, all pathological AFPs share the presence of TM, CBM, and GBM regions, whereas the functional amyloids seem to show just one of these regions. For comparative purposes, we also analyzed a few examples of amyloid proteins that behave as biologically non-relevant AFPs. Based on the known experimental data on the β-amyloid and α-synuclein pore formation, we suggest that many AFPs have the potential for pore formation. Oligomerization and α-TM helix to β-TM strands transition on lipid rafts seem to be the common key events.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Systemic Candesartan Treatment Modulates Behavior, Synaptic Protein Levels, and Neuroinflammation in Female Mice That Express Human APOE4</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.628403</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) could be beneficial for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients independent of any effects on hypertension. However, studies in rodent models directly testing the activity of ARB treatment on behavior and AD-relevent pathology including neuroinflammation, Aβ levels, and cerebrovascular function, have produced mixed results. APOE4 is a major genetic risk factor for AD and has been linked to many of the same functions as those purported to be modulated by ARB treatment. Therefore, evaluating the effects of ARB treatment on behavior and AD-relevant pathology in mice that express human APOE4 could provide important information on whether to further develop ARBs for AD therapy. In this study, we treated female and male mice that express the human APOE4 gene in the absence (E4FAD−) or presence (E4FAD+) of high Aβ levels with the ARB prodrug candesartan cilexetil for a duration of 4 months. Compared to vehicle, candesartan treatment resulted in greater memory-relevant behavior and higher hippocampal presynaptic protein levels in female, but not male, E4FAD− and E4FAD+ mice. The beneficial effects of candesartan in female E4FAD− and E4FAD+ mice occurred in tandem with lower GFAP and Iba1 levels in the hippocampus, whereas there were no effects on markers of cerebrovascular function and Aβ levels. Collectively, these data imply that the effects of ARBs on AD-relevant pathology may be modulated in part by the interaction between APOE genotype and biological sex. Thus, the further development of ARBs could provide therapeutic options for targeting neuroinflammation in female APOE4 carriers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: The Impact of Vigorous Cycling Exercise on Visual Attention: A Study With the BR8 Wireless Dry EEG System</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.621365</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many studies have reported that exercise can influence cognitive performance. But advancing our understanding of the interrelations between psychology and physiology in sports neuroscience requires the study of real-time brain dynamics during exercise in the field. Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the most powerful brain imaging technologies. However, the limited portability and long preparation time of traditional wet-sensor systems largely limits their use to laboratory settings. Wireless dry-sensor systems are emerging with much greater potential for practical application in sports. Hence, in this paper, we use the BR8 wireless dry-sensor EEG system to measure P300 brain dynamics while cycling at various intensities. The preparation time was mostly less than 2 min as BR8 system’s dry sensors were able to attain the required skin-sensor interface impedance, enabling its operation without any skin preparation or application of conductive gel. Ten participants performed four sessions of a 3 min rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task while resting and while cycling. These four sessions were pre-CE (RSVP only), low-CE (RSVP in 40–50% of max heart rate), vigorous-CE (RSVP in 71–85% of max heart rate) and post-CE (RSVP only). The recorded brain signals demonstrate that the P300 amplitudes, observed at the Pz channel, for the target and non-target responses were significantly different in all four sessions. The results also show decreased reaction times to the visual attention task during vigorous exercise, enriching our understanding of the ways in which exercise can enhance cognitive performance. Even though only a single channel was evaluated in this study, the quality and reliability of the measurement using these dry sensor-based EEG systems is clearly demonstrated by our results. Further, the smooth implementation of the experiment with a dry system and the success of the data analysis demonstrate that wireless dry EEG devices can open avenues for real-time measurement of cognitive functions in athletes outside the laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.620176</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a destructive and burdensome neurodegenerative disease, one of the most common characteristics of which are neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) that are composed of abnormal tau protein. Animal studies have suggested that dl-3-n-butylphthalide (dl-NBP) alleviates cognitive impairment in mouse models of APP/PS1 and SAMP8. However, the underlying mechanisms related to this remain unclear. In this study, we examined the effects of dl-NBP on learning and memory in P301S transgenic mice, which carry the human tau gene with the P301S mutation. We found that dl-NBP supplementation effectively improved behavioral deficits and rescued synaptic loss in P301S tau transgenic mice, compared with vehicle-treated P301S mice. Furthermore, we also found that it markedly inhibited the hyperphosphorylated tau at the Ser262 site and decreased the activity of MARK4, which was associated with tau at the Ser262 site. Finally, dl-NBP treatment exerted anti-inflammatory effects and reduced inflammatory responses in P301S mice. In conclusion, our results provide evidence that dl-NBP has a promising potential for the therapy of tauopathies, including AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Case Report: Untreatable Headache in a Child With Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt Managed by Use of New Non-invasive Intracranial Pressure Waveform</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.601945</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;brain4care, a new Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared non-invasive sensor that monitors intracranial pressure waveforms, was used in a 13-year-old girl who presented with untreatable headaches. The patient had a history of craniopharyngioma resection and a ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement 7 years prior to the use of the device. Secondary obstructive hydrocephalus was also a present factor in the case. The hypothesis was that due to the hydrocephalus, the child presented chronic headaches and needed constant readjustment into the ventriculoperitoneal shunt to regulate the cerebrospinal fluid inside her ventricles in order to control the patient's intracranial pressure (ICP). The device was chosen considering the risks to submit a patient into the regular invasive method to measure ICP. It was identified that the device could also indicate altered intracranial compliance due to the ratio between the P1 and P2 amplitudes (P2/P1 ratio &amp;gt; 1).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, an artificial intelligence segmented dynamic video image based on the process of intensive cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease monitoring is deeply investigated, and a sparse automatic coding deep neural network with a four layers stack structure is designed to automatically extract the deep features of the segmented dynamic video image shot, and six categories of normal, atrial premature, ventricular premature, right bundle branch block, left bundle branch block, and pacing are achieved through hierarchical training and optimization. Accurate recognition of heartbeats with an average accuracy of 99.5%. It provides technical assistance for the intelligent prediction of high-risk cardiovascular diseases like ventricular fibrillation. An intelligent prediction algorithm for sudden cardiac death based on the echolocation network was proposed. By designing an echolocation network with a multilayer serial structure, an intelligent distinction between sudden cardiac death signal and non-sudden death signal was realized, and the signal was predicted 5 min before sudden death occurred, with an average prediction accuracy of 94.32%. Using the self-learning capability of stack sparse auto-coding network, a large amount of label-free data is designed to train the stack sparse auto-coding deep neural network to automatically extract deep representations of plaque features. A small amount of labeled data then introduced to micro-train the entire network. Through the automatic analysis of the fiber cap thickness in the plaques, the automatic identification of thin fiber cap-like vulnerable plaques was achieved, and the average overlap of vulnerable regions reached 87%. The overall time for the automatic plaque and vulnerable plaque recognition algorithm was 0.54 s. It provides theoretical support for accurate diagnosis and endogenous analysis of high-risk cardiovascular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.592989</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sleep–wake disruptions are among the most prevalent and burdensome non-motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Clinical studies have demonstrated that these disturbances can precede the onset of typical motor symptoms by years, indicating that they may play a primary function in the pathogenesis of PD. Animal studies suggest that sleep facilitates the removal of metabolic wastes through the glymphatic system via convective flow from the periarterial space to the perivenous space, upregulates antioxidative defenses, and promotes the maintenance of neuronal protein homeostasis. Therefore, disruptions to the sleep–wake cycle have been associated with inefficient metabolic clearance and increased oxidative stress in the central nervous system (CNS). This leads to excessive accumulation of alpha-synuclein and the induction of neuronal loss, both of which have been proposed to be contributing factors to the pathogenesis and progression of PD. Additionally, recent studies have suggested that PD-related pathophysiological alterations during the prodromal phase disrupt sleep and circadian rhythms. Taken together, these findings indicate potential mechanistic interactions between sleep–wake disorders and PD progression as proposed in this review. Further research into the hypothetical mechanisms underlying these interactions would be valuable, as positive findings may provide promising insights into novel therapeutic interventions for PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Tau Deletion Prevents Cognitive Impairment and Mitochondrial Dysfunction Age Associated by a Mechanism Dependent on Cyclophilin-D</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.586710</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aging is an irreversible process and the primary risk factor for the development of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Mitochondrial impairment is a process that generates oxidative damage and ATP deficit; both factors are important in the memory decline showed during normal aging and AD. Tau is a microtubule-associated protein, with a strong influence on both the morphology and physiology of neurons. In AD, tau protein undergoes post-translational modifications, which could play a relevant role in the onset and progression of this disease. Also, these abnormal forms of tau could be present during the physiological aging that could be related to memory impairment present during this stage. We previously showed that tau ablation improves mitochondrial function and cognitive abilities in young wild-type mice. However, the possible contribution of tau during aging that could predispose to the development of AD is unclear. Here, we show that tau deletion prevents cognitive impairment and improves mitochondrial function during normal aging as indicated by a reduction in oxidative damage and increased ATP production. Notably, we observed a decrease in cyclophilin-D (CypD) levels in aged tau−/− mice, resulting in increased calcium buffering and reduced mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening. The mPTP is a mitochondrial structure, whose opening is dependent on CypD expression, and new evidence suggests that this could play an essential role in the neurodegenerative process showed during AD. In contrast, hippocampal CypD overexpression in aged tau−/− mice impairs mitochondrial function evidenced by an ATP deficit, increased mPTP opening, and memory loss; all effects were observed in the AD pathology. Our results indicate that the absence of tau prevents age-associated cognitive impairment by maintaining mitochondrial function and reducing mPTP opening through a CypD-dependent mechanism. These findings are novel and represent an important advance in the study of how tau contributes to the cognitive and mitochondrial failure present during aging and AD in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Migraine is a chronic and idiopathic disorder leading to cognitive and affective problems. However, the neural basis of migraine without aura is still unclear. In this study, dynamic amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (dALFF) analyses were performed in 21 patients with migraine without aura and 21 gender- and age-matched healthy controls to identify the voxel-level abnormal functional dynamics. Significantly decreased dALFF in the bilateral anterior insula, bilateral lateral orbitofrontal cortex, bilateral medial prefrontal cortex, bilateral anterior cingulate cortex, and left middle frontal cortex were found in patients with migraine without aura. The dALFF values in the anterior cingulate cortex were negatively correlated with pain intensity, i.e., visual analog scale. Finally, support vector machine was used to classify patients with migraine without aura from healthy controls and achieved an accuracy of 83.33%, sensitivity of 90.48%, and specificity of 76.19%. Our findings provide the evidence that migraine influences the brain functional activity dynamics and reveal the neural basis for migraine, which could facilitate understanding the neuropathology of migraine and future treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.606292</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Our prior research demonstrated that the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) exerted a modulatory role in ingroup bias in emotional mimicry. In this study, two experiments were conducted to further explore whether the rTPJ is a neural region for emotional mimicry or for the modulation of emotional mimicry by group membership in a sham-controlled, double-blinded, between-subject design. Both experiments employed non-invasive transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to temporarily change the cortical excitability over the rTPJ and facial electromyography (fEMG) to measure facial muscle activations as an index of emotional mimicry. After the anodal or sham stimulation, participants in Experiment 1 passively viewed a series of happy clips, while participants in Experiment 2 viewed happy clips performed by ethnic ingroup and outgroup models. fEMG analyses revealed that participants in Experiment 1 showed the same degree of happy mimicry for both tDCS conditions (anodal vs. sham) and participants in Experiment 2 showed an ingroup bias in happy mimicry in the sham condition, which disappeared in the anodal condition. Taken together, the present study demonstrated that rTPJ plays a role in the modulation of emotional mimicry by group membership.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Ninety-seven schoolchildren from 8 to 14 years old were tested: a clinical sample of 49 children with ADHD (n = 18), SLD (n = 18) or SLD in comorbidity with ADHD (n = 13), and 48 typically-developing (TD) children matched for age and intelligence. Participants were administered tasks and questionnaires to confirm their initial diagnosis, and a battery of executive function (EF) tasks testing inhibition, shifting, and verbal and visuospatial updating. Using one-way ANOVAs, our results showed that all children in the clinical samples exhibited impairments on EF measures (inhibition and shifting tasks) when compared with TD children. A more specific pattern only emerged for the updating tasks. Only children with SLD had significant impairment in verbal updating, whereas children with ADHD, and those with SLD in comorbidity with ADHD, had the worst performance in visuospatial updating.

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Criticality, Connectivity, and Neural Disorder: A Multifaceted Approach to Neural Computation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.611183</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It has been hypothesized that the brain optimizes its capacity for computation by self-organizing to a critical point. The dynamical state of criticality is achieved by striking a balance such that activity can effectively spread through the network without overwhelming it and is commonly identified in neuronal networks by observing the behavior of cascades of network activity termed “neuronal avalanches.” The dynamic activity that occurs in neuronal networks is closely intertwined with how the elements of the network are connected and how they influence each other's functional activity. In this review, we highlight how studying criticality with a broad perspective that integrates concepts from physics, experimental and theoretical neuroscience, and computer science can provide a greater understanding of the mechanisms that drive networks to criticality and how their disruption may manifest in different disorders. First, integrating graph theory into experimental studies on criticality, as is becoming more common in theoretical and modeling studies, would provide insight into the kinds of network structures that support criticality in networks of biological neurons. Furthermore, plasticity mechanisms play a crucial role in shaping these neural structures, both in terms of homeostatic maintenance and learning. Both network structures and plasticity have been studied fairly extensively in theoretical models, but much work remains to bridge the gap between theoretical and experimental findings. Finally, information theoretical approaches can tie in more concrete evidence of a network's computational capabilities. Approaching neural dynamics with all these facets in mind has the potential to provide a greater understanding of what goes wrong in neural disorders. Criticality analysis therefore holds potential to identify disruptions to healthy dynamics, granted that robust methods and approaches are considered.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Neurofascin Is a Novel Component of Rod Photoreceptor Synapses in the Outer Retina</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.635849</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural circuit formation is an intricate and complex process where multiple neuron types must come together to form synaptic connections at a precise location and time. How this process is orchestrated during development remains poorly understood. Cell adhesion molecules are known to play a pivotal role in assembling neural circuits. They serve as recognition molecules between corresponding synaptic partners. In this study, we identified a new player in assembling neural circuits in the outer retina, the L1-family cell adhesion molecule Neurofascin (Nfasc). Our data reveals Nfasc is expressed in the synaptic layer where photoreceptors make synaptic connections to their respective partners. A closer examination of Nfasc expression shows high levels of expression in rod bipolars but not in cone bipolars. Disruption of Nfasc using a conditional knockout allele results in selective loss of pre- and post-synaptic proteins in the rod synaptic layer but not in the cone synaptic layer. Electron microscopic analysis confirms that indeed there are abnormal synaptic structures with less dendrites of rod bipolars innervating rod terminals in loss of Nfasc animals. Consistent with these findings, we also observe a decrease in rod-driven retinal responses with disruption of Nfasc function but not in cone-driven responses. Taken together, our data suggest a new role of Nfasc in rod synapses within the mouse outer retina.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are components of the cell surface and extracellular matrix, which bear long polysaccharides called heparan sulfate (HS) attached to the core proteins. HSPGs interact with a variety of ligand proteins through the HS chains, and mutations in HSPG-related genes influence many biological processes and cause various diseases. In particular, recent findings from vertebrate and invertebrate studies have raised the importance of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored HSPGs, glypicans, as central players in the development and functions of synapses. Glypicans are important components of the synapse-organizing protein complexes and serve as ligands for leucine-rich repeat transmembrane neuronal proteins (LRRTMs), leukocyte common antigen-related (LAR) family receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs), and G-protein-coupled receptor 158 (GPR158), regulating synapse formation. Many of these interactions are mediated by the HS chains of glypicans. Neurexins (Nrxs) are also synthesized as HSPGs and bind to some ligands in common with glypicans through HS chains. Therefore, glypicans and Nrxs may act competitively at the synapses. Furthermore, glypicans regulate the postsynaptic expression levels of ionotropic glutamate receptors, controlling the electrophysiological properties and non-canonical BMP signaling of synapses. Dysfunctions of glypicans lead to failures in neuronal network formation, malfunction of synapses, and abnormal behaviors that are characteristic of neurodevelopmental disorders. Recent human genetics revealed that glypicans and HS are associated with autism spectrum disorder, neuroticism, and schizophrenia. In this review, we introduce the studies showing the roles of glypicans and HS in synapse formation, neural plasticity, and neurological disorders, especially focusing on the mouse and Drosophila as potential models for human diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: D1R- and D2R-Medium-Sized Spiny Neurons Diversity: Insights Into Striatal Vulnerability to Huntington’s Disease Mutation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.628010</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Huntington’s disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder caused by an aberrant expansion of the CAG tract within the exon 1 of the HD gene, HTT. HD progressively impairs motor and cognitive capabilities, leading to a total loss of autonomy and ultimate death. Currently, no cure or effective treatment is available to halt the disease. Although the HTT gene is ubiquitously expressed, the striatum appears to be the most susceptible district to the HD mutation with Medium-sized Spiny Neurons (MSNs) (D1R and D2R) representing 95% of the striatal neuronal population. Why are striatal MSNs so vulnerable to the HD mutation? Particularly, why do D1R- and D2R-MSNs display different susceptibility to HD? Here, we highlight significant differences between D1R- and D2R-MSNs subpopulations, such as morphology, electrophysiology, transcriptomic, functionality, and localization in the striatum. We discuss possible reasons for their selective degeneration in the context of HD. Our review suggests that a better understanding of cell type-specific gene expression dysregulation within the striatum might reveal new paths to therapeutic intervention or prevention to ameliorate HD patients’ life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Kinase Signaling in Dendritic Development and Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.624648</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dendrites undergo extensive growth and remodeling during their lifetime. Specification of neurites into dendrites is followed by their arborization, maturation, and functional integration into synaptic networks. Each of these distinct developmental processes is spatially and temporally controlled in an exquisite fashion. Protein kinases through their highly specific substrate phosphorylation regulate dendritic growth and plasticity. Perturbation of kinase function results in aberrant dendritic growth and synaptic function. Not surprisingly, kinase dysfunction is strongly associated with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Herein, we review, (a) key kinase pathways that regulate dendrite structure, function and plasticity, (b) how aberrant kinase signaling contributes to dendritic dysfunction in neurological disorders and (c) emergent technologies that can be applied to dissect the role of protein kinases in dendritic structure and function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Engine Failure in Axo-Myelinic Signaling: A Potential Key Player in the Pathogenesis of Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.610295</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a complex and chronic disease of the central nervous system (CNS), characterized by both degenerative and inflammatory processes leading to axonal damage, demyelination, and neuronal loss. In the last decade, the traditional outside-in standpoint on MS pathogenesis, which identifies a primary autoimmune inflammatory etiology, has been challenged by a complementary inside-out theory. By focusing on the degenerative processes of MS, the axo-myelinic system may reveal new insights into the disease triggering mechanisms. Oxidative stress (OS) has been widely described as one of the means driving tissue injury in neurodegenerative disorders, including MS. Axonal mitochondria constitute the main energy source for electrically active axons and neurons and are largely vulnerable to oxidative injury. Consequently, axonal mitochondrial dysfunction might impair efficient axo-glial communication, which could, in turn, affect axonal integrity and the maintenance of axonal, neuronal, and synaptic signaling. In this review article, we argue that OS-derived mitochondrial impairment may underline the dysfunctional relationship between axons and their supportive glia cells, specifically oligodendrocytes and that this mechanism is implicated in the development of a primary cytodegeneration and a secondary pro-inflammatory response (inside-out), which in turn, together with a variably primed host’s immune system, may lead to the onset of MS and its different subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Ginkgolide B Maintains Calcium Homeostasis in Hypoxic Hippocampal Neurons by Inhibiting Calcium Influx and Intracellular Calcium Release</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.627846</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ginkgolide B (GB), a terpene lactone and active ingredient of Ginkgo biloba, shows protective effects in neuronal cells subjected to hypoxia. We investigated whether GB might protect neurons from hypoxic injury through regulation of neuronal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis. Primary hippocampal neurons subjected to chemical hypoxia (0.7 mM CoCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in vitro exhibited an increase in cytoplasmic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (measured from the fluorescence of fluo-4), but this effect was significantly diminished by pre-treatment with 0.4 mM GB. Electrophysiological recordings from the brain slices of rats exposed to hypoxia in vivo revealed increases in spontaneous discharge frequency, action potential frequency and calcium current magnitude, and all these effects of hypoxia were suppressed by pre-treatment with 12 mg/kg GB. Western blot analysis demonstrated that hypoxia was associated with enhanced mRNA and protein expressions of Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 (a voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel), STIM1 (a regulator of store-operated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry) and RyR2 (isoforms of Ryanodine Receptor which mediates sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release), and these actions of hypoxia were suppressed by GB. Taken together, our in vitro and in vivo data suggest that GB might protect neurons from hypoxia, in part, by regulating Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx and intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release to maintain Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Interleukin-1β Modulates Synaptic Transmission and Synaptic Plasticity During the Acute Phase of Sepsis in the Senescence-Accelerated Mouse Hippocampus</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.637703</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Aging and pre-existing cognitive impairment are considered to be independent risk factors for sepsis-associated encephalopathy. This study aimed to investigate the manner in which aging and pre-existing cognitive dysfunction modified neuroinflammation, synaptic plasticity, and basal synaptic transmission during the acute phase of sepsis using Senescence-Accelerated Mice Prone 8 (SAMP8) and Senescence-Accelerated Resistant Mice 1 (SAMR1).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We used 6-month-old SAMP8 and SAMR1. Sepsis was induced using cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). The animal’s hippocampi and blood were collected for subsequent investigations 24 h after surgery.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Long-term potentiation (LTP) was impaired in the Shaffer-collateral (SC)-CA1 pathway of the hippocampus in SAMP8 without surgery compared to the age-matched SAMR1, which was reflective of cognitive dysfunction in SAMP8. CLP impaired the SC-CA1 LTP in SAMR1 compared to the sham-operated controls, but not in SAMP8. Moreover, CLP decreased the input-output curve and increased the paired-pulse ratio in SAMP8, suggesting the reduced probability of basal synaptic transmission due to sepsis. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that CLP elevated IL-1β levels, especially in the hippocampi of SAMP8 with microglial activation. In vivo peripheral IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) administration in the septic SAMP8 revealed that the neuroinflammation was not correlated with the peripheral elevation of IL-1β. Ex vivo IL-1ra administration to the hippocampus ameliorated LTP impairment in SAMR1 and the reduction in basal transmission in SAMP8 after sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusions&lt;p&gt;The mechanism of the modulation of synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity by the acute stage of sepsis differed between SAMR1 and SAMP8. These changes were related to centrally derived IL-1 receptor-mediated signaling and were accompanied by microglial activation, especially in SAMP8.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Association Between Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase and Mild Cognitive Impairment in Chinese Women</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.630409</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Dementia, as a global public health problem, is becoming increasingly serious. As a precursor of dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) plays an important role in the diagnosis and prevention of dementia. Recent studies have found a correlation between gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels and cognitive function in men. The relationship between GGT levels and cognitive function in women remains unclear because GGT activity and expression differ between the sexes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: We recruited a total of 2,943 Chinese women from Jidong and Taian in 2019. We grouped the participants according to GGT levels, diagnosed MCI using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) scale, and modeled the study outcomes using logistic regression to explore the relationship between GGT level and MCI. We also analyzed the interaction of obesity, sleep duration, and hyperuricemia with GGT in the development of MCI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The prevalence of MCI increased with increasing GGT level, from the lowest quartile to the highest quartile of GGT: 8.4% (66/786), 14.2% (119/840), 17.6% (108/613), and 21.4% (151/704), respectively. At the same time, as GGT levels increased, so did the risk of MCI. In the fully adjusted model, compared with those for participants in the lowest GGT quartiles, the odds ratios (ORs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for MCI for participants in the second, third, and fourth GGT quartiles were 1.49 (1.04–2.12), 1.53(1.06–2.21), and 1.88 (1.33–2.65), respectively. The risk of developing MCI was further increased in people with high GGT levels who were obese (OR = 1.96, 95% CI: 1.39–2.76, P &amp;lt; 0.001), slept less (OR = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.35–2.71, P &amp;lt; 0.001), had high levels of uric acid (OR = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.03–2.32, P &amp;lt; 0.001), or after menopause (OR = 2.92, 95% CI: 2.07–4.12, P &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: We found that MCI is more common in women with elevated GGT levels, so GGT could be a potential diagnostic marker for MCI. Meanwhile, our findings indicated that women with high GGT levels had an increased risk of MCI when they were obese, sleep deprived, had high serum uric acid (SUA) levels or underwent menopause.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Tele-Health Intervention for Carers of Dementia Patients—A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.612404</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the major mental health outcomes on dementia patient carers when using psychoeducational programs and psychotherapeutic interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A meta-analysis was performed with randomized controlled trials of carers' tele-health interventions from the literature inception to December 31, 2019, using PubMed, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases for articles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The meta-analysis identified 1,043 results, of which 11 were randomized control trials. Among all 11 randomized control trials, only one study addressed face-to-face contact with online modules of interventions, four studies addressed telephone-based interventions, two studies reported on combined face-to-face contact and phone call interventions, two studies focused on web-based interventions, one study used video and telephone interventions, and one study conducted a computer-telephone integration system of intervention. The updated evidence suggested that there was more efficacy via tele-health interventions in lowering depression for carers of people with dementia. We outlined the delivery formation of intervention to evaluate the effectiveness and processes of major mental health improvements, including depression, burden, anxiety, and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: In this study, tele-health intervention was shown to significantly lower depression and also lower the risk of mental health impairment. Although there was a significant decrease of depression, there were no significant differences in burden, anxiety, and quality of life. Future researchers are encouraged to carry out larger-scale studies; also, further analysis using a standardized assessment tool is suggested for future multi-component tele-health interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Altered Insular Subregional Connectivity Associated With Cognitions for Distinguishing the Spectrum of Pre-clinical Alzheimer's Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.597455</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) are regarded as part of the pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) spectrum. The insular subregional networks are thought to have diverse intrinsic connectivity patterns that are involved in cognitive and emotional processing. We set out to investigate convergent and divergent altered connectivity patterns of the insular subregions across the spectrum of pre-clinical AD and evaluated how well these patterns can differentiate the pre-clinical AD spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: Functional connectivity (FC) analyses in insular subnetworks were carried out among 38 patients with SCD, 56 patients with aMCI, and 55 normal controls (CNs). Logistic regression analyses were used to construct models for aMCI and CN, as well as SCD and CN classification. Finally, we conducted correlation analyses to measure the relationship between FCs of altered insular subnetworks and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Patients with SCD presented with reduced FC in the bilateral cerebellum posterior lobe and increased FC in the medial frontal gyrus and the middle temporal gyrus. On the other hand, patients with aMCI largely presented with decreased FC in the bilateral inferior parietal lobule, the cerebellum posterior lobe, and the anterior cingulate cortex, as well as increased FC in the medial and inferior frontal gyrus, and the middle and superior temporal gyrus. Logistic regression analyses indicated that a model composed of FCs among altered insular subnetworks in patients with SCD was able to appropriately classify 83.9% of patients with SCD and CN, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.876, 81.6% sensitivity, and 81.8% specificity. A model consisting of altered insular subnetwork FCs in patients with aMCI was able to appropriately classify 86.5% of the patients with aMCI and CNs, with an AUC of 0.887, 80.4% sensitivity, and 83.6% specificity. Furthermore, some of the FCs among altered insular subnetworks were significantly correlated with episodic memory and executive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Patients with SCD and aMCI are likely to share similar convergent and divergent altered intrinsic FC patterns of insular subnetworks as the pre-clinical AD spectrum, and presented with abnormalities among subnetworks. Based on these abnormalities, individuals can be correctly differentiated in the pre-clinical AD spectrum. These results suggest that alterations in insular subnetworks can be utilized as a potential biomarker to aid in conducting a clinical diagnosis of the spectrum of pre-clinical AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Disease‐Modifying Therapies and Coronavirus Disease 2019 Severity in Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26028?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
This study was undertaken to assess the impact of immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapies on the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS).


Methods
We retrospectively collected data of PwMS with suspected or confirmed COVID‐19. All the patients had complete follow‐up to death or recovery. Severe COVID‐19 was defined by a 3‐level variable: mild disease not requiring hospitalization versus pneumonia or hospitalization versus intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death. We evaluated baseline characteristics and MS therapies associated with severe COVID‐19 by multivariate and propensity score (PS)‐weighted ordinal logistic models. Sensitivity analyses were run to confirm the results.


Results
Of 844 PwMS with suspected (n = 565) or confirmed (n = 279) COVID‐19, 13 (1.54%) died; 11 of them were in a progressive MS phase, and 8 were without any therapy. Thirty‐eight (4.5%) were admitted to an ICU; 99 (11.7%) had radiologically documented pneumonia; 96 (11.4%) were hospitalized.
After adjusting for region, age, sex, progressive MS course, Expanded Disability Status Scale, disease duration, body mass index, comorbidities, and recent methylprednisolone use, therapy with an anti‐CD20 agent (ocrelizumab or rituximab) was significantly associated (odds ratio [OR] = 2.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.18–4.74, p = 0.015) with increased risk of severe COVID‐19. Recent use (&amp;lt;1 month) of methylprednisolone was also associated with a worse outcome (OR = 5.24, 95% CI = 2.20–12.53, p = 0.001). Results were confirmed by the PS‐weighted analysis and by all the sensitivity analyses.


Interpretation
This study showed an acceptable level of safety of therapies with a broad array of mechanisms of action. However, some specific elements of risk emerged. These will need to be considered while the COVID‐19 pandemic persists. ANN NEUROL 2021</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Parkinson's disease and other Lewy body spectrum diseases (LBDs) are associated with a specific risk for clinical depression. In the present clinicopathological study with 73 LBD patients, we observed that the substantia nigra pars compacta dopamine neuron density was markedly lower in patients who had comorbid depression antemortem than in nondepressed patients (1.52 vs 2.32 n/mm2, p=0.004). There were no differences in cognition, motor disease severity, antiparkinsonian medications or disease duration between groups. The results implicate the substantia nigra as an important psychomotor modulatory area of mood in patients with Lewy body disorders.

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Inferences of glia‐mediated control in Caenorhabditis elegans</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24803?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>In this study we show that the invertebrate cephalic glia (CEPglia) are important regulators of complex behaviors. Caenorhabditis elegans CEPglia are similar to astrocytes and assist in temporally regulating bidirectional communication with neurons and non‐neuronal cells. Thus, CEPglia mediated signaling facilitates the fluent transition between independent behaviors in a complex motor program.

Abstract
Astrocytes modulate synaptic transmission; yet, it remains unclear how glia influence complex behaviors. Here, we explore the effects of Caenorhabditis elegans astrocyte‐like cephalic glia (CEPglia) and the glia‐specific bHLH transcription factor HLH‐17 on mating behavior and the defecation motor program (DMP). In C. elegans, male mating has been explicitly described through the male tail circuit and is characterized by coordination of multiple independent behaviors to ensure that copulation is achieved. Furthermore, the sex‐specific male mating circuitry shares similar components with the DMP, which is complex and rhythmic, and requires a fixed sequence of behaviors to be activated periodically. We found that loss of CEPglia reduced persistence in executing mating behaviors and hindered copulation, while males that lacked HLH‐17 demonstrated repetitive prodding behavior that increased the time spent in mating but did not hinder copulation. During the DMP, we found that posterior body wall contractions (pBocs) and enteric muscle contractions (EMCs) were differentially affected by loss of HLH‐17 or CEPglia in males and hermaphrodites. pBocs and EMCs required HLH‐17 activity in both sexes, whereas loss of CEPglia alone did not affect DMP in males. Our data suggest that CEPglia mediate complex behaviors by signaling to the GABAergic DVB neuron, and that HLH‐17 activity influences those discrete steps within those behaviors. Collectively, these data provide evidence of glia as a link in cooperative regulation of complex and rhythmic behavior that, in C. elegans links circuitry in the head and the tail.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Computational Model of Motion Sickness Describing the Effects of Learning Exogenous Motion Dynamics</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.634604</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The existing computational models used to estimate motion sickness are incapable of describing the fact that the predictability of motion patterns affects motion sickness. Therefore, the present study proposes a computational model to describe the effect of the predictability of dynamics or the pattern of motion stimuli on motion sickness. In the proposed model, a submodel – in which a recursive Gaussian process regression is used to represent human features of online learning and future prediction of motion dynamics – is combined with a conventional model of motion sickness based on an observer theory. A simulation experiment was conducted in which the proposed model predicted motion sickness caused by a 900 s horizontal movement. The movement was composed of a 9 m repetitive back-and-forth movement pattern with a pause. Regarding the motion condition, the direction and timing of the motion were varied as follows: (a) Predictable motion (M_P): the direction of the motion and duration of the pause were set to 8 s; (b) Motion with unpredicted direction (M_dU): the pause duration was fixed as in (M_P), but the motion direction was randomly determined; (c) Motion with unpredicted timing (M_tU): the motion direction was fixed as in (M_P), but the pause duration was randomly selected from 4 to 12 s. The results obtained using the proposed model demonstrated that the predicted motion sickness incidence for (M_P) was smaller than those for (M_dU) and (M_tU) and no considerable difference was found between M_dU and M_tU. This tendency agrees with the sickness patterns observed in a previous experimental study in which the human participants were subject to motion conditions similar to those used in our simulations. Moreover, no significant differences were found in the predicted motion sickness incidences at different conditions when the conventional model was used.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Up and Down States During Slow Oscillations in Slow-Wave Sleep and Different Levels of Anesthesia</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.609645</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Slow oscillations are a pattern of synchronized network activity generated by the cerebral cortex. They consist of Up and Down states, which are periods of activity interspersed with periods of silence, respectively. However, even when this is a unique dynamic regime of transitions between Up and Down states, this pattern is not constant: there is a range of oscillatory frequencies (0.1–4 Hz), and the duration of Up vs. Down states during the cycles is variable. This opens many questions. Is there a constant relationship between the duration of Up and Down states? How much do they vary across conditions and oscillatory frequencies? Are there different sub regimes within the slow oscillations? To answer these questions, we aimed to explore a concrete aspect of slow oscillations, Up and Down state durations, across three conditions: deep anesthesia, light anesthesia, and slow-wave sleep (SWS), in the same chronically implanted rats. We found that light anesthesia and SWS have rather similar properties, occupying a small area of the Up and Down state duration space. Deeper levels of anesthesia occupy a larger region of this space, revealing that a large variety of Up and Down state durations can emerge within the slow oscillatory regime. In a network model, we investigated the network parameters that can explain the different points within our bifurcation diagram in which slow oscillations are expressed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Glycinergic Transmission in the Presence and Absence of Functional GlyT2: Lessons From the Auditory Brainstem</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.560008</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Synaptic transmission is controlled by re-uptake systems that reduce transmitter concentrations in the synaptic cleft and recycle the transmitter into presynaptic terminals. The re-uptake systems are thought to ensure cytosolic concentrations in the terminals that are sufficient for reloading empty synaptic vesicles (SVs). Genetic deletion of glycine transporter 2 (GlyT2) results in severely disrupted inhibitory neurotransmission and ultimately to death. Here we investigated the role of GlyT2 at inhibitory glycinergic synapses in the mammalian auditory brainstem. These synapses are tuned for resilience, reliability, and precision, even during sustained high-frequency stimulation when endocytosis and refilling of SVs probably contribute substantially to efficient replenishment of the readily releasable pool (RRP). Such robust synapses are formed between MNTB and LSO neurons (medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, lateral superior olive). By means of patch-clamp recordings, we assessed the synaptic performance in controls, in GlyT2 knockout mice (KOs), and upon acute pharmacological GlyT2 blockade. Via computational modeling, we calculated the reoccupation rate of empty release sites and RRP replenishment kinetics during 60-s challenge and 60-s recovery periods. Control MNTB-LSO inputs maintained high fidelity neurotransmission at 50 Hz for 60 s and recovered very efficiently from synaptic depression. During 'marathon-experiments' (30,600 stimuli in 20 min), RRP replenishment accumulated to 1,260-fold. In contrast, KO inputs featured severe impairments. For example, the input number was reduced to ~1 (vs. ~4 in controls), implying massive functional degeneration of the MNTB-LSO microcircuit and a role of GlyT2 during synapse maturation. Surprisingly, neurotransmission did not collapse completely in KOs as inputs still replenished their small RRP 80-fold upon 50 Hz | 60 s challenge. However, they totally failed to do so for extended periods. Upon acute pharmacological GlyT2 inactivation, synaptic performance remained robust, in stark contrast to KOs. RRP replenishment was 865-fold in marathon-experiments, only ~1/3 lower than in controls. Collectively, our empirical and modeling results demonstrate that GlyT2 re-uptake activity is not the dominant factor in the SV recycling pathway that imparts indefatigability to MNTB-LSO synapses. We postulate that additional glycine sources, possibly the antiporter Asc-1, contribute to RRP replenishment at these high-fidelity brainstem synapses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Astrocytic and Oligodendrocytic P2X7 Receptors Determine Neuronal Functions in the CNS</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.641570</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;P2X7 receptors are members of the ATP-gated cationic channel family with a preferential localization at the microglial cells, the resident macrophages of the brain. However, these receptors are also present at neuroglia (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes) although at a considerably lower density. They mediate necrosis/apoptosis by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as the excitotoxic (glio)transmitters glutamate and ATP. Besides mediating cell damage i.e., superimposed upon chronic neurodegenerative processes in Alzheimer’s Disease, Parkinson’s Disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, they may also participate in neuroglial signaling to neurons under conditions of high ATP concentrations during any other form of neuroinflammation/neurodegeneration. It is a pertinent open question whether P2X7Rs are localized on neurons, or whether only neuroglia/microglia possess this receptor-type causing indirect effects by releasing the above-mentioned signaling molecules. We suggest as based on molecular biology and functional evidence that neurons are devoid of P2X7Rs although the existence of neuronal P2X7Rs cannot be excluded with absolute certainty.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Glymphatic System as a Gateway to Connect Neurodegeneration From Periphery to CNS</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.639140</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The classic concept of the absence of lymphatic vessels in the central nervous system (CNS), suggesting the immune privilege of the brain in spite of its high metabolic rate, was predominant until recent times. On the other hand, this idea left questioned how cerebral interstitial fluid is cleared of waste products. It was generally thought that clearance depends on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Not long ago, an anatomically and functionally discrete paravascular space was revised to provide a pathway for the clearance of molecules drained within the interstitial space. According to this model, CSF enters the brain parenchyma along arterial paravascular spaces. Once mixed with interstitial fluid and solutes in a process mediated by aquaporin-4, CSF exits through the extracellular space along venous paravascular spaces, thus being removed from the brain. This process includes the participation of perivascular glial cells due to a sieving effect of their end-feet. Such draining space resembles the peripheral lymphatic system, therefore, the term “glymphatic” (glial-lymphatic) pathway has been coined. Specific studies focused on the potential role of the glymphatic pathway in healthy and pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases. This mainly concerns Alzheimer’s disease (AD), as well as hemorrhagic and ischemic neurovascular disorders; other acute degenerative processes, such as normal pressure hydrocephalus or traumatic brain injury are involved as well. Novel morphological and functional investigations also suggested alternative models to drain molecules through perivascular pathways, which enriched our insight of homeostatic processes within neural microenvironment. Under the light of these considerations, the present article aims to discuss recent findings and concepts on nervous lymphatic drainage and blood–brain barrier (BBB) in an attempt to understand how peripheral pathological conditions may be detrimental to the CNS, paving the way to neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.590354</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Low-intensity transcranial ultrasound (LITUS) may have a therapeutic effect on Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients to some extent. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and relaxation time T2&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; that indicate the integrity of fiber tracts and iron concentrations in brain tissue have been used to evaluate the therapeutic effects of LITUS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Purpose: This study aims to use FA and T2&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; values to evaluate the therapeutic effects of LITUS in a PD rat model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials and Methods: Twenty Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into a hemi-PD group (n = 10) and a LITUS group (n = 10). Single-shot spin echo echo-planar imaging and fast low-angle shot T2WI sequences at 3.0 T were used. The FA and T2&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; values on the right side of the substantia nigra (SN) pars compacta were measured to evaluate the therapeutic effect of LITUS in the rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: One week after PD-like signs were induced in the rats, the FA value in the LITUS group was significantly larger compared with the PD group (0.214 ± 0.027 vs. 0.340 ± 0.032, t = 2.864, P = 0.011). At the 5th and 6th weeks, the FA values in the LITUS group were significantly smaller compared with the PD group (5th week: 0.290 ± 0.037 vs. 0.405 ± 0.027, t = 2.385, P = 0.030; 6th week: 0.299 ± 0.021 vs. 0.525 ± 0.028, t = 6.620, P &amp;lt; 0.0001). In the 5th and 6th weeks, the T2&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; values in the injected right SN of the LITUS group were significantly higher compared with the PD group (5th week, 12.169 ± 0.826 in the LITUS group vs. 7.550 ± 0.824 in the PD group; 6th week, 11.749 ± 0.615 in the LITUS group vs. 7.550 ± 0.849 in the PD group).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: LITUS had neuroprotective effects and can reduce the damage of 6-OHDA-induced neurotoxicity in hemi-PD rats. The combination of FA and T2&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; assessments can potentially serve as a new and effective method to evaluate the therapeutic effects of LITUS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Isoquercetin Improves Inflammatory Response in Rats Following Ischemic Stroke</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.555543</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Inflammatory response contributes to brain injury after ischemia and reperfusion (I/R). Our previous literature has shown isoquercetin plays an important role in protecting against cerebral I/R injury. The present study was conducted to further investigate the effect of isoquercetin on inflammation-induced neuronal injury in I/R rats with the involvement of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA) and inhibitor of NF-κB (I-κB)/nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway mediated by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and C5a receptor 1 (C5aR1). In vivo middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R) rat model and in vitro oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R) neuron model were used. MCAO/R induced neurological deficits, cell apoptosis, and release of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6 in ischemic brain in rats. Simultaneously, the expression of TLR4 and C5aR1 was significantly up-regulated in both MCAO/R rats and OGD/R neurons, accompanied with the inhibition of cAMP/PKA signaling and activation of I-κB/NF-κB signaling in the cortex of MCAO/R rats. Over-expression of C5aR1 in neurons induced decrease of cell viability, exerting similar effects with OGD/R injury. Isoquercetin acted as a neuroprotective agent against I/R brain injury to suppress inflammatory response and improve cell recovery by inhibiting TLR4 and C5aR1 expression, promoting cAMP/PKA activation, and inhibiting I-κB/NF-κB activation and Caspase 3 expression. TLR4 and C5aR1 contributed to inflammation and apoptosis via activating cAMP/PKA/I-κB/NF-κB signaling during cerebral I/R, suggesting that this signaling pathway may be a potent therapeutic target in ischemic stroke. Isoquercetin was identified as a neuroprotective agent, which maybe a promising therapeutic agent used for the treatment of ischemic stroke and related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Networks Are Associated With Depression in Patients With Parkinson’s Disease: A Resting-State Imaging Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.573538</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Disturbance of networks was recently proposed to be associated with the occurrence of depression in Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, the neurobiological mechanism of depression underlying PD remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;This study was conducted to investigate whether intra-network and inter-network brain connectivity is differently changed in PD patients with and without depression (PDD and PDND patients, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Forty-one PDD patients, 64 PDND patients, and 55 healthy controls (HCs) underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The default mode network (DMN), executive control network (ECN), salience network (SN), precuneus network (PCUN), and sensorimotor network (SMN) were extracted using independent component analysis (ICA), and then the functional connectivity (FC) values within and between these networks were measured.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;PDD patients exhibited abnormal FC values within the DMN, ECN, SN, PCUN, and SMN. In addition, PDD patients demonstrated decreased connectivity between anterior SN (aSN) and bilateral ECN, between posterior SN (pSN) and dorsal DMN (dDMN), and between PCUN and dDMN/SMN/bilateral ECN. Connectivity within the left hippocampus of dDMN and the right medial superior frontal gyrus of aSN was a significant predictor of depression level in PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusions&lt;p&gt;Aberrant intra- and inter-network FC is involved in several important hubs in the large-scale networks, which can be a biomarker for distinguishing PDD from PDND.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.638887</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The loss or absence of vision is probably one of the most incapacitating events that can befall a human being. The importance of vision for humans is also reflected in brain anatomy as approximately one third of the human brain is devoted to vision. It is therefore unsurprising that throughout history many attempts have been undertaken to develop devices aiming at substituting for a missing visual capacity. In this review, we present two concepts that have been prevalent over the last two decades. The first concept is sensory substitution, which refers to the use of another sensory modality to perform a task that is normally primarily sub-served by the lost sense. The second concept is cross-modal plasticity, which occurs when loss of input in one sensory modality leads to reorganization in brain representation of other sensory modalities. Both phenomena are training-dependent. We also briefly describe the history of blindness from ancient times to modernity, and then proceed to address the means that have been used to help blind individuals, with an emphasis on modern technologies, invasive (various type of surgical implants) and non-invasive devices. With the advent of brain imaging, it has become possible to peer into the neural substrates of sensory substitution and highlight the magnitude of the plastic processes that lead to a rewired brain. Finally, we will address the important question of the value and practicality of the available technologies and future directions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Feeling Touched: Empathy Is Associated With Performance in a Tactile Acuity Task</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.593425</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The concept of empathy describes our capacity to understand the emotions and intentions of others and to relate to our conspecifics. Numerous studies investigated empathy as a state as well as a stable personality trait. For example, recent studies in neuroscience suggest, among other brain areas such as the insula or the ACC, a role of the somatosensory cortices for empathy (e.g., when observing someone else being touched). Since the classic understanding of the primary somatosensory cortex is to represent touch on the body surface, we here aimed to test whether tactile performance is linked to the personality trait empathy. To test this, we examined the tactile acuity of 95 healthy participants (mean age 31 years) by using a two-point discrimination threshold task at the index fingers. Trait empathy was assessed by employing the interpersonal reactivity index (IRI), which measures self-reported empathy with four scales (empathic concern, perspective taking, fantasy, and personal distress). Results of regression analyses suggested the subscale empathic concern to be positively associated with performance in the tactile acuity task. We discuss this finding in the light of recent studies on empathy and consider possible implications of tactile training to enhance empathy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Short-Term Plasticity in Cortical GABAergic Synapses on Olfactory Bulb Granule Cells Is Modulated by Endocannabinoids</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.629052</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Olfactory bulb and higher processing areas are synaptically interconnected, providing rapid regulation of olfactory bulb circuit dynamics and sensory processing. Short-term plasticity changes at any of these synapses could modulate sensory processing and potentially short-term sensory memory. A key olfactory bulb circuit for mediating cortical feedback modulation is granule cells, which are targeted by multiple cortical regions including both glutamatergic excitatory inputs and GABAergic inhibitory inputs. There is robust endocannabinoid modulation of excitatory inputs to granule cells and here we explored whether there was also endocannabinoid modulation of the inhibitory cortical inputs to granule cells. We expressed light-gated cation channel channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in GABAergic neurons in the horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca (HDB) and their projections to granule cells in olfactory bulb. Selective optical activation of ChR2 positive axons/terminals generated strong, frequency-dependent short-term depression of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated-IPSC in granule cells. As cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor is heavily expressed in olfactory bulb granule cell layer (GCL) and there is endogenous endocannabinoid release in GCL, we investigated whether activation of CB1 receptor modulated the HDB IPSC and short-term depression at the HDB→granule cell synapse. Activation of the CB1 receptor by the exogenous agonist Win 55,212-2 significantly decreased the peak amplitude of individual IPSC and decreased short-term depression, while blockade of the CB1 receptor by AM 251 slightly increased individual IPSCs and increased short-term depression. Thus, we conclude that there is tonic endocannabinoid activation of the GABAergic projections of the HDB to granule cells, similar to the modulation observed with glutamatergic projections to granule cells. Modulation of inhibitory synaptic currents and frequency-dependent short-term depression could regulate the precise balance of cortical feedback excitation and inhibition of granule cells leading to changes in granule cell mediated inhibition of olfactory bulb output to higher processing areas.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Stroke, the most prevalent cerebrovascular disease, causes serious loss of neurological function and is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite advances in pharmacological and surgical therapy, treatment for functional rehabilitation following stroke is limited with a consequent serious impact on quality of life. Over the past decades, mesenchymal stem cell (MSCs)-based therapy has emerged as a novel strategy for various diseases including stroke due to their unique properties that include easy isolation, multipotent differentiation potential and strong paracrine capacity. Although MSCs have shown promising results in the treatment of stroke, there remain many challenges to overcome prior to their therapeutic application. In this review, we focus on the following issues: the scientific data from preclinical studies and clinical trials of MSCs in the treatment of stroke; the potential mechanisms underlying MSC-based therapy for stroke; the challenges related to the timing and delivery of MSCs and MSC senescence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.625175</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Modular organization reflects the activity patterns of our brain. Different disease states may lead to different activity patterns and clinical features. Early onset depression (EOD) and late onset depression (LOD) share the same clinical symptoms, but have different treatment strategies and prognosis. Thus, explored the modular organization of EOD and LOD might help us understand their pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: The study included 82 patients with late life depression (EOD 40, LOD 42) and 90 healthy controls. We evaluated the memory, executive function and processing speed and performed resting-stage functional MRI for all participants. We constructed a functional network based on Granger causality analysis and carried out modularity, normalized mutual information (NMI), Phi coefficient, within module degree z-score, and participation coefficient analyses for all the participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Result: The Granger function network analysis suggested that the functional modularity was different among the three groups (P&lt;sub&gt;auc&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.0300), and NMI analysis confirmed that the partition of EOD was different from that of LOD (P&lt;sub&gt;auc&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.0190). Rh.10d.ROI (polar frontal cortex) and Rh.IPS1.ROI (dorsal stream visual cortex) were shown to be the potential specific nodes in the modular assignment according to the Phi coefficient (P = 0.0002, P&lt;sub&gt;fdr&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.0744 &amp;amp; P = 0.0004, P&lt;sub&gt;fdr&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.0744).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: This study reveal that the functional modularity and partition were different between EOD and LOD in Granger function network. These findings support the hypothesis that different pathological changes might exist in EOD and LOD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Chronic immobilization stress (CIS) results in sex‐dependent changes in opioid peptide levels and receptor subcellular distributions within the rat dorsal hippocampus, which are paralleled with an inability for males to acquire conditioned place preference (CPP) to oxycodone. Here, RNAScope in situ hybridization was used to determine the expression of hippocampal opioid peptides and receptors in unstressed (US) and CIS estrus female and male adult (∼2.5 months old ) Sprague Dawley rats. In all groups, dentate granule cells expressed PENK and PDYN; additionally, numerous interneurons expressed PENK. OPRD1 and OPRM1 were primarily expressed in interneurons, and to a lesser extent, in pyramidal and granule cells. OPRK1‐was expressed in sparsely distributed interneurons. There were few baseline sex differences: US females compared to US males had more PENK‐expressing and fewer OPRD1‐expressing granule cells and more OPRM1‐expressing CA3b interneurons. Several expression differences emerged after CIS. Both CIS females and males compared to their US counterparts had elevated: (1) PENK‐expressing dentate granule cells and interneurons in CA1 and CA2/3a; (2) OPRD1 probe number and cell expression in CA1, CA2/3a and CA3b and the dentate gyrus; and (3) OPRK1‐expressing interneurons in the dentate hilus. Also, CIS males compared to US males had elevated: (1) PDYN expression in granule cells; (2) OPRD1 probe and interneuron expression in CA2/3a; (3) OPRM1 in granule cells; and (4) OPRK1 interneuron expression in CA2/3a. The sex‐specific changes in hippocampal opioid gene expression may impact network properties and synaptic plasticity processes that may contribute to the attenuation of oxycodone CPP in CIS males.</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: MED27 Variants Cause Developmental Delay, Dystonia, and Cerebellar Hypoplasia</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26019?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>The Mediator multiprotein complex functions as a regulator of RNA polymerase II–catalyzed gene transcription. In this study, exome sequencing detected biallelic putative disease‐causing variants in MED27, encoding Mediator complex subunit 27, in 16 patients from 11 families with a novel neurodevelopmental syndrome. Patient phenotypes are highly homogeneous, including global developmental delay, intellectual disability, axial hypotonia with distal spasticity, dystonic movements, and cerebellar hypoplasia. Seizures and cataracts were noted in severely affected individuals. Identification of multiple patients with biallelic MED27 variants supports the critical role of MED27 in normal human neural development, particularly for the cerebellum.

	<title>Hippocampus: Hippocampal beta oscillations predict mouse object‐location associative memory performance</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23311?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Memorizing the locations of environmental cues is crucial for survival and depends on the hippocampus. We recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from the hippocampus of freely moving mice during an object location task. The power of beta‐band (23–30 Hz) oscillations increased immediately before approaching objects in a memory‐encoding phase. The exploration‐induced beta oscillations gradually decreased during the memory‐encoding session. Mice that exhibited stronger beta oscillation power exhibited better performance in the subsequent memory‐retrieval test. These results suggest that beta oscillations in the hippocampal CA1 region are involved in the memory encoding of object‐location associations.</content:encoded>
