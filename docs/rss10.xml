	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: AJILE Movement Prediction: Multimodal Deep Learning for Natural Human Neural Recordings and Video. (arXiv:1709.05939v1 [cs.CV])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05939</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Developing useful interfaces between brains and machines is a grand challenge
of neuroengineering. An effective interface has the capacity to not only
interpret neural signals, but predict the intentions of the human to perform an
action in the near future; prediction is made even more challenging outside
well-controlled laboratory experiments. This paper describes our approach to
detect and to predict natural human arm movements in the future, a key
challenge in brain computer interfacing that has never before been attempted.
We introduce the novel Annotated Joints in Long-term ECoG (AJILE) dataset;
AJILE includes automatically annotated poses of 7 upper body joints for four
human subjects over 670 total hours (more than 72 million frames), along with
the corresponding simultaneously acquired intracranial neural recordings. The
size and scope of AJILE greatly exceeds all previous datasets with movements
and electrocorticography (ECoG), making it possible to take a deep learning
approach to movement prediction. We propose a multimodal model that combines
deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM)
blocks, leveraging both ECoG and video modalities. We demonstrate that our
models are able to detect movements and predict future movements up to 800 msec
before movement initiation. Further, our multimodal movement prediction models
exhibit resilience to simulated ablation of input neural signals. We believe a
multimodal approach to natural neural decoding that takes context into account
is critical in advancing bioelectronic technologies and human neuroscience.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Closing the loop between neural network simulators and the OpenAI Gym. (arXiv:1709.05650v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05650</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Since the enormous breakthroughs in machine learning over the last decade,
functional neural network models are of growing interest for many researchers
in the field of computational neuroscience. One major branch of research is
concerned with biologically plausible implementations of reinforcement
learning, with a variety of different models developed over the recent years.
However, most studies in this area are conducted with custom simulation scripts
and manually implemented tasks. This makes it hard for other researchers to
reproduce and build upon previous work and nearly impossible to compare the
performance of different learning architectures. In this work, we present a
novel approach to solve this problem, connecting benchmark tools from the field
of machine learning and state-of-the-art neural network simulators from
computational neuroscience. This toolchain enables researchers in both fields
to make use of well-tested high-performance simulation software supporting
biologically plausible neuron, synapse and network models and allows them to
evaluate and compare their approach on the basis of standardized environments
of varying complexity. We demonstrate the functionality of the toolchain by
implementing a neuronal actor-critic architecture for reinforcement learning in
the NEST simulator and successfully training it on two different environments
from the OpenAI Gym.

&lt;p&gt;Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) represses the transcription of many target genes, including genes that encode chromatin-associated proteins. Loss of FMRP leads to fragile X syndrome (FXS); however, whether misregulation of chromatin-associated proteins contributes to FXS is unclear. Korb et al. showed that &lt;/p&gt;

During sensory processing, reverse-correlation techniques revealed that white-noise luminance sequences elicit a robust occipital ~10 Hz response that periodically reverberates the input sequence for up to 1 s. These perceptual echoes constitute the impulse response function of the visual system. However, the spatial dimension of perceptual echoes remains unknown: do they reverberate across the cortex simultaneously? Does stimulation over multiple visual coordinates evoke multiple synchronized echoes, or do they show consistent phase differences? Here, we tested the spatial dimension of perceptual echoes in two electroencephalogram (EEG) experiments manipulating the location of the visual stimulation. When a single disc flickered a white-noise luminance sequence in the upper visual field, we observed a single &quot;echo wave&quot; originating in posterior sensors and spatially propagating towards frontal ones (i.e. periodic travelling wave). The presentation of two independent flickering discs in separate visual hemifields produced two simultaneous and superimposed echo waves propagating in opposite directions, one in response to each stimulus. Strikingly, at many electrode sites, the phase of the two echoes differed, with a phase advance for the contralateral stimulus location. EEG source reconstruction tentatively located the waves within contralateral parieto-occipital cortex. In conclusion, the alpha rhythm processes stimulus information as a travelling wave that propagates across the cortical representation of retinotopic space in the human brain. In line with the &quot;cortical scanning&quot; hypothesis (Pitts &amp;amp; McCulloch, 1947), these results suggest the existence of an additional spatial dimension embedded in the phase of the alpha rhythm.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: CA2 Neuronal Activity Controls Hippocampal Oscillations and Social Behavior</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/190504v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Hippocampal oscillations arise from coordinated activity among distinct populations of neurons and are associated with cognitive functions and behaviors. Although much progress has been made toward identifying the relative contribution of specific neuronal populations in hippocampal oscillations, far less is known about the role of hippocampal area CA2, which is thought to support social aspects of episodic memory. Furthermore, the little existing evidence on the role of CA2 in oscillations have led to conflicting conclusions. Therefore, we sought to identify the specific contribution of CA2 pyramidal neurons to brain oscillations using a controlled experimental system. We used excitatory and inhibitory DREADDs in transgenic mice to acutely and reversibly manipulate CA2 pyramidal cell activity. Here, we report on the role of CA2 in hippocampal-prefrontal cortical network oscillations and social behavior. We found that excitation or inhibition of CA2 pyramidal cell activity bidirectionally regulated hippocampal and prefrontal cortical low gamma oscillations and inversely modulated hippocampal ripple oscillations. Further, CA2 inhibition impaired social approach behavior. These findings support a role for CA2 in low gamma generation and ripple modulation within the hippocampus and underscore the importance of CA2 neuronal activity in extrahippocampal oscillations and social behavior.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Using spatiotemporal source separation to identify prominent features in multichannel data without sinusoidal filters</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/190470v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The number of simultaneously recorded electrodes in neuroscience is steadily increasing, providing new opportunities for understanding brain function, but also new challenges for appropriately dealing with the increase in dimensionality. Multivariate source-separation analysis methods have been particularly effective at improving signal-to-noise ratio while reducing the dimensionality of the data, and are widely used for cleaning, classifying, and source-localizing multichannel neural time series data. Most source-separation methods produce a spatial component (that is, a weighted combination of channels to produce one time series); here, this is extended to apply source-separation to a time series, with the idea of obtaining a weighted combination of successive time points, such that the weights are optimized to satisfy some criteria. This is achieved via a two-stage source-separation procedure, in which an optimal spatial filter is first constructed, and then its optimal temporal basis function is computed. This second stage is achieved with a time-delay-embedding matrix, in which additional rows of a matrix are created from time-delayed versions of existing rows. The optimal spatial and temporal weights can be obtained by solving a generalized eigendecomposition of covariance matrices. The method is demonstrated in simulated data and in an empirical EEG study on theta-band activity during response conflict. Spatiotemporal source separation has several advantages, including defining empirical filters without the need to apply sinusoidal narrowband filters.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Limitations of compensatory plasticity: the organization of the primary sensorimotor cortex in foot-using bilateral upper limb dysplasics</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/190462v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>What forces direct brain organization and its plasticity? When a brain region is deprived of its input would this region reorganize based on compensation for the disability and experience, or would strong limitations of brain structure limit its plasticity? People born without hands activate their sensorimotor hand region while moving body parts used to compensate for this ability (e.g. their feet). This has been taken to suggest an organization based on functions, such as performing manual-like dexterous actions, rather than on body parts. Here we test the selectivity for functionally-compensatory body parts in the sensorimotor cortex of people born without hands. Despite clear compensatory foot use, the sensorimotor hand area in the dysplasic subjects showed preference for non-compensatory body parts whose cortical territory is close to the hand area. This suggests that function-based organization, originally proposed for full congenital blindness and deafness, does not apply to cases of the primary sensorimotor cortex in dysplasia. This is consistent with the idea that experience-independent functional specialization occurs at relatively high levels of representation. Furthermore, it stresses the roles of neuroanatomical constraints such as topographical proximity and connectivity in determining the functional development of brain regions. These findings reveal limitations to brain plasticity and to the role of experience in shaping the functional organization of the brain.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Structural priming is supported by different components of non-declarative memory: Evidence from priming across the lifespan</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/190355v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>This study investigates how non-declarative memory supports both the transient, short-term and the persistent, long-term structural priming effects commonly seen in the literature. Specifically, we propose that these characteristics are supported by different subcomponents of non-declarative memory: perceptual and conceptual non-declarative memory respectively. To test this proposal, we investigated how the magnitude of short- and long-term structural priming effects change throughout the lifespan. Previous studies have suggested that perceptual and conceptual memory age differently, with only conceptual memory showing age-related decline. Therefore, by investigating how decreased performance in perceptual and conceptual non-declarative memory tasks relate to decreased structural priming magnitude across the lifespan, we aim to elucidate how non-declarative memory supports two seemingly different components of structural priming. We find no change in short-term priming magnitude and performance on perceptual tasks, whereas both long-term priming and conceptual memory declined with age. We conclude that the two seemingly different components of structural priming are supported by different components of non-declarative memory. These findings have important implications for theoretical accounts of structural priming.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A blood-based signature of cerebral spinal fluid A{beta}1-42 status</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/190207v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>It is increasingly recognized that Alzheimer's disease (AD) exists before dementia is present and that shifts in amyloid beta occur long before clinical symptoms can be detected. Early detection of these molecular changes is a key aspect for the success of interventions aimed at slowing down rates of cognitive decline. Recent evidence indicates that of the two established methods for measuring amyloid, a decrease in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) amyloid {beta} (A{beta}1-42) may be an earlier indicator of Alzheimer's disease risk than measures of amyloid obtained from Positron Emission Topography (PET). However, CSF collection is highly invasive and expensive. In contrast, blood collection is routinely performed, minimally invasive and cheap. In this work, we develop a blood-based signature that can provide a cheap and minimally invasive estimation of an individual's CSF amyloid status. We show that a Random Forest model derived from plasma analytes can accurately predict subjects as having abnormal (low) CSF A{beta}1-42 levels indicative of AD risk (0.84 AUC, 0.73 sensitivity, and 0.76 specificity). Post-hoc analysis indicates that only six analytes are required to achieve similar performance. Furthermore, we show across an independent validation cohort that individuals with predicted abnormal CSF A{beta}1-42 levels transitioned to an AD diagnosis over 120 months significantly faster than those predicted with normal CSF A{beta}1-42 levels. This is the first study to show that a plasma protein signature, together with age and APOE{epsilon}4 genotype, is able to predict CSF A{beta}1-42 levels with high accuracy. Biomarkers in plasma have previously been shown to be predictive of PET amyloid levels. This work further highlights the potential for developing a blood-based signature for improved AD screening, critical for drug and intervention trials.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Progression of regional grey matter atrophy in multiple sclerosis</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/190116v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Grey matter atrophy is present from the earliest clinical stages of multiple sclerosis (MS), but the temporal ordering is poorly understood. We aimed to determine the sequence in which grey matter regions become atrophic in MS, and its association with disability accumulation. In this longitudinal study, we included 1,417 subjects: 253 with clinically-isolated syndrome (CIS), 708 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), 128 secondary-progressive MS (SPMS), 125 primary-progressive MS (PPMS), and 203 healthy controls from 7 European centres. Subjects underwent repeated MRI scanning (total number of scans 3,604); the mean follow-up for patients was 2.41yrs (SD1.97). Disability was scored using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). We calculated the volume of brain grey matter regions and brainstem using an unbiased within-subject template. We used an established data-driven event-based model (EBM) to determine the sequence of occurrence of atrophy and its uncertainty. We assigned each subject to a specific EBM stage, based on the number of their atrophic regions. We used nested linear mixed-effects regression models to explore the associations between the rate of increase in the EBM stages over time, disease duration and annual rate of EDSS gain. The first regions to become atrophic in CIS and relapse-onset MS patients (RRMS and SPMS) were the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus, followed by the middle cingulate cortex, brainstem and thalamus. The sequence of atrophy in PPMS showed a similar involvement of the thalamus, cuneus, precuneus, and pallidum, followed by the brainstem and posterior cingulate cortex. The cerebellum, caudate and putamen showed early atrophy in relapse-onset MS and late atrophy in PPMS. Patients with SPMS showed the highest EBM stages (highest number of atrophic regions, all p&amp;lt;0.001) at study entry. Rates of increase in EBM stages were significantly different from healthy controls in all MS phenotypes, except for CIS. The increase in the number of atrophic regions (EBM stage) was associated with disease duration in all patients. EBM stage was associated with disability accumulation in RRMS independent of disease duration (p&amp;lt;0.0001). This data-driven staging of atrophy progression in a large MS sample demonstrates that grey matter atrophy spreads to involve more regions over time. The sequence in which regions become atrophic is reasonably consistent across MS phenotypes. The spread of atrophy was associated with disease duration, and disability accumulation in RRMS.</content:encoded>

Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations in the blood are associated with acute and chronic infections and inflammation. Nevertheless, the functional role of increased CRP in multiple bacterial and viral infections as well as in chronic inflammatory diseases remains unclear. Here, we studied the relationship between CRP and gene expression levels in the blood in 491 individuals from the Estonian Biobank cohort, to elucidate the role of CRP in these inflammatory mechanisms. As a result, we identified a set of 1,614 genes associated with changes in CRP levels with a high proportion of interferon-stimulated genes. Further, we performed likelihood-based causality model selection and Mendelian randomization analysis to discover causal links between CRP and the expression of CRP-associated genes. Strikingly, our computational analysis and cell culture stimulation assays revealed increased CRP levels to drive the expression of complement regulatory protein &lt;i&gt;CD59&lt;/i&gt;, suggesting CRP to have a critical role in protecting blood cells from the adverse effects of the immune defence system. Our results show the benefit of integrative analysis approaches in hypothesis-free uncovering of causal relationships between traits.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GGnikhoj_Ok&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Dynamical processes in biology are studied using an ever-increasing number of techniques, each of which brings out unique features of the system. One of the current challenges is to develop systematic approaches for fusing heterogeneous datasets into an integrated view of multivariable dynamics. We demonstrate that heterogeneous data fusion can be successfully implemented within a semi-supervised learning framework that exploits the intrinsic geometry of high-dimensional datasets. We illustrate our approach using a dataset from studies of pattern formation in Drosophila. The result is a continuous trajectory that reveals the joint dynamics of gene expression, subcellular protein localization, protein phosphorylation, and tissue morphogenesis. Our approach can be readily adapted to other imaging modalities and forms a starting point for further steps of data analytics and modeling of biological dynamics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hVbjiutPHkE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Translation of mRNAs through Internal Ribosome Entry Sites (IRESs) has emerged as a prominent mechanism of cellular and viral initiation. It supports cap-independent translation of select cellular genes under normal conditions, and in conditions when cap-dependent translation is inhibited. IRES structure and sequence are believed to be involved in this process. However due to the small number of IRESs known, there have been no systematic investigations of the determinants of IRES activity. With the recent discovery of thousands of novel IRESs in human and viruses, the next challenge is to decipher the sequence determinants of IRES activity. We present the first in-depth computational analysis of a large body of IRESs, exploring RNA sequence features predictive of IRES activity. We identified predictive &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-mer features resembling IRES &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-acting factor (ITAF) binding motifs across human and viral IRESs, and found that their effect on expression depends on their sequence, number and position. Our results also suggest that the architecture of retroviral IRESs differs from that of other viruses, presumably due to their exposure to the nuclear environment. Finally, we measured IRES activity of synthetically designed sequences to confirm our prediction of increasing activity as a function of the number of short IRES elements.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FpSjb2fNv-w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Gag, as the major structural protein of HIV-1, is necessary for the assembly of the HIV-1 sphere shell. An in-depth understanding of its trafficking and polymerization is important for gaining further insights into the mechanisms of HIV-1 replication and the design of antiviral drugs. We developed a mathematical model to simulate two biophysical processes, specifically Gag monomer and dimer transport in the cytoplasm and the polymerization of monomers to form a hexamer underneath the plasma membrane. Using experimental data, an optimization approach was utilized to identify the model parameters, and the identifiability and sensitivity of these parameters were then analyzed. Using our model, we analyzed the weight of the pathways involved in the polymerization reactions and concluded that the predominant pathways for the formation of a hexamer might be the polymerization of two monomers to form a dimer, the polymerization of a dimer and a monomer to form a trimer, and the polymerization of two trimers to form a hexamer. We then deduced that the dimer and trimer intermediates might be crucial in hexamer formation. We also explored four theoretical combined methods for Gag suppression, and hypothesized that the N-terminal glycine residue of the MA domain of Gag might be a promising drug target. This work serves as a guide for future theoretical and experimental efforts aiming to understand HIV-1 Gag trafficking and polymerization, and might help accelerate the efficiency of anti-AIDS drug design.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/i-9e76KG4Ck&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The bacterial Lux system is used as a gene expression reporter. It is fast, sensitive and non-destructive, enabling high frequency measurements. Originally developed for bacterial cells, it has also been adapted for eukaryotic cells, and can be used for whole cell biosensors, or in real time with live animals without the need for euthanasia. However, correct interpretation of bioluminescent data is limited: the bioluminescence is different from gene expression because of nonlinear molecular and enzyme dynamics of the Lux system. We have developed a computational approach that, for the first time, allows users of Lux assays to infer gene transcription levels from the light output. This approach is based upon a new mathematical model for Lux activity, that includes the actions of LuxAB, LuxEC and Fre, with improved mechanisms for all reactions, as well as synthesis and turn-over of Lux proteins. The model is calibrated with new experimental data for the LuxAB and Fre reactions from &lt;i&gt;Photorhabdus luminescens&lt;/i&gt;—the source of modern Lux reporters—while literature data has been used for LuxEC. Importantly, the data show clear evidence for previously unreported product inhibition for the LuxAB reaction. Model simulations show that predicted bioluminescent profiles can be very different from changes in gene expression, with transient peaks of light output, very similar to light output seen in some experimental data sets. By incorporating the calibrated model into a Bayesian inference scheme, we can reverse engineer promoter activity from the bioluminescence. We show examples where a decrease in bioluminescence would be better interpreted as a switching off of the promoter, or where an increase in bioluminescence would be better interpreted as a longer period of gene expression. This approach could benefit all users of Lux technology.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OD83Pe1_mRg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Cell mechanics has proven to be important in many biological processes. Although there is a number of experimental techniques which allow us to study mechanical properties of cell, there is still a lack of understanding of the role each sub-cellular components plays during cell deformations. We present a new mesoscopic particle-based eukaryotic cell model which explicitly describes cell membrane, nucleus and cytoskeleton. We employ Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) method that provides us with the unified framework for modeling of a cell and its interactions in the flow. Data from micropipette aspiration experiments were used to define model parameters. The model was validated using data from microfluidic experiments. The validated model was then applied to study the impact of the sub-cellular components on the cell viscoelastic response in micropipette aspiration and microfluidic experiments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/iuIJrlcAA6o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Tumor-induced angiogenesis leads to the development of leaky tumor vessels devoid of structural and morphological integrity. Due to angiogenesis, elevated interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) and low blood perfusion emerge as common properties of the tumor microenvironment that act as barriers for drug delivery. In order to overcome these barriers, normalization of vasculature is considered to be a viable option. However, insight is needed into the phenomenon of normalization and in which conditions it can realize its promise. In order to explore the effect of microenvironmental conditions and drug scheduling on normalization benefit, we build a mathematical model that incorporates tumor growth, angiogenesis and IFP. We administer various theoretical combinations of antiangiogenic agents and cytotoxic nanoparticles through heterogeneous vasculature that displays a similar morphology to tumor vasculature. We observe differences in drug extravasation that depend on the scheduling of combined therapy; for concurrent therapy, total drug extravasation is increased but in adjuvant therapy, drugs can penetrate into deeper regions of tumor.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5DhiN_Ok8Xk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Our work suggests that the current focus of treating myotonia, blocking the transient Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; current underlying action potentials, is an inefficient approach. We show that inhibiting NaPIC is paralleled by elimination of myotonia. We suggest the ideal myotonia therapy would selectively block NaPIC and spare the transient Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; current.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05022</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In language production, humans are confronted with considerable word
selection demands. Often, we must select a word from among similar, acceptable,
and competing alternative words in order to construct a sentence that conveys
an intended meaning. In recent years, the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) has
been identified as critical to this ability. Despite a recent emphasis on
network approaches to understanding language, how the left IFG interacts with
the brain's complex networks to facilitate controlled language performance
remains unknown. Here, we take a novel approach to understand word selection as
a network control process in the brain. Using anatomical brain network derived
from high-resolution diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI), we compute network
controllability underlying the site of transcranial magnetic stimulation in the
IFG between administrations of two word selection tasks. We find that a
statistic that quantifies the IFG's control of difficult to reach states
explains vulnerability to TMS in a number control task and two language control
tasks. Moreover, we find that a statistic that quantifies the IFG's control of
intermodular integration and segregation across the human connectome explains
changes in language task performance following TMS.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04974</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep, classical graph-theoretical parameters, like the size of the minimum
vertex cover, the chromatic number, or the eigengap of the adjacency matrix of
the graph were studied widely by mathematicians in the last century. Most
researchers today study much simpler parameters of braingraphs or connectomes
which were defined in the last twenty years for enormous networks -- like the
graph of the World Wide Web -- with hundreds of millions of nodes. Since the
connectomes, describing the connections of the human brain, typically contain
several hundred vertices today, one can compute and analyze the much deeper,
harder-to-compute classical graph parameters for these, relatively small graphs
of the brain. This deeper approach has proven to be very successful in the
comparison of the connectomes of the sexes in our earlier works: we have shown
that graph parameters, deeply characterizing the graph connectivity are
significantly better in women's connectomes than in men's. In the present
contribution we compare numerous graph parameters in the three largest lobes
--- frontal, parietal, temporal --- and in both hemispheres of the brain. We
apply the diffusion weighted imaging data of 423 subjects of the NIH-funded
Human Connectome Project, and present some findings, never described before,
including that the right parietal lobe contains significantly more edges, has
higher average degree, density, larger minimum vertex cover and Hoffman bound
than the left parietal lobe. Similar advantages in the deep graph connectivity
properties are hold for the left frontal vs. the right frontal and for the
right temporal vs. the left temporal lobes.

	<content:encoded>Thermosensation provides crucial information but it is poorly understood how temperature representation is transformed from sensation to behavior. Here, we report a preparation that allows control of heat delivery to zebrafish larvae while monitoring motor output and imaging whole-brain calcium signals, thereby uncovering algorithmic and computational rules that couple dynamics of heat modulation, neural activity and swimming behavior. This approach identifies a critical step in the transformation of temperature representation between the sensory trigeminal ganglia and the hindbrain: A simple sustained trigeminal stimulus representation is transformed into a representation of absolute temperature as well as temperature changes in the hindbrain that explains the observed motor output. An activity constrained dynamic circuit model captures the most prominent aspects of these sensori-motor transformations and predicts both behavior and neural activity in response to novel heat stimuli. These findings provide the first algorithmic description of heat processing from sensory input to behavioral output.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/190348v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>We present an algorithm for detecting the location of cells from two-photon calcium imaging data. In our framework, multiple coupled active contours evolve, guided by a model-based cost function, to identify cell boundaries. An active contour seeks to partition a local region into two subregions, a cell interior and exterior, in which all pixels have maximally  similar time courses. This simple, local model allows contours to be evolved predominantly independently. When contours are sufficiently close, their evolution is coupled, in a manner that permits overlap. We illustrate the ability of the proposed method to demix overlapping cells on real data. The proposed framework is flexible, incorporating no prior information regarding a cell's morphology or stereotypical temporal activity, which enables the detection of cells with diverse properties. We demonstrate algorithm performance on a challenging mouse in vitro dataset, containing synchronously spiking cells, and a manually labelled mouse in vivo dataset, on which ABLE achieves a 67.5% success rate.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/190108v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Differential Susceptibility Theory explains long-term associations between neurobiological sensitivity and cognitive outcomes, but no comparable theoretical framework exists to understand how neurobiological sensitivity and cognitive performance inter-relate on shorter time-frames. Here, we evaluate a framework proposed by Aston-Jones and colleagues, building on the Yerkes-Dodson model, to understand these associations. The framework describes how slow-moving (tonic) changes in autonomic arousal relate to fast (phasic) changes, as observed for example relative to experimenter-determined events, and how phasic changes relate to attention. Larger phasic changes, which associate with better selective attention, are most likely at mid-level tonic arousal. Smaller phasic changes, and worse selective attention, are observed at hypo- and hyper-arousal. We review the fit of this model to typical and atypical development, during infancy and childhood.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/189985v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The perceptual upright is thought to be constructed by the central nervous system (CNS) as a vector sum; by combining estimates on the upright provided by the visual system and the body's inertial sensors with prior knowledge that the upright is usually above the head. Results from a number of recent studies furthermore show that the weighting of the respective sensory signals is proportional to their reliability, consistent with a Bayesian interpretation of the idea of a vector sum (Forced Fusion, FF). However, findings from a study conducted in partial gravity suggest that the CNS may rely on a single sensory system (Cue Capture, CC), or choose to process sensory signals differently based on inferred signal causality (Causal Inference, CI). We developed a novel Alternative-Reality system to manipulate visual and physical tilt independently, and tasked participants (n=28) to indicate the perceived upright for various (in-)congruent combinations of visual-inertial stimuli. Overall, the data appear best explained by the FF model. However, an evaluation of individual data reveals considerable variability, favoring different models in about equal proportions of participants (FF, n=12; CI, n=7, CC, n=9). Given the observed variability, we conclude that the notion of a vector sum does not provide a comprehensive explanation of the perception of the upright.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/189969v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The behavioral effects of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) can change qualitatively when stimulation is preceded by initial state manipulations such as priming or adaptation. In addition, baseline performance level of the participant has been shown to play a role in modulating the impact of TMS. Here we examined the link between these two. This was done in the context of a priming paradigm, in which, at group level, TMS selectively facilitates targets incongruent with the prime while having no statistically significant effects on other prime-target congruencies. Correlation and regression analyses indicated that, for all prime-target congruencies, a significant linear relationship between baseline performance and the magnitude of the induced TMS effect was present: low levels of baseline performance were associated with TMS-induced facilitations and high baseline performance with impairments. Thus as performance level increased, TMS effects turned from facilitation to impairment. The key finding was that priming shifted the transition from facilitatory to disruptive effects for targets incongruent with the prime, such that TMS induced facilitations were obtained until a higher level of performance than for other prime-target congruengies. Given that brain state manipulations such as priming operate via modulations of neural excitability, this result is consistent with the view that neural excitability, coupled with nonlinear neural effects, underlie behavioral effects of TMS.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/189944v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The Roving Mismatch Negativity (MMN), and Visual LTP paradigms are widely used as independent measures of sensory plasticity. However, the paradigms are built upon fundamentally different (and seemingly opposing) models of perceptual learning; namely, Predictive Coding (MMN) and Hebbian plasticity (LTP). The aims of the current study were to 1) compare the generative mechanisms of the MMN and visual LTP, therefore assessing whether Predictive Coding and Hebbian mechanisms co-occur in the brain, and 2) assess whether the paradigms identify similar group differences in plasticity. Forty participants were split into two groups based on the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and were presented with both paradigms. Consistent with Predictive Coding and Hebbian predictions, Dynamic Causal Modelling revealed that the generation of the MMN modulates forward and backward connections in the underlying network, while visual LTP only modulates forward connections. Genetic differences were identified in the ERPs for both paradigms, but were only apparent in backward connections of the MMN network. These results suggest that both Predictive Coding and Hebbian mechanisms are utilized by the brain under different task demands. Additionally, both tasks provide unique insight into plasticity mechanisms, which has important implications for future studies of aberrant plasticity in clinical populations.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Pdgfra+ oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) arise in distinct specification waves during embryogenesis in the central nervous system (CNS). It is unclear whether there is a correlation between these waves and different transcriptional oligodendrocyte (OL) states at adult stages. Here we present a bulk and single-cell transcriptomics resource providing insights on how transitions between these states occur. We show that E13.5 Pdgfra+ populations are not OPCs, exhibiting instead hallmarks of neural progenitors. A subset of these progenitors, which we refer as pre-OPCs, rewires their transcriptional landscape, converging into indistinguishable OPC states at E17.5 and post-natal stages. P7 brain and spinal cord OPCs present similar transcriptional profiles at the single-cell level, indicating that OPC states are not region-specific. Postnatal OPC progeny of E13.5 Pdgfra+ have electrophysiological and transcriptional profiles similar to OPCs derived from subsequent specification waves. In addition, lineage tracing indicates that a subset of E13.5 Pdgfra+ cells also originate cells of the pericyte lineage. In summary, our results indicate that embryonic Pdgfra+ cells are diverse and give rise at post-natal stages to distinct cell lineages, including OPCs with convergent transcriptional profiles in different CNS regions.</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Dendritic spines provide cognitive resilience against Alzheimer's disease</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25049</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Neuroimaging and other biomarker assays suggest that the pathological processes of Alzheimer's disease (AD) initiate years prior to clinical dementia onset. However some 30%-50% of older individuals that harbor AD pathology do not become symptomatic in their lifetime. It is hypothesized that such individuals exhibit cognitive resilience that protects against AD dementia. We hypothesized that in cases with AD pathology structural changes in dendritic spines would distinguish individuals that had or did not have clinical dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We compared dendritic spines within layers II and III pyramidal neuron dendrites in Brodmann Area 46 dorsolateral prefrontal cortex using the Golgi-Cox technique in 12 age-matched pathology-free controls, 8 controls with AD pathology (CAD), and 21 AD cases. We used highly optimized methods to trace impregnated dendrites from brightfield microscopy images which enabled accurate three-dimensional digital reconstruction of dendritic structure for morphologic analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Spine density was similar among control and CAD cases but reduced significantly in AD. Thin and mushroom spines were reduced significantly in AD compared to CAD brains, whereas stubby spine density was decreased significantly in CAD and AD compared to controls. Increased spine extent distinguished CAD cases from controls and AD. Linear regression analysis of all cases indicated that spine density was not associated with neuritic plaque score but did display negative correlation with Braak staging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: These observations provide cellular evidence to support the hypothesis that dendritic spine plasticity is a mechanism of cognitive resilience that protects older individuals with AD pathology from developing dementia.

Multiple treatment strategies are available for empiric antibiotic therapy in hospitals, but neither clinical studies nor theoretical investigations have yielded a clear picture when which strategy is optimal and why. Extending earlier work of others and us, we present a mathematical model capturing treatment strategies using two drugs, i.e the multi-drug therapies referred to as cycling, mixing, and combination therapy, as well as monotherapy with either drug. We randomly sample a large parameter space to determine the conditions determining success or failure of these strategies. We find that combination therapy tends to outperform the other treatment strategies. By using linear discriminant analysis and particle swarm optimization, we find that the most important parameters determining success or failure of combination therapy relative to the other treatment strategies are the &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; rate of emergence of double resistance in patients infected with sensitive bacteria and the fitness costs associated with double resistance. The rate at which double resistance is imported into the hospital via patients admitted from the outside community has little influence, as all treatment strategies are affected equally. The parameter sets for which combination therapy fails tend to fall into areas with low biological plausibility as they are characterised by very high rates of &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; emergence of resistance to both drugs compared to a single drug, and the cost of double resistance is considerably smaller than the sum of the costs of single resistance.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/BpDkFaeaRVs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04654</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;How does the neocortex learn and develop the foundations of all our
high-level cognitive abilities? We present a comprehensive framework spanning
biological, computational, and cognitive levels, with a clear theoretical
continuity between levels, providing a coherent answer directly supported by
extensive data at each level. Learning is based on making predictions about
what the senses will report at 100 msec (alpha frequency) intervals, and
adapting synaptic weights to improve prediction accuracy. The pulvinar nucleus
of the thalamus serves as a projection screen upon which predictions are
generated, through deep-layer 6 corticothalamic inputs from multiple brain
areas and levels of abstraction. The sparse driving inputs from layer 5
intrinsic bursting neurons provide the target signal, and the temporal
difference between it and the prediction reverberates throughout the cortex,
driving synaptic changes that approximate error backpropagation, using only
local activation signals in equations derived directly from a detailed
biophysical model. In vision, predictive learning requires a
carefully-organized developmental progression and anatomical organization of
three pathways (What, Where, and What * Where), according to two central
principles: top-down input from compact, high-level, abstract representations
is essential for accurate prediction of low-level sensory inputs; and the
collective, low-level prediction error must be progressively and
opportunistically partitioned to enable extraction of separable factors that
drive the learning of further high-level abstractions. Our model self-organized
systematic invariant object representations of 100 different objects from
simple movies, accounts for a wide range of data, and makes many testable
predictions.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Negative afterimage appears in our vision when we shift our gaze from an over
stimulated original image to a new area with a uniform color. The colors of
negative afterimages differ from the old stimulating colors in the original
image when the color in the new area is either neutral or chromatic. The
interaction between stimulating colors in the test and inducing field in the
original image changes our color perception due to simultaneous contrast, and
the interaction between changed colors perceived in the previously-viewed field
and the color in the currently-viewed field also affects our perception of
colors in negative afterimages due to successive contrast. Based on these
observations we propose a computational model to estimate colors of negative
afterimages in more general cases where the original stimulating color in the
test field is chromatic, and the original stimulating color in the inducing
field and the new stimulating color can be either neutral or chromatic. We
validate our model with human experiments.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Mutational burden of giant synaptic genes may be the cause of Alzheimer's disease</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/189712v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>All of the drug trials of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) have failed to slow progression of dementia in phase III studies, and the most effective therapeutic approach still remains controversial due to our incomplete understanding of AD pathophysiology. Amyloid beta (A{beta}) and its cascade have been the primary focus of drug design efforts for more than a decade. However, mounting evidence indicates that mechanisms of AD etiopathogenesis are probably more complex than the previous reductionist models. Several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have recently shed light on dark aspects of AD from a hypothesis-free point of view. While the newly identified AD risk genes rather raise more questions than they answer in deciphering the amyloid cascade, as a potentially overlooked finding, many of them code for receptors and transducers of cell adhesion signaling cascades. Remarkably, the hallmark genetic factors of AD, including the amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilins (PSEN) and APOE also take part in highly similar pathways of cell adhesion regulation and coordinate contact-guidance of neuronal growth cones in brain development, albeit these A{beta}-independent roles remain highly underexplored. Here, we have revisited function of 27 AD risk genes in pathways of normal cell physiology. Our review clearly shows that a disrupted cell adhesion signaling nexus, rather than a protein aggregation process, is the central point of convergence in the unbiased genetic risk factors of AD. To further elucidate a potential relationship between aging and pathways of cell adhesion, we have conducted an exploratory bioinformatics analysis which revealed that cell adhesion is the most representative ontology of human genes larger than 500kb (p=8.0 x10-13), and these extremely large genes are mostly expressed in brain (p=2.1 x10-17) and selectively take part in synaptic composition (p=2.4 x10-14). As possible driving forces of brain evolution, large genes may coordinate complex wiring of synaptic circuits in neurodevelopment, and we suggest that they may also be vulnerable to the impact of somatic mutations in aging due to their exceptional sizes which will be assessed by statistical models. An exemplar of this notion is the giant APOE receptor Lrp1b which is one of the most frequently deleted genes in various cancers and also represents the only brain-specific lipoprotein receptor. Our model, the large gene instability hypothesis, highlights alternate strategies for AD prevention, biomarker discovery and therapeutic design based on targeting genomic instability and synaptic adhesion.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/189621v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Sensory hair cells require control of physical properties of their apical plasma membranes for normal development and function. Members of the ARF small GTPase family regulate membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal assembly in many cells. We identified ELMOD1, a guanine nucleoside triphosphatase activating protein (GAP) for ARF6, as the most highly enriched ARF regulator in hair cells. To characterize ELMOD1 control of trafficking, we used a mouse strain lacking functional ELMOD1 (roundabout; rda). In rda/rda mice, cuticular plates of utricle hair cells initially formed normally, then degenerated after postnatal day 5 (P5); large numbers of vesicles invaded the compromised cuticular plate. Hair bundles initially developed normally, but the cell's apical membrane lifted away from the cuticular plate, and stereocilia elongated and fused. Membrane trafficking in type I hair cells, measured by FM1-43 dye labeling, was altered in rda/rda mice. Consistent with the proposed GAP role for ELMOD1, the ARF6 GTP/GDP ratio was significantly elevated in rda/rda utricles as compared to controls, and the level of ARF6-GTP was correlated with the severity of the rda/rda phenotype. These results suggest that conversion of ARF6 to its GDP-bound form is necessary for final stabilization of the hair bundle.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Implicit sensorimotor adaptation is traditionally described as a process of error reduction, whereby a fraction of the error is corrected for with each movement. Here, in our study of healthy human participants, we characterize two constraints on this learning process: the size of adaptive corrections is only related to error size when errors are smaller than 6{degrees}, and learning functions converge to a similar level of asymptotic learning over a wide range of error sizes. These findings are problematic for current models of sensorimotor adaptation, and point to a new theoretical perspective in which learning is constrained by the size of the error correction, rather than sensitivity to error.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Failure to reactivate salient episodic information during indirect and direct tests of memory retrieval</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/189522v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Several fMRI and EEG studies have demonstrated that successful episodic retrieval is accompanied by the reactivation of cortical regions that were active during encoding. These findings are consistent with influential models of episodic memory that posit that conscious retrieval (recollection) relies on hippocampally-mediated cortical reinstatement. Evidence of reactivation corresponding to episodic information that is beyond conscious awareness at the time of memory retrieval, however, is limited. A recent exception is from an EEG study by Wimber, Maa{beta}, Staudigl, Richardson-Klavehn, and Hanslmayr (2012) in which words were encoded in the context of highly salient visual flicker entrainment and then presented at retrieval in the absence of any flicker. In that study, coherent (phase-locked) neural activity was observed at the corresponding entrained frequencies during retrieval, consistent with the notion that encoding representations were reactivated. Given the important implications of unconscious reactivation to past findings and the modeling literature, the current study set out to provide a direct replication of the previous study. Additionally, an attempt was made to extend such findings to intentional retrieval by acquiring EEG while subjects were explicitly asked to make memory judgments about the flicker frequency from encoding. Throughout a comprehensive set of analyses, the current study consistently failed to demonstrate evidence for unconscious reactivation, and instead provided support that test items were indistinguishable according to their prior encoding context. The findings thus establish an important boundary condition for the involvement of cortical reinstatement in episodic memory.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/189506v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Behavior relies on the ability of sensory systems to infer properties of the environment from incoming stimuli. The accuracy of inference depends on the fidelity with which behaviorally-relevant properties of stimuli are encoded in neural responses. High-fidelity encodings can be metabolically costly, but low-fidelity encodings can cause errors in inference. Here, we derive adaptive sensory encoding schemes that dynamically navigate this tradeoff between coding cost and inference error. We find that optimal encodings increase the fidelity of the neural response following a change in the stimulus distribution, whereas stimuli originating from a known distribution can be encoded with low fidelity at little cost. We predict dynamical signatures of an encoding scheme designed to preserve only those stimulus details that are relevant for inference, and we demonstrate how known phenomena, such as burst coding and the perception of metamers, can be understood as hallmarks of adaptive encoding for accurate inference.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/189464v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Head Direction cells form an internal compass that signals head azimuth orientation even in the absence of visual landmarks. It is well accepted that head direction properties are generated through a ring attractor that is updated using rotation self-motion cues. The properties and origin of this self-motion velocity drive remain, however, unknown. We propose a unified, quantitative framework whereby the attractor velocity input represents a multisensory self-motion estimate computed through an internal model that uses sensory prediction error based on vestibular, visual, and somatosensory cues to improve on-line motor drive. We show how context-dependent strength of recurrent connections within the attractor itself, rather than the self-motion input, explain differences in head direction cell firing between free foraging and restrained movements. We also summarize recent findings on how head tilt relative to gravity influences the azimuth coding of head direction cells, and explain why and how these effects reflect an updating self-motion velocity drive that is not purely egocentric. Finally, we highlight recent findings that the internal compass may be three-dimensional and hypothesize that the additional vertical degrees of freedom are defined based on global allocentric gravity cues.</content:encoded>

The dominance of the major transcript isoform relative to other isoforms from the same gene generated by alternative splicing (AS) is essential to the maintenance of normal cellular physiology. However, the underlying principles that determine such dominance remain unknown. Here, we analyzed the physical AS process and found that it can be modeled by a stochastic minimization process, which causes the scaled expression levels of all transcript isoforms to follow the same Weibull extreme value distribution. Surprisingly, we also found a simple equation to describe the median frequency of transcript isoforms of different dominance. This two-parameter Weibull model provides the statistical distribution of all isoforms of all transcribed genes, and reveals that previously unexplained observations concerning relative isoform expression derive from these principles.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vx5zFApiVZY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Bioinformatics skills have become essential for many research areas; however, the availability of qualified researchers is usually lower than the demand and training to increase the number of able bioinformaticians is an important task for the bioinformatics community. When conducting training or hands-on tutorials, the lack of control over the analysis tools and repositories often results in undesirable situations during training, as unavailable online tools or version conflicts may delay, complicate, or even prevent the successful completion of a training event. The eBioKit is a stand-alone educational platform that hosts numerous tools and databases for bioinformatics research and allows training to take place in a controlled environment. A key advantage of the eBioKit over other existing teaching solutions is that all the required software and databases are locally installed on the system, significantly reducing the dependence on the internet. Furthermore, the architecture of the eBioKit has demonstrated itself to be an excellent balance between portability and performance, not only making the eBioKit an exceptional educational tool but also providing small research groups with a platform to incorporate bioinformatics analysis in their research. As a result, the eBioKit has formed an integral part of training and research performed by a wide variety of universities and organizations such as the Pan African Bioinformatics Network (H3ABioNet) as part of the initiative Human Heredity and Health in Africa (H3Africa), the Southern Africa Network for Biosciences (SAnBio) initiative, the Biosciences eastern and central Africa (BecA) hub, and the International Glossina Genome Initiative.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JFh742g4bvM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04300</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Bacteria are easily characterizable model organisms with an impressively
complicated set of capabilities. Among their capabilities is quorum sensing, a
detailed cell-cell signaling system that may have a common origin with
eukaryotic cell-cell signaling. Not only are the two phenomena similar, but
quorum sensing, as is the case with any bacterial phenomenon when compared to
eukaryotes, is also easier to study in depth than eukaryotic cell-cell
signaling. This ease of study is a contrast to the only partially understood
cellular dynamics of neurons. Here we review the literature on the strikingly
neuron-like qualities of bacterial colonies and biofilms, including ion-based
and hormonal signaling, and action potential-like behavior. This allows them to
feasibly act as an analog for neurons that could produce more detailed and more
accurate biologically-based computational models. Using bacteria as the basis
for biologically feasible computational models may allow models to better
harness the tremendous ability of biological organisms to make decisions and
process information. Additionally, principles gleaned from bacterial function
have the potential to influence computational efforts divorced from biology,
just as neuronal function has in the abstract influenced countless machine
learning efforts.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04090</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Determining functional brain connectivity is crucial to understanding the
brain and neural differences underlying disorders such as autism. Recent
studies have used Gaussian graphical models to learn brain connectivity via
statistical dependencies across brain regions from neuroimaging. However,
previous studies often fail to properly incorporate priors tailored to
neuroscience, such as preferring shorter connections. To remedy this problem,
the paper here introduces a novel, weighted-$\ell_1$, multi-task graphical
model (W-SIMULE). This model elegantly incorporates a flexible prior, along
with a parallelizable formulation. Additionally, W-SIMULE extends the
often-used Gaussian assumption, leading to considerable performance increases.
Here, applications to fMRI data show that W-SIMULE succeeds in determining
functional connectivity in terms of (1) log-likelihood, (2) finding edges that
differentiate groups, and (3) classifying different groups based on their
connectivity, achieving 58.6\% accuracy on the ABIDE dataset. Having
established W-SIMULE's effectiveness, it links four key areas to autism, all of
which are consistent with the literature. Due to its elegant domain adaptivity,
W-SIMULE can be readily applied to various data types to effectively estimate
connectivity.

	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/fhS4VF136qI/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by María E. Soler-Oliva, Jose A. Guerrero-Martínez, Valentina Bachetti, Jose C. Reyes&lt;/p&gt;

Gene order is not random in eukaryotic chromosomes, and co-regulated genes tend to be clustered. The mechanisms that determine co-regulation of large regions of the genome and its connection with chromatin three-dimensional (3D) organization are still unclear however. Here we have adapted a recently described method for identifying chromatin topologically associating domains (TADs) to identify coexpression domains (which we term “CODs”). Using human normal breast and breast cancer RNA-seq data, we have identified approximately 500 CODs. CODs in the normal and breast cancer genomes share similar characteristics but differ in their gene composition. COD genes have a greater tendency to be coexpressed with genes that reside in other CODs than with non-COD genes. Such inter-COD coexpression is maintained over large chromosomal distances in the normal genome but is partially lost in the cancer genome. Analyzing the relationship between CODs and chromatin 3D organization using Hi-C contact data, we find that CODs do not correspond to TADs. In fact, intra-TAD gene coexpression is the same as random for most chromosomes. However, the contact profile is similar between gene pairs that reside either in the same COD or in coexpressed CODs. These data indicate that co-regulated genes in the genome present similar patterns of contacts irrespective of the frequency of physical chromatin contacts between them.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fhS4VF136qI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: After Nerve Injury, Lineage Tracing Shows That Myelin and Remak Schwann Cells Elongate Extensively and Branch to Form Repair Schwann Cells, Which Shorten Radically on Remyelination</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/37/9086?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There is consensus that, distal to peripheral nerve injury, myelin and Remak cells reorganize to form cellular columns, Bungner's bands, which are indispensable for regeneration. However, knowledge of the structure of these regeneration tracks has not advanced for decades and the structure of the cells that form them, denervated or repair Schwann cells, remains obscure. Furthermore, the origin of these cells from myelin and Remak cells and their ability to give rise to myelin cells after regeneration has not been demonstrated directly, although these conversions are believed to be central to nerve repair. Using genetic lineage-tracing and scanning-block face electron microscopy, we show that injury of sciatic nerves from mice of either sex triggers extensive and unexpected Schwann cell elongation and branching to form long, parallel processes. Repair cells are 2- to 3-fold longer than myelin and Remak cells and 7- to 10-fold longer than immature Schwann cells. Remarkably, when repair cells transit back to myelinating cells, they shorten ~7-fold to generate the typically short internodes of regenerated nerves. The present experiments define novel morphological transitions in injured nerves and show that repair Schwann cells have a cell-type-specific structure that differentiates them from other cells in the Schwann cell lineage. They also provide the first direct evidence using genetic lineage tracing for two basic assumptions in Schwann cell biology: that myelin and Remak cells generate the elongated cells that build Bungner bands in injured nerves and that such cells can transform to myelin cells after regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; After injury to peripheral nerves, the myelin and Remak Schwann cells distal to the injury site reorganize and modify their properties to form cells that support the survival of injured neurons, promote axon growth, remove myelin-associated growth inhibitors, and guide regenerating axons to their targets. We show that the generation of these repair-supportive Schwann cells involves an extensive cellular elongation and branching, often to form long, parallel processes. This generates a distinctive repair cell morphology that is favorable for the formation of the regeneration tracks that are essential for nerve repair. Remyelination, conversely, involves a striking cell shortening to form the typical short myelin cells of regenerated nerves. We also provide evidence for direct lineage relationships between: (1) repair cells and myelin and Remak cells of uninjured nerves and (2) remyelinating cells in regenerated nerves.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Individual Movement Variability Magnitudes Are Explained by Cortical Neural Variability</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/37/9076?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Humans exhibit considerable motor variability even across trivial reaching movements. This variability can be separated into specific kinematic components such as extent and direction that are thought to be governed by distinct neural processes. Here, we report that individual subjects (males and females) exhibit different magnitudes of kinematic variability, which are consistent (within individual) across movements to different targets and regardless of which arm (right or left) was used to perform the movements. Simultaneous fMRI recordings revealed that the same subjects also exhibited different magnitudes of fMRI variability across movements in a variety of motor system areas. These fMRI variability magnitudes were also consistent across movements to different targets when performed with either arm. Cortical fMRI variability in the posterior–parietal cortex of individual subjects explained their movement–extent variability. This relationship was apparent only in posterior-parietal cortex and not in other motor system areas, thereby suggesting that individuals with more variable movement preparation exhibit larger kinematic variability. We therefore propose that neural and kinematic variability are reliable and interrelated individual characteristics that may predispose individual subjects to exhibit distinct motor capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neural activity and movement kinematics are remarkably variable. Although intertrial variability is rarely studied, here, we demonstrate that individual human subjects exhibit distinct magnitudes of neural and kinematic variability that are reproducible across movements to different targets and when performing these movements with either arm. Furthermore, when examining the relationship between cortical variability and movement variability, we find that cortical fMRI variability in parietal cortex of individual subjects explained their movement extent variability. This enabled us to explain why some subjects performed more variable movements than others based on their cortical variability magnitudes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Contribution of Astroglial Cx43 Hemichannels to the Modulation of Glutamatergic Currents by D-Serine in the Mouse Prefrontal Cortex</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/37/9064?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes interact dynamically with neurons by modifying synaptic activity and plasticity. This interplay occurs through a process named gliotransmission, meaning that neuroactive molecules are released by astrocytes. Acting as a gliotransmitter, D-serine, a co-agonist of the NMDA receptor at the glycine-binding site, can be released by astrocytes in a calcium [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;-dependent manner. A typical feature of astrocytes is their high expression level of connexin43 (Cx43), a protein forming gap junction channels and hemichannels associated with dynamic neuroglial interactions. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of Cx43 hemichannel activity reduced the amplitude of NMDA EPSCs in mouse layer 5 prefrontal cortex pyramidal neurons without affecting AMPA EPSC currents. This reduction of NMDA EPSCs was rescued by addition of D-serine in the extracellular medium. LTP of NMDA and AMPA EPSCs after high-frequency stimulation was reduced by prior inhibition of Cx43 hemichannel activity. Inactivation of D-serine synthesis within the astroglial network resulted in the reduction of NMDA EPSCs, which was rescued by adding extracellular D-serine. We showed that the activity of Cx43 hemichannels recorded in cultured astrocytes was [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt; dependent. Accordingly, in acute cortical slices, clamping [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; at a low level in astroglial network resulted in an inhibition of NMDA EPSC potentiation that was rescued by adding extracellular D-serine. This work demonstrates that astroglial Cx43 hemichannel activity is associated with D-serine release. This process, occurring by direct permeation of D-serine through hemichannels or indirectly by Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry and activation of other [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;-dependent mechanisms results in the modulation of synaptic activity and plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We recorded neuronal glutamatergic (NMDA and AMPA) responses in prefrontal cortex (PFC) neurons and used pharmacological and genetic interventions to block connexin-mediated hemichannel activity specifically in a glial cell population. For the first time in astrocytes, we demonstrated that hemichannel activity depends on the intracellular calcium concentration and is associated with D-serine release. Blocking hemichannel activity reduced the LTP of these excitatory synaptic currents triggered by high-frequency stimulation. These observations may be particularly relevant in the PFC, where D-serine and its converting enzyme are highly expressed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Effector-Invariant Movement Encoding in the Human Motor System</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/37/9054?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ipsilateral motor areas of cerebral cortex are active during arm movements and even reliably predict movement direction. Is coding similar during ipsilateral and contralateral movements? If so, is it in extrinsic (world-centered) or intrinsic (joint-configuration) coordinates? We addressed these questions by examining the similarity of multivoxel fMRI patterns in visuomotor cortical regions during unilateral reaching movements with both arms. The results of three complementary analyses revealed that fMRI response patterns were similar across right and left arm movements to identical targets (extrinsic coordinates) in visual cortices, and across movements with equivalent joint-angles (intrinsic coordinates) in motor cortices. We interpret this as evidence for the existence of distributed neural populations in multiple motor system areas that encode ipsilateral and contralateral movements in a similar manner: according to their intrinsic/joint coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Cortical motor control exhibits clear lateralization: each hemisphere controls the motor output of the contralateral body. Nevertheless, neural populations in ipsilateral areas across the visuomotor hierarchy are active during unilateral movements. We show that fMRI response patterns in the motor cortices are similar for both arms if the movement direction is mirror-reversed across the midline. This suggests that in both ipsilateral and contralateral motor cortices, neural populations have effector-invariant coding of movements in intrinsic coordinates. This not only affects our understanding of motor control, it may serve in the development of brain machine interfaces that also use ipsilateral neural activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Changes in the Excitability of Neocortical Neurons in a Mouse Model of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Are Not Specific to Corticospinal Neurons and Are Modulated by Advancing Disease</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/37/9037?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cell type-specific changes in neuronal excitability have been proposed to contribute to the selective degeneration of corticospinal neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and to neocortical hyperexcitability, a prominent feature of both inherited and sporadic variants of the disease, but the mechanisms underlying selective loss of specific cell types in ALS are not known. We analyzed the physiological properties of distinct classes of cortical neurons in the motor cortex of &lt;i&gt;hSOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice of both sexes and found that they all exhibit increases in intrinsic excitability that depend on disease stage. Targeted recordings and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; calcium imaging further revealed that neurons adapt their functional properties to normalize cortical excitability as the disease progresses. Although different neuron classes all exhibited increases in intrinsic excitability, transcriptional profiling indicated that the molecular mechanisms underlying these changes are cell type specific. The increases in excitability in both excitatory and inhibitory cortical neurons show that selective dysfunction of neuronal cell types cannot account for the specific vulnerability of corticospinal motor neurons in ALS. Furthermore, the stage-dependent alterations in neuronal function highlight the ability of cortical circuits to adapt as disease progresses. These findings show that both disease stage and cell type must be considered when developing therapeutic strategies for treating ALS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; It is not known why certain classes of neurons preferentially die in different neurodegenerative diseases. It has been proposed that the enhanced excitability of affected neurons is a major contributor to their selective loss. We show using a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a disease in which corticospinal neurons exhibit selective vulnerability, that changes in excitability are not restricted to this neuronal class and that excitability does not increase monotonically with disease progression. Moreover, although all neuronal cell types tested exhibited abnormal functional properties, analysis of their gene expression demonstrated cell type-specific responses to the ALS-causing mutation. These findings suggest that therapies for ALS may need to be tailored for different cell types and stages of disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Bilingual Language Switching in the Laboratory versus in the Wild: The Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Adaptive Language Control</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/37/9022?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For a bilingual human, every utterance requires a choice about which language to use. This choice is commonly regarded as part of general executive control, engaging prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices similarly to many types of effortful task switching. However, although language control within artificial switching paradigms has been heavily studied, the neurobiology of natural switching within socially cued situations has not been characterized. Additionally, although theoretical models address how language control mechanisms adapt to the distinct demands of different interactional contexts, these predictions have not been empirically tested. We used MEG (RRID: &lt;a href=&quot;https://scicrunch.org/resolver/NIFINV:nlx_inv_090918&quot;&gt;NIFINV:nlx_inv_090918&lt;/a&gt;) to investigate language switching in multiple contexts ranging from completely artificial to the comprehension of a fully natural bilingual conversation recorded &quot;in the wild.&quot; Our results showed less anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortex involvement for more natural switching. In production, voluntary switching did not engage the prefrontal cortex or elicit behavioral switch costs. In comprehension, while laboratory switches recruited executive control areas, fully natural switching within a conversation only engaged auditory cortices. Multivariate pattern analyses revealed that, in production, interlocutor identity was represented in a sustained fashion throughout the different stages of language planning until speech onset. In comprehension, however, a biphasic pattern was observed: interlocutor identity was first represented at the presentation of the interlocutor and then again at the presentation of the auditory word. In all, our findings underscore the importance of ecologically valid experimental paradigms and offer the first neurophysiological characterization of language control in a range of situations simulating real life to various degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Bilingualism is an inherently social phenomenon, interactional context fully determining language choice. This research addresses the neural mechanisms underlying multilingual individuals' ability to successfully adapt to varying conversational contexts both while speaking and listening. Our results showed that interactional context critically determines language control networks' engagement: switching under external constraints heavily recruited prefrontal control regions, whereas natural, voluntary switching did not. These findings challenge conclusions derived from artificial switching paradigms, which suggested that language switching is intrinsically effortful. Further, our results predict that the so-called bilingual advantage should be limited to individuals who need to control their languages according to external cues and thus would not occur by virtue of an experience in which switching is fully free.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Superoptimal Perceptual Integration Suggests a Place-Based Representation of Pitch at High Frequencies</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/37/9013?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Pitch, the perceptual correlate of sound repetition rate or frequency, plays an important role in speech perception, music perception, and listening in complex acoustic environments. Despite the perceptual importance of pitch, the neural mechanisms that underlie it remain poorly understood. Although cortical regions responsive to pitch have been identified, little is known about how pitch information is extracted from the inner ear itself. The two primary theories of peripheral pitch coding involve stimulus-driven spike timing, or phase locking, in the auditory nerve (time code), and the spatial distribution of responses along the length of the cochlear partition (place code). To rule out the use of timing information, we tested pitch discrimination of very high-frequency tones (&amp;gt;8 kHz), well beyond the putative limit of phase locking. We found that high-frequency pure-tone discrimination was poor, but when the tones were combined into a harmonic complex, a dramatic improvement in discrimination ability was observed that exceeded performance predicted by the optimal integration of peripheral information from each of the component frequencies. The results are consistent with the existence of pitch-sensitive neurons that rely only on place-based information from multiple harmonically related components. The results also provide evidence against the common assumption that poor high-frequency pure-tone pitch perception is the result of peripheral neural-coding constraints. The finding that place-based spectral coding is sufficient to elicit complex pitch at high frequencies has important implications for the design of future neural prostheses to restore hearing to deaf individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The question of how pitch is represented in the ear has been debated for over a century. Two competing theories involve timing information from neural spikes in the auditory nerve (time code) and the spatial distribution of neural activity along the length of the cochlear partition (place code). By using very high-frequency tones unlikely to be coded via time information, we discovered that information from the individual harmonics is combined so efficiently that performance exceeds theoretical predictions based on the optimal integration of information from each harmonic. The findings have important implications for the design of auditory prostheses because they suggest that enhanced spatial resolution alone may be sufficient to restore pitch via such implants.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Mutant Huntingtin Is Secreted via a Late Endosomal/Lysosomal Unconventional Secretory Pathway</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/37/9000?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of a CAG triplet in the gene encoding for huntingtin (Htt). The resulting mutant protein (mHtt) with extended polyglutamine (polyQ) sequence at the N terminus leads to neuronal degeneration both in a cell-autonomous and a non-cell-autonomous manner. Recent studies identified mHtt in the extracellular environment and suggested that its spreading contributes to toxicity, but the mechanism of mHtt release from the cell of origin remains unknown. In this study, we performed a comprehensive, unbiased analysis of secretory pathways and identified an unconventional lysosomal pathway as an important mechanism for mHtt secretion in mouse neuroblastoma and striatal cell lines, as well as in primary neurons. mHtt secretion was dependent on synaptotagmin 7, a regulator of lysosomal secretion, and inhibited by chemical ablation of late endosomes/lysosomes, suggesting a lysosomal secretory pattern. mHtt was targeted preferentially to the late endosomes/lysosomes compared with wild-type Htt. Importantly, we found that late endosomal/lysosomal targeting and secretion of mHtt could be inhibited efficiently by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and neutral sphingomyelinase chemical inhibitors, Ly294002 and GW4869, respectively. Together, our data suggest a lysosomal mechanism of mHtt secretion and offer potential strategies for pharmacological modulation of its neuronal secretion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This is the first study examining the mechanism of mutant huntingtin (mHTT) secretion in an unbiased manner. We found that the protein is secreted via a late endosomal/lysosomal unconventional secretory pathway. Moreover, mHtt secretion can be reduced significantly by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and neutral sphingomyelinase inhibitors. Understanding and manipulating the secretion of mHtt is important because of its potentially harmful propagation in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Plasticity Beyond V1: Reinforcement of Motion Perception upon Binocular Central Retinal Lesions in Adulthood</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/37/8989?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Induction of a central retinal lesion in both eyes of adult mammals is a model for macular degeneration and leads to retinotopic map reorganization in the primary visual cortex (V1). Here we characterized the spatiotemporal dynamics of molecular activity levels in the central and peripheral representation of five higher-order visual areas, V2/18, V3/19, V4/21a,V5/PMLS, area 7, and V1/17, in adult cats with central 10° retinal lesions (both sexes), by means of real-time PCR for the neuronal activity reporter gene &lt;i&gt;zif268.&lt;/i&gt; The lesions elicited a similar, permanent reduction in activity in the center of the lesion projection zone of area V1/17, V2/18, V3/19, and V4/21a, but not in the motion-driven V5/PMLS, which instead displayed an increase in molecular activity at 3 months postlesion, independent of visual field coordinates. Also area 7 only displayed decreased activity in its LPZ in the first weeks postlesion and increased activities in its periphery from 1 month onward. Therefore we examined the impact of central vision loss on motion perception using random dot kinematograms to test the capacity for form from motion detection based on direction and velocity cues. We revealed that the central retinal lesions either do not impair motion detection or even result in better performance, specifically when motion discrimination was based on velocity discrimination. In conclusion, we propose that central retinal damage leads to enhanced peripheral vision by sensitizing the visual system for motion processing relying on feedback from V5/PMLS and area 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Central retinal lesions, a model for macular degeneration, result in functional reorganization of the primary visual cortex. Examining the level of cortical reactivation with the molecular activity marker &lt;i&gt;zif268&lt;/i&gt; revealed reorganization in visual areas outside V1. Retinotopic lesion projection zones typically display an initial depression in &lt;i&gt;zif268&lt;/i&gt; expression, followed by partial recovery with postlesion time. Only the motion-sensitive area V5/PMLS shows no decrease, and even a significant activity increase at 3 months post-retinal lesion. Behavioral tests of motion perception found no impairment and even better sensitivity to higher random dot stimulus velocities. We demonstrate that the loss of central vision induces functional mobilization of motion-sensitive visual cortex, resulting in enhanced perception of moving stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Wnt9a Can Influence Cell Fates and Neural Connectivity across the Radial Axis of the Developing Cochlea</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/37/8975?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Vertebrate hearing organs manifest cellular asymmetries across the radial axis that underlie afferent versus efferent circuits between the inner ear and the brain. Therefore, understanding the molecular control of patterning across this axis has important functional implications. Radial axis patterning begins before the cells become postmitotic and is likely linked to the onset of asymmetric expression of secreted factors adjacent to the sensory primordium. This study explores one such asymmetrically expressed gene, &lt;i&gt;Wnt9a&lt;/i&gt;, which becomes restricted to the neural edge of the avian auditory organ, the basilar papilla, by embryonic day 5 (E5). Radial patterning is disrupted when &lt;i&gt;Wnt9a&lt;/i&gt; is overexpressed throughout the prosensory domain beginning on E3. Sexes were pooled for analysis and sex differences were not studied. Analysis of gene expression and afferent innervation on E6 suggests that ectopic Wnt9a expands the neural-side fate, possibly by re-specifying the abneural fate. RNA sequencing reveals quantitative changes, not only in Wnt-pathway genes, but also in genes involved in axon guidance and cytoskeletal remodeling. By E18, these early patterning effects are manifest as profound changes in cell fates [short hair cells (HCs) are missing], ribbon synapse numbers, outward ionic currents, and efferent innervation. These observations suggest that Wnt9a may be one of the molecules responsible for breaking symmetry across the radial axis of the avian auditory organ. Indirectly, Wnt9a can regulate the mature phenotype whereby afferent axons predominantly innervate neural-side tall HCs, resulting in more ribbon synapses per HC compared with abneural-side short HCs with few ribbons and large efferent synapses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Wnts are a class of secreted factors that are best known for stimulating cell division in development and cancer. However, in certain contexts during development, Wnt-expressing cells can direct neighboring cells to take on specific fates. This study suggests that the Wnt9a ligand may play such a role in the developing hearing organ of the bird cochlea. This was shown through patterning defects that occur in response to the overexpression of Wnt9a. This manipulation increased one type of sensory hair cell (tall HCs) at the expense of another (short HCs) that is usually located furthest from the Wnt9a source. The extraneous tall HCs that replaced short HCs showed some physiological properties and neuronal connections consistent with a fate switch.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Attenuated Activity across Multiple Cell Types and Reduced Monosynaptic Connectivity in the Aged Perirhinal Cortex</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/37/8965?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The perirhinal cortex (PER), which is critical for associative memory and stimulus discrimination, has been described as a wall of inhibition between the neocortex and hippocampus. With advanced age, rats show deficits on PER-dependent behavioral tasks and fewer PER principal neurons are activated by stimuli, but the role of PER interneurons in these altered circuit properties in old age has not been characterized. In the present study, PER neurons were recorded while rats traversed a circular track bidirectionally in which the track was either empty or contained eight novel objects evenly spaced around the track. Putative interneurons were discriminated from principal cells based on the autocorrelogram, waveform parameters, and firing rate. While object modulation of interneuron firing was observed in both young and aged rats, PER interneurons recorded from old animals had lower firing rates compared with those from young animals. This difference could not be accounted for by differences in running speed, as the firing rates of PER interneurons did not show significant velocity modulation. Finally, in the aged rats, relative to young rats, there was a significant reduction in detected excitatory and inhibitory monosynaptic connections. Together these data suggest that with advanced age there may be reduced afferent drive from excitatory cells onto interneurons that may compromise the wall of inhibition between the hippocampus and cortex. This circuit dysfunction could erode the function of temporal lobe networks and ultimately contribute to cognitive aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We report that lower firing rates observed in aged perirhinal cortical principal cells are associated with weaker interneuron activity and reduced monosynaptic coupling between excitatory and inhibitory cells. This is likely to affect feedforward inhibition from the perirhinal to the entorhinal cortex that gates the flow of information to the hippocampus. This is significant because cognitive dysfunction in normative and pathological aging has been linked to hyperexcitability in the aged CA3 subregion of the hippocampus in rats, monkeys, and humans. The reduced inhibition in the perirhinal cortex reported here could contribute to this circuit imbalance, and may be a key point to consider for therapeutic interventions aimed at restoring network function to optimize cognition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/37/8952?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;GABAergic neurons in the inferior colliculus (IC) play a critical role in auditory information processing, yet their responses to sound are unknown. Here, we used optogenetic methods to characterize the response properties of GABAergic and presumed glutamatergic neurons to sound in the IC. We found that responses to pure tones of both inhibitory and excitatory classes of neurons were similar in their thresholds, response latencies, rate-level functions, and frequency tuning, but GABAergic neurons may have higher spontaneous firing rates. In contrast to their responses to pure tones, the inhibitory and excitatory neurons differed in their ability to follow amplitude modulations. The responses of both cell classes were affected by their location regardless of the cell type, especially in terms of their frequency tuning. These results show that the synaptic domain, a unique organization of local neural circuits in the IC, may interact with all types of neurons to produce their ultimate response to sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Although the inferior colliculus (IC) in the auditory midbrain is composed of different types of neurons, little is known about how these specific types of neurons respond to sound. Here, for the first time, we characterized the response properties of GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons in the IC. Both classes of neurons had diverse response properties to tones but were overall similar, except for the spontaneous activity and their ability to follow amplitude-modulated sound. Both classes of neurons may compose a basic local circuit that is replicated throughout the IC. Within each local circuit, the inputs to the local circuit may have a greater influence in determining the response properties to sound than the specific neuron types.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Calpain-GRIP Signaling in Nucleus Accumbens Core Mediates the Reconsolidation of Drug Reward Memory</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/37/8938?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Exposure to drug-paired cues causes drug memories to be in a destabilized state and interfering with memory reconsolidation can inhibit relapse. Calpain, a calcium-dependent neutral cysteine protease, is involved in synaptic plasticity and the formation of long-term fear memory. However, the role of calpain in the reconsolidation of drug reward memory is still unknown. In the present study, using a conditioned place preference (CPP) model, we found that exposure to drug-paired contextual stimuli induced the activation of calpain and decreased the expression of glutamate receptor interacting protein 1 (GRIP1) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core, but not shell, of male rats. Infusions of calpain inhibitors in the NAc core immediately after retrieval disrupted the reconsolidation of cocaine/morphine cue memory and blocked retrieval-induced calpain activation and GRIP1 degradation. The suppressive effect of calpain inhibitors on the expression of drug-induced CPP lasted for at least 14 d. The inhibition of calpain without retrieval 6 h after retrieval or after exposure to an unpaired context had no effects on the expression of reward memory. Calpain inhibition after retrieval also decreased cocaine seeking in a self-administration model and this effect did not recover spontaneously after 28 d. Moreover, the knock-down of GRIP1 expression in the NAc core by lentivirus-mediated short-hairpin RNA blocked disruption of the reconsolidation of drug cue memories that was induced by calpain inhibitor treatment. These results suggest that calpain activity in the NAc core is crucial for the reconsolidation of drug reward memory via the regulation of GRIP1 expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Calpain plays an important role in synaptic plasticity and long-term memory consolidation, however, its role in the reconsolidation of drug cue memory remains unknown. Using conditioned place preference and self-administration procedures, we found that exposure to drug-paired cues induced the activation of calpain and decreased glutamate receptor interacting protein 1 (GRIP1) expression in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core. The inhibition of calpain activity in the NAc core immediately after retrieval disrupted the reconsolidation of cocaine/morphine cue memory that was blocked by prior GRIP1 knock-down. Our findings indicate that calpain-GRIP signaling is essential for the restabilization process that is associated with drug cue memory and the inhibition of calpain activity may be a novel strategy for the prevention of drug relapse.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Human Occipital and Parietal GABA Selectively Influence Visual Perception of Orientation and Size</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/37/8929?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in human brain. The level of GABA varies substantially across individuals, and this variability is associated with interindividual differences in visual perception. However, it remains unclear whether the association between GABA level and visual perception reflects a general influence of visual inhibition or whether the GABA levels of different cortical regions selectively influence perception of different visual features. To address this, we studied how the GABA levels of parietal and occipital cortices related to interindividual differences in size, orientation, and brightness perception. We used visual contextual illusion as a perceptual assay since the illusion dissociates perceptual content from stimulus content and the magnitude of the illusion reflects the effect of visual inhibition. Across individuals, we observed selective correlations between the level of GABA and the magnitude of contextual illusion. Specifically, parietal GABA level correlated with size illusion magnitude but not with orientation or brightness illusion magnitude; in contrast, occipital GABA level correlated with orientation illusion magnitude but not with size or brightness illusion magnitude. Our findings reveal a region- and feature-dependent influence of GABA level on human visual perception. Parietal and occipital cortices contain, respectively, topographic maps of size and orientation preference in which neural responses to stimulus sizes and stimulus orientations are modulated by intraregional lateral connections. We propose that these lateral connections may underlie the selective influence of GABA on visual perception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; GABA, the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in human visual system, varies substantially across individuals. This interindividual variability in GABA level is linked to interindividual differences in many aspects of visual perception. However, the widespread influence of GABA raises the question of whether interindividual variability in GABA reflects an overall variability in visual inhibition and has a general influence on visual perception or whether the GABA levels of different cortical regions have selective influence on perception of different visual features. Here we report a region- and feature-dependent influence of GABA level on human visual perception. Our findings suggest that GABA level of a cortical region selectively influences perception of visual features that are topographically mapped in this region through intraregional lateral connections.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/37/8919?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The basic organization principles of the primary visual cortex (V1) are commonly assumed to also hold in the association cortex such that neurons within a cortical column share functional connectivity patterns and represent the same region of the visual field. We mapped the visual receptive fields (RFs) of neurons recorded at the same electrode in the ventral intraparietal area (VIP) and the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) of rhesus monkeys. We report that the spatial characteristics of visual RFs between adjacent neurons differed considerably, with increasing heterogeneity from VIP to PFC. In addition to RF incongruences, we found differential functional connectivity between putative inhibitory interneurons and pyramidal cells in PFC and VIP. These findings suggest that local RF topography vanishes with hierarchical distance from visual cortical input and argue for increasingly modified functional microcircuits in noncanonical association cortices that contrast V1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Our visual field is thought to be represented faithfully by the early visual brain areas; all the information from a certain region of the visual field is conveyed to neurons situated close together within a functionally defined cortical column. We examined this principle in the association areas, PFC, and ventral intraparietal area of rhesus monkeys and found that adjacent neurons represent markedly different areas of the visual field. This is the first demonstration of such noncanonical organization of these brain areas.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Opposite Synaptic Alterations at the Neuromuscular Junction in an ALS Mouse Model: When Motor Units Matter</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/37/8901?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Denervation of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) precedes the loss of motor neurons (MNs) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ALS is characterized by a motor unit (MU)-dependent vulnerability where MNs with fast-fatigable (FF) characteristics are lost first, followed by fast fatigue-resistant (FR) and slow (S) MNs. However, changes in NMJ properties as a function of MU types remain debated. We hypothesized that NMJ synaptic functions would be altered precociously in an MU-specific manner, before structural alterations of the NMJ. Synaptic transmission and morphological changes of NMJs have been explored in two nerve–muscle preparations of male &lt;i&gt;SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G37R&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice and their wild-type (WT) littermates: the soleus (S and FR MU); and the extensor digitorum longus (FF MU). S, FR, and FF NMJs of WT mice showed distinct synaptic properties from which we build an MU synaptic profile (MUSP) that reports MU-dependent NMJ synaptic properties. At postnatal day 180 (P180), FF and S NMJs of SOD1 already showed, respectively, lower and higher quantal content compared with WT mice, before signs of MN death and before NMJ morphological alterations. Changes persisted in both muscles until preonset (P380), while denervation was frequent in the mutant mouse. MN death was evident at this stage. Additional changes occurred at clinical disease onset (P450) for S and FR MU. As a whole, our results reveal a reversed MUSP in SOD1 mutants and highlight MU-specific synaptic changes occurring in a precise temporal sequence. Importantly, changes in synaptic properties appear to be good predictors of vulnerability to neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The inadequate excitability of motor neurons and their output, the neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), has been considered a key factor in the detrimental outcome of the motor function in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, a conundrum persists at the NMJ whereby persistent but incoherent opposite neurotransmission changes have been reported to take place. This article untangles this conundrum by systematically analyzing the changes in synaptic properties over the course of the disease progression as a function of the motor unit type.

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Time of Day Differences in Neural Reward Functioning in Healthy Young Men</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/37/8895?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Reward function appears to be modulated by the circadian system, but little is known about the neural basis of this interaction. Previous research suggests that the neural reward response may be different in the afternoon; however, the direction of this effect is contentious. Reward response may follow the diurnal rhythm in self-reported positive affect, peaking in the early afternoon. An alternative is that daily reward response represents a type of prediction error, with neural reward activation relatively high at times of day when rewards are unexpected (i.e., early and late in the day). The present study measured neural reward activation in the context of a validated reward task at 10.00 h, 14.00 h, and 19.00 h in healthy human males. A region of interest BOLD fMRI protocol was used to investigate the diurnal waveform of activation in reward-related brain regions. Multilevel modeling found, as expected, a highly significant quadratic time-of-day effect focusing on the left putamen (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Consistent with the &quot;prediction error&quot; hypothesis, activation was significantly higher at 10.00 h and 19.00 h compared with 14.00 h. It is provisionally concluded that the putamen may be particularly important in endogenous priming of reward motivation at different times of day, with the pattern of activation consistent with circadian-modulated reward expectancies in neural pathways (i.e., greater activation to reward stimuli at unexpected times of day). This study encourages further research into circadian modulation of reward and underscores the methodological importance of accounting for time of day in fMRI protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This is one of the first studies to use a repeated-measures imaging procedure to explore the diurnal rhythm of reward activation. Although self-reported reward (most often operationalized as positive affect) peaks in the afternoon, the present findings indicate that neural activation is lowest at this time. We conclude that the diurnal neural activation pattern may reflect a prediction error of the brain, where rewards at unexpected times (10.00 h and 19.00 h) elicit higher activation in reward brain regions than at expected (14.00 h) times. These data also have methodological significance, suggesting that there may be a time of day influence, which should be accounted for in neural reward studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: STIM1 Regulates Somatic Ca2+ Signals and Intrinsic Firing Properties of Cerebellar Purkinje Neurons</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/37/8876?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Control of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; flux between the cytosol and intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; stores is essential for maintaining normal cellular function. It has been well established in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells that stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) initiates and regulates refilling Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; into the ER. Here, we describe a novel, additional role for STIM1, the regulation of free cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and the consequent control of spike firing in neurons. Among central neurons, cerebellar Purkinje neurons express the highest level of STIM1, and they fire continuously in the absence of stimulation, making somatic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis of particular importance. By using Purkinje neuron-specific STIM1 knock-out (STIM1&lt;sup&gt;PKO&lt;/sup&gt;) male mice, we found that the deletion of STIM1 delayed clearance of cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in the soma during ongoing neuronal firing. Deletion of STIM1 also reduced the Purkinje neuronal excitability and impaired intrinsic plasticity without affecting long-term synaptic plasticity. In vestibulo-ocular reflex learning, STIM1&lt;sup&gt;PKO&lt;/sup&gt; male mice showed severe deficits in memory consolidation, whereas they were normal in memory acquisition. Our results suggest that STIM1 is critically involved in the regulation of the neuronal excitability and the intrinsic plasticity of the Purkinje neurons as well as cerebellar memory consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), which regulates the refilling of ER Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, has been investigated in several systems including the CNS. In addition to a previous study showing that STIM1 regulates dendritic ER Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; refilling and mGluR1-mediated synaptic transmission, we provide compelling evidence describing a novel role of STIM1 in spike firing Purkinje neurons. We found that STIM1 regulates cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; clearance of the soma during spike firing, and the interruption of this cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; clearing disrupts neuronal excitability and cerebellar memory consolidation. Our results provide new insights into neuronal functions of STIM1 from single neuronal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dynamics to behavior level.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Learning and Stress Shape the Reward Response Patterns of Serotonin Neurons</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/37/8863?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The ability to predict reward promotes animal survival. Both dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area and serotonin neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) participate in reward processing. Although the learning effects on dopamine neurons have been extensively characterized, it remains largely unknown how the response of serotonin neurons evolves during learning. Moreover, although stress is known to strongly influence reward-related behavior, we know very little about how stress modulates neuronal reward responses. By monitoring Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals during the entire process of Pavlovian conditioning, we here show that learning differentially shapes the response patterns of serotonin neurons and dopamine neurons in mice of either sex. Serotonin neurons gradually develop a slow ramp-up response to the reward-predicting cue, and ultimately remain responsive to the reward, whereas dopamine neurons increase their response to the cue but reduce their response to the reward. For both neuron types, the responses to the cue and the reward depend on reward value, are reversible when the reward is omitted, and are rapidly reinstated by restoring the reward. We also found that stressors including head restraint and fearful context substantially reduce the response strength of both neuron types, to both the cue and the reward. These results reveal the dynamic nature of the reward responses, support the hypothesis that DRN serotonin neurons signal the current likelihood of receiving a net benefit, and suggest that the inhibitory effect of stress on the reward responses of serotonin neurons and dopamine neurons may contribute to stress-induced anhedonia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Both serotonin neurons in the dorsal raphe and dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area are intimately involved in reward processing. Using long-term fiber photometry of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals from freely behaving mice, we here show that learning produces a ramp-up activation pattern in serotonin neurons that differs from that in dopamine neurons, indicating complementary roles for these two neuron types in reward processing. Moreover, stress treatment substantially reduces the reward responses of both serotonin neurons and dopamine neurons, suggesting a possible physiological basis for stress-induced anhedonia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Heterogeneities in contact networks have a major effect in determining whether a pathogen can become epidemic or persist at endemic levels. Epidemic models that determine which interventions can successfully prevent an outbreak need to account for social structure and mixing patterns. Contact patterns vary across age and locations (e.g. home, work, and school), and including them as predictors in transmission dynamic models of pathogens that spread socially will improve the models’ realism. Data from population-based contact diaries in eight European countries from the POLYMOD study were projected to 144 other countries using a Bayesian hierarchical model that estimated the proclivity of age-and-location-specific contact patterns for the countries, using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. Household level data from the Demographic and Health Surveys for nine lower-income countries and socio-demographic factors from several on-line databases for 152 countries were used to quantify similarity of countries to estimate contact patterns in the home, work, school and other locations for countries for which no contact data are available, accounting for demographic structure, household structure where known, and a variety of metrics including workforce participation and school enrolment. Contacts are highly assortative with age across all countries considered, but pronounced regional differences in the age-specific contacts at home were noticeable, with more inter-generational contacts in Asian countries than in other settings. Moreover, there were variations in contact patterns by location, with work-place contacts being least assortative. These variations led to differences in the effect of social distancing measures in an age structured epidemic model. Contacts have an important role in transmission dynamic models that use contact rates to characterize the spread of contact-transmissible diseases. This study provides estimates of mixing patterns for societies for which contact data such as POLYMOD are not yet available.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/BcGlKAb3694&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03113</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spike synchrony, which occurs in various cortical areas in response to
specific perception, action and memory tasks, has sparked a long-standing
debate on the nature of temporal organization in cortex. One prominent view is
that this type of synchrony facilitates the binding or grouping of separate
stimulus components. We argue instead for a more general function: A measure of
the prior probability of incoming stimuli, implemented by long-range,
horizontal, intra-cortical connections. We show that networks of this kind --
pulse-coupled excitatory spiking networks in a noisy environment -- can provide
a sufficient substrate for stimulus-dependent spike synchrony. This allows a
quick (few spikes) estimate of the match between inputs and the input history
as encoded in the network structure. Given the ubiquity of small, strongly
excitatory subnetworks in cortex, we thus propose that many experimental
observations of spike synchrony can be viewed as signs of input patterns that
resemble long-term experience, i.e. patterns of high prior probability.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03000</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human learners are adept at grasping the complex relationships underlying
incoming sequential input. In the present work, we formalize complex
relationships as graph structures derived from temporal associations in motor
sequences. Next, we explore the extent to which learners are sensitive to key
variations in the topological properties inherent to those graph structures.
Participants performed a probabilistic motor sequence task in which the order
of button presses was determined by the traversal of graphs with modular,
lattice-like, or random organization. Graph nodes each represented a unique
button press and edges represented a transition between button presses. Results
indicate that learning, indexed here by participants' response times, was
strongly mediated by the graph's meso-scale organization, with modular graphs
being associated with shorter response times than random and lattice graphs.
Moreover, variations in a node's number of connections (degree) and a node's
role in mediating long-distance communication (betweeness centrality) impacted
graph learning, even after accounting for level of practice on that node. These
results demonstrate that the graph architecture underlying temporal sequences
of stimuli fundamentally constrain learning, and moreover that tools from
network science provide a valuable framework for assessing how learners encode
complex, temporally structured information.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Individual Differences in Learning Social and Non-Social Network Structures. (arXiv:1709.02852v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02852</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Learning about complex associations between pieces of information enables
individuals to quickly adjust their expectations and develop mental models.
Yet, the degree to which humans can learn higher-order information about
complex associations is not well understood; nor is it known whether the
learning process differs for social and non-social information. Here, we employ
a paradigm in which the order of stimulus presentation forms temporal
associations between the stimuli, collectively constituting a complex network
structure. We examined individual differences in the ability to learn network
topology for which stimuli were social versus non-social. Although participants
were able to learn both social and non-social networks, their performance in
social network learning was uncorrelated with their performance in non-social
network learning. Importantly, social traits, including social orientation and
perspective-taking, uniquely predicted the learning of social networks but not
the learning of non-social networks. Taken together, our results suggest that
the process of learning higher-order structure in social networks is
independent from the process of learning higher-order structure in non-social
networks. Our study design provides a promising approach to identify
neurophysiological drivers of social network versus non-social network
learning, extending our knowledge about the impact of individual differences on
these learning processes. Implications for how people learn and adapt to new
social contexts that require integration into a new social network are
discussed.

	<content:encoded>Stress is a major trigger of seizures in people with epilepsy. Exposure to stress results in the release of several stress mediators throughout the brain, including the hippocampus, a region sensitive to stress and prone to seizures. Stress mediators interact with their respective receptors to produce distinct effects on the excitability of hippocampal neurons and networks. Crucially, these stress mediators and their actions exhibit unique spatiotemporal profiles, generating a complex combinatorial output with time- and space-dependent effects on hippocampal network excitability and seizure generation.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Allosteric conformational change cascade in cytoplasmic dynein revealed by structure-based molecular simulations</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/vvMjV_5qqlU/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Shintaroh Kubo, Wenfei Li, Shoji Takada&lt;/p&gt;

Cytoplasmic dynein is a giant ATP-driven molecular motor that proceeds to the minus end of the microtubule (MT). Dynein hydrolyzes ATP in a ring-like structure, containing 6 AAA+ (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) modules, which is ~15 nm away from the MT binding domain (MTBD). This architecture implies that long-distance allosteric couplings exist between the AAA+ ring and the MTBD in order for dynein to move on the MT, although little is known about the mechanisms involved. Here, we have performed comprehensive molecular simulations of the dynein motor domain based on pre- and post- power-stroke structural information and in doing so we address the allosteric conformational changes that occur during the power-stroke and recovery-stroke processes. In the power-stroke process, the N-terminal linker movement was the prerequisite to the nucleotide-dependent AAA1 transition, from which a transition cascade propagated, on average, in a circular manner on the AAA+ ring until it reached the AAA6/C-terminal module. The recovery-stroke process was initiated by the transition of the AAA6/C-terminal, from which the transition cascade split into the two directions of the AAA+ ring, occurring both clockwise and anti-clockwise. In both processes, the MTBD conformational change was regulated by the AAA4 module and the AAA5/Strut module.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Funneled potential and flux landscapes dictate the stabilities of both the states and the flow: Fission yeast cell cycle</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/7uCW9oTiM_A/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaosheng Luo, Liufang Xu, Bo Han, Jin Wang&lt;/p&gt;

Using fission yeast cell cycle as an example, we uncovered that the non-equilibrium network dynamics and global properties are determined by two essential features: the potential landscape and the flux landscape. These two landscapes can be quantified through the decomposition of the dynamics into the detailed balance preserving part and detailed balance breaking non-equilibrium part. While the funneled potential landscape is often crucial for the stability of the single attractor networks, we have uncovered that the funneled flux landscape is crucial for the emergence and maintenance of the stable limit cycle oscillation flow. This provides a new interpretation of the origin for the limit cycle oscillations: There are many cycles and loops existed flowing through the state space and forming the flux landscapes, each cycle with a probability flux going through the loop. The limit cycle emerges when a loop stands out and carries significantly more probability flux than other loops. We explore how robustness ratio (RR) as the gap or steepness versus averaged variations or roughness of the landscape, quantifying the degrees of the funneling of the underlying potential and flux landscapes. We state that these two landscapes complement each other with one crucial for stabilities of states on the cycle and the other crucial for the stability of the flow along the cycle. The flux is directly related to the speed of the cell cycle. This allows us to identify the key factors and structure elements of the networks in determining the stability, speed and robustness of the fission yeast cell cycle oscillations. We see that the non-equilibriumness characterized by the degree of detailed balance breaking from the energy pump quantified by the flux is the cause of the energy dissipation for initiating and sustaining the replications essential for the origin and evolution of life. Regulating the cell cycle speed is crucial for designing the prevention and curing strategy of cancer.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7uCW9oTiM_A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

We investigate methods to vaccinate contact networks—i.e. removing nodes in such a way that disease spreading is hindered as much as possible—with respect to their cost-efficiency. Any real implementation of such protocols would come with costs related both to the vaccination itself, and gathering of information about the network. Disregarding this, we argue, would lead to erroneous evaluation of vaccination protocols. We use the susceptible-infected-recovered model—the generic model for diseases making patients immune upon recovery—as our disease-spreading scenario, and analyze outbreaks on both empirical and model networks. For different relative costs, different protocols dominate. For high vaccination costs and low costs of gathering information, the so-called acquaintance vaccination is the most cost efficient. For other parameter values, protocols designed for query-efficient identification of the network’s largest degrees are most efficient.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qHBfqQHqk_Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Exploring the inhibition mechanism of adenylyl cyclase type 5 by n-terminal myristoylated Gαi1</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/BpoioK4eFoA/article</link>

Adenylyl cyclase (AC) is an important messenger involved in G-protein-coupled-receptor signal transduction pathways, which is a well-known target for drug development. AC is regulated by activated stimulatory (Gα&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) and inhibitory (Gα&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) G proteins in the cytosol. Although experimental studies have shown that these Gα subunits can stimulate or inhibit AC’s function in a non-competitive way, it is not well understood what the difference is in their mode of action as both Gα subunits appear structurally very similar in a non-lipidated state. However, a significant difference between Gα&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; and Gα&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is that while Gα&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; does not require any lipidation in order to stimulate AC, N-terminal myristoylation is crucial for Gα&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;’s inhibitory function as AC is not inhibited by non-myristoylated Gα&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;. At present, only the conformation of the complex including Gα&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; and AC has been resolved via X-ray crystallography. Therefore, understanding the interaction between Gα&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and AC is important as it will provide more insight into the unknown mechanism of AC regulation. This study demonstrates via classical molecular dynamics simulations that the myristoylated Gα&lt;sub&gt;i1&lt;/sub&gt; structure is able to interact with apo adenylyl cyclase type 5 in a way that causes inhibition of the catalytic function of the enzyme, suggesting that Gα lipidation could play a crucial role in AC regulation and in regulating G protein function by affecting Gα&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;’s active conformation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/BpoioK4eFoA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biallelic &lt;em&gt;DNAJC12&lt;/em&gt; mutations were described in children with hyperphenylalaninemia, neurodevelopmental delay, and dystonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We identified &lt;em&gt;DNAJC12&lt;/em&gt; homozygous null variants (c.187A&amp;gt;T;p.K63*and c.79-2A&amp;gt;G;p.V27Wfs*14) in two kindreds with early-onset parkinsonism. Both probands had mild intellectual disability, mild non-progressive, motor symptoms, sustained benefit from small dose of levodopa and substantial worsening of symptoms after levodopa discontinuation. Neuropathology (Proband-A) revealed no alpha-synuclein pathology and substantia nigra depigmentation with moderate cell loss &lt;em&gt;DNAJC12&lt;/em&gt; transcripts were reduced in both patients. Our results suggest &lt;em&gt;DNAJC12&lt;/em&gt; mutations (absent in 500 early-onset patients with Parkinson's disease) rarely cause dopa-responsive non-progressive parkinsonism in adulthood, broadening the clinical spectrum of &lt;em&gt;DNAJC12&lt;/em&gt; deficiency.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Bicycling suppresses abnormal beta synchrony in the Parkinsonian basal ganglia</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25047</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freezing of gait is a poorly understood symptom of Parkinson's disease, and can severely disrupt the locomotion of affected patients. However, bicycling ability remains surprisingly unaffected in most patients suffering from freezing suggesting functional differences in the motor network. The purpose of this study was to characterize and contrast the oscillatory dynamics underlying bicycling and walking in the basal ganglia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We present the first local field potential recordings directly comparing bicycling and walking in Parkinson's disease patients with electrodes implanted in the subthalamic nuclei for deep brain stimulation. Low (13-22 Hz) and high (23-35 Hz) beta power changes were analyzed in 22 subthalamic nuclei from 13 Parkinson's disease patients (57.5 +/- 5.9 years, four female). The study group consisted of five patients with and eight patients without freezing of gait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In patients without freezing of gait, both bicycling and walking led to a suppression of subthalamic beta power (13-35 Hz), and this suppression was stronger for bicycling. Freezers showed a similar pattern in general. Superimposed on this pattern, however, we observed a movement-induced, narrowband power increase around 18 Hz, which was evident even in the absence of freezing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results indicate that bicycling facilitates overall suppression of beta power. Furthermore, movement leads to exaggerated synchronization in the low beta band specifically within the basal ganglia of patients susceptible to freezing. Abnormal ∼18 Hz oscillations are implicated in the pathophysiology of freezing of gait, and suppressing them may form a key strategy in developing potential therapies.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Brain-heart interactions reveal consciousness in non-communicating patients</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25045</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We here aimed at characterizing heart-brain interactions in patients with disorders of consciousness. We tested how this information impacts data-driven classification between unresponsive and minimally conscious patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cohort of 127 patients in vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (VS/UWS, n=70) and minimally conscious state (MCS, n=57) were presented with the ‘Local-Global' auditory oddball paradigm, which distinguishes two levels of processing: short-term deviation of local auditory regularities and global long-term rule violations. In addition to previously validated markers of consciousness extracted from electroencephalograms (EEG), we computed autonomic cardiac markers, such as heart rate and variability (HR, HRV), and cardiac cycle phase-shifts triggered by the processing of the auditory stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;HR and HRV were similar in patients across groups. The cardiac cycle was not sensitive to the processing of local regularities in either the VS/UWS or MCS patients. In contrast, global regularities induced a phase-shift of the cardiac cycle exclusively in the MCS group. The interval between the auditory stimulation and the following R-peak was significantly shortened in MCS when the auditory rule was violated. When the information of the cardiac cycle modulations and other consciousness-related EEG markers were combined, single-patient classification performance was enhanced compared to classification with solely EEG markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our work shows a link between residual cognitive processing and the modulation of autonomic somatic markers. These results open a new window to evaluate patients with disorders of consciousness via the embodied paradigm, according to which body-brain functions contribute to a holistic approach to conscious processing.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Mutations of KIF14 Cause Primary Microcephaly by Impairing Cytokinesis</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25044</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH) is a rare condition characterized by a reduced cerebral cortex accompanied with intellectual disability. Mutations in 17 genes have been shown to cause this phenotype. Recently, mutations in &lt;em&gt;CIT,&lt;/em&gt; encoding CRIK (&lt;b&gt;Citron Rho-interacting kinase) —&lt;/b&gt; a component of the central spindle matrix, were added. We aimed at identifying novel MCPH-associated genes and exploring their functional role in pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Linkage analysis and whole-exome sequencing were performed in consanguineous and nonconsanguineous MCPH families to identify disease-causing variants. Functional consequences were investigated by RNA studies and on cellular level using immunofluorescence and microscopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: We identified homozygous mutations in &lt;em&gt;KIF14&lt;/em&gt; (NM_014875.2;c.263T&amp;gt;A;pLeu88*, c.2480_2482delTTG;p.Val827del and c.4071G&amp;gt;A;p.Gln1357=) as the likely cause in three MCPH families. Further, in a patient presenting with a severe form of primary microcephaly and short stature, we identified compound heterozygous missense mutations in &lt;em&gt;KIF14&lt;/em&gt; (NM_014875.2;c.2545C&amp;gt;G;p.His849Asp and c.3662G&amp;gt;T;p.Gly1221Val). Three of the five identified mutations impaired splicing and two resulted in a truncated protein. Intriguingly, &lt;em&gt;Kif14&lt;/em&gt; knockout mice also showed primary microcephaly. Human k&lt;b&gt;inesin-like protein&lt;/b&gt; KIF14, a microtubule motor protein, localizes at the midbody to finalize cytokinesis by interacting with CRIK. We found impaired localization of both KIF14 and CRIK at the midbody in patient-derived fibroblasts. Further, we observed a large number of binucleated and apoptotic cells — signs of failed cytokinesis that we also observed in experimentally KIF14-depleted cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Our data corroborate the role of an impaired cytokinesis for the etiology of primary and syndromic microcephaly as has been proposed by recent findings on &lt;em&gt;CIT&lt;/em&gt; mutations.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Deconstructing normal pressure hydrocephalus: Ventriculomegaly as early sign of neurodegeneration</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25046</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) remains both over-suspected on clinical grounds and under-confirmed when based on immediate and sustained response to cerebrospinal fluid diversion. Poor long-term post-shunt benefits and findings of neurodegenerative pathology in most patients with adequate follow up suggests that hydrocephalic disorders appearing in late adulthood may often result from initially unapparent parenchymal abnormalities. We critically review the NPH literature, highlighting the near universal lack of blinding and controls, the absence of specific clinical, imaging, or pathologic features, and the ongoing dependence for diagnostic confirmation on variable cutoffs of gait response to bedside fluid-drainage testing. We also summarize our long-term institutional experience, in which post-shunt benefits in patients with initial diagnosis of idiopathic NPH persist in only 32% of patients at 36 months, with known revised diagnosis in over 25% (Alzheimer disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and progressive supranuclear palsy). We postulate that previously reported NPH cases with “dual” pathology (i.e., developing a “second” disorder) more likely represent ventriculomegalic presentations of selected neurodegenerative disorders in which benefits from shunting may be short-lived, with a consequently unfavorable risk-benefit ratio.

We conducted a multicenter, phase 1/2 study in SRSE patients to evaluate the safety and tolerability of brexanolone (USAN; formerly SAGE-547 Injection), a proprietary, aqueous formulation of the neuroactive steroid, allopregnanolone. Secondary objectives included pharmacokinetic assessment and open-label evaluation of brexanolone response during and after anesthetic third-line agent (TLA) weaning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25008-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients receiving TLAs for SRSE control were eligible for open-label, 1-hour brexanolone loading infusions, followed by maintenance infusion. After 48 hours of brexanolone infusion, TLAs were weaned during brexanolone maintenance. After 4 days, the brexanolone dose was tapered. Safety and functional status were assessed over 3 weeks of follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25008-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-five patients received open-label study drug. No serious adverse events (SAEs) were attributable to study drug, as determined by the Safety Review Committee. Sixteen patients (64%) experienced ≥1 SAE. Six patient deaths occurred, all deemed related to underlying medical conditions. Twenty-two patients underwent ≥1 TLA wean attempt. Seventeen (77%) met the response endpoint of weaning successfully off TLAs before tapering brexanolone. Sixteen (73%) were successfully weaned off TLAs within 5 days of initiating brexanolone infusion without anesthetic agent reinstatement in the following 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The results suggest the possible development of brexanolone as an adjunctive therapy for SRSE requiring pharmacological coma for seizure control.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this work, we study the dynamic range in a neuronal network modelled by
cellular automaton. We consider deterministic and non-deterministic rules to
simulate electrical and chemical synapses. Chemical synapses have an intrinsic
time-delay and are susceptible to parameter variations guided by learning
Hebbian rules of behaviour. Our results show that chemical synapses can
abruptly enhance sensibility of the neural network, a manifestation that can
become even more predominant if learning rules of evolution are applied to the
chemical synapses.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The ability to rapidly identify symmetry and anti-symmetry is an essential
attribute of intelligence. Symmetry perception is a central process in human
vision and may be key to human 3D visualization. While previous work in
understanding neuron symmetry perception has concentrated on the neuron as an
integrator, here we show how the coincidence detecting property of the spiking
neuron can be used to reveal symmetry density in spatial data. We develop a
method for synchronizing symmetry-identifying spiking artificial neural
networks to enable layering and feedback in the network. We show a method for
building a network capable of identifying symmetry density between sets of data
and present a digital logic implementation demonstrating an 8x8
leaky-integrate-and-fire symmetry detector in a field programmable gate array.
Our results show that the efficiencies of spiking neural networks can be
harnessed to rapidly identify symmetry in spatial data with applications in
image processing, 3D computer vision, and robotics.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This document presents the material of two lectures on statistical physics
and neural representations, delivered by one of us (R.M.) at the Fundamental
Problems in Statistical Physics XIV summer school in July 2017. In a first
part, we consider the neural representations of space (maps) in the
hippocampus. We introduce an extension of the Hopfield model, able to store
multiple spatial maps as continuous, finite-dimensional attractors. The phase
diagram and dynamical properties of the model are analyzed. We then show how
spatial representations can be dynamically decoded using an effective Ising
model capturing the correlation structure in the neural data, and compare
applications to data obtained from hippocampal multi-electrode recordings and
by (sub)sampling our attractor model. In a second part, we focus on the problem
of learning data representations in machine learning, in particular with
artificial neural networks. We start by introducing data representations
through some illustrations. We then analyze two important algorithms, Principal
Component Analysis and Restricted Boltzmann Machines, with tools from
statistical physics.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Fractional cable equation for general geometry, a model of axons with swellings and anomalous diffusion. (arXiv:1709.02443v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02443</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Different experimental studies have reported anomalous diffusion in brain
tissues and notably this anomalous diffusion is expressed through fractional
derivatives. Axons are important to understand neurodegenerative diseases such
as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Indeed,
abnormal accumulation of proteins and organelles in axons is a hallmark feature
of these diseases. The diffusion in the axons can become to anomalous as a
result from this abnormality. In this case the voltage propagation in axons is
affected. Another hallmark feature of different neurodegenerative diseases is
given by discrete swellings along the axon. In order to model the voltage
propagation in axons with anomalous diffusion and swellings, in this paper we
propose a fractional cable equation for general geometry. This generalized
equation depends on fractional parameters and geometric quantities such as the
curvature and torsion of the cable. For a cable with a constant radius we show
that the voltage decreases when the fractional effect increases. In cables with
swellings we find that when the fractional effect or the swelling radius
increase, the voltage decreases. A similar behavior is obtained when the number
of swellings and the fractional effect increase. Moreover, we find that when
the radius swelling (or the number of swellings) and the fractional effect
increase at the same time, the voltage dramatically decreases.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/29893</link>
	<content:encoded>In many excitatory synapses, mobile zinc is found within glutamatergic vesicles and is coreleased with glutamate. &lt;i&gt;Ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies established that synaptically released (synaptic) zinc inhibits excitatory neurotransmission at lower frequencies of synaptic activity but enhances steady state synaptic responses during higher frequencies of activity. However, it remains unknown how synaptic zinc affects neuronal processing &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we imaged the sound-evoked neuronal activity of the primary auditory cortex in awake mice. We discovered that synaptic zinc enhanced the gain of sound-evoked responses in CaMKII-expressing principal neurons, but it reduced the gain of parvalbumin- and somatostatin-expressing interneurons. This modulation was sound intensity-dependent and, in part, NMDA receptor-independent. By establishing a previously unknown link between synaptic zinc and gain control of auditory cortical processing, our findings advance understanding about cortical synaptic mechanisms and create a new framework for approaching and interpreting the role of the auditory cortex in sound processing.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The Zika virus has emerged as a global public health concern. Its rapid geographic expansion is attributed to the success of &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; mosquito vectors, but local epidemiological drivers are still poorly understood. Feira de Santana played a pivotal role in the Chikungunya epidemic in Brazil and was one of the first urban centres to report Zika infections. Using a climate-driven transmission model and notified Zika case data, we show that a low observation rate and high vectorial capacity translated into a significant attack rate during the 2015 outbreak, with a subsequent decline in 2016 and fade-out in 2017 due to herd-immunity. We find a potential Zika-related, low risk for microcephaly per pregnancy, but with significant public health impact given high attack rates. The balance between the loss of herd-immunity and viral re-importation will dictate future transmission potential of in this urban setting.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Simultaneous activation of parallel sensory pathways promotes a grooming sequence in Drosophila</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/28804</link>
	<content:encoded>A central model that describes how behavioral sequences are produced features a neural architecture that readies different movements simultaneously, and a mechanism where prioritized suppression between the movements determines their sequential performance. We previously described a model whereby suppression drives a &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; grooming sequence that is induced by simultaneous activation of different sensory pathways that each elicit a distinct movement (Seeds et al. 2014). Here, we confirm this model using transgenic expression to identify and optogenetically activate sensory neurons that elicit specific grooming movements. Simultaneous activation of different sensory pathways elicits a grooming sequence that resembles the naturally induced sequence. Moreover, the sequence proceeds after the sensory excitation is terminated, indicating that a persistent trace of this excitation induces the next grooming movement once the previous one is performed. This reveals a mechanism whereby parallel sensory inputs can be integrated and stored to elicit a delayed and sequential grooming response.</content:encoded>

However, accumulating evidence has shown that precision grip can recover considerably through rehabilitative training. Recent multidisciplinary studies have revealed that, at the spinal level, this recovery is possible due to an indirect neural pathway through propriospinal neurons (PNs), which relay cortical commands to hand motoneurons. Although this indirect spinal pathway is heavily involved in recovery, its role is dwarfed by a simultaneous large-scale network reorganization spanning motor-related cortices and mesolimbic structures.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Mobility can promote the evolution of cooperation via emergent self-assortment dynamics</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/jZzpQOEMUtY/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Jaideep Joshi, Iain D Couzin, Simon A Levin, Vishwesha Guttal&lt;/p&gt;

The evolution of costly cooperation, where cooperators pay a personal cost to benefit others, requires that cooperators interact more frequently with other cooperators. This condition, called positive assortment, is known to occur in spatially-structured viscous populations, where individuals typically have low mobility and limited dispersal. However many social organisms across taxa, from cells and bacteria, to birds, fish and ungulates, are mobile, and live in populations with considerable inter-group mixing. In the absence of information regarding others’ traits or conditional strategies, such mixing may inhibit assortment and limit the potential for cooperation to evolve. Here we employ spatially-explicit individual-based evolutionary simulations to incorporate costs and benefits of two coevolving costly traits: cooperative and local cohesive tendencies. We demonstrate that, despite possessing no information about others’ traits or payoffs, mobility (via self-propulsion or environmental forcing) facilitates assortment of cooperators via a dynamically evolving difference in the cohesive tendencies of cooperators and defectors. We show analytically that this assortment can also be viewed in a multilevel selection framework, where selection for cooperation among emergent groups can overcome selection against cooperators within the groups. As a result of these dynamics, we find an oscillatory pattern of cooperation and defection that maintains cooperation even in the absence of well known mechanisms such as kin interactions, reciprocity, local dispersal or conditional strategies that require information on others’ strategies or payoffs. Our results offer insights into differential adhesion based mechanisms for positive assortment and reveal the possibility of cooperative aggregations in dynamic fission-fusion populations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jZzpQOEMUtY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Population FBA predicts metabolic phenotypes in yeast</title>

Using protein counts sampled from single cell proteomics distributions to constrain fluxes through a genome-scale model of metabolism, Population flux balance analysis (Population FBA) successfully described metabolic heterogeneity in a population of independent &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; cells growing in a defined medium. We extend the methodology to account for correlations in protein expression arising from the co-regulation of genes and apply it to study the growth of independent &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; cells in two different growth media. We find the partitioning of flux between fermentation and respiration predicted by our model agrees with recent &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C fluxomics experiments, and that our model largely recovers the Crabtree effect (the experimentally known bias among certain yeast species toward fermentation with the production of ethanol even in the presence of oxygen), while FBA without proteomics constraints predicts respirative metabolism almost exclusively. The comparisons to the &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C study showed improvement upon inclusion of the correlations and motivated a technique to systematically identify inconsistent kinetic parameters in the literature. The minor secretion fluxes for glycerol and acetate are underestimated by our method, which indicate a need for further refinements to the metabolic model. For yeast cells grown in synthetic defined (SD) medium, the calculated broad distribution of growth rates matches experimental observations from single cell studies, and we characterize several metabolic phenotypes within our modeled populations that make use of diverse pathways. Fast growing yeast cells are predicted to perform significant amount of respiration, use serine-glycine cycle and produce ethanol in mitochondria as opposed to slow growing cells. We use a genetic algorithm to determine the proteomics constraints necessary to reproduce the growth rate distributions seen experimentally. We find that a core set of 51 constraints are essential but that additional constraints are still necessary to recover the observed growth rate distribution in SD medium.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-Ch-pmMQQWc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Axonal components of nerves innervating the human arm</title>

Despite comprehensive knowledge on the topographical anatomy of nerves innervating the human upper limbs, the definite quantity of sensory and motor axons within this neural network remains elusive. Our aim was to perform a quantitative analysis of the axonal components of human upper limb nerves based on highly specific molecular features from spinal cord level to the terminal nerves at wrist level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25018-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nerve specimen harvest at predefined harvesting sites (plexus roots and cords as well as major nerves originating from the brachial plexus innervating the arm and hand) was performed in 9 human heart-beating organ donors. Double immunofluorescence staining using antibodies against choline-acetyltransferase and neurofilament was performed to differentiate motor and sensory axons on nerve cross sections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25018-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three hundred fifty thousand axons emerge from the spinal cord to innervate the human upper limb, of which 10% are motor neurons. In all nerves studied, sensory axons outnumber motor axons by a ratio of at least 9:1. The sensory axon contribution increases when moving distally, whereas only 1,700 motor axons reach the hand to innervate the intrinsic musculature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25018-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that upper limb motor execution, and particularly dexterous coordination of hand movement, require an unexpectedly low number of motor neurons, with a large convergence of afferent input for feedback control.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Brain structural connectivity atrophy in Alzheimer's disease. (arXiv:1709.02369v2 [physics.med-ph] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02369</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Analysis and quantification of brain structural changes, using Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), are increasingly used to define novel biomarkers of
brain pathologies, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Network-based models of
the brain have shown that both local and global topological properties can
reveal patterns of disease propagation. On the other hand, intra-subject
descriptions cannot exploit the whole information context, accessible through
inter-subject comparisons. To address this, we developed a novel approach,
which models brain structural connectivity atrophy with a multiplex network and
summarizes it within a classification score. On an independent dataset
multiplex networks were able to correctly segregate, from normal controls (NC),
AD patients and subjects with mild cognitive impairment that will convert to AD
(cMCI) with an accuracy of, respectively, $0.86 \pm 0.01$ and $0.84 \pm 0.01$.
The model also shows that illness effects are maximally detected by parceling
the brain in equal volumes of $3000$ $mm^3$ (&quot;patches&quot;), without any $a$
$priori$ segmentation based on anatomical features. A direct comparison to
standard voxel-based morphometry on the same dataset showed that the multiplex
network approach had higher sensitivity. This method is general and can have
twofold potential applications: providing a reliable tool for clinical trials
and a disease signature of neurodegenerative pathologies.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02341</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This work combines the free energy principle from cognitive neuroscience and
the ensuing active inference dynamics with recent advances in variational
inference in deep generative models, and evolution strategies as efficient
large scale, black box optimisation technique, to introduce the &quot;deep active
inference&quot; agent. This agent minimises a variational free energy bound on the
average surprise of its sensations, which is motivated by a homeostatic
argument. It does so by optimising the parameters of a generative latent
variable model of its sensory inputs, together with a variational density
approximating the posterior distribution over the latent variables, given its
observations, and by acting on its environment to actively sample input that is
likely under this generative model. The internal dynamics of the agent are
implemented using deep and recurrent neural networks, as used in machine
learning, making the deep active inference agent a scalable and very flexible
class of active inference agent. Using the mountain car problem, we show how
goal directed behaviour can be implemented by defining appropriate priors on
the latent states in the agent's model. Furthermore, we show that the deep
active inference agent can learn a generative model of the environment, which
can be sampled from to understand the agent's beliefs about the environment and
its interaction therewith.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The field of neuroscience is facing an unprecedented expanse in the volume
and diversity of available data. Traditionally, network models have provided
key insights into the structure and function of the brain. With the advent of
big data in neuroscience, both more sophisticated models capable of
characterizing the increasing complexity of the data and novel methods of
quantitative analysis are needed. Recently multilayer networks, a mathematical
extension of traditional networks, have gained increasing popularity in
neuroscience due to their ability to capture the full information of
multi-model, multi-scale, spatiotemporal data sets. Here, we review multilayer
networks and their applications in neuroscience, showing how incorporating the
multilayer framework into network neuroscience analysis has uncovered
previously hidden features of brain networks. We specifically highlight the use
of multilayer networks to model disease, structure-function relationships,
network evolution, and link multi-scale data. Finally, we close with a
discussion of promising new directions of multilayer network neuroscience
research and propose a modified definition of multilayer networks designed to
unite and clarify the use of the multilayer formalism in describing real-world
systems.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/27702</link>
	<content:encoded>Addressing how neural circuits underlie behavior is routinely done by measuring electrical activity from single neurons in experimental sessions. While such recordings yield snapshots of neural dynamics during specified tasks, they are ill-suited for tracking single-unit activity over longer timescales relevant for most developmental and learning processes, or for capturing neural dynamics across different behavioral states. Here we describe an automated platform for continuous long-term recordings of neural activity and behavior in freely moving rodents. An unsupervised algorithm identifies and tracks the activity of single units over weeks of recording, dramatically simplifying the analysis of large datasets. Months-long recordings from motor cortex and striatum made and analyzed with our system revealed remarkable stability in basic neuronal properties, such as firing rates and inter-spike interval distributions. Interneuronal correlations and the representation of different movements and behaviors were similarly stable. This establishes the feasibility of high-throughput long-term extracellular recordings in behaving animals.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/27402</link>
	<content:encoded>We have identified the plant biflavonoid hinokiflavone as an inhibitor of splicing &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and modulator of alternative splicing in cells. Chemical synthesis confirms hinokiflavone is the active molecule. Hinokiflavone inhibits splicing&lt;i&gt; in vitro&lt;/i&gt; by blocking spliceosome assembly, leading to accumulation of the A complex. Cells treated with hinokiflavone show altered subnuclear organization specifically of splicing factors required for A complex formation, which relocalize together with SUMO1 and SUMO2 into enlarged nuclear speckles. Hinokiflavone increases protein SUMOylation levels, both in &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; splicing reactions and in cells. Hinokiflavone also inhibited a purified, &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; expressed SUMO protease, SENP1, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, indicating the increase in SUMOylated proteins results primarily from inhibition of de-SUMOylation. Using a quantitative proteomics assay we identified many SUMO2 sites whose levels increased in cells following hinokiflavone treatment, with the major targets including 6 proteins that are components of the U2 snRNP and required for A complex formation.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/26509</link>
	<content:encoded>Wnt5a-Ror signaling constitutes a developmental pathway crucial for embryonic tissue morphogenesis, reproduction and adult tissue regeneration, yet the molecular mechanisms by which the Wnt5a-Ror pathway mediates these processes are largely unknown. Using a proteomic screen, we identify the kinesin superfamily protein Kif26b as a downstream target of the Wnt5a-Ror pathway. Wnt5a-Ror, through a process independent of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin-dependent pathway, regulates the cellular stability of Kif26b by inducing its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Through this mechanism, Kif26b modulates the migratory behavior of cultured mesenchymal cells in a Wnt5a-dependent manner. Genetic perturbation of Kif26b function in vivo caused embryonic axis malformations and depletion of primordial germ cells in the developing gonad, two phenotypes characteristic of disrupted Wnt5a-Ror signaling. These findings indicate that Kif26b links Wnt5a-Ror signaling to the control of morphogenetic cell and tissue behaviors in vertebrates and reveal a new role for regulated proteolysis in noncanonical Wnt5a-Ror signal transduction.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/26014</link>
	<content:encoded>Phenomics, which ideally involves in-depth phenotyping at the whole-organism scale, may enhance our functional understanding of genetic variation. Here, we demonstrate methods to profile hundreds of phenotypic measures comprised of morphological and densitometric traits at a large number of sites within the axial skeleton of adult zebrafish. We show the potential for vertebral patterns to confer heightened sensitivity, with similar specificity, in discriminating mutant populations compared to analyzing individual vertebrae in isolation. We identify phenotypes associated with human brittle bone disease and thyroid stimulating hormone receptor hyperactivity. Finally, we develop allometric models and show their potential to aid in the discrimination of mutant phenotypes masked by alterations in growth. Our studies demonstrate virtues of deep phenotyping in a spatially distributed organ system. Analyzing phenotypic patterns may increase productivity in genetic screens, and facilitate the study of genetic variants associated with smaller effect sizes, such as those that underlie complex diseases.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/25269</link>
	<content:encoded>Commissural axons switch on responsiveness to Wnt attraction during midline crossing to turn anteriorly after exiting the floor plate. We report here Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) downregulates Shisa2, which inhibits glycosylation and cell surface presentation of Frizzled3 in rodent commissural axon growth cones. Constitutive Shisa2 expression causes randomized turning of post-crossing commissural axons along the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis. Loss of Shisa2 lead to precocious anterior turning of commissural axons before or during midline crossing. Post-crossing commissural axon turning is completely randomized along the A-P axis when &lt;i&gt;Wntless&lt;/i&gt;, essential for Wnt secretion, is conditionally knocked out in the floor plate. The regulatory link between Shh and PCP signaling may also occur in other developmental processes.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/24502</link>
	<content:encoded>Genetic analysis has revealed that the dual specificity protein kinase DYRK1A has multiple roles in the development of the central nervous system. Increased &lt;i&gt;DYRK1A&lt;/i&gt; gene dosage, such as occurs in Down syndrome, affects neural progenitor cell differentiation, while haploinsufficiency of &lt;i&gt;DYRK1A&lt;/i&gt; is associated with severe microcephaly. Using a set of known and newly synthesized DYRK1A inhibitors, along with CRISPR-mediated gene activation and shRNA knockdown of &lt;i&gt;DYRK1A&lt;/i&gt;, we show that chemical inhibition or genetic knockdown of &lt;i&gt;DYRK1A&lt;/i&gt; interferes with neural specification of human pluripotent stem cells, a process equating to the earliest stage of human brain development. DYRK1A inhibition insulates the self-renewing subpopulation of human pluripotent stem cells from powerful signals that drive neural induction. Our results suggest a novel mechanism for the disruptive effects of loss of &lt;i&gt;DYRK1A&lt;/i&gt; during early mammalian development, and reveal a requirement for &lt;i&gt;DYRK1A&lt;/i&gt; in the acquisition of competence for differentiation in human pluripotent stem cells.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Standardized mean differences cause funnel plot distortion in publication bias assessments</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/24260</link>
	<content:encoded>Meta-analyses are increasingly used for synthesis of evidence, and often include an assessment of publication bias based on detection of asymmetry in funnel plots. We studied the influence of different normalisation approaches, sample size and intervention effects on funnel plot asymmetry, using empirical datasets and illustrative simulations. We found that funnel plots of the Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) plotted against the standard error (SE) are susceptible to distortion, leading to overestimation of the existence and extent of publication bias. Distortion was more severe when the primary studies had a small sample size and when an intervention effect was present. We show that using the Normalised Mean Difference (when possible), or plotting the SMD against a sample size-based precision estimate, are more reliable alternatives. We conclude that funnel plots using the SMD in combination with the SE are unsuitable for publication bias assessments and can lead to false-positive results.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Resource depletion through primate stone technology</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/23647</link>
	<content:encoded>Tool use has allowed humans to become one of the most successful species. However, tool-assisted foraging has also pushed many of our prey species to extinction or endangerment, a technology-driven process thought to be uniquely human. Here, we demonstrate that tool-assisted foraging on shellfish by long-tailed macaques (&lt;i&gt;Macaca fascicularis&lt;/i&gt;) in Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park, Thailand, reduces prey size and prey abundance, with more pronounced effects where the macaque population size is larger. We compared availability, sizes and maturation stages of shellfish between two adjacent islands inhabited by different-sized macaque populations and demonstrate potential effects on the prey reproductive biology. We provide evidence that once technological macaques reach a large enough group size, they enter a feedback loop – driving shellfish prey size down with attendant changes in the tool sizes used by the monkeys. If this pattern continues, prey populations could be reduced to a point where tool-assisted foraging is no longer beneficial to the macaques, which in return may lessen or extinguish the remarkable foraging technology employed by these primates.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Two passive mechanical conditions modulate power generation by the outer hair cells</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/0NEUBF5ry7U/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Yanju Liu, Sheryl M. Gracewski, Jong-Hoon Nam&lt;/p&gt;

In the mammalian cochlea, small vibrations of the sensory epithelium are amplified due to active electro-mechanical feedback of the outer hair cells. The level of amplification is greater in the base than in the apex of the cochlea. Theoretical studies have used longitudinally varying active feedback properties to reproduce the location-dependent amplification. The active feedback force has been considered to be proportional to the basilar membrane displacement or velocity. An underlying assumption was that organ of Corti mechanics are governed by rigid body kinematics. However, recent progress in vibration measurement techniques reveals that organ of Corti mechanics are too complicated to be fully represented with rigid body kinematics. In this study, two components of the active feedback are considered explicitly—organ of Corti mechanics, and outer hair cell electro-mechanics. Physiological properties for the outer hair cells were incorporated, such as the active force gain, mechano-transduction properties, and membrane RC time constant. Instead of a kinematical model, a fully deformable 3D finite element model was used. We show that the organ of Corti mechanics dictate the longitudinal trend of cochlear amplification. Specifically, our results suggest that two mechanical conditions are responsible for location-dependent cochlear amplification. First, the phase of the outer hair cell’s somatic force with respect to its elongation rate varies along the cochlear length. Second, the local stiffness of the organ of Corti complex felt by individual outer hair cells varies along the cochlear length. We describe how these two mechanical conditions result in greater amplification toward the base of the cochlea.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0NEUBF5ry7U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/30286</link>
	<content:encoded>Neurotransmitter release depends on the SNARE complex formed by syntaxin-1, synaptobrevin and SNAP-25, as well as on complexins, which bind to the SNARE complex and play active and inhibitory roles. A crystal structure of a Complexin-I fragment bearing a so-called 'superclamp' mutation bound to a truncated SNARE complex lacking the C-terminus of the synaptobrevin SNARE motif (SNAREΔ60) suggested that an 'accessory' α-helix of Complexin-I inhibits release by inserting into the C-terminus of the SNARE complex. Previously, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments performed in different laboratories yielded apparently discrepant results in support or against the existence of such binding mode in solution (Trimbuch et al., 2014; Krishnakumar et al., 2015). Here, ITC experiments performed to solve these discrepancies now show that the region containing the Complexin-I accessory helix and preceding N-terminal sequences does interact with SNAREΔ60, but the interaction requires the polybasic juxtamembrane region of syntaxin-1 and is not affected by the superclamp mutation within the experimental error of these experiments.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/29241</link>
	<content:encoded>Myelination is a biosynthetically demanding process in which mTORC1, the gatekeeper of anabolism, occupies a privileged regulatory position. We have shown previously that loss of mTORC1 function in Schwann cells (SCs) hampers myelination. Here, we genetically disrupted key inhibitory components upstream of mTORC1, TSC1 or PTEN, in mouse SC development, adult homeostasis, and nerve injury. Surprisingly, the resulting mTORC1 hyperactivity led to markedly delayed onset of both developmental myelination and remyelination after injury. However, if mTORC1 was hyperactivated after myelination onset, radial hypermyelination was observed. At early developmental stages, physiologically high PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 signaling suppresses expression of Krox20 (Egr2), the master regulator of PNS myelination. This effect is mediated by S6K and contributes to control mechanisms that keep SCs in a not-fully differentiated state to ensure proper timing of myelination initiation. An ensuing decline in mTORC1 activity is crucial to allow myelination to start, while remaining mTORC1 activity drives myelin growth.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/29218</link>
	<content:encoded>Methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR), found in strictly anaerobic methanogenic and methanotrophic archaea, catalyzes the reversible production and consumption of the potent greenhouse gas methane. The α subunit of MCR (McrA) contains several unusual post-translational modifications, including a rare thioamidation of glycine. Based on the presumed function of homologous genes involved in the biosynthesis of thioviridamide, a thioamide-containing natural product, we hypothesized that the archaeal &lt;i&gt;tfuA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ycaO&lt;/i&gt; genes would be responsible for post-translational installation of thioglycine into McrA. Mass spectrometric characterization of McrA from the methanogenic archaeon &lt;i&gt;Methanosarcina acetivorans&lt;/i&gt; lacking &lt;i&gt;tfuA&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;i&gt;/&lt;/i&gt;or &lt;i&gt;ycaO&lt;/i&gt; revealed the presence of glycine, rather than thioglycine, supporting this hypothesis. Phenotypic characterization of the ∆&lt;i&gt;ycaO-tfuA&lt;/i&gt; mutant revealed a severe growth rate defect on substrates with low free energy yields and at elevated temperatures (39°C - 45°C). Our analyses support a role for thioglycine in stabilizing the protein secondary structure near the active site.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/27109</link>
	<content:encoded>Transmissible amyloid particles called prions are associated with infectious prion diseases in mammals and inherited phenotypes in yeast. All amyloid aggregates can give rise to potentially infectious seeds that accelerate their growth. Why some amyloid seeds are highly infectious prion particles while others are less infectious or even inert, is currently not understood. To address this question, we analyzed the suprastructure and dimensions of synthetic amyloid fibrils assembled from the yeast (&lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;) prion protein Sup35NM. We then quantified the ability of these particles to induce the [&lt;i&gt;PSI&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;] prion phenotype in cells. Our results show a striking relationship between the length distribution of the amyloid fibrils and their ability to induce the heritable [&lt;i&gt;PSI&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;] prion phenotype. Using a simple particle size threshold model to describe transfection activity, we explain how dimensions of amyloid fibrils are able to modulate their infectious potential as prions.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/22225</link>
	<content:encoded>It is widely believed that persistent neural activity underlies short-term memory. Yet, as we show, temporal degradation in such networks behaves differently from human short-term memory performance. We build a more general framework where the memory is viewed as a problem of passing information through noisy channels that represent analog persistent activity networks. Rather than directly storing information, such memory networks might hold information encoded to achieve robustness against noise. We derive a fundamental lower-bound on memory recall precision, which declines with storage duration and number of stored items. We show that human performance, though inconsistent with models involving direct (uncoded) storage in persistent activity networks, can be well-fit by the theoretical bound. This finding is consistent with the view that if the brain stores information in patterns of persistent activity, it might use codes that minimize the effects of noise, motivating the search for such codes in the brain.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Estimating short-term synaptic plasticity from pre- and postsynaptic spiking</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/Bi9xTDVaR8E/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Abed Ghanbari, Aleksey Malyshev, Maxim Volgushev, Ian H. Stevenson&lt;/p&gt;

Short-term synaptic plasticity (STP) critically affects the processing of information in neuronal circuits by reversibly changing the effective strength of connections between neurons on time scales from milliseconds to a few seconds. STP is traditionally studied using intracellular recordings of postsynaptic potentials or currents evoked by presynaptic spikes. However, STP also affects the statistics of postsynaptic spikes. Here we present two model-based approaches for estimating synaptic weights and short-term plasticity from pre- and postsynaptic spike observations alone. We extend a generalized linear model (GLM) that predicts postsynaptic spiking as a function of the observed pre- and postsynaptic spikes and allow the connection strength (coupling term in the GLM) to vary as a function of time based on the history of presynaptic spikes. Our first model assumes that STP follows a Tsodyks-Markram description of vesicle depletion and recovery. In a second model, we introduce a functional description of STP where we estimate the coupling term as a biophysically unrestrained function of the presynaptic inter-spike intervals. To validate the models, we test the accuracy of STP estimation using the spiking of pre- and postsynaptic neurons with known synaptic dynamics. We first test our models using the responses of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons to simulated presynaptic input with different types of STP, and then use simulated spike trains to examine the effects of spike-frequency adaptation, stochastic vesicle release, spike sorting errors, and common input. We find that, using only spike observations, both model-based methods can accurately reconstruct the time-varying synaptic weights of presynaptic inputs for different types of STP. Our models also capture the differences in postsynaptic spike responses to presynaptic spikes following short vs long inter-spike intervals, similar to results reported for thalamocortical connections. These models may thus be useful tools for characterizing short-term plasticity from multi-electrode spike recordings in vivo.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Bi9xTDVaR8E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Alcohol improves cerebellar-learning deficit in myoclonus-dystonia - a clinical and electrophysiological investigation</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25035</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objectives&lt;/em&gt;: To characterize neurophysiological subcortical abnormalities in myoclonus-dystonia and their modulation by alcohol administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods&lt;/em&gt;: Cerebellar associative learning and basal ganglia-brainstem interaction were investigated in 17 myoclonus-dystonia patients with &lt;em&gt;epsilon-sarcoglycan&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SGCE)&lt;/em&gt; gene mutation and 21 age- and sex-matched healthy controls by means of classical eyeblink conditioning and blink reflex recovery cycle before and after alcohol intake resulting in a breath alcohol concentration of 0.08% (0.8 g/l). The alcohol responsiveness of clinical symptoms was evaluated by three blinded raters with a standardized video protocol and clinical rating scales including the Unified Myoclonus Rating Scale (UMRS) and the Burke Fahn Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results&lt;/em&gt;: Patients showed a significantly reduced number of conditioned eyeblink responses before alcohol administration compared to controls. While the conditioning response rate decreased under alcohol intake in controls, it increased in patients (ANOVA: alcohol state x Group p = 0.004). Blink reflex recovery cycle before and after alcohol intake did not differ between groups. Myoclonus improved significantly after alcohol intake (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.016). The severity of action myoclonus at baseline correlated negatively with the conditioning response in classical eyeblink conditioning in patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interpretation&lt;/em&gt;: The combination of findings with reduced baseline acquisition of conditioned eyeblink responses and normal blink reflex recovery cycle in patients that improved significantly by alcohol intake suggests a crucial role of cerebellar networks in the generation of symptoms in these patients.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Internal Grant Review to Increase Grant Funding for Junior Investigators</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25040</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decreasing biomedical research support over the past decade has driven many talented young scientists to seek careers outside academia. In 2011, the Department of Neurology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine developed an internal grant review program (IGRP) to systematically review career development awards (CDAs) and research grants (e.g., R01s) for junior investigators prior to NIH submission. With IGRP implementation, we observed significant increases in the number of CDAs and R-grants awarded to junior investigators. Thus, internal grant review is an effective means for supporting junior faculty and help them retain their research roles within academia. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Concussion in adolescence and risk of multiple sclerosis</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25036</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: To assess whether concussion in childhood or adolescence is associated with subsequent multiple sclerosis risk. Previous research suggests an association but methodological limitations included retrospective data collection and small study populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: The national Swedish Patient (hospital diagnoses) and Multiple Sclerosis registers were used to identify all MS diagnoses up to 2012 among people born from 1964, when the Patient Register was established. The 7292 patients with multiple sclerosis were matched individually with 10 people without MS by sex, year of birth, age/vital status at multiple sclerosis diagnosis, and region of residence (county), resulting in a study population of 80212. Diagnoses of concussion and control diagnoses of broken limb bones were identified using the Patient Register from birth to age 10 years or from ages 11 to 20 years. Conditional logistic regression was used to examine associations with multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Concussion in adolescence was associated with a raised risk of multiple sclerosis, producing adjusted odds ratios (and 95% confidence intervals) of 1.22 (1.05-1.42, p=0.008) and 2.33 (1.35-4.04, p=0.002) for one diagnosis of concussion, or more than one diagnosis of concussion, respectively, compared with none. No notable association with multiple sclerosis was observed for concussion in childhood, or broken limb bones in childhood and adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Head trauma in adolescence, particularly if repeated, is associated with a raised risk of future multiple sclerosis, possibly due to initiation of an autoimmune process in the central nervous system. This further emphasises the importance of protecting young people from head injuries. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>In mammals, acoustic information arises in the cochlea and is transmitted to the ventral cochlear nuclei (VCN). Three groups of VCN neurons extract different features from the firing of auditory nerve fibers and convey that information along separate pathways through the brainstem. Two of these pathways process temporal information: octopus cells detect coincident firing among auditory nerve fibers and transmit signals along monaural pathways, and bushy cells sharpen the encoding of fine structure and feed binaural pathways.</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Neurons are akin to modern cities in that both are dependent on robust transport mechanisms. Like the best mass transit systems, trafficking in neurons must be tailored to respond to local requirements. Neurons depend on both high-speed, long-distance transport and localized dynamics to correctly deliver &lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>Acquisition of social preference for siblings versus non-siblings is dynamic, but the developmental regulatory mechanisms have been unclear. Dulcis et al. found that sustained exposure to olfactory cues converts non-kin aversion to attraction via neurotransmitter switching coordinated by microRNAs.</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Fetal Growth and Premature Delivery in Pregnant Women on Anti-epileptic Drugs</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25031</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; To evaluate the effects of epilepsy and antiepileptic drugs (AED) use during pregnancy on fetal growth and preterm delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; This study included singleton liveborns born to women enrolled in the North American Antiepileptic Drug Pregnancy Registry between 1997 and 2016. Data were collected prospectively through telephone interviews. The prevalence of preterm birth (&amp;lt;37 weeks) and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) among infants exposed prenatally to AED when used by women with epilepsy (WWE) or women without epilepsy (WWOE) was compared with that among infants unexposed to AEDs and born to WWOE. Multivariable log-binomial regression models were used to estimate relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; The study population included infants born to 6,777 AED-WWE, 696 AED-WWOE, and 486 no-AED WWOE. The risk of prematurity was 6.2% for no-AED-WWOE, 9.3% for AED-WWE (RR 1.5, 95%CI: 1.0-2.1) and 10.5% for AED-WWOE (RR 1.5: 1.0-2.4). Prenatal exposure to AED in WWE and WWOE was associated with a mean lower birth weight of 110 and 136 grams, respectively, as compared to no-AED WWOE. The prevalence of SGA was 5.0% for no-AED-WWOE, 10.9% for AED-WWE (RR 2.0: 1.3-3.0) and 11.0% for AED-WWOE (RR 1.9: 1.2-2.9). Within users of AEDs in monotherapy, the prevalence of SGA ranged from 7.3% for lamotrigine to 18.5% for topiramate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interpretation&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; Women on AEDs during pregnancy, whether for epilepsy or for other neuropsychiatric indications, are at a higher risk of delivering prematurely and giving birth to SGA newborns. The risk may vary by drug. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Hexanucleotide repeat expansions in C9orf72 gene locus create double jeopardy, first by leading to DNA–RNA R-loops that spawn double-strand breaks and second by the synthesis of dipeptide repeats that hinder DNA repair. This two-pronged mechanism may explain neurodegeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>Amputees who wish to rid themselves of a phantom limb must weaken the neural representation of the absent limb. Conversely, amputees who wish to replace a lost limb must assimilate a neuroprosthetic with the existing neural representation. Whether we wish to remove a phantom limb or assimilate a synthetic one, we will benefit from knowing more about the developmental process that enables embodiment. A potentially critical contributor to that process is the spontaneous activity – in the form of limb twitches – that occurs exclusively and abundantly during active (REM) sleep, a particularly prominent state in early development.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30124-8?rss=yes</link>
	<content:encoded>To date, studies have demonstrated the dynamic influence of exogenous environmental stimuli on multiple regions of the brain. This environmental influence positively and negatively impacts programs governing myelination, and acts on myelinating oligodendrocyte (OL) cells across the human lifespan. Developmentally, environmental manipulation of OL progenitor cells (OPCs) has profound effects on the establishment of functional cognitive, sensory, and motor programs. Furthermore, central nervous system (CNS) myelin remains an adaptive entity in adulthood, sensitive to environmentally induced structural changes.</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;The dominantly inherited spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a large and diverse group of neurodegenerative diseases. The most prevalent SCAs (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6 and SCA7) are caused by expansion of a glutamine-encoding CAG repeat in the affected gene. These SCAs represent a substantial portion of &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emerging complexity of the transcriptional landscape poses great challenges to our conventional preconceptions of how the genome regulates brain function and dysfunction. Non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) confer a high level of intricate and dynamic regulation of various molecular processes in the CNS and they have &lt;/p&gt;
