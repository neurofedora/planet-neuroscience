Here we review advances in theory and experiments that highlight how noise correlations are implicated in perceptual processes. We focus on the structure of correlations and variations in it to reveal the computations performed by the cortex. We argue that to discover the functional role of correlations in cortical computations, and make predictions about them, we need to harness hierarchical encoding models. We propose that in hierarchical models the source of noise correlations is dual: inference of both task-related and higher-level perceptual variables contribute to their emergence, which is reflected in the task- and stimulus-dependence of the correlation structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: October 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 58&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Sander W Keemink, Christian K Machens&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A central tenet of neuroscience is that the brain works through large populations of interacting neurons. With recent advances in recording techniques, the inner working of these populations has come into full view. Analyzing the resulting large-scale data sets is challenging because of the often complex and ‘mixed’ dependency of neural activities on experimental parameters, such as stimuli, decisions, or motor responses. Here we review recent insights gained from analyzing these data with dimensionality reduction methods that ‘demix’ these dependencies. We demonstrate that the mappings from (carefully chosen) experimental parameters to population activities appear to be typical and stable across tasks, brain areas, and animals, and are often identifiable by linear methods. By considering when and why dimensionality reduction and demixing work well, we argue for a view of population coding in which populations represent (demixed) latent signals, corresponding to stimuli, decisions, motor responses, and so on. These latent signals are encoded into neural population activity via non-linear mappings and decoded via linear readouts. We explain how such a scheme can facilitate the propagation of information across cortical areas, and we review neural network architectures that can reproduce the encoding and decoding of latent signals in population activities. These architectures promise a link from the biophysics of single neurons to the activities of neural populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

When incorporated into reinforcement-based machine learning algorithms, visual novelty can act as an intrinsic reward signal that vastly increases the efficiency of exploration and expedites learning, particularly in situations where external rewards are difficult to obtain. Here we review parallels between recent developments in novelty-driven machine learning algorithms and our understanding of how visual novelty is computed and signaled in the primate brain. We propose that in the visual system, novelty representations are not configured with the principal goal of detecting novel objects, but rather with the broader goal of flexibly generalizing novelty information across different states in the service of driving novelty-based learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

The two domains have been typically treated in complete separation both in terms of the underlying computational mechanisms and the brain areas and processes implementing those computations. However, a number of recent findings in both domains call in question this strict separation. We interpret classical and more recent results in the general framework of probabilistic computation, provide a unifying view of how various aspects of the two domains are interlinked, and suggest how the probabilistic approach can also alleviate the problem of dealing with widely different types of neural correlates of learning. Finally, we outline several directions along which our proposed approach fosters new types of experiments that can promote investigations of natural learning in humans and other species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

This skill is important for a range of behaviours from navigating a new city to learning music and language. Classical approaches that investigate our ability to extract the principles of organisation that govern complex environments focus on reward-based learning. Yet, the human brain is shown to be expert at learning generative structure based on mere exposure and without explicit reward. Individuals are shown to adapt to–unbeknownst to them–changes in the environment’s temporal statistics and predict future events. Further, we present evidence for a common brain architecture for unsupervised structure learning and reward-based learning, suggesting that the brain is built on the premise that ‘learning is its own reward’ to support adaptive behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

Analysis of complex dynamical systems is also at the heart of control engineering, where it is central to the design of robust control strategies. Although a rich engineering literature has grown over decades to facilitate the analysis of such systems, little of it has percolated into neuroscience so far. Here, we give a brief introduction to a number of core control-theoretic concepts that provide useful perspectives on neural circuit dynamics. We introduce important mathematical tools related to these concepts, and establish connections to neural circuit analysis, focusing on a number of themes that have arisen from the modern ‘state-space’ view on neural population dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

Recent work has highlighted this state-dependent functional flexibility of cortical circuits and provided initial insights into underlying circuit-level mechanisms. Transitions from quiescent to aroused or task-engaged behavioral states are associated with common motifs of network activity, including changes in correlations and enhanced sensory encoding. Evidence points to a key role for selective activation of specific GABAergic interneuron populations in mediating mode-switching in cortical networks. Finally, inhibitory interneurons may function as a critical target for convergent state-dependent neuromodulatory sculpting of cortical circuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

Studies in head-fixed mice, where such tools can routinely be applied, begin to provide new insights into the neural code of primary visual cortex (V1) underlying visual perception, and the micro-circuits of attention, predictive processing, and learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

Recent experiments reveal that neuronal representations of learned sensorimotor tasks continually change over days and weeks, even after animals have achieved expert behavioral performance. How is learned information stored to allow consistent behavior despite ongoing changes in neuronal activity? What functions could ongoing reconfiguration serve? We highlight recent experimental evidence for such representational drift in sensorimotor systems, and discuss how this fits into a framework of distributed population codes. We identify recent theoretical work that suggests computational roles for drift and argue that the recurrent and distributed nature of sensorimotor representations permits drift while limiting disruptive effects. We propose that representational drift may create error signals between interconnected brain regions that can be used to keep neural codes consistent in the presence of continual change. These concepts suggest experimental and theoretical approaches to studying both learning and maintenance of distributed and adaptive population codes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

In models, the critical state offers a number of computational advantages. Thus this hypothesis, and in particular the experimental work by Beggs and Plenz (2003), has triggered an avalanche of research, with thousands of studies referring to it. Nonetheless, experimental results are still contradictory. How is it possible, that a hypothesis has attracted active research for decades, but nonetheless remains controversial? We discuss the experimental and conceptual controversy, and then present a parsimonious solution that (i) unifies the contradictory experimental results, (ii) avoids disadvantages of a critical state, and (iii) enables rapid, adaptive tuning of network properties to task requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

Here, we review emerging conceptual and technological advances that begin to address this challenge, garnering insights from both biological and artificial neural networks. We argue that neural data should be recorded during rich behavioral tasks, to model cognitive processes and estimate latent behavioral variables. Careful quantification of animal movements can also provide a more complete picture of how movements shape neural dynamics and reflect changes in brain state, such as arousal or stress. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) could serve as artificial model organisms to connect neural dynamics and rich behavioral data. ANNs have already begun to reveal how a wide range of different behaviors can be implemented, generating hypotheses about how observed neural activity might drive behavior and explaining diversity in behavioral strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

Once thought to play a housekeeping function of removing misfolded proteins or compromised organelles, neuronal autophagy is now regarded as a finely tuned, real time surveillance and clearance system crucial to synaptic integrity and function. Here we review the role of autophagy in synaptic plasticity and its regulation by epigenetic mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

Traditional theories of object recognition have focused on how crucial form features, for example, the orientation of edges, may be extracted in early visual cortex and utilized to recognize objects. An alternative view argues that much of early and mid-level visual processing focuses on encoding surface characteristics, for example, texture. Neurophysiological evidence from primate area V4 supports a third alternative — the joint, but independent, encoding of form and texture — that would be advantageous for segmenting objects from the background in natural scenes and for object recognition that is independent of surface texture. Future studies that leverage deep convolutional network models, especially focusing on network failures to match biology and behavior, can advance our insights into how such a joint representation of form and surface properties might emerge in visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

Do these choice-correlations reflect feedforward, feedback signalling, both, or neither? We highlight recent results of correlational and causal examinations of choice and choice-history signals in sensory, and in part sensorimotor, cortex and address formal statistical frameworks to infer causal interactions from data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

While the implied existence of a one-to-one mapping between external referents and neural firing has been useful, the prevalence of adaptation challenges this. Adaptation provides neural responses with dynamics on timescales that range from milliseconds up to many seconds. These timescales are highly relevant for sensory experience in the natural world, in which local statistical properties of inputs change continuously, and are additionally altered by active sensing. Adaptation has a number of consequences for coding: it creates short-term history dependence; it engenders complex feature selectivity that is time-varying; and it can serve to enhance information representation in dynamic environments. Considering how to best incorporate adaptation into neural models exposes a fundamental dichotomy in approaches to the description of neural systems: ones that take an explicitly ‘coding’ perspective versus ones that describe the system’s dynamics. Here we discuss the pros and cons of different approaches to the modeling of adaptive dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

Neural activity propagates within this network on a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. At the micro scale, neurophysiological recordings reveal coordinated dynamics in local neural populations, which support behaviorally relevant computations. At the macro scale, neuroimaging modalities measure global activity fluctuations organized into spatiotemporal patterns across the entire brain. Here we review recent advances linking the local and global scales of cortical dynamics and their relationship to behavior. We argue that diverse experimental observations on the dimensionality and variability of neural activity can be reconciled by considering how activity propagates in space and time on multiple spatial scales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

Despite their success, these models fall short to capture spike synchronization effects, to link to biophysical parameters and to describe finite-size fluctuations. In this opinion article, we propose that the refractory density method (RDM), also known as age-structured population dynamics or quasi-renewal theory, yields a powerful theoretical framework to build rate-based models for mesoscopic neural populations from realistic neuron dynamics at the microscopic level. We review recent advances achieved by the RDM to obtain efficient population density equations for networks of generalized integrate-and-fire (GIF) neurons — a class of neuron models that has been successfully fitted to various cell types. The theory not only predicts the nonstationary dynamics of large populations of neurons but also permits an extension to finite-size populations and a systematic reduction to low-dimensional rate dynamics. The new types of rate models will allow a re-examination of models of cortical computations under biological constraints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00471</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The inner ear houses the sensory epithelium responsible for vestibular and auditory function. The sensory epithelia are driven by pressure and vibration of the fluid filled structures in which they are embedded so that understanding the homeostatic mechanisms regulating fluid dynamics within these structures is critical to understanding function at the systems level. Additionally, there is a growing need for drug delivery to the inner ear for preventive and restorative treatments to the pathologies associated with hearing and balance dysfunction.  We compare drug delivery to neonatal and adult inner ear by injection into the posterior semicircular canal (PSCC) or through the round window membrane (RWM). PSCC injections produced higher levels of dye delivery within the cochlea than did RWM injections. Neonatal PSCC injections produced a gradient in dye distribution; however adult distributions were relatively uniform. RWM injections resulted in an early base to apex gradient that became more uniform over time, post injection. RWM injections lead to higher levels of dye distributions in the brain, likely demonstrating that injections can traverse the cochlea aqueduct. We hypothesize the relative position of the cochlear aqueduct between injection site and cochlea is instrumental in dictating dye distribution within the cochlea. Dye distribution is further compounded by the ability of some chemicals to cross inner ear membranes accessing the blood supply as demonstrated by the rapid distribution of gentamicin-conjugated Texas red (GTTR) throughout the body. These data allow for a direct evaluation of injection mode and age to compare strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches. PSCC injection delivers a more uniform and higher level of dye to the cochlea compared to RWM injection.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13443</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;What is motivation and how does it work? Where do goals come from and how do
they vary within and between species and individuals? Why do we prefer some
things over others? MEDO is a theoretical framework for understanding these
questions in abstract terms, as well as for generating and evaluating specific
hypotheses that seek to explain goal-oriented behavior. MEDO views preferences
as selective processes influencing the likelihood of particular outcomes, which
are more or less consistent with the dynamics underlying those influences. With
respect to biological organisms, these patterns must compete and cooperate in
shaping system evolution. To the extent that shaping processes are themselves
altered by experience, this enables feedback relationships where histories of
reward and punishment can impact future motivation. In this way, various biases
can undergo either amplification or attenuation, potentially resulting in
enduring preferences and orientations. MEDO is unique in that it specifically
models all shaping dynamics in terms of natural selection operating on multiple
levels--genetic, neural, and cultural--and even considers aspects of
development to themselves be evolutionary processes. Thus, MEDO reflects a kind
of generalized Darwinism, in that it assumes that natural selection provides a
common principle for understanding the emergence of complexity within all
dynamical systems in which replication, variation, and selection occur.
However, MEDO combines this evolutionary perspective with economic decision
theory, which describes both the preferences underlying individual choices, as
well as the preferences underlying choices made by engineers in designing
optimized systems. In this way, MEDO uses economic decision theory to explain
goal-oriented behaviors as well as the interacting evolutionary optimization
processes from which they emerge.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent Brain-Machine Interfaces have shifted towards miniature devices that
are constructed from nanoscale components. While these devices can be implanted
into the brain, their functionalities can be limited, and will require
communication and networking to enable cooperation. One form of communication
for neuron stimulation is the use of light. A number of considerations needs to
be taken into account for the propagation and this includes diffraction,
scattering, absorption, as well as attenuation. These properties are not only
affected by the medium, but also by the cell's geometric shape. These factor
affects both the direction and amplitude of the light wave. This paper analyzes
the propagation path loss and geometrical gain, channel impulse and frequency
response for light propagation along the neural tissue. The total attenuation
depends on the propagation medium loss and geometrical gain, and the channel
response is highly dependent on the quantity of cells along the path.
Additionally, the optical properties of the medium also impacts on the time
delay at the receiver and the width the location of the detectors. Based on the
numerical analysis, spherical cells attenuate approximately 20% of the
transmitted power, which is less than the fusiform and pyramidal cells (35% and
65%, respectively).

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Anxiety and depression are major public health concerns worldwide. Although genome-wide association studies have identified several genes robustly associated with susceptibility for these disorders, the molecular and cellular mechanisms associated with anxiety and depression is largely unknown. Reduction of microRNA-137 (miR-137) level has been implicated in the etiology of major depressive disorder. However, little is known about the in vivo impact of the loss of miR-137 on the biology of anxiety and depression. Here, we generated a forebrain-specific miR-137 knockout mouse line, and showed that miR-137 is critical for dendritic and synaptic growth in the forebrain. Mice with miR-137 loss-of-function exhibit anxiety-like behavior, and impaired spatial learning and memory. We then observe an elevated expression of EZH2 in the forebrain of miR-137 knockout mice, and provide direct evidence that knockdown of EZH2 can rescue anxious phenotypes associated with the loss of miR-137. Together our results suggest that loss of miR-137 contributes to the etiology of anxiety, and EZH2 might be a potential therapeutic target for anxiety and depressive phenotypes associated with the dysfunction of miR-137.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Retinoic acid (RA) is the active metabolite of vitamin A but is also used as a medication, primarily for acne in which the treatment regime lasts several months. A number of studies have indicated that treatment with RA over this time period impacts the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and may contribute to a number of the side-effects of the drug. No studies though have investigated the short-term, early effects RA may have on the HPA axis via the transcriptional pathways activated by the RA receptor. This study investigated the action of RA over 3 days on regulatory components of the HPA axis. Several key genes involved in glucocorticoid feedback pathways in the hippocampus, hypothalamus and pituitary were unchanged after 3-days exposure to RA. Key elements though in the adrenal gland involved in corticosterone and aldosterone synthesis were altered in particular with the Cyp11b2 gene downregulated in vivo and ex vivo. The rapid, 5 h, change in Cyp11b2 expression suggested this activation may be direct. These results highlight the adrenal gland as a target of short-term action of RA and potentially a trigger component in the mechanisms by which the long-term adverse effects of RA treatment occur.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Accelerated Intermittent Theta-Burst Stimulation as a Treatment for Cocaine Use Disorder: A Proof-of-Concept Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01147</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There are no effective treatments for cocaine use disorder (CUD), a chronic, relapsing brain disease characterized by dysregulated circuits related to cue reactivity, reward processing, response inhibition, and executive control. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has the potential to modulate circuits and networks implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders, including addiction. Although acute applications of TMS have reduced craving in urine-negative cocaine users, the tolerability and safety of administering accelerated TMS to cocaine-positive individuals is unknown. As such, we performed a proof-of-concept study employing an intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) protocol in an actively cocaine-using sample. Although our main goal was to assess the tolerability and safety of administering three iTBS sessions daily, we also hypothesized that iTBS would reduce cocaine use in this non-treatment seeking cohort. We recruited 19 individuals with CUD to receive three open-label iTBS sessions per day, with approximately a 60-min interval between sessions, for 10 days over a 2-week period (30 total iTBS sessions). iTBS was delivered to left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) with neuronavigation guidance. Compliance and safety were assessed throughout the trial. Cocaine use behavior was assessed before, during, and after the intervention and at 1- and 4-week follow-up visits. Of the 335 iTBS sessions applied, 73% were performed on participants with cocaine-positive urine tests. Nine of the 14 participants who initiated treatment received at least 26 of 30 iTBS sessions and returned for the 4-week follow-up visit. These individuals reduced their weekly cocaine consumption by 78% in amount of dollars spent and 70% in days of use relative to pre-iTBS cocaine use patterns. Similarly, individuals reduced their weekly consumption of nicotine, alcohol, and THC, suggesting iTBS modulated a common circuit across drugs of abuse. iTBS was well-tolerated, despite the expected occasional headaches. A single participant developed a transient neurological event of uncertain etiology on iTBS day 9 and cocaine-induced psychosis 2 weeks after discontinuation. It thus appears that accelerated iTBS to left dlPFC administered in active, chronic cocaine users is both feasible and tolerable in actively using cocaine participants with preliminary indications of efficacy in reducing both the amount and frequency of cocaine (and other off target drug) use. The neural underpinnings of these behavioral changes could help in the future development of effective treatment of CUD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Dietary Supplementation With the Ketogenic Diet Metabolite Beta-Hydroxybutyrate Ameliorates Post-TBI Aggression in Young-Adult Male Drosophila</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01140</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI), caused by repeated concussive head trauma can induce chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a neurodegenerative disease featuring behavioral symptoms ranging from cognitive deficits to elevated aggression. In a Drosophila model, we used a high-impact trauma device (Katzenberger et al., 2013, 2015) to induce TBI-like symptoms and to study post-TBI behavioral outcomes. Following TBI, aggression in banged male flies was significantly elevated as compared with that in unbanged flies. These increases in aggressive behavior were not the result of basal motility changes, as measured by a negative geotaxis assay. In addition, the increase in post-TBI aggression appeared to be specific to concussive trauma: neither cold exposure nor electric shock—two alternate types of trauma—significantly elevated aggressive behavior in male-male pairs. Various forms of dietary therapy, especially the high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (KD), have recently been explored for a wide variety of neuropathies. We thus hypothesized that putatively neuroprotective dietary interventions might be able to suppress post-traumatic elevations in aggressive behavior in animals subjected to head-trauma-inducing strikes, or “bangs”. We supplemented a normal high-carbohydrate Drosophila diet with the KD metabolite beta-hydroxybutyrate (β-HB)—a ketone body (KB). Banged flies raised on a KB-supplemented diet exhibited a marked reduction in aggression, whereas aggression in unbanged flies was equivalent whether dieted with KB supplements or not. Pharmacological blockade of the ATP-sensitive potassium (K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt;) channel abrogated KB effects reducing post-TBI aggression while pharmacological activation mimicked them, suggesting a mechanism by which KBs act in this model. KBs did not significantly extend lifespan in banged flies, but markedly extended lifespan in unbanged flies. We have thus developed a functional model for the study of post-TBI elevations of aggression. Further, we conclude that dietary interventions may be a fruitful avenue for further exploration of treatments for TBI- and CTE-related cognitive-behavioral symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Challenge for Affective Brain-Computer Interfaces: Non-stationary Spatio-spectral EEG Oscillations of Emotional Responses</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00366</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based affective brain-computer interfaces (aBCIs) have been attracting ever-growing interest and research resources. Whereas most previous neuroscience studies have focused on single-day/-session recording and sensor-level analysis, less effort has been invested in assessing the fundamental nature of non-stationary EEG oscillations underlying emotional responses across days and individuals. This work thus aimed to use a data-driven blind source separation method, i.e., independent component analysis (ICA), to derive emotion-relevant spatio-spectral EEG source oscillations and assess the extent of non-stationarity. To this end, this work conducted an 8-day music-listening experiment (i.e., roughly interspaced over 2 months) and recorded whole-scalp 30-ch EEG data from 10 subjects. Given the large size of the data (i.e., from 80 sessions), results indicated that EEG non-stationarity was clearly revealed in the numbers and locations of brain sources of interest as well as their spectral modulation to the emotional responses. Less than half of subjects (two to four) showed the same relatively day-stationary (source reproducibility &amp;gt;6 days) spatio-spectral tendency towards one of the binary valence and arousal states. This work substantially advances the previous work by exploiting intra- and inter-individual EEG variability in an ecological multiday scenario. Such EEG non-stationarity may inevitably present a great challenge for the development of an accurate, robust, and generalized emotion-classification model.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Two Neural Circuits to Point Towards Home Position After Passive Body Displacements</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00070</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A challenge in motor control research is to understand the mechanisms underlying the transformation of sensory information into arm motor commands. Here, we investigated these transformation mechanisms for movements whose targets were defined by information issued from body rotations in the dark (i.e., idiothetic information). Immediately after being rotated, participants reproduced the amplitude of their perceived rotation using their arm (Experiment 1). The cortical activation during movement planning was analyzed using electroencephalography and source analyses. Task-related activities were found in regions of interest (ROIs) located in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), dorsal premotor cortex, dorsal region of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the sensorimotor cortex. Importantly, critical regions for the cognitive encoding of space did not show significant task-related activities. These results suggest that arm movements were planned using a sensorimotor-type of spatial representation. However, when a 8 s delay was introduced between body rotation and the arm movement (Experiment 2), we found that areas involved in the cognitive encoding of space [e.g., ventral premotor cortex (vPM), rostral ACC, inferior and superior posterior parietal cortex (PPC)] showed task-related activities. Overall, our results suggest that the use of a cognitive-type of representation for planning arm movement after body motion is necessary when relevant spatial information must be stored before triggering the movement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: A Biologically-Inspired Model to Predict Perceived Visual Speed as a Function of the Stimulated Portion of the Visual Field</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00068</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spatial orientation relies on a representation of the position and orientation of the body relative to the surrounding environment. When navigating in the environment, this representation must be constantly updated taking into account the direction, speed, and amplitude of body motion. Visual information plays an important role in this updating process, notably via optical flow. Here, we systematically investigated how the size and the simulated portion of the field of view (FoV) affect perceived visual speed of human observers. We propose a computational model to account for the patterns of human data. This model is composed of hierarchical cells' layers that model the neural processing stages of the dorsal visual pathway. Specifically, we consider that the activity of the MT area is processed by populations of modeled MST cells that are sensitive to the differential components of the optical flow, thus producing selectivity for specific patterns of optical flow. Our results indicate that the proposed computational model is able to describe the experimental evidence and it could be used to predict expected biases of speed perception for conditions in which only some portions of the visual field are visible.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Associations Between Cognitive Functions and Physical Frailty in Patients With Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00283</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease manifested by both motor and non-motor dysfunctions and co-existence of cognitive impairment and physical frailty is common. Given that research in this area is limited, a better understanding of associated factors with physical frailty could provide a focused screening method and facilitate early intervention in PD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Seventy-six patients with idiopathic PD were recruited and Fried’s criteria of physical frailty were used to group all participants. Comprehensive cognitive tests and clinical characteristics were measured, and univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to explore the relationship between clinical factors or neuropsychological functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Twenty-nine patients with PD (38%) exhibited physical frailty. Compared to PD patients without frailty, PD patients with frailty were older in age and demonstrated worse disease severity and poorer cognitive functions, including attention, executive function, memory, speech and language, and visuospatial function (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Further, stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that disease severity by the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) total score (OR: 1.065; 95% CI: 1.033–1.099) and executive function (OR: 0.724; 95% CI: 0.581–0.877) were independent risk factors for predicting physical frailty (p = 0.003 and 0.002). The best cut-off points are 46 in UPDRS (sensitivity: 62.1%; specificity: 91.5%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Executive function impairment is an independent risk factor for the development of physical frailty with disease progression. Awareness of such comorbidity might provide a screening tool to facilitate investigation in their underlying etiology and early intervention for frailty prevention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/50663</link>
	<content:encoded>Even though pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is associated with fibrotic stroma, the molecular pathways regulating the formation of cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are not well elucidated. An epigenomic analysis of patient-derived and &lt;i&gt;de-novo&lt;/i&gt; generated CAFs demonstrated widespread loss of cytosine methylation that was associated with overexpression of various inflammatory transcripts including &lt;i&gt;CXCR4&lt;/i&gt;. Co-culture of neoplastic cells with CAFs led to increased invasiveness that was abrogated by inhibition of CX&lt;i&gt;CR4&lt;/i&gt;. Metabolite tracing revealed that lactate produced by neoplastic cells leads to increased production of alpha-ketoglutarate (aKG) within mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). In turn, aKG mediated activation of the demethylase TET enzyme led to decreased cytosine methylation and increased hydroxymethylation during &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; differentiation of MSCs to CAF. Co-injection of neoplastic cells with TET-deficient MSCs inhibited tumor growth &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Thus, in PDAC, a tumor-mediated lactate flux is associated with widespread epigenomic reprogramming that is seen during CAF formation.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/50416</link>
	<content:encoded>Mutations that activate LRRK2 protein kinase cause Parkinson's disease. LRRK2 phosphorylates a subset of Rab GTPases within their Switch-II motif controlling interaction with effectors. An siRNA screen of all human protein phosphatases revealed that a poorly studied protein phosphatase, PPM1H, counteracts LRRK2 signaling by specifically dephosphorylating Rab proteins. PPM1H knockout increased endogenous Rab phosphorylation and inhibited Rab dephosphorylation in human A549 cells. Overexpression of PPM1H suppressed LRRK2-mediated Rab phosphorylation. PPM1H also efficiently and directly dephosphorylated Rab8A in biochemical studies. A 'substrate-trapping' PPM1H mutant (Asp288Ala) binds with high affinity to endogenous, LRRK2-phosphorylated Rab proteins, thereby blocking dephosphorylation seen upon addition of LRRK2 inhibitors. PPM1H is localized to the Golgi and its knockdown suppresses primary cilia formation, similar to pathogenic LRRK2. Thus, PPM1H acts as a key modulator of LRRK2 signaling by controlling dephosphorylation of Rab proteins. PPM1H activity enhancers could offer a new therapeutic approach to prevent or treat Parkinson's disease.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: A proline-rich motif on VGLUT1 reduces synaptic vesicle super-pool and spontaneous release frequency</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/50401</link>
	<content:encoded>Glutamate secretion at excitatory synapses is tightly regulated to allow for the precise tuning of synaptic strength. Vesicular Glutamate Transporters (VGLUT) accumulate glutamate into synaptic vesicles (SV) and thereby regulate quantal size. Further, the number of release sites and the release probability of SVs maybe regulated by the organization of active zone proteins and SV clusters. In the present work, we uncover a mechanism mediating an increased SV clustering through the interaction of VGLUT1 second proline-rich domain, endophilinA1 and intersectin1. This strengthening of SV clusters results in a combined reduction of axonal SV super-pool size and miniature excitatory events frequency. Our findings support a model in which clustered vesicles are held together through multiple weak interactions between Src homology 3 and proline-rich domains of synaptic proteins. In mammals, VGLUT1 gained a proline-rich sequence that recruits endophilinA1 and turns the transporter into a regulator of SV organization and spontaneous release.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/49953</link>
	<content:encoded>The voltage-gated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel Kv2.1 serves a major structural role in the soma and proximal dendrites of mammalian brain neurons, tethering the plasma membrane (PM) to endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Although Kv2.1 clustering at neuronal ER-PM junctions (EPJs) is tightly regulated and highly conserved, its function remains unclear. By identifying and evaluating proteins in close spatial proximity to Kv2.1-containing EPJs, we discovered that a significant role of Kv2.1 at EPJs is to promote the clustering and functional coupling of PM L-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels (LTCCs) to ryanodine receptor (RyR) ER Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release channels. Kv2.1 clustering also unexpectedly enhanced LTCC opening at polarized membrane potentials. This enabled Kv2.1-LTCC-RyR triads to generate localized Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release events (&lt;i&gt;i.e.&lt;/i&gt;, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sparks) independently of action potentials. Together, these findings uncover a novel mode of LTCC regulation and establish a unique mechanism whereby Kv2.1-associated EPJs provide a molecular platform for localized somatodendritic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals in mammalian brain neurons.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/49910</link>
	<content:encoded>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affects 1.5-3.0 million people in the United States. IBD is genetically determined and many common risk alleles have been identified. Yet, a large proportion of genetic predisposition remains unexplained. In this study we report the identification of an ultrarare missense variant (NM_006998.3:c.230G&amp;gt;A;p.Arg77His) in the &lt;i&gt;SCGN&lt;/i&gt; gene causing Mendelian early-onset ulcerative colitis. &lt;i&gt;SCGN&lt;/i&gt; encodes a calcium sensor that is exclusively expressed in neuroendocrine lineages, including enteroendocrine cells and gut neurons. SCGN interacts with the SNARE complex, which is required for vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. We show that the &lt;i&gt;SCGN&lt;/i&gt; mutation identified impacted the localization of the SNARE complex partner, SNAP25, leading to impaired hormone release. Finally, we show that mouse models of &lt;i&gt;Scgn&lt;/i&gt; deficiency recapitulate impaired hormone release and susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis. Altogether, these studies demonstrate that functional deficiency in SCGN can result in intestinal inflammation and implicates the neuroendocrine cellular compartment in IBD.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: One-step efficient generation of dual-function conditional knockout and geno-tagging alleles in zebrafish</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/48081</link>
	<content:encoded>CRISPR/Cas systems are widely used to knockout genes by inducing indel mutations, which are prone to genetic compensation. Complex genome modifications such as knockin (KI) might bypass compensation, though difficult to practice due to low efficiency. Moreover, no 'two-in-one' KI strategy combining conditional knockout (CKO) with fluorescent gene-labeling or further allele-labeling has been reported. Here, we developed a dual-cassette-donor strategy and achieved one-step and efficient generation of dual-function KI alleles at &lt;i&gt;tbx5a&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;kctd10&lt;/i&gt; loci in zebrafish &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; targeted insertion. These alleles display fluorescent gene-tagging and CKO effects before and after Cre induction, respectively. By introducing a second fluorescent reporter, geno-tagging effects were achieved at &lt;i&gt;tbx5a&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;i&gt; sox10&lt;/i&gt; loci, exhibiting CKO coupled with fluorescent reporter switch upon Cre induction, enabling tracing of three distinct genotypes. We found that LiCl purification of gRNA is critical for highly efficient KI, and preselection of founders allows the efficient germline recovery of KI events.</content:encoded>

A custom microscope allowed us to image the soma and up to 300 μm of contiguous dendrite at 15 Hz, while resolving individual spines. New analysis methods were used to estimate the frequency and spatial scales of activity in dendritic branches and spines. The majority of dendritic calcium transients were coincident with global events. However, task-associated calcium signals in dendrites and spines were compartmentalized by dendritic branching and clustered within branches over approximately 10 μm. Diverse behavior-related signals were intermingled and distributed throughout the dendritic arbor, potentially supporting a large learning capacity in individual neurons.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The autosomal dominant neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL) &lt;i&gt;CLN4&lt;/i&gt; is caused by mutations in the synaptic vesicle (SV) protein CSPα. We developed animal models of &lt;i&gt;CLN4&lt;/i&gt; by expressing &lt;i&gt;CLN4&lt;/i&gt; mutant human CSPα (hCSPα) in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; neurons. Similar to patients, &lt;i&gt;CLN4&lt;/i&gt; mutations induced excessive oligomerization of hCSPα and premature lethality in a dose-dependent manner. Instead of being localized to SVs, most &lt;i&gt;CLN4&lt;/i&gt; mutant hCSPα accumulated abnormally, and co-localized with ubiquitinated proteins and the prelysosomal markers HRS and LAMP1. Ultrastructural examination revealed frequent abnormal membrane structures in axons and neuronal somata. The lethality, oligomerization and prelysosomal accumulation induced by &lt;i&gt;CLN4&lt;/i&gt; mutations was attenuated by reducing endogenous wild type (WT) dCSP levels and enhanced by increasing WT levels. Furthermore, reducing the gene dosage of Hsc70 also attenuated &lt;i&gt;CLN4&lt;/i&gt; phenotypes. Taken together, we suggest that &lt;i&gt;CLN4&lt;/i&gt; alleles resemble dominant hypermorphic gain of function mutations that drive excessive oligomerization and impair membrane trafficking.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/45789</link>
	<content:encoded>Supramolecular signaling assemblies are of interest for their unique signaling properties. A µm scale signaling assembly, the central supramolecular signaling cluster (cSMAC), forms at the center of the interface of T cells activated by antigen-presenting cells. We have determined that it is composed of multiple complexes of a supramolecular volume of up to 0.5 µm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and associated with extensive membrane undulations. To determine cSMAC function, we have systematically manipulated the localization of three adaptor proteins, LAT, SLP-76, and Grb2. cSMAC localization varied between the adaptors and was diminished upon blockade of the costimulatory receptor CD28 and deficiency of the signal amplifying kinase Itk. Reconstitution of cSMAC localization restored IL-2 secretion which is a key T cell effector function as dependent on reconstitution dynamics. Our data suggest that the cSMAC enhances early signaling by facilitating signaling interactions and attenuates signaling thereafter through sequestration of a more limited set of signaling intermediates.</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Identifying parabrachial neurons selectively regulating satiety for highly palatable food in mice</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0252-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Food consumption is necessary for organisms to maintain metabolic homeostasis. Both extrinsic and intrinsic processes, relayed via intricate neural circuitry, orchestrate the initiation and termination of food intake. More specifically, there are functionally distinct neural circuits that mediate either homeostatic or hedonic suppression of feeding. Notably, being satiated is a positive feeling whereas food aversion is a negative feeling. While significant progress has been made toward elucidating neural circuitry underlying aversive appetite suppression in mice, the circuitry underlying homeostatic satiety is not fully understood. The lateral parabrachial nucleus (PB&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) is known as a node that regulates various sensory and visceral processes. Here we identified and selectively labeled neurons in the caudal lateral region of PB&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; (PB&lt;sub&gt;cl&lt;/sub&gt;) that are activated by consumption of condensed milk, chocolate Ensure or peanut butter, which we refer to as PB&lt;sub&gt;cl&lt;/sub&gt;-palatable-food activated neurons (PANs). Specific optogenetic activation of PANs induced positive place preference but decreased the consumption of high-caloric foods such as condensed milk, whereas silencing these cells significantly increased condensed milk consumption in feeding assays. Thus, the PB&lt;sub&gt;cl&lt;/sub&gt; PANs revealed here represent a novel neural substrate regulating caloric-sufficiency mediated satiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The lateral parabrachial nucleus (PB&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) is a critical for regulating somatic and visceral processes including thermoregulation, taste preference, thirst, and appetite. Recent work on satiety-promoting circuits has implicated the PB&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; as an important node. Previous studies identified the PB&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Global vs. Network-Specific Regulations as the Source of Intrinsic Coactivations in Resting-State Networks</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00065</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spontaneous neural activities are endowed with specific patterning characterized by synchronizations within functionally relevant distant regions that are termed as resting-state networks (RSNs). Although the mechanisms that organize the large-scale neural systems are still largely unknown, recent studies have proposed a hypothesis that network-specific coactivations indeed emerge as the result of globally propagating neural activities with specific paths of transmission. However, the extent to which such a centralized global regulation, rather than network-specific control, contributes to the RSN synchronization remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated the contribution from each mechanism by directly identifying the global as well as local component of resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data provided by human connectome project, using temporal independent component analysis (ICA). Based on the spatial distribution pattern, each ICA component was classified as global or local. Time lag mapping of each IC revealed several paths of global or semi-global propagations that are partially overlapping yet spatially distinct to each other. Consistent with previous studies, the time lag of global oscillation, although being less spatially homogenous than what was assumed to be, contributed to the RSN synchronization. However, an equivalent contribution was also shown on the part of the more locally confined activities that are independent to each other. While allowing the view that network-specific coactivation occurs as part of the sequences of global neural activities, these results further confirm an equally important role of the network-specific regulation for its coactivation, regardless of whether vascular artifacts contaminate the global component in fMRI measures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: State-Dependent Entrainment of Prefrontal Cortex Local Field Potential Activity Following Patterned Stimulation of the Cerebellar Vermis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00060</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The cerebellum is involved in sensorimotor, cognitive, and emotional functions through cerebello-cerebral connectivity. Cerebellar neurostimulation thus likely affects cortical circuits, as has been shown in studies using cerebellar stimulation to treat neurological disorders through modulation of frontal EEG oscillations. Here we studied the effects of different frequencies of cerebellar stimulation on oscillations and coherence in the cerebellum and prefrontal cortex in the urethane-anesthetized rat. Local field potentials were recorded in the right lateral cerebellum (Crus I/II) and bilaterally in the prefrontal cortex (frontal association area, FrA) in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Stimulation was delivered to the cerebellar vermis (lobule VII) using single pulses (0.2 Hz for 60 s), or repeated pulses at 1 Hz (30 s), 5 Hz (10 s), 25 Hz (2 s), and 50 Hz (1 s). Effects of stimulation were influenced by the initial state of EEG activity which varies over time during urethane-anesthesia; 1 Hz stimulation was more effective when delivered during the slow-wave state (Stage 1), while stimulation with single-pulse, 25, and 50 Hz showed stronger effects during the activated state (Stage 2). Single-pulses resulted in increases in oscillatory power in the delta and theta bands for the cerebellum, and in frequencies up to 80 Hz in cortical sites. 1 Hz stimulation induced a decrease in 0–30 Hz activity and increased activity in the 30–200 Hz range, in the right FrA. 5 Hz stimulation reduced power in high frequencies in Stage 1 and induced mixed effects during Stage 2.25 Hz stimulation increased cortical power at low frequencies during Stage 2, and increased power in higher frequency bands during Stage 1. Stimulation at 50 Hz increased delta-band power in all recording sites, with the strongest and most rapid effects in the cerebellum. 25 and 50 Hz stimulation also induced state-dependent effects on cerebello-cortical and cortico-cortical coherence at high frequencies. Cerebellar stimulation can therefore entrain field potential activity in the FrA and drive synchronization of cerebello-cortical and cortico-cortical networks in a frequency-dependent manner. These effects highlight the role of the cerebellar vermis in modulating large-scale synchronization of neural networks in non-motor frontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The resting condition involved showing a black screen, the control condition, a mosaic patterned static videoclip; the static condition, a static videoclip of wrist flexion 0°; and the dynamic condition, a videoclip that corresponded to each participant’s closely-matched illusory wrist flexion angle and speed by vibration. Vibratory stimulation (frequency 80 Hz and duration 4 s) was applied to the distal tendon of the dominant right extensor carpi radialis (ECR) using a tendon vibrator in the control, static, and dynamic conditions. Four seconds after the vibratory stimulation (end of vibration), the primary motor cortex at the midpoint between the centers of gravity of the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) and ECR muscles was stimulated by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The ECR motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes significantly increased in the control condition compared to the resting condition, whereas the FCR MEP amplitudes did not change between the resting and control conditions. In addition, the ECR MEP amplitudes significantly increased in the static condition compared to the dynamic condition. However, the FCR MEP amplitudes significantly increased in the dynamic condition compared to the static condition. These results imply that the difference between visuo-proprioceptive information had an effect on corticospinal excitability for the muscle. In conclusion, we found that proprioceptive and visual information differentially altered the corticospinal excitability of reciprocal muscles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurogenesis section | New and Recent Articles: BAF45D Downregulation in Spinal Cord Ependymal Cells Following Spinal Cord Injury in Adult Rats and Its Potential Role in the Development of Neuronal Lesions</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01151</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The endogenous spinal cord ependymal cells (SCECs), which form the central canal (CC), are critically involved in proliferation, differentiation and migration after spinal cord injury (SCI) and represents a repair cell source in treating SCI. Previously, we reported that BAF45D is expressed in the SCECs and the spinal cord neurons in adult mice and knockdown of BAF45D fail to induce expression of PAX6, a neurogenic fate determinant, during early neural differentiation of human embryonic stem cells. However, the effects of SCI on expression of BAF45D have not been reported. The aim of this study is to explore the expression and potential role of BAF45D in rat SCI model. In this study, adult rats were randomly divided into intact, sham, and SCI groups. We first explored expression of BAF45D in the SCECs in intact adult rats. We then explored SCI-induced loss of motor neurons and lesion of neurites in the anterior horns induced by the SCI. We also investigated whether the SCI-induced lesions in SCECs are accompanied by the motor neuron lesions. Finally, we examined the effect of BAF45D knockdown on cell growth in neuro2a cells. Our data showed that BAF45D is expressed in SCECs, neurons, and oligodendrocytes but not astrocytes in the spinal cords of intact adult rats. After SCI, the structure of CC was disrupted and the BAF45D-positive SCEC-derivatives were decreased. During the early stages of SCI, when shape of CC was affected but there was no disruption in circular structure of the SCECs, it was evident that there was a significant reduction in the number of neurites and motor neurons in the anterior horns compared with those of intact rats. In comparison, a complete loss of SCECs accompanied by further loss of motor neurons but not neurites was observed at the later stage. BAF45D knockdown was also found to inhibit cell growth in neuro2a cells. These results highlight the decreased expression of BAF45D in SCI-injured SCECs and the potential role of BAF45D downregulation in development of neuronal lesion after SCI in adult rats.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: The Delta-Subunit Selective GABAA Receptor Modulator, DS2, Improves Stroke Recovery via an Anti-inflammatory Mechanism</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01133</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Inflammatory processes are known to contribute to tissue damage in the central nervous system (CNS) across a broad range of neurological conditions, including stroke. Gamma amino butyric acid (GABA), the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS, has been implicated in modulating peripheral immune responses by acting on GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors on antigen-presenting cells and lymphocytes. Here, we investigated the effects and mechanism of action of the delta-selective compound, DS2, to improve stroke recovery and modulate inflammation. We report a decrease in nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation in innate immune cells over a concentration range in vitro. Following a photochemically induced motor cortex stroke, treatment with DS2 at 0.1 mg/kg from 1 h post-stroke significantly decreased circulating tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-17, and IL-6 levels, reduced infarct size and improved motor function in mice. Free brain concentrations of DS2 were found to be lower than needed for robust modulation of central GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors and were not affected by the presence and absence of elacridar, an inhibitor of both P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Finally, as DS2 appears to dampen peripheral immune activation and only shows limited brain exposure, we assessed the role of DS2 to promote functional recovery after stroke when administered from 3-days after the stroke. Treatment with DS2 from 3-days post-stroke improved motor function on the grid-walking, but not on the cylinder task. These data highlight the need to further develop subunit-selective compounds to better understand change in GABA receptor signaling pathways both centrally and peripherally. Importantly, we show that GABA compounds such as DS2 that only shows limited brain exposure can still afford significant protection and promote functional recovery most likely via modulation of peripheral immune cells and could be given as an adjunct treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Network Representations of Facial and Bodily Expressions: Evidence From Multivariate Connectivity Pattern Classification</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01111</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Emotions can be perceived from both facial and bodily expressions. Our previous study has found the successful decoding of facial expressions based on the functional connectivity (FC) patterns. However, the role of the FC patterns in the recognition of bodily expressions remained unclear, and no neuroimaging studies have adequately addressed the question of whether emotions perceiving from facial and bodily expressions are processed rely upon common or different neural networks. To address this, the present study collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from a block design experiment with facial and bodily expression videos as stimuli (three emotions: anger, fear, and joy), and conducted multivariate pattern classification analysis based on the estimated FC patterns. We found that in addition to the facial expressions, bodily expressions could also be successfully decoded based on the large-scale FC patterns. The emotion classification accuracies for the facial expressions were higher than that for the bodily expressions. Further contributive FC analysis showed that emotion-discriminative networks were widely distributed in both hemispheres, containing regions that ranged from primary visual areas to higher-level cognitive areas. Moreover, for a particular emotion, discriminative FCs for facial and bodily expressions were distinct. Together, our findings highlight the key role of the FC patterns in the emotion processing, indicating how large-scale FC patterns reconfigure in processing of facial and bodily expressions, and suggest the distributed neural representation for the emotion recognition. Furthermore, our results also suggest that the human brain employs separate network representations for facial and bodily expressions of the same emotions. This study provides new evidence for the network representations for emotion perception and may further our understanding of the potential mechanisms underlying body language emotion recognition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00384</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Diet and nutrition play a key role in the promotion and maintenance of good health, as they are important modifiable risk factors for chronic diseases. A growing number of studies indicate that optimal food intake and optimal physical activity are essential for the gray matter volume (GMV). However, the precise definition of “optimal” is extremely difficult and a topic of several studies. In the current research, we used the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based normalized GMV (nGMV), for monitoring brain conditions based on GMV. By analyzing the relationship between the nGMV of 171 healthy Japanese participants and the results of a brief self-administered diet history questionnaire (BDHQ), we found that while nGMV was high in the participants with high intake of milk and yogurt, it was low in the participants of “alcohol and animal foods dietary pattern” (high intake of alcohol and animal foods). On the other hand, another food pattern “vegetable-animal balanced dietary pattern” (balanced intake of vegetables and animal foods) has no significant association with nGMV, indicating that although a diet consisting of a good balance of vegetables and animal foods may not lead to brain atrophy, it might not positively contribute to a higher nGMV. nGMV, as an objective measure of the association between food intake and the brain, might provide useful information for “optimal” food intake for GMV.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Post-error slowing (PES) is an established performance monitoring readout. Several previous studies have found that PES is reduced in children and adolescents with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We analyzed reaction time data, along with electroencephalography (EEG) data, from a response priming experiment in children and adolescents with ADHD (N = 28) and typically developing (TD) controls (N = 15) between 10 and 17 years of age. We report dynamic reaction time changes before and after errors: whereas TD controls readjusted their response speed to their individual average speed after committing an error, this reaction time adjustment appeared to be delayed and decreased in ADHD patients. In the EEG, error trials were accompanied by increased frontal midline theta activity, which was attenuated in ADHD compared to TD. We conclude that PES has a different time course rather than being fully absent in ADHD and discuss relationships with our EEG findings and potential implications for performance monitoring in ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Age-Related Differences in Functional and Structural Connectivity in the Spatial Navigation Brain Network</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00069</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spatial navigation involves multiple cognitive processes including multisensory integration, visuospatial coding, memory, and decision-making. These functions are mediated by the interplay of cerebral structures that can be broadly separated into a posterior network (subserving visual and spatial processing) and an anterior network (dedicated to memory and navigation planning). Within these networks, areas such as the hippocampus (HC) are known to be affected by aging and to be associated with cognitive decline and navigation impairments. However, age-related changes in brain connectivity within the spatial navigation network remain to be investigated. For this purpose, we performed a neuroimaging study combining functional and structural connectivity analyses between cerebral regions involved in spatial navigation. Nineteen young (μ = 27 years, σ = 4.3; 10 F) and 22 older (μ = 73 years, σ = 4.1; 10 F) participants were examined in this study. Our analyses focused on the parahippocampal place area (PPA), the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), the occipital place area (OPA), and the projections into the visual cortex of central and peripheral visual fields, delineated from independent functional localizers. In addition, we segmented the HC and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) from anatomical images. Our results show an age-related decrease in functional connectivity between low-visual areas and the HC, associated with an increase in functional connectivity between OPA and PPA in older participants compared to young subjects. Concerning the structural connectivity, we found age-related differences in white matter integrity within the navigation brain network, with the exception of the OPA. The OPA is known to be involved in egocentric navigation, as opposed to allocentric strategies which are more related to the hippocampal region. The increase in functional connectivity between the OPA and PPA may thus reflect a compensatory mechanism for the age-related alterations around the HC, favoring the use of the preserved structural network mediating egocentric navigation. Overall, these findings on age-related differences of functional and structural connectivity may help to elucidate the cerebral bases of spatial navigation deficits in healthy and pathological aging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Processing Bodies Oscillate in Neuro 2A Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00487</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Circadian rhythms are biological variables that oscillate with periods close to 24 h that are generated internally by biological clocks. Depending on the tissue/cell type, about 5–20% of genes are expressed rhythmically. Unexpectedly, the correlation between the oscillations of messengers and the proteins they encode is low. We hypothesize that these discrepancies could be because in certain phases of the circadian cycle some messengers could be translationally silenced and stored. Processing bodies (PBs) are membraneless organelles formed by ribonucleoprotein aggregates located in the cytoplasm. They contain silenced messengers and factors involved in mRNA processing. A previous work showed that the number of cells containing these mRNA granules varies when comparing two time-points in U2OS cell cultures and that these differences disappear when an essential clock gene is silenced. Here we evaluate whether PBs oscillate in Neuro2A cells. We analyzed in cell cultures synchronized with dexamethasone the variations in the number, the signal intensity of the markers used (GE-1/HEDLS and DDX6), and the area of PBs between 8 and 68 h post-synchronization. All three parameters oscillated with periods compatible with a circadian regulated process. The most robust rhythm was the number of PBs. These rhythms could be generated by oscillations in proteins that have been involved in the nucleation of these foci such as LSM1, TTP, and BRF1. The described phenomenon would allow to explain the differences observed in the temporal profiles of some messengers and their proteins and to understand how circadian clocks can control post-transcriptionally cellular functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurotrophins activate Trk receptor signaling to support neuronal survival and many aspects of neuronal function. Early studies demonstrated that TrkA formed a complex with the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt;), which increased the affinity and selectivity of NGF binding, however, whether interaction of p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt; with other Trk receptors performs a similar function to enhance ligand binding has not been demonstrated. We investigated the interaction of TrkB with full length p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt; in hippocampal neurons in response to BDNF and found that the association of these receptors occurs after ligand binding and requires phosphorylation of TrkB, indicating that formation of this receptor complex was not necessary for ligand binding. Moreover, the interaction of these receptors required internalization and localization to early endosomes. We found that association of TrkB with p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt; was necessary for optimal downstream signaling of the PI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;K-Akt pathway, but not the Erk pathway, in hippocampal neurons. The absence of p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt; impaired the ability of BDNF to rescue hippocampal neurons in a trophic deprivation model, suggesting that p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt; facilitates the ability of TrkB to activate specific pathways to promote neuronal survival.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Genetically-encoded indicators of neuronal activity enable the labeling of a genetically defined population of neurons to optically monitor their activities. However, researchers often find difficulties in identifying relevant signals from excessive background fluorescence. A photoactivatable version of a genetically encoded calcium indicator, sPA-GCaMP6f is a good example of circumventing such an obstacle by limiting the fluorescence to a region of interest defined by the user. Here, we apply this strategy to genetically encoded voltage (GEVI) and pH (GEPI) indicators. Three photoactivatable GEVI candidates were considered. The first one used a circularly-permuted fluorescent protein, the second design involved a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) pair, and the third approach employed a pH-sensitive variant of GFP, ecliptic pHluorin. The candidate with a variant of ecliptic pHluorin exhibited photoactivation and a voltage-dependent fluorescence change. This effort also yielded a pH-sensitive photoactivatable GFP that varies its brightness in response to intracellular pH changes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Introduction&lt;p&gt;The utility of subjective memory impairment (SMI) as a risk marker for preclinical Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains unclear; however, recent studies have identified a correlation between retinal biomarkers and onset of preclinical disease. This study examines the relationship between retinal biomarkers that have been associated with cerebral amyloid, an early hallmark of AD, and SMI scores in patients at risk for developing AD.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Forty-nine cognitively normal subjects were followed over 27 months and evaluated using a combination of neuropsychological, psychological, and retinal imaging instruments. Subjective memory testing was conducted using the memory assessment clinic questionnaire (MACQ) and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS). Multivariate linear analysis was conducted using STATA software.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Positive correlations were found between retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) volume and scores obtained from the MAC-Q at 27 months (MAC-Q_27), the DASS questionnaire for anxiety at 27 months (DASS-A_27), and the change in DASS-A over 27 months (dDASSA). There was also a significant positive correlation between these variables and the change in RNFL thickness over 27 months (dRNFL). MACQ_27, DASSA_27, and dDASS-A accounted for 35.7% of RFNL variance at 27 months and 21.5% of dRFNL variance.&lt;/p&gt;Discussion&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that worse subjective memory complaints and anxiety scores may be associated with one of the most commonly used structural anatomical retinal markers of early disease burden in AD. If so, these results lend support to SMI as a valid risk marker for later cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Evolution is at the core of the impending antibiotic crisis. Sustainable therapy must thus account for the adaptive potential of pathogens. One option is to exploit evolutionary trade-offs, like collateral sensitivity, where evolved resistance to one antibiotic causes hypersensitivity to another one. To date, the evolutionary stability and thus clinical utility of this trade-off is unclear. We performed a critical experimental test on this key requirement, using evolution experiments with &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt;, and identified three main outcomes: (i) bacteria commonly failed to counter hypersensitivity and went extinct; (ii) hypersensitivity sometimes converted into multidrug resistance; and (iii) resistance gains frequently caused re-sensitization to the previous drug, thereby maintaining the trade-off. Drug order affected the evolutionary outcome, most likely due to variation in the effect size of collateral sensitivity, epistasis among adaptive mutations, and fitness costs. Our finding of robust genetic trade-offs and drug-order effects can guide design of evolution-informed antibiotic therapy.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/50559</link>
	<content:encoded>When facing microbes, animals engage in behaviors that lower the impact of the infection. We previously demonstrated that internal sensing of bacterial peptidoglycan reduces &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; female oviposition via NF-κB pathway activation in some neurons (Kurz et al., 2017). Although we showed that the neuromodulator octopamine is implicated, the identity of the involved neurons, as well as the physiological mechanism blocking egg-laying, remained unknown. In this study, we identified few ventral nerve cord and brain octopaminergic neurons expressing an NF-κB pathway component. We functionally demonstrated that NF-κB pathway activation in the brain, but not in the ventral nerve cord octopaminergic neurons, triggers an egg-laying drop in response to infection. Furthermore, we demonstrated via calcium imaging that the activity of these neurons can be directly modulated by peptidoglycan and that these cells do not control other octopamine-dependent behaviors such as female receptivity. This study shows that by sensing peptidoglycan and hence activating NF-κB cascade, a couple of brain neurons modulate a specific octopamine-dependent behavior to adapt female physiology status to their infectious state.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Lysosomes are major sites for intracellular, acidic hydrolase-mediated proteolysis and cellular degradation. The export of low-molecular-weight catabolic end-products is facilitated by polytopic transmembrane proteins mediating secondary active or passive transport. A number of these lysosomal transporters, however, remain enigmatic. We present a detailed analysis of MFSD1, a hitherto uncharacterized lysosomal family member of the major facilitator superfamily. MFSD1 is not N-glycosylated. It contains a dileucine-based sorting motif needed for its transport to lysosomes. &lt;i&gt;Mfsd1&lt;/i&gt; knockout mice develop splenomegaly and severe liver disease. Proteomics of isolated lysosomes from &lt;i&gt;Mfsd1&lt;/i&gt; knockout mice revealed GLMP as a critical accessory subunit for MFSD1. MFSD1 and GLMP physically interact. GLMP is essential for the maintenance of normal levels of MFSD1 in lysosomes and vice versa. &lt;i&gt;Glmp&lt;/i&gt; knockout mice mimic the phenotype of &lt;i&gt;Mfsd1&lt;/i&gt; knockout mice. Our data reveal a tightly linked MFSD1/GLMP lysosomal membrane protein transporter complex.</content:encoded>

Here we study the in vivo dynamics of &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; gametocytes by establishing a framework which incorporates improved measurements of parasitemia, a novel gametocyte dynamics model and model fitting using Bayesian hierarchical inference. We found that the model provides an excellent fit to the clinical data from 17 volunteers infected with &lt;i&gt;P. falciparum&lt;/i&gt; (3D7 strain) and reliably predicts observed gametocytemia. We estimated the sexual commitment rate and gametocyte sequestration time to be 0.54% (95% credible interval: 0.30–1.00%) per asexual replication cycle and 8.39 (6.54–10.59) days respectively. We used the data-calibrated model to investigate human-to-mosquito transmissibility, providing a method to link within-human host infection kinetics to epidemiological-scale infection and transmission patterns.</content:encoded>

We found that the degree of interhemispheric rs-FC within fronto-temporal auditory networks predicts—weeks after scanning—learning, transmission, and structural modification of an artificial tone system. Our study introduces neuroimaging in cultural transmission research and points to specific neural auditory processing mechanisms that constrain and drive variation in the cultural transmission and regularization of musical systems.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Mask family proteins ANKHD1 and ANKRD17 regulate YAP nuclear import and stability</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/48601</link>
	<content:encoded>Mask family proteins were discovered in&lt;i&gt; Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; to promote the activity of the transcriptional coactivator Yorkie (Yki), the sole fly homolog of mammalian YAP (YAP1) and TAZ (WWTR1). The molecular function of Mask, or its mammalian homologs Mask1 (ANKHD1) and Mask2 (ANKRD17), remains unclear. Mask family proteins contain two ankyrin repeat domains that bind Yki/YAP as well as a conserved nuclear localisation sequence (NLS) and nuclear export sequence (NES), suggesting a role in nucleo-cytoplasmic transport. Here we show that Mask acts to promote nuclear import of Yki, and that addition of an ectopic NLS to Yki is sufficient to bypass the requirement for Mask in Yki-driven tissue growth. Mammalian Mask1/2 proteins also promote nuclear import of YAP, as well as stabilising YAP and driving formation of liquid droplets. Mask1/2 and YAP normally colocalise in a granular fashion in both nucleus and cytoplasm, and are co-regulated during mechanotransduction.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: TMC1 is an essential component of a leak channel that modulates tonotopy and excitability of auditory hair cells in mice</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/47441</link>
	<content:encoded>Hearing sensation relies on the mechano-electrical transducer (MET) channel of cochlear hair cells, in which transmembrane channel-like 1 (TMC1) and transmembrane channel-like 2 (TMC2) have been proposed to be the pore-forming subunits in mammals. TMCs were also found to regulate other biological processes than MET in invertebrates ranging from sensations to motor function. However, whether TMCs have a non-MET role remains elusive in mammals. Here, we report that in mouse hair cells, TMC1, but not TMC2, provides a background leak conductance, with properties distinct from those of the MET channels. By cysteine substitutions in TMC1, we characterized 4 amino acids that are required for the leak conductance. The leak conductance is graded in frequency-dependent manner along the length of the cochlea and indispensable for action potential firing. Taken together, our results show that TMC1 confers a background leak conductance in cochlear hair cells, which may be critical for the acquisition of sound-frequency and -intensity.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Cerebellar climbing fibers encode expected reward size</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/46870</link>
	<content:encoded>Climbing fiber inputs to the cerebellum encode error signals that instruct learning. Recently, evidence has accumulated to suggest that the cerebellum is also involved in the processing of reward. To study how rewarding events are encoded, we recorded the activity of climbing fibers when monkeys were engaged in an eye movement task. At the beginning of each trial, the monkeys were cued to the size of the reward that would be delivered upon successful completion of the trial. Climbing fiber activity increased when the monkeys were presented with a cue indicating a large reward size. Reward size did not modulate activity at reward delivery or during eye movements. Comparison between climbing fiber and simple spike activity indicated different interactions for coding of movement and reward. These results indicate that climbing fibers encode the expected reward size and suggest a general role of the cerebellum in associative learning beyond error correction.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Amidst multiple binding orientations on fork DNA, Saccharolobus MCM helicase proceeds N-first for unwinding</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/46096</link>
	<content:encoded>DNA replication requires that the duplex genomic DNA strands be separated; a function that is implemented by ring-shaped hexameric helicases in all Domains. Helicases are composed of two domains, an N- terminal DNA binding domain (NTD) and a C- terminal motor domain (CTD). Replication is controlled by loading of helicases at origins of replication, activation to preferentially encircle one strand, and then translocation to begin separation of the two strands. Using a combination of site-specific DNA footprinting, single-turnover unwinding assays, and unique fluorescence translocation monitoring, we have been able to quantify the binding distribution and the translocation orientation of &lt;i&gt;Saccharolobus &lt;/i&gt;(formally &lt;i&gt;Sulfolobus&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;i&gt; solfataricus&lt;/i&gt; MCM on DNA. Our results show that both the DNA substrate and the C-terminal winged-helix (WH) domain influence the orientation but that translocation on DNA proceeds N-first.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Monkeys and Humans Implement Causal Inference to Simultaneously Localize Auditory and Visual Stimuli</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/823385v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The environment is sampled by multiple senses, which are woven together to produce a unified perceptual state. However, optimally unifying such signals requires assigning particular signals to the same or different underlying objects or events. Many prior studies (especially in animals) have assumed fusion of cross-modal information, whereas recent work in humans has begun to probe the appropriateness of this assumption. Here we present results from a novel behavioral task in which both monkeys and humans localized visual and auditory stimuli and reported their perceived sources through saccadic eye movements. When the locations of visual and auditory stimuli were widely separated, subjects made two saccades, while when the two stimuli were presented at the same location they made only a single saccade. Intermediate levels of separation produced mixed response patterns: a single saccade to an intermediate position on some trials or separate saccades to both locations on others. The distribution of responses was well described by a hierarchical causal inference model that accurately predicted both the explicit &quot;same vs. different&quot; source judgements as well as biases in localization of the source(s) under each of these conditions.  The results from this task are broadly consistent with prior work in humans across a wide variety of analogous tasks, extending the study of multisensory causal inference to non-human primates and to a natural behavioral task with both a categorical assay of the number of perceived sources and a continuous report of the perceived position of the stimuli.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Dimensionality, information and learning in prefrontal cortex</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/823377v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Learning leads to changes in population patterns of neural activity.  In this study we wanted to examine how these changes in patterns of activity affect the dimensionality of neural responses and information about choices.  We addressed these questions by carrying out high channel count recordings in dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC; 768 electrodes) while monkeys performed a two-armed bandit reinforcement learning task.  The high channel count recordings allowed us to study population coding while monkeys learned choices between actions or objects.  We found that the dimensionality of neural population activity was higher across blocks in which animals learned the values of novel pairs of objects, than across blocks in which they learned the values of actions.  The increase in dimensionality with learning in object blocks was related to less shared information across blocks, and therefore patterns of neural activity that were less similar, when compared to learning in action blocks.  Furthermore, these differences emerged with learning, and were not a simple function of the choice of a visual image or action.  Therefore, learning the values of novel objects increases the dimensionality of neural representations in dlPFC.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Attending to mistakes while practicing alone provides opportunities for learning, but self-evaluation during audience-directed performance could distract from ongoing execution. It remains unknown how animals switch between practice and performance modes, and how evaluation systems process errors across distinct performance contexts. We recorded from striatal-projecting dopamine (DA) neurons as male songbirds transitioned from singing alone to singing female-directed courtship song. In the presence of the female, singing-related performance error signals were reduced or gated off and DA neurons were instead phasically activated by female vocalizations. Mesostriatal DA neurons can thus dynamically change their tuning with changes in social context.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The Longitudinal Assessment of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer\'s disease and their Association with White Matter Hyperintensities in the National Alzheimer\'s Coordinating Center\'s Uniform Data Set</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/822809v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Introduction: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are common in all dementias, including those with Alzheimers disease (AD). NPS contribute to patients distress, caregiver burden, and can lead to institutionalization. White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are a common finding on MRI usually indicative of cerebrovascular disease and have been associated with certain NPS. The aim of this study was two-fold. Firstly, we assessed the relationship between WMH load and NPS severity in MCI due to AD (MCI-AD) and AD. Secondly, we assessed the ability of WMH to predict the development and progression of NPS in these participants. Data was obtained from the National Alzheimers Coordinating Center. Methods: WMH were obtained from baseline MRIs and quantified using an automated segmentation technique. NPS were measured using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Mixed effect models and correlations were used to determine the relationship between WMH load and NPS severity scores. Results: Cross-sectional analysis showed no significant association between NPS and WMH at baseline. Longitudinal mixed effect models, however, revealed a significant relationship between increase in NPI total scores and baseline WMH load (p=0.014). There was also a significant relationship between increase in irritability severity scores over time and baseline WMH load (p= 0.009). Trends were observed for a relationship between increase in agitation severity scores and baseline WMH load (p=0.058). No other NPS severity scores were significantly associated with baseline WMH load. The correlation plot analysis showed that baseline whole brain WMH predicted change in future NPI total scores (r=0.169, p=0.008). Baseline whole brain WMH also predicted change in future agitation severity scores (r= 0.165, p= 0.009). The temporal lobe WMH (r=0.169, p=0.008) and frontal lobe WMH (r=0.153, p=0.016) contributed most to this this change. Conclusion: Irritability and agitation are common NPS and very distressful to patients and caregivers. Our findings of an increase in irritability severity over time as well as higher agitation severity scores at follow-up in participants with MCI-AD and AD with increased WMH loads have important implications for treatment, arguing for aggressive treatment of vascular risk factors in patients with MCI-AD and AD.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Recurrent interactions in local cortical circuits</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/822700v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The majority of cortical synapses are local and excitatory. Local recurrent circuits could implement amplification, allowing for pattern completion and other computations1. Cortical circuits contain subnetworks, consisting of neurons with similar receptive fields and elevated connectivity relative to the network average2,3. Understanding the computations performed by these subnetworks during behavior has been hampered by the fact that cortical neurons encoding different types of information are spatially intermingled and distributed over large brain volumes 4,5. We used computational modeling, optical recordings and manipulations to probe the function of recurrent coupling in layer (L) 2/3 of the somatosensory cortex during tactile discrimination. A model of L2/3 dynamics revealed that recurrent excitation enhances sensory signals via amplification, but only for subnetwork with elevated connectivity. Networks with high amplification were sensitive to damage: loss of a few subnetwork members degraded stimulus encoding. We tested this prediction experimentally by mapping neuronal selectivity5 and photoablating6,7 neurons with specific selectivity. In L2/3 of the somatosensory cortex, ablating a small proportion (10-20, &amp;lt; 5 % of the total) of neurons representing touch dramatically reduced responses in the spared touch representation, but not other representations. Network models further predicted that degradation following ablation should be greatest among spared neurons with stimulus responses that were most similar to the ablated population. Consistent with this prediction, ablations most strongly impacted neurons with selectivity similar to the ablated population. Our data shows that recurrence among cortical neurons with similar selectivity can drive input-specific amplification during behavior.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/822676v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>A growing body of evidence has highlighted behavioral connections between musical rhythm and linguistic syntax, suggesting that these may be mediated by common neural resources. Here, we performed a quantitative meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies using activation likelihood estimate (ALE) to localize the shared neural structures engaged in a representative set of musical rhythm (rhythm, beat, and meter) and linguistic syntax (merge movement, and reanalysis). Rhythm engaged a bilateral sensorimotor network throughout the brain consisting of the inferior frontal gyri, supplementary motor area, superior temporal gyri/temporoparietal junction, insula, the intraparietal lobule, and putamen. By contrast, syntax mostly recruited the left sensorimotor network including the inferior frontal gyrus, posterior superior temporal gyrus, premotor cortex, and supplementary motor area. Intersections between rhythm and syntax maps yielded overlapping regions in the left inferior frontal gyrus, left supplementary motor area, and bilateral insula--neural substrates involved in temporal hierarchy processing and predictive coding. Together, this is the first neuroimaging meta-analysis providing detailed anatomical overlap of sensorimotor regions recruited for musical rhythm and linguistic syntax.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/822650v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>We are constantly faced with the trade-off between exploiting past actions with known outcomes and exploring novel actions whose outcomes may be better. The balance between exploitation and exploration has been hypothesized to rely on multiple neuromodulator systems, namely dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus (LC). However, little is known about the dynamics of these neuromodulator systems during exploitative and exploratory states, or how they interact. We developed a novel behavioral paradigm to capture exploitative and exploratory behavioral states, and imaged calcium dynamics in genetically-identified dopaminergic SNc neurons and noradrenergic LC neurons during the transitions between these states. We found dichotomous changes in sustained activity in SNc and LC during exploitative bouts of action-reward, with SNc showing higher and LC showing lower sustained activity. Exploitative states were also marked by a lengthening of positive SNc response plateaus and negative LC response depressions, as well as hysteretic dynamics in SNc networks. Chemogenetic enhancement of dopaminergic and noradrenergic excitability favored exploitative and exploratory states, respectively. Together, these data suggest that opponent changes in dopaminergic and noradrenergic activity states modulate the transitions between exploitative and exploratory behavioral states, with important implications for downstream circuit dynamics.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/822635v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The current study represents the first comprehensive examination of spatial, temporal and sustained attention following cerebellar damage. Results indicated that, compared to controls, cerebellar damage eliminated the onset of inhibition of return (IOR) during the reflexive covert attention task, and reduced the ability to detect successive targets during an attentional blink task. However, cerebellar damage had no effect on voluntary covert attention or the sustained attention to response task (SART). Lesion overlay analysis indicated that impaired performance on IOR and the attentional blink were associated with damage to Crus II and lobule VII (tuber) and VIII (pyramis) of the left posterior cerebellum. Critically, subsequent analyses indicated our results are not due to either general motor impairments or to damage to the deep cerebellar nuclei. Collectively these data demonstrate, for the first time, that the same cerebellar regions are involved in both spatial and temporal visual attention. Furthermore, these data suggest that damage to the cerebellum may induce a form of attentional dysmetria, such that performance suffers under conditions in which the rapid deployment of attention (either spatial or temporal) is required.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/822478v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Both spike rate and timing transmit information in the brain, yet how rate-modulated cellular properties affect spike timing is largely unexplored. Phase response curves (PRCs), quantifying how a neuron transforms input to output by spike timing, exhibit strong rate-adaptation, but its mechanism and relevance for network output are poorly understood. Using our Purkinje cell (PC) model and pyramidal neuron model, we demonstrate that the rate-adaptation is caused by rate-dependent subthreshold membrane potentials efficiently regulating the activation of Na+ channels. Then we use a realistic PC network model to examine how rate-dependent responses synchronize spikes in the scenario of reciprocal inhibition-caused high-frequency oscillations. Large and broad PRCs at high rates increase oscillation power and spike correlations. The irregularity of spiking and the network connectivity also regulate oscillations. The combination of these factors enables transient oscillations between fast-spiking neurons. Our work demonstrates that rate-adaptation of PRCs can spatio-temporally organize neuronal output.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/822361v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Oligomeric forms of amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) peptide are known to be the primary neurotoxic species in Alzheimer,s disease (AD), but how they interact with neurons to produce their deleterious effects is unclear. Over ten different cell-surface receptors for A{beta} have been described, but their molecular interactions with A{beta} assemblies and their relative contributions to mediating AD pathology have remained uncertain. In the present work, we have used super-resolution microscopy to directly visualize A{beta}-receptor interactions at the nanometer scale. We report that one documented A{beta} receptor, the cellular prion protein, PrPC, specifically inhibits the polymerization A{beta} fibrils via a unique mechanism in which it binds specifically to the rapidly growing end of each fibril, thereby blocking polarized elongation at that end. PrPC binds neurotoxic oligomers and protofibrils in a similar fashion, suggesting that it may recognize a common, end-specific, structural motif on all of these assemblies. Finally, two other candidate A{beta} receptors, Fc{gamma}RIIb and LilrB2, affect A{beta} fibril growth in a manner similar to PrPC. Taken together, our results suggest that neurotoxic signaling by several different receptors may be activated by common molecular interactions with both fibrillar and oligomeric A{beta} ligands. Targeting such interactions with small molecules represents an attractive therapeutic strategy for treatment of AD.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/822213v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Functional connectivity studies have identified at least two large-scale neural systems that constitute cognitive control networks: the frontoparietal network (FPN) and cingulo opercular network (CON). Control networks are thought to support goal directed cognition and behavior. It was previously shown that the FPN flexibly shifts its global connectivity pattern according to task goal, consistent with a 'flexible hub' mechanism for cognitive control. Our aim was to build on this finding to develop a functional cartography (a multimetric profile) of control networks in terms of dynamic network properties. We quantified network properties in (male and female) humans using a high-control-demand cognitive paradigm involving switching among 64 task sets. We hypothesized that cognitive control is enacted by the FPN and CON via distinct but complementary roles reflected in network dynamics. Consistent with a flexible 'coordinator' mechanism, FPN connections were globally diverse across tasks, while maintaining within-network connectivity to aid cross-region coordination. Consistent with a flexible 'switcher' mechanism, CON regions switched to other networks in a task dependent manner, driven primarily by reduced within-network connections to other CON regions. This pattern of results suggests FPN acts as a dynamic, global coordinator of goal-relevant information, while CON transiently disbands to lend processing resources to other goal relevant networks. This cartography of network dynamics reveals a dissociation between two prominent cognitive control networks, suggesting complementary mechanisms underlying goal directed cognition.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/822155v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: The retinal and cerebral microvasculature share many morphological and physiological properties. Perivascular Spaces (PVS), also known as Virchow-Robin spaces, are visible with increasing resolution with the ongoing improvement of brain MRI technology. We investigated the associations between quantitative retinal measurements and novel computational PVS parameters in a cohort of older people in their eighth decade. Methods: We analysed data from community-dwelling individuals (n=381 of 866) from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936, who underwent multimodal brain MRI and retinal fundus camera imaging at mean age 72.55 years (SD=0.71). We assessed PVS computationally in the centrum semiovale. We calculated the total volume and count of PVS, and the mean per-subject individual PVS length, width and size. Digital retinal images were analysed using the VAMPIRE software suite, obtaining the Central Retinal Artery and Vein Equivalents (CRVE and CRAE), Arteriole-to-Venule ratio (AVR), and fractal dimension (FD) of both eyes. We investigated the associations between computational PVS measurements and retinal vascular measurements using general linear models. We adjusted for age, gender and important covariates (hypertension, diabetes, cholesterol, cardiovascular disease history and smoking). Results: In 381 subjects with all measures, increasing total volume and count of PVS were associated with decreased CRAE in the left eye (volume {beta}=-0.170 p&amp;lt;0.001; count {beta}=-0.184, p&amp;lt;0.001). No associations of PVS with CRVE were found. The PVS total volume, individual width and size were associated with the FD of the arterioles (a) and venules (v) of the left eye (total volume: FDa {beta}=-0.137, FDv {beta}=-0.139, both p&amp;lt;0.01; width: FDa {beta}=-0.144, FDv {beta}=-0.158, both p&amp;lt;0.01; size: FDa {beta}=-0.157, p=0.002; FDv {beta}=-0.162, p=0.001). Conclusions: We show that worse brain PVS computational metrics associate with narrower retinal arterioles and lower retinal microvessel branching complexity, providing more direct evidence in vivo in humans of the microvessel changes underlying brain small vessel disease.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Optimizing the Accuracy of Cortical Volumetric Analysis in Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/822148v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Cortical volumetric analysis is widely used to study the anatomic basis of neurological deficits in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, patients with TBI-related lesions are often excluded from analysis, because cortical lesions may compromise the accuracy of reconstructed surfaces upon which volumetric measurements are based. Here, we propose a novel FreeSurfer-based lesion correction method and illustrate its impact on cortical volume measures in patients with chronic moderate-to-severe TBI. We performed MRI in 87 patients at mean+/-SD 10.9+/-9.1 years post-injury using a T1-weighted multi-echo MPRAGE sequence at 1 mm resolution. Following surface reconstruction, we parcellated the cerebral cortex into seven functional networks using FreeSurfer's standard pipeline. Next, we manually labeled vertices on the cortical surface where lesions caused inaccuracies and removed them from network-based cortical volumetric measures. After performing this lesion correction procedure, we measured the surface area of lesion overlap with each network and the percent volume of each network affected by lesions. We identified 120 lesions that caused inaccuracies in the cortical surface in 46 patients. In these 46 patients, the most commonly lesioned networks were the limbic and default mode networks (95.7% each), followed by the executive control (78.3%), and salience (71.7%) networks. The limbic network had the largest average surface area of lesion overlap (4.4+/-3.7%) and the largest percent volume affected by lesions (12.7+/-9.7%).

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Intrinsic dynamics enhance temporal stability of stimulus representation along a visual cortical hierarchy</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/822130v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Along the ventral stream, cortical representations of brief, static stimuli become gradually more invariant to identity-preserving transformations. In the presence of long, ethologically relevant dynamic stimuli, higher invariance should imply temporally persistent representations at the top of this functional hierarchy. However, such stimuli could engage adaptive and predictive processes, whose impact on neural coding dynamics is unknown. More generally, coding dynamics in the presence of temporally structured stimuli are not understood. By probing the rodent analogue of the ventral stream with movies, we uncovered a hierarchy of temporal scales along this pathway, with deeper areas encoding visual information more persistently. Furthermore, the impact of intrinsic dynamics on the stability of stimulus representations gradually grows along the hierarchy. These results suggest that feedforward computations in the cortical hierarchy build up invariance even for dynamic, temporally structured stimuli, and that intrinsic processing contributes to the stabilization of representations in noisy, changing environments.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Broadband Signal Rather than Frequency-Specific Rhythms Underlies Prediction Error in the Primate Auditory Cortex</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/821942v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Detection of statistical irregularities, measured as a prediction error response, is fundamental to the perceptual monitoring of the environment. We studied whether prediction error response is generated by neural oscillations or asynchronous neuronal firing. Electrocorticography (ECoG) was carried out in three monkeys, who passively listened to the auditory roving oddball stimuli. Local field potentials (LFP) recorded over the auditory cortex underwent spectral principal component analysis, which decoupled broadband and rhythmic components of LFP signal. We found that broadband component generated prediction error response, whereas none of the rhythmic components encoded statistical irregularities of sounds. The broadband component displayed more stochastic, asymmetrical multifractal properties than the rhythmic components, which revealed more self-similar dynamics. We thus conclude that the prediction error response is encoded by asynchronous neuronal populations, defined by irregular dynamical states which, unlike oscillatory rhythms, appear to enable the neural representation of auditory prediction error response.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/821918v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Population receptive field (pRF) modelling is a common technique for estimating the stimulus-selectivity of populations of neurons using neuroimaging. Here, we aimed to address if pRF properties estimated with this method depend on the spatio-temporal structure and the predictability of the mapping stimulus. We mapped the polar angle preference and tuning width of voxels in visual cortex (V1-V4) of healthy, adult volunteers. We compared sequences orderly sweeping through the visual field or jumping from location to location employing stimuli of different width (45deg vs 6deg) and cycles of variable duration (8s vs 60s). While we did not observe any systematic influence of stimulus predictability, the temporal structure of the sequences significantly affected tuning width estimates. Ordered designs with large wedges and short cycles produced systematically smaller estimates than random sequences. Interestingly, when we used small wedges and long cycles, we obtained larger tuning width estimates for ordered than random sequences. We suggest that, ordered and random mapping protocols show different susceptibility to other design choices such as stimulus type and duration of the mapping cycle and can produce significantly different pRF results.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/821892v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The impact of commensal bacteria on the host arises from complex microbial-diet-host interactions. Mapping metabolic interactions in gut microbial communities is therefore key to understand how the microbiome influences the host. Here we use an interdisciplinary approach including isotope-resolved metabolomics to show that in Drosophila melanogaster, Acetobacter pomorum (Ap) and Lactobacillus plantarum (Lp) establish a syntrophic relationship to overcome detrimental host diets and identify Ap as the bacterium altering the host's feeding decisions. Specifically, we show that Lp generates lactate which is used by Ap to produce and provide amino acids that are essential to Lp allowing it to grow in imbalanced diets. Lactate is also necessary and sufficient for Ap to alter the fly's protein appetite. Our data show that gut bacterial communities use metabolic interactions to become resilient to detrimental host diets and to ensure the constant flow of metabolites used by effector bacteria to alter host behaviour.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The CNS lymphatic system modulates the adaptive neuro-immune response in the perilesional cortex after brain trauma</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/821645v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Rationale: The recently discovered meningeal lymphatic vessels (mLVs) have been proposed to be the missing link between the immune and the central nervous systems. The role of mLVs in modulating the neuro-immune response following a brain injury, however, has not been analyzed. Parenchymal T lymphocyte infiltration has been previously reported as part of secondary events after traumatic brain injury (TBI), suggestive of an adaptive neuro-immune response. The phenotype of these cells has remained uncharacterized. In this study, we identified the subpopulations of T cells infiltrating the perilesional areas 30 days post injury (an early-chronic time point). Furthermore, we analyzed how the lack of mLVs affects the magnitude and the type of immune response in the brain after TBI. Methods: TBI was induced in K14 VEGFR3-Ig mice (lacking mLVs), or in their littermate controls (WT), applying a controlled cortical impact (CCI). One month after TBI, T cells were isolated from cortical areas ipsilateral or contralateral to the trauma and from the spleen, and analyzed by flow cytometry for TCR{beta} (T cells), CD4 (T-helper cells), CD8 (cytotoxic T cells), CD44 (memory T cells), and CD69 (effector T cells). Lesion size in each animal was evaluated by MRI. Results: In both WT- and K14-VEGFR3-Ig-CCI mice, we found a prominent T cell infiltration in the brain, confined to the perilesional cortex and hippocampus. The majority of infiltrating T cells are CD8 (cytotoxic T cells), expressing a CD44hiCD69+ phenotype, suggesting that these are effector resident memory T cells. K14-VEGFR3-Ig mice showed a significant reduction of infiltrating CD4+ T lymphocytes, implying that mLVs are important in establishing a proper neuro-immune response. Negligible T cell infiltration was observed in the contralateral unaffected side. Extension of the lesion (measured as lesion volume from MRI) did not differ between the genotypes. Finally, TBI did not correlate with alterations in peripheral circulating T cells, as assessed one month after injury induction. Conclusions: Our data support the hypothesis that mLVs are pivotal for a proper and specific neuro-immune response after TBI, which is principally mediated by the resident memory cytotoxic CD8+ T cells.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: TET1-mediated Oligodendrocyte Homeostasis Regulates Myelination and Synaptic Functions</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/821496v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>DNA methylation is critical for oligodendrocyte development. The role of the converse process, DNA demethylation regulated by Ten-Eleven-Translocation (TET) dioxygenases, in oligodendrocyte homeostasis, myelination and remyelination however remains elusive. Here, we identify a genome-wide and locus-specific DNA hydroxymethylation landscape shift during oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) differentiation. Tet1 ablation results in defects in oligodendrocyte development and myelination in the developing brain, while impairing remyelination after demyelination in adult brains. Transcriptomic and DNA hydroxymethylation analyses reveal a TET1-regulated epigenetic program for oligodendrocyte differentiation and identify a set of target genes associated with Ca2+ homeostasis. Tet1-deficient OPCs exhibited reduced [Ca2+] oscillations, while activation of calcium channels partially restores the differentiation defect of Tet1-deficient OPCs. Moreover, dysregulated oligodendrocyte homeostasis caused by Tet1-deficiency impairs action potential propagation and synaptic transmission. Thus, our results suggest that stage-specific TET1-mediated epigenetic programming of oligodendrocyte homeostasis is required for proper myelination and repair as well as neuronal physiology in cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms, respectively.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Prospective and retrospective contributions to intention awareness in voluntary action</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/821488v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Spontaneous, voluntary actions are often accompanied by motor intentions, that is the experience of &quot;being about to move&quot;. The emergence of this experience is contentiously discussed, culminating in two opposing views of motor intention. While prospective theorists hold that an intention to move genuinely precedes the action, retrospective theorists suggest that an intention is reconstructed only after action execution. As such, both theories offer radically different predictions about the possibility of voluntary control over action intention. We assess here the respective contributions of prospective and retrospective factors in motor intention awareness in a real-time EEG setup. Participants performed self-paced movements with intermittent interruption by cues, signalling to either move or not to move. Cues were triggered by a brain-computer interface upon detection of either the presence or absence of a readiness potential (RP), a signal known to precede self-paced voluntary actions. Subsequently, participants reported their intention to move at the time of the cue. We found that participants were more likely to report an intention to move when the cue was followed by a movement than no movement, highlighting the effect of retrospection on awareness of intention. Interestingly, however, an intention to move was also more frequently reported when the cue was elicited by an RP, compared to when no RP was present, suggesting that awareness of intention is also informed by motor preparation processes, congruent with prospective theories. Overall, our findings show that intention awareness in voluntary action relies on both prospective and retrospective components, and we describe here how these two factors are dynamically integrated over time.</content:encoded>

CRISPR-Cas is a powerful genome editing technology and has a great potential for &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; gene therapy. Successful translational application of CRISPR-Cas to biomedicine still faces many safety concerns, including off-target side effect, cell fitness problem after CRISPR-Cas treatment, and on-target genome editing side effect in undesired tissues. To solve these issues, it is needed to design sgRNA with high cell-specific efficacy and specificity. Existing single-guide RNA (sgRNA) design tools mainly depend on a sgRNA sequence and the local information of the targeted genome, thus are not sufficient to account for the difference in the cellular response of the same gene in different cell types. To incorporate cell-specific information into the sgRNA design, we develop novel interpretable machine learning models, which integrate features learned from advanced transformer-based deep neural network with cell-specific gene property derived from biological network and gene expression profile, for the prediction of CRISPR-Cas9 and CRISPR-Cas12a efficacy and specificity. In benchmark studies, our models significantly outperform state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, we find that the network-based gene property is critical for the prediction of cell-specific post-treatment cellular response. Our results suggest that the design of efficient and safe CRISPR-Cas needs to consider cell-specific information of genes. Our findings may bolster developing more accurate predictive models of CRISPR-Cas across a broad spectrum of biological conditions as well as provide new insight into developing efficient and safe CRISPR-based gene therapy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mujuedi3HYI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The somatic co-evolution of tumors and the cellular immune responses that combat them drives the diversity of immune-tumor interactions. This includes tumor mutations that generate neo-antigenic epitopes that elicit cytotoxic T-cell activity and subsequent pressure to select for genetic loss of antigen presentation. Most studies have focused on how tumor missense mutations can drive tumor immunity, but frameshift mutations have the potential to create far greater antigenic diversity. However, expression of this antigenic diversity is potentially regulated by Nonsense Mediated Decay (NMD) and NMD has been shown to be of variable efficiency in cancers. Here we studied how mutational changes influence global NMD and cytolytic immune responses. Using TCGA datasets, we derived novel patient-level metrics of ‘NMD burden’ and interrogated how different mutation and most importantly NMD burdens influence cytolytic activity using machine learning models and survival outcomes. We find that NMD is a significant and independent predictor of immune cytolytic activity. Different indications exhibited varying dependence on NMD and mutation burden features. We also observed significant co-alteration of genes in the NMD pathway, with a global increase in NMD efficiency in patients with NMD co-alterations. Finally, NMD burden also stratified patient survival in multivariate regression models in subset of cancer types. Our work suggests that beyond selecting for mutations that elicit NMD in tumor suppressors, tumor evolution may react to the selective pressure generated by inflammation to globally enhance NMD through coordinated amplification and/or mutation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/I-EjVjD-doM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Patterns of periodic voltage spikes elicited by a neuron help define its dynamical identity. Experimentally recorded spike trains from various neurons show qualitatively distinguishable features such as delayed spiking, spiking with or without frequency adaptation, and intrinsic bursting. Moreover, the input-dependent responses of a neuron not only show different quantitative features, such as higher spike frequency for a stronger input current injection, but can also exhibit qualitatively different responses, such as spiking and bursting under different input conditions, thus forming a complex phenotype of responses. In previous work, the comprehensive knowledge base of hippocampal neuron types &lt;i&gt;Hippocampome.org&lt;/i&gt; systematically characterized various spike pattern phenotypes experimentally identified from 120 neuron types/subtypes. In this paper, we present a complete set of simple phenomenological models that quantitatively reproduce the diverse and complex phenotypes of hippocampal neurons. In addition to point-neuron models, we created compact multi-compartment models with up to four compartments, which will allow spatial segregation of synaptic integration in network simulations. Electrotonic compartmentalization observed in our compact multi-compartment models is qualitatively consistent with experimental observations. The models were created using an automated pipeline based on evolutionary algorithms. This work maps 120 neuron types/subtypes in the rodent hippocampus to a low-dimensional model space and adds another dimension to the knowledge accumulated in &lt;i&gt;Hippocampome.org&lt;/i&gt;. Computationally efficient representations of intrinsic dynamics, along with other pieces of knowledge available in &lt;i&gt;Hippocampome.org&lt;/i&gt;, provide a biologically realistic platform to explore the large-scale interactions of various neuron types at the mesoscopic level.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CMiShQXC2Oc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Single-cell RNA-sequencing data generated by a variety of technologies, such as Drop-seq and SMART-seq, can reveal simultaneously the mRNA transcript levels of thousands of genes in thousands of cells. It is often important to identify informative genes or cell-type-discriminative markers to reduce dimensionality and achieve informative cell typing results. We present an &lt;i&gt;ab initio&lt;/i&gt; method that performs unsupervised marker selection by identifying genes that have subpopulation-discriminative expression levels and are co- or mutually-exclusively expressed with other genes. Consistent improvements in cell-type classification and biologically meaningful marker selection are achieved by applying SCMarker on various datasets in multiple tissue types, followed by a variety of clustering algorithms. The source code of SCMarker is publicly available at https://github.com/KChen-lab/SCMarker.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wcDVjucqO9I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) promotes stomatal closure via multifarious cellular signaling cascades. Our previous comprehensive reconstruction of the stomatal closure network resulted in an 81-node network with 153 edges. Discrete dynamic modeling utilizing this network reproduced over 75% of experimental observations but a few experimentally supported results were not recapitulated. Here we identify predictions that improve the agreement between model and experiment. We performed dynamics-preserving network reduction, resulting in a condensed 49 node and 113 edge stomatal closure network that preserved all dynamics-determining network motifs and reproduced the predictions of the original model. We then utilized the reduced network to explore cases in which experimental activation of internal nodes in the absence of ABA elicited stomatal closure in wet bench experiments, but not in our in silico model. Our simulations revealed that addition of a single edge, which allows indirect inhibition of any one of three PP2C protein phosphatases (ABI2, PP2CA, HAB1) by cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; elevation, resolves the majority of the discrepancies. Consistent with this hypothesis, we experimentally show that Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; application to cellular lysates at physiological concentrations inhibits PP2C activity. The model augmented with this new edge provides new insights into the role of cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; oscillations in stomatal closure, revealing a mutual reinforcement between repeated increases in cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration and a self-sustaining feedback circuit inside the signaling network. These results illustrate how iteration between model and experiment can improve predictions of highly complex cellular dynamics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GF6OkN8haIg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

This paper presents a morphological analysis of fibrotic scarring in non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, and its relationship to electrical instabilities which underlie reentrant arrhythmias. Two dimensional electrophysiological simulation models were constructed from a set of 699 late gadolinium enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance images originating from 157 patients. Areas of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) in each image were assigned one of 10 possible microstructures, which modelled the details of fibrotic scarring an order of magnitude below the MRI scan resolution. A simulated programmed electrical stimulation protocol tested each model for the possibility of generating either a transmural block or a transmural reentry. The outcomes of the simulations were compared against morphological LGE features extracted from the images. Models which blocked or reentered, grouped by microstructure, were significantly different from one another in myocardial-LGE interface length, number of components and entropy, but not in relative area and transmurality. With an unknown microstructure, transmurality alone was the best predictor of block, whereas a combination of interface length, transmurality and number of components was the best predictor of reentry in linear discriminant analysis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WEFZtn9nOgU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The molecular and cellular basis of novelty is an active area of research in evolutionary biology. Until very recently, the vast majority of cellular phenomena were so difficult to sample that cross-species studies of biochemistry were rare and comparative analysis at the level of biochemical systems was almost impossible. Recent advances in systems biology are changing what is possible, however, and comparative phylogenetic methods that can handle this new data are wanted. Here, we introduce the term “phylogenetic latent variable models” (PLVMs, pronounced “plums”) for a class of models that has recently been used to infer the evolution of cellular states from systems-level molecular data, and develop a new parameterization and fitting strategy that is useful for comparative inference of biochemical networks. We deploy this new framework to infer the ancestral states and evolutionary dynamics of protein-interaction networks by analyzing &amp;gt;16,000 predominantly metazoan co-fractionation and affinity-purification mass spectrometry experiments. Based on these data, we estimate ancestral interactions across unikonts, broadly recovering protein complexes involved in translation, transcription, proteostasis, transport, and membrane trafficking. Using these results, we predict an ancient core of the Commander complex made up of CCDC22, CCDC93, C16orf62, and DSCR3, with more recent additions of COMMD-containing proteins in tetrapods. We also use simulations to develop model fitting strategies and discuss future model developments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KptEXMSq-d8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Cognitive development studies how information processing in the brain changes over the course of development. A key part of this question is how information is represented and stored in memory. This study examined allocentric (world-based) spatial memory, an important cognitive tool for planning routes and interacting with the space around us. This is typically theorized to use multiple landmarks all at once whenever it operates. In contrast, here we show that allocentric spatial memory frequently operates over a limited spatial window, much less than the full proximal scene, for children between 3.5 and 8.5 years old. The use of multiple landmarks increases gradually with age. Participants were asked to point to a remembered target location after a change of view in immersive virtual reality. A k-fold cross-validation model-comparison selected a model where young children usually use the target location’s vector to the single nearest landmark and rarely take advantage of the vectors to other nearby landmarks. The comparison models, which attempt to explain the errors as generic forms of noise rather than encoding to a single spatial cue, did not capture the distribution of responses as well. Parameter fits of this new single- versus multi-cue model are also easily interpretable and related to other variables of interest in development (age, executive function). Based on this, we theorize that spatial memory in humans develops through three advancing levels (but not strict stages): most likely to encode locations egocentrically (relative to the self), then allocentrically (relative to the world) but using only one landmark, and finally, most likely to encode locations relative to multiple parts of the scene.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nCBcqTqNlq0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Epigenetic switching as a strategy for quick adaptation while attenuating biochemical noise</title>

Epigenetic switches are bistable, molecular systems built from self-reinforcing feedback loops that can spontaneously switch between heritable phenotypes in the absence of DNA mutation. It has been hypothesized that epigenetic switches first evolved as a mechanism of bet-hedging and adaptation, but the evolutionary trajectories and conditions by which an epigenetic switch can outcompete adaptation through genetic mutation remain unknown. Here, we used computer simulations to evolve a mechanistic, biophysical model of a self-activating genetic circuit, which can both adapt genetically through mutation and exhibit epigenetic switching. We evolved these genetic circuits under a fluctuating environment that alternatively selected for low and high protein expression levels. In all tested conditions, the population first evolved by genetic mutation towards a region of genotypes where genetic adaptation can occur faster after each environmental transition. Once in this region, the self-activating genetic circuit can exhibit epigenetic switching, which starts competing with genetic adaptation. We show a trade-off between either minimizing the adaptation time or increasing the robustness of the phenotype to biochemical noise. Epigenetic switching was superior in a fast fluctuating environment because it adapted faster than genetic mutation after an environmental transition, while still attenuating the effect of biochemical noise on the phenotype. Conversely, genetic adaptation was favored in a slowly fluctuating environment because it maximized the phenotypic robustness to biochemical noise during the constant environment between transitions, even if this resulted in slower adaptation. This simple trade-off predicts the conditions and trajectories under which an epigenetic switch evolved to outcompete genetic adaptation, shedding light on possible mechanisms by which bet-hedging strategies might emerge and persist in natural populations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/88xq5ZSe1ww&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Matrix feedback enables diverse higher-order patterning of the extracellular matrix</title>

The higher-order patterning of extra-cellular matrix in normal and pathological tissues has profound consequences on tissue function. Whilst studies have documented both how fibroblasts create and maintain individual matrix fibers and how cell migration is altered by the fibers they interact with, a model unifying these two aspects of tissue organization is lacking. Here we use computational modelling to understand the effect of this interconnectivity between fibroblasts and matrix at the mesoscale level. We created a unique adaptation to the Vicsek flocking model to include feedback from a second layer representing the matrix, and use experimentation to parameterize our model and validate model-driven hypotheses. Our two-layer model demonstrates that feedback between fibroblasts and matrix increases matrix diversity creating higher-order patterns. The model can quantitatively recapitulate matrix patterns of tissues &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Cells follow matrix fibers irrespective of when the matrix fibers were deposited, resulting in feedback with the matrix acting as temporal ‘memory’ to collective behaviour, which creates diversity in topology. We also establish conditions under which matrix can be remodelled from one pattern to another. Our model elucidates how simple rules defining fibroblast-matrix interactions are sufficient to generate complex tissue patterns.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/R2NeXOG79ko&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Seasonal influenza: Modelling approaches to capture immunity propagation</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/Kt4OvA3pkM8/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Edward M. Hill, Stavros Petrou, Simon de Lusignan, Ivelina Yonova, Matt J. Keeling&lt;/p&gt;

Seasonal influenza poses serious problems for global public health, being a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality. In England, there has been a long-standing national vaccination programme, with vaccination of at-risk groups and children offering partial protection against infection. Transmission models have been a fundamental component of analysis, informing the efficient use of limited resources. However, these models generally treat each season and each strain circulating within that season in isolation. Here, we amalgamate multiple data sources to calibrate a susceptible-latent-infected-recovered type transmission model for seasonal influenza, incorporating the four main strains and mechanisms linking prior season epidemiological outcomes to immunity at the beginning of the following season. Data pertaining to nine influenza seasons, starting with the 2009/10 season, informed our estimates for epidemiological processes, virological sample positivity, vaccine uptake and efficacy attributes, and general practitioner influenza-like-illness consultations as reported by the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC). We performed parameter inference via approximate Bayesian computation to assess strain transmissibility, dependence of present season influenza immunity on prior protection, and variability in the influenza case ascertainment across seasons. This produced reasonable agreement between model and data on the annual strain composition. Parameter fits indicated that the propagation of immunity from one season to the next is weaker if vaccine derived, compared to natural immunity from infection. Projecting the dynamics forward in time suggests that while historic immunity plays an important role in determining annual strain composition, the variability in vaccine efficacy hampers our ability to make long-term predictions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Kt4OvA3pkM8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: POPDC3 Gene Variants Associate with a New Form of Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25620?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Popeye domain containing 3 (&lt;i&gt;POPDC3)&lt;/i&gt; gene encodes a membrane protein involved in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling. Besides gastric cancer, no disease association has been described. We describe a new muscular dystrophy associated with this gene.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We screened 1,500 patients with unclassified limb girdle weakness or hyperCKemia for pathogenic &lt;i&gt;POPDC3&lt;/i&gt; variants. Five patients carrying &lt;i&gt;POPDC3&lt;/i&gt; variants were examined by muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), muscle biopsy, and cardiac examination. We performed functional analyses in a zebrafish &lt;i&gt;popdc3&lt;/i&gt; knockdown model and heterologous expression of the mutant proteins in &lt;i&gt;Xenopus laevis&lt;/i&gt; oocytes to measure TREK‐1 current.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified homozygous &lt;i&gt;POPDC3&lt;/i&gt; missense variants (p.Leu155His, p.Leu217Phe, and p.Arg261Gln) in 5 patients from 3 ethnically distinct families. Variants affected highly conserved residues in the Popeye (p.Leu155 and p.Leu217) and carboxy‐terminal (p.Arg261) domains. The variants were almost absent from control populations. Probands’ muscle biopsies were dystrophic, and serum creatine kinase levels were 1,050 to 9,200U/l. Muscle weakness was proximal with adulthood onset in most patients and affected lower earlier than upper limbs. Muscle MRI revealed fat replacement of paraspinal and proximal leg muscles; cardiac investigations were unremarkable. Knockdown of &lt;i&gt;popdc3&lt;/i&gt; in zebrafish, using 2 different splice‐site blocking morpholinos, resulted in larvae with tail curling and dystrophic muscle features. All 3 mutants cloned in &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; oocytes caused an aberrant modulation of the mechano‐gated potassium channel, TREK‐1.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings point to an important role of POPDC3 for skeletal muscle function and suggest that pathogenic variants in &lt;i&gt;POPDC3&lt;/i&gt; are responsible for a novel type of autosomal recessive limb girdle muscular dystrophy. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;TMEM175/GAK/DGKQ&lt;/i&gt; locus is the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; strongest risk locus in genome‐wide association studies (GWAS) of Parkinson disease (PD). We aimed to identify the specific disease‐associated variants in this locus, and their potential implications.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full sequencing of &lt;i&gt;TMEM175/GAK/DGKQ,&lt;/i&gt; followed by genotyping of specific associated variants was performed in PD (n=1,575) and rapid eye movement (REM)‐sleep behavior disorder (RBD) patients (n=533) and in controls (n=1,583). Adjusted regression models and a meta‐analysis were performed. Association between variants and glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity was analyzed in 715 individuals with available data. Homology modelling, molecular dynamics simulations, and lysosomal localization experiments were performed on &lt;i&gt;TMEM175&lt;/i&gt; variants to determine their potential effects on structure and function.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two coding variants, &lt;i&gt;TMEM175&lt;/i&gt; p.M393T (OR=1.37, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;=0.0003) and p.Q65P (OR=0.72, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;=0.005) were associated with PD, and p.M393T was also associated with RBD (OR=1.59, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;=0.001). &lt;i&gt;TMEM175&lt;/i&gt; p.M393T was associated with reduced GCase activity. Homology modelling and normal mode analysis demonstrated that &lt;i&gt;TMEM175&lt;/i&gt; p.M393T creates a polar side‐chain in the hydrophobic core of the transmembrane, which could destabilize the domain and thus impair either its assembly, maturation, or trafficking. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that the p.Q65P variant may increase stability and ion conductance of the transmembrane protein, and lysosomal localization was not affected by these variants.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coding variants in &lt;i&gt;TMEM175&lt;/i&gt; are likely to be responsible for the association in the &lt;i&gt;TMEM175/GAK/DGKQ&lt;/i&gt; locus, which could be mediated by affecting GCase activity.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Layer and cell specific recruitment dynamics during epileptic seizures in‐vivo</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25628?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate the network dynamics mechanisms underlying differential initiation of epileptic inter‐ictal spikes and seizures.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed combined &lt;i&gt;in‐vivo&lt;/i&gt; two‐photon calcium imaging from different targeted neuronal subpopulations and extracellular electrophysiological recordings during 4‐aminopyridine induced neocortical spikes and seizures.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both spikes and seizures were associated with intense synchronized activation of excitatory layer‐2/3 pyramidal neurons (PNs) and to a lesser degree layer‐4 neurons, as well as inhibitory parvalbumin‐expressing interneurons. In sharp contrast, layer‐5 PNs and somatostatin‐expressing interneurons were gradually and asynchronously recruited into the ictal activity during the course of seizures. Within layer‐2/3, the main difference between onset of spikes and seizures lied in the relative recruitment dynamics of excitatory PNs compared to parvalbumin‐ and somatostatin‐expressing inhibitory interneurons. While spikes exhibited balanced recruitment of PNs and parvalbumin‐expressing interneurons, during seizures interneurons responses were reduced and less synchronized than in layer‐2/3 PNs. Similar imbalance was not observed in layers 4 or 5 of the neocortex. Machine learning based algorithms we developed were able to distinguish spikes form seizures based solely on activation dynamics of layer‐2/3 PNs at discharge onset.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During onset of seizures the recruitment dynamics markedly differed between neuronal subpopulations, with rapid synchronous recruitment of layer‐2/3 PNs, layer‐4 neurons and parvalbumin‐expressing INs and gradual asynchronous recruitment of layer‐5 PNs and somatostatin‐expressing INs. Seizures initiated in layer‐2/3 due to a dynamic mismatch between local PNs and inhibitory INs, and only later spread to layer‐5 by gradually and asynchronously recruiting PNs in this layer.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Cholesterol accessibility at the ciliary membrane controls Hedgehog signaling</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/50051</link>
	<content:encoded>Previously we proposed that transmission of the Hedgehog signal across the plasma membrane by Smoothened is triggered by its interaction with cholesterol (Luchetti et al., 2016). But how is cholesterol, an abundant lipid, regulated tightly enough to control a signaling system that can cause birth defects and cancer? Using toxin-based sensors that distinguish between distinct pools of cholesterol, we find that Smoothened activation and Hedgehog signaling are driven by a biochemically-defined, small fraction of membrane cholesterol, termed accessible cholesterol. Increasing cholesterol accessibility by depletion of sphingomyelin, which sequesters cholesterol in complexes, amplifies Hedgehog signaling. Hedgehog ligands increase cholesterol accessibility in the membrane of the primary cilium by inactivating the transporter-like protein Patched 1. Trapping this accessible cholesterol blocks Hedgehog signal transmission across the membrane.  Our work shows that the organization of cholesterol in the ciliary membrane can be modified by extracellular ligands to control the activity of cilia-localized signaling proteins.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/49872</link>
	<content:encoded>Parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) GABAergic interneurons mediate feedforward and feedback inhibition and have a key role in gamma oscillations and information processing. The importance of fast synaptic recruitment, action potential initiation and repolarization, and rapid synchronous GABA release by PV+ cells is well established. In contrast, the functional significance of PV+ cell NMDA receptors (NMDARs), which generate relatively slow postsynaptic currents, is unclear. Underlining their importance, several studies implicate PV+ cell NMDAR disruption in impaired network function and circuit pathologies. Here, we show that dendritic NMDARs underlie supralinear integration of feedback excitation from local pyramidal neurons onto mouse CA1 PV+ cells. Furthermore, by incorporating NMDARs at feedback connections onto PV+ cells in spiking networks, we show that these receptors enable cooperative recruitment of PV+ interneurons, strengthening and stabilising principal cell assemblies. Failure of this phenomenon provides a parsimonious explanation for cognitive and sensory gating deficits in pathologies with impaired PV+ NMDAR signalling.</content:encoded>

Splice variants have been shown to play an important role in tumor initiation and progression and can serve as novel cancer biomarkers. However, the clinical importance of individual splice variants and the mechanisms by which they can perturb cellular functions are still poorly understood. To address these issues, we developed an efficient and robust computational method to: (1) identify splice variants that are associated with patient survival in a statistically significant manner; and (2) predict rewired protein-protein interactions that may result from altered patterns of expression of such variants. We applied our method to the lung adenocarcinoma dataset from TCGA and identified splice variants that are significantly associated with patient survival and can alter protein-protein interactions. Among these variants, several are implicated in DNA repair through homologous recombination. To computationally validate our findings, we characterized the mutational signatures in patients, grouped by low and high expression of a splice variant associated with patient survival and involved in DNA repair. The results of the mutational signature analysis are in agreement with the molecular mechanism suggested by our method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to build a computational approach to systematically identify splice variants associated with patient survival that can also generate experimentally testable, mechanistic hypotheses. Code for identifying survival-significant splice variants using the Null Empirically Estimated P-value method can be found at https://github.com/thecodingdoc/neep.

Spatio-temporal sequences of neuronal activity are observed in many brain regions in a variety of tasks and are thought to form the basis of meaningful behavior. However, mechanisms by which a neuronal network can generate spatio-temporal activity sequences have remained obscure. Existing models are biologically untenable because they either require manual embedding of a feedforward network within a random network or supervised learning to train the connectivity of a network to generate sequences. Here, we propose a biologically plausible, generative rule to create spatio-temporal activity sequences in a network model of spiking neurons with distance-dependent connectivity. We show that the emergence of spatio-temporal activity sequences requires: (1) individual neurons preferentially project a small fraction of their axons in a specific direction, and (2) the preferential projection direction of neighboring neurons is similar. Thus, an anisotropic but correlated connectivity of neuron groups suffices to generate spatio-temporal activity sequences in an otherwise random neuronal network model.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tQQooQPDRuI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Non-muscle myosin II (NMII)-induced multicellular contractility is essential for development, maintenance and remodeling of tissue morphologies. Dysregulation of the cytoskeleton can lead to birth defects or enable cancer progression. We demonstrate that the Matrigel patterning assay, widely used to characterize endothelial cells, is a highly sensitive tool to evaluate cell contractility within a soft extracellular matrix (ECM) environment. We propose a computational model to explore how cell-exerted contractile forces can tear up the cell-Matrigel composite material and gradually remodel it into a network structure. We identify measures that are characteristic for cellular contractility and can be obtained from image analysis of the recorded patterning process. The assay was calibrated by inhibition of NMII activity in A431 epithelial carcinoma cells either directly with blebbistatin or indirectly with Y27632 Rho kinase inhibitor. Using Matrigel patterning as a bioassay, we provide the first functional demonstration that overexpression of S100A4, a calcium-binding protein that is frequently overexpressed in metastatic tumors and inhibits NMIIA activity by inducing filament disassembly, effectively reduces cell contractility.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ABGLY4EUD6c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Characterizing cellular responses to different extrinsic signals is an active area of research, and curated pathway databases describe these complex signaling reactions. Here, we revisit a fundamental question in signaling pathway analysis: are two molecules “connected” in a network? This question is the first step towards understanding the potential influence of molecules in a pathway, and the answer depends on the choice of modeling framework. We examined the connectivity of Reactome signaling pathways using four different pathway representations. We find that Reactome is very well connected as a graph, moderately well connected as a compound graph or bipartite graph, and poorly connected as a hypergraph (which captures many-to-many relationships in reaction networks). We present a novel relaxation of hypergraph connectivity that iteratively increases connectivity from a node while preserving the hypergraph topology. This measure, &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;-relaxation distance, provides a parameterized transition between hypergraph connectivity and graph connectivity. &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;-relaxation distance is sensitive to the presence of small molecules that participate in many functionally unrelated reactions in the network. We also define a score that quantifies one pathway’s downstream influence on another, which can be calculated as &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;-relaxation distance gradually relaxes the connectivity constraint in hypergraphs. Computing this score across all pairs of 34 Reactome pathways reveals pairs of pathways with statistically significant influence. We present two such case studies, and we describe the specific reactions that contribute to the large influence score. Finally, we investigate the ability for connectivity measures to capture functional relationships among proteins, and use the evidence channels in the STRING database as a benchmark dataset. STRING interactions whose proteins are &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;-connected in Reactome have statistically significantly higher scores than interactions connected in the bipartite graph representation. Our method lays the groundwork for other generalizations of graph-theoretic concepts to hypergraphs in order to facilitate signaling pathway analysis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xGM-IKDTWiY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Topological gene-set analysis has emerged as a powerful means for omic data interpretation. Although numerous methods for identifying dysregulated genes have been proposed, few of them aim to distinguish genes that are the real source of perturbation from those that merely respond to the signal dysregulation. Here, we propose a new method, called SourceSet, able to distinguish between the primary and the secondary dysregulation within a Gaussian graphical model context. The proposed method compares gene expression profiles in the control and in the perturbed condition and detects the differences in both the mean and the covariance parameters with a series of likelihood ratio tests. The resulting evidence is used to infer the primary and the secondary set, i.e. the genes responsible for the primary dysregulation, and the genes affected by the perturbation through network propagation. The proposed method demonstrates high specificity and sensitivity in different simulated scenarios and on several real biological case studies. In order to fit into the more traditional pathway analysis framework, SourceSet R package also extends the analysis from a single to multiple pathways and provides several graphical outputs, including Cytoscape visualization to browse the results.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Abr9RrGaERA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: A Naturalistic Approach to the Hard Problem of Consciousness</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00058</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Following a brief review of current efforts to identify the neuronal correlates of conscious processing (NCCP) an attempt is made to bridge the gap between the material neuronal processes and the immaterial dimensions of subjective experience. It is argued that this “hard problem” of consciousness research cannot be solved by only considering the neuronal underpinnings of cognition. The proposal is that the hard problem can be treated within a naturalistic framework if one considers not only the biological but also the socio-cultural dimensions of evolution. The argument is based on the following premises: perceptions are the result of a constructivist process that depends on priors. This applies both for perceptions of the outer world and the perception of oneself. Social interactions between agents endowed with the cognitive abilities of humans generated immaterial realities, addressed as social or cultural realities. This novel class of realities assumed the role of priors for the perception of oneself and the embedding world. A natural consequence of these extended perceptions is a dualist classification of observables into material and immaterial phenomena nurturing the concept of ontological substance dualism. It is argued that perceptions shaped by socio-cultural priors lead to the construction of a self-model that has both a material and an immaterial dimension. As priors are implicit and not amenable to conscious recollection the perceived immaterial dimension is experienced as veridical and not derivable from material processes—which is the hallmark of the hard problem. These considerations let the hard problem appear as the result of cognitive constructs that are amenable to naturalistic explanations in an evolutionary framework.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Role of Microglia and Astrocytes in Huntington’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00258</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Huntington’s disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease. HD patients present with movement disorders, behavioral and psychiatric symptoms and cognitive decline. This review summarizes the contribution of microglia and astrocytes to HD pathophysiology. Neuroinflammation in the HD brain is characterized by a reactive morphology in these glial cells. Microglia and astrocytes are critical in regulating neuronal activity and maintaining an optimal milieu for neuronal function. Previous studies provide evidence that activated microglia and reactive astrocytes contribute to HD pathology through transcriptional activation of pro-inflammatory genes to perpetuate a chronic inflammatory state. Reactive astrocytes also display functional changes in glutamate and ion homeostasis and energy metabolism. Astrocytic and microglial changes may further contribute to the neuronal death observed with the progression of HD. Importantly, the degree to which these neuroinflammatory changes are detrimental to neurons and contribute to the progression of HD pathology is not well understood. Furthermore, recent observations provide compelling evidence that activated microglia and astrocytes exert a variety of beneficial functions that are essential for limiting tissue damage and preserving neuronal function in the HD brain. Therefore, a better understanding of the neuroinflammatory environment in the brain in HD may lead to the development of targeted and innovative therapeutic opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Histone H3K9 Trimethylation Downregulates the Expression of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor in the Dorsal Hippocampus and Impairs Memory Formation During Anaesthesia and Surgery</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00246</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is essential for cognitive and memory functions. Abnormal BDNF expression in the central nervous system may impair these functions. Anaesthesia and surgery can induce perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND). Clinical studies show that BDNF expression is decreased in patients presenting with cognitive impairment after anaesthesia and surgery. However, the molecular mechanism is still unclear. Epigenetic regulation plays an important role in cognition. The hypermethylation of H3K9 is crucial for transcriptional silencing and the onset of cognitive disorders. Here, we hypothesised that H3K9 trimethylation repressed BDNF expression and impaired memory formation or recall during anaesthesia and surgery. Laparotomy under isoflurane inhalation anaesthesia, behavioural tests, Western blotting, quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and immunohistochemistry were used in this study. BDNF expression was decreased in the hippocampus after anaesthesia and surgery. Cognitive impairment affected memory formation but not recall. The trimethylation of H3K9 downregulated BDNF expression. The overexpression of BDNF or use of exogenous BDNF improved the impairment of memory formation caused by anaesthesia and surgery. Therefore, inhibiting H3K9 trimethylation and increasing the expression of BDNF may help prevent PND in the clinical setting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01132</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation (nGVS) has been shown to improve motor performance in people with and without disabilities. Previous investigations on the use of nGVS to improve upper-limb motor performance have focused on unimanual fine motor movements, nevertheless, bimanual gross movements are also essential for conducting activities of daily living and can be affected as a result of cerebral dysfunction. Consequently, in this study we investigated the effects of nGVS on bimanual gross motor performance.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Twelve healthy participants completed a visuomotor task in which they performed bimanual upper-limb movements using two robots. During the task, participants tracked a target that oscillated following a sinusoidal amplitude-modulated trajectory. In half of the trials, participants received subthreshold nGVS, in the other half, they received sham stimulation. Primary outcome measure: percent improvement in root mean square error (RMSE) between the target’s and cursors’ trajectories. Secondary outcome measures: percent improvement in lag between the cursors and target; and percent improvement in RMSE between the cursors’ trajectories. A post-test questionnaire was administered to evaluate the experience of participants.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Tracking error was not affected by nGVS: left −2.6(5.5)%, p = 0.128; right −0.9(6.2)%, p = 0.639; nor was bimanual coordination −1.5(9.6)%, p = 0.590. When comparing if one hand was affected more than the other, we did not find a statistically significant difference (−1.7(3.3)%, p = 0.098). Similar results were found for the lag. Questionnaire results indicated that the robotic devices did not limit participants’ movements, did not make participants feel unsafe, nor were they difficult to control. Furthermore, participants did not feel unsafe with the nGVS device, nor did they report any discomfort due to nGVS.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Results suggest that nGVS applied to people without disabilities do not affect bimanual gross motor performance. However, as this was the first study to investigate such effects, stimulation parameters were based on previous unimanual fine motor studies. Future studies should investigate optimal stimulation parameters for improving upper-limb gross motor performance. Overall, participants felt safe using the robotic devices and receiving the noisy electrical stimulation. As such, a similar setup could potentially be employed for subsequent studies investigating the relation between upper-limb performance and nGVS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Diabetes leads to an elevated risk of stroke and worse functional outcome compared to the general population. We investigate whether L-4F, an economical ApoA-I mimetic peptide, reduces neurovascular and white-matter damage in db/db type-2 diabetic (T2DM) stroke mice. L-4F (16 mg/kg, subcutaneously administered initially 2 h after stroke and subsequently daily for 4 days) reduced hemorrhagic transformation, decreased infarct-volume and mortality, and treated mice exhibited increased cerebral arteriole diameter and smooth muscle cell number, decreased blood-brain barrier leakage and white-matter damage in the ischemic brain as well as improved neurological functional outcome after stroke compared with vehicle-control T2DM mice (p &amp;lt; 0.05, n = 11/group). Moreover, administration of L-4F mitigated macrophage infiltration, and reduced the level of proinflammatory mediators tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), high-mobility group box-1 (HMGB-1)/advanced glycation end-product receptor (RAGE) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in the ischemic brain in T2DM mice (p &amp;lt; 0.05, n = 6/group). In vitro, L-4F treatment did not increase capillary-like tube formation in mouse-brain endothelial cells, but increased primary artery explant cell migration derived from C57BL/6-aorta 1 day after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo), and enhanced neurite-outgrowth after 2 h of oxygen-glucose deprivation and axonal-outgrowth in primary cortical neurons derived from the C57BL/6-embryos subjected to high-glucose condition. This study suggests that early treatment with L-4F provides a potential strategy to reduce neuroinflammation and vascular and white-matter damage in the T2DM stroke population.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: The Relationship Between Local Field Potentials and the Blood-Oxygenation-Level Dependent MRI Signal Can Be Non-linear</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01126</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is currently one of the most important neuroimaging methods in neuroscience. The image contrast in fMRI relies on the blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) signal, which indirectly reflects neural activity through neurovascular coupling. Because the mechanism that links the BOLD signal to neural activities involves multiple complicated processes, where neural activity, regional metabolism, hemodynamics, and the BOLD signal are all inter-connected, understanding the quantitative relationship between the BOLD signal and the underlying neural activities is crucial for interpreting fMRI data. Simultaneous local field potential (LFP) and fMRI recordings provide a method to study neurovascular coupling. There were a few studies that have shown non-linearities in stimulus related responses, but whether there is any non-linearity in LFP—BOLD relationship at rest has not been specifically quantified. In this study, we analyzed the simultaneous LFP and resting state-fMRI data acquired from rodents, and found that the relationship between LFP and BOLD is non-linear under isoflurane (ISO) anesthesia, but linear under dexmedetomidine (DMED) anesthesia. Subsequent analysis suggests that such non-linearity may come from the non-Gaussian distribution of LFP power and switching from LFP power to LFP amplitude can alleviate the problem to a degree. We also confirmed that, despite the non-linearity in the mean LFP—BOLD curve, the Pearson correlation between the two signals is relatively unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: The Impact of the Geometric Correction Scheme on MEG Functional Topology at Rest</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01114</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spontaneous activity is correlated across brain regions in large scale networks (RSN) closely resembling those recruited during several behavioral tasks and characterized by functional specialization and dynamic integration. Specifically, MEG studies revealed a set of central regions (dynamic core) possibly facilitating communication among differently specialized brain systems. However, source projected MEG signals, due to the fundamentally ill-posed inverse problem, are affected by spatial leakage, leading to the estimation of spurious, blurred connections that may affect the topological properties of brain networks and their integration. To reduce leakage effects, several correction schemes have been proposed including the Geometric Correction Scheme (GCS) whose theory, simulations and empirical results on topography of a few RSNs were already presented. However, its impact on the estimation of fundamental graph measures used to describe the architecture of interactions among brain regions has not been investigated yet. Here, we estimated dense, MEG band-limited power connectomes in theta, alpha, beta, and gamma bands from 13 healthy subjects (all young adults). We compared the connectivity and topology of MEG uncorrected and GCS-corrected connectomes. The use of GCS considerably reorganized the topology of connectivity, reducing the local, within-hemisphere interactions mainly in the beta and gamma bands and increasing across-hemisphere interactions mainly in the alpha and beta bands. Moreover, the number of hubs decreased in the alpha and beta bands, but the centrality of some fundamental regions such as the Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC), Supplementary Motor Area (SMA) and Middle Prefrontal Cortex (MPFC) remained strong in all bands, associated to an increase of the Global Efficiency and a decrease of Modularity. As a comparison, we applied orthogonalization on connectomes and ran the same topological analyses. The correlation values were considerably reduced, and orthogonalization mainly decreased local within-hemisphere interactions in all bands, similarly to GCS. Notably, the centrality of the PCC, SMA and MPFC was preserved in all bands, as for GCS, together with other hubs in the posterior parietal regions. Overall, leakage correction removes spurious local connections, but confirms the role of dynamic hub regions, specifically the anterior and posterior cingulate, in integrating information in the brain at rest.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cognitive control of emotions depends on intermodular long-distance communications. However, negative connections between connector hubs are removed by traditional hard-thresholding approach in graph-theoretical research. Using soft-thresholding approach to reserve negative links, we explore time-varying features of connector hubs in intermodular communications during cognitive control of affective pictures. We develop a novel approach to sparse functional networks and construct negatively linking connector networks for positive, negative, and neutral pictures. We find that consisting of flexible hubs, the frontoparietal system dynamically top–down inhibits neural activities through negative connections from the salience subnetwork and visual processing area. Moreover, the shared connectors form functional backbones that dynamically reconfigure according to differently-valenced pictures in order to coordinate both stability and flexibility of cognitive connector networks. These results reveal the necessity of conserving negative links between intermodular communications in chronnectome research and deepen the understanding of how connector networks dynamically evolute during cognitive control of affective processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;While common semantic representations for individual words across languages have been identified, a common meaning system at sentence-level has not been determined. In this study, fMRI was used to investigate whether an across-language sentence comprehension system exists. Chinese–Japanese bilingual participants (n = 32) were asked to determine whether two consecutive stimuli were related (coherent) or not (incoherent) to the same event. Stimuli were displayed with three different modalities (Chinese written sentences, Japanese written sentences, and pictures). The behavioral results showed no significant difference in accuracy and response times among the three modalities. Multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) of fMRI data was used to classify the semantic relationship (coherent or incoherent) across the stimulus modalities. The classifier was first trained to determine coherency within Chinese sentences and then tested with Japanese sentences, and vice versa. A whole-brain searchlight analysis revealed significant above-chance classification accuracy across Chinese and Japanese sentences in the supramarginal gyrus (BA 40), extending into the angular gyrus (BA 39) as well as the opercular (BA 44) and triangular (BA 45) parts of the inferior frontal gyrus in the left hemisphere (cluster-level FWE corrected p &amp;lt; 0.05). Significant above-chance classification accuracy was also found across Japanese sentences and pictures in the supramarginal (BA 40) and angular gyrus (BA 39). These results indicate that a common meaning system for sentence processing across languages and modalities exists, and it involves the left inferior parietal gyrus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Attenuation in P300 amplitude has been characterized in a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders such as dementia, schizophrenia, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, it is unclear whether the attenuation observed in the averaged event-related potential (ERP) is due to the reduction of neural resources available for cognitive processing, the decreased consistency of cognitive resource allocation, or the increased instability of cognitive processing speed. In this study, we investigated this problem by estimating single-trial P300 amplitude and latency using a modified Woody filter and examined the relation between amplitudes and latencies from the single-trial level to the averaged ERP level. ERPs were recorded from 30 military service members returning from combat deployment at two time points separated by 6 or 12 months. A conventional visual oddball task was used to elicit P300. We observed that the extent of changes in the within-subject average P300 amplitude over time was significantly correlated with the amount of change in three single-trial measures: (1) the latency variance of the single-trial P300 (r = −0.440, p = 0.0102); (2) the percentage of P300-absent trials (r = −0.488, p = 0.005); and (3) the consistent variation of the single-trial amplitude (r = 0.571, p = 0.0022). These findings suggest that there are multiple underlying mechanisms on the single-trial level that contribute to the changes in amplitudes seen at the averaged ERP level. The changes between the first and second assessments were quantified with the intraclass correlation coefficient, the standard error of measurement and the minimal detectable difference. The unique population, the small sample size and the large fraction of participants lost to follow up precludes generalizations of these measures of change to other populations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Stereoscopic Rendering via Goggles Elicits Higher Functional Connectivity During Virtual Reality Gaming</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00365</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Virtual reality (VR) simulates real-world scenarios by creating a sense of presence in its users. Such immersive scenarios lead to behavior that is more similar to that displayed in real world settings, which may facilitate the transfer of knowledge and skills acquired in VR to similar real world situations. VR has already been used in education, psychotherapy, rehabilitation and it comes as an appealing choice for training intervention purposes. The aim of the present study was to investigate to what extent VR technology for games presented via goggles can be used in a magnetic resonance imaging scanner (MRI), addressing the question of whether brain connectivity differs between VR stimulation via goggles and a presentation from a screen via mirror projection. Moreover, we wanted to investigate whether stereoscopic goggle stimulation, where both eyes receive different visual input, would elicit stronger brain connectivity than a stimulation in which both eyes receive the same visual input (monoscopic). To our knowledge, there is no previous research using games and functional connectivity (FC) in MRI to address this question. Multiple analyses approaches were taken so that different aspects of brain connectivity could be covered: fractional low-frequency fluctuation, independent component analysis (ICA), seed-based FC (SeedFC) and graph analysis. In goggle presentation (mono and stereoscopic) as contrasted to screen, we found differences in brain activation in left cerebellum and postcentral gyrus as well as differences in connectivity in the visual cortex and frontal inferior cortex [when focusing on the visual and default mode network (DMN)]. When considering connectivity in specific areas of interest, we found higher connectivity between bilateral superior frontal cortex and the temporal lobe, as well as bilateral inferior parietal cortex with right calcarine and right lingual cortex. Furthermore, we found superior frontal cortex and insula/putamen to be more strongly connected in goggle stereoscopic vs. goggle monoscopic, in line with our hypothesis. We assume that the condition that elicits higher brain connectivity values should be most suited for long-term brain training interventions given that, extended training under these conditions could permanently improve brain connectivity on a functional as well as on a structural level.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Interaction of the Psychiatric Risk Gene Cacna1c With Post-weaning Social Isolation or Environmental Enrichment Does Not Affect Brain Mitochondrial Bioenergetics in Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00483</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders involves complex interactions between genetic and environmental risk factors. Confirmed by several genome-wide association studies, Cacna1c represents one of the most robustly replicated psychiatric risk genes. Besides genetic predispositions, environmental stress such as childhood maltreatment also contributes to enhanced disease vulnerability. Both, Cacna1c gene variants and stressful life events are associated with morphological alterations in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus. Emerging evidence suggests impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics as a possible underlying mechanism of these regional brain abnormalities. In the present study, we simulated the interaction of psychiatric disease-relevant genetic and environmental factors in rodents to investigate their potential effect on brain mitochondrial function using a constitutive heterozygous Cacna1c rat model in combination with a four-week exposure to either post-weaning social isolation, standard housing, or social and physical environmental enrichment. Mitochondria were isolated from the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus to evaluate their bioenergetics, membrane potential, reactive oxygen species production, and respiratory chain complex protein levels. None of these parameters were considerably affected in this particular gene-environment setting. These negative results were very robust in all tested conditions demonstrating that Cacna1c depletion did not significantly translate into altered bioenergetic characteristics. Thus, further investigations are required to determine the disease-related effects on brain mitochondria.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Alteration of Musashi1 Intra-cellular Distribution During Regeneration Following Gentamicin-Induced Hair Cell Loss in the Guinea Pig Crista Ampullaris</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00481</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The mechanism underlying hair cell (HC) regeneration in the mammalian inner ear is still under debate. Understanding what molecules regulate the HC regeneration in mature mammals will be the key to the treatment of the inner ear disorder. Musashi1 (MSI1) is an RNA binding protein associated with asymmetric division and maintenance of stem cell function as a modulator of the Notch-1 signaling pathway. In this study, we investigated the cellular proliferative activity and changes in spatiotemporal pattern of MSI1 expression in the gentamicin (GM)-treated crista ampullaris (CA) in guinea pigs. Although the vestibular HCs in the CA almost disappeared at 14 days after injecting GM in the inner ear, the density of vestibular HCs spontaneously increased by up to 50% relative to controls at 56 days post-GM treatment (PT). The number of the type II HCs was significantly increased at 28 days PT relative to 14 days PT (p &amp;lt; 0.01) while that of type I HCs or supporting cells (SCs) did not change. The number of SCs did not change through the observational period. Administration of bromodeoxyuridine with the same GM treatment showed that the cell proliferation activity was high in SCs between 14 and 28 days PT. The changes in spatiotemporal patterns of MSI1 expression during spontaneous HC regeneration following GM treatment showed that MSI1-immunoreactivity was diffusely spread into the cytoplasm of the SCs during 7–21 days PT whereas the expression of MSI1 was confined to the nucleus of SCs in the other period. The MSI1/MYO7A double-positive cells were observed at 21 days PT. These results suggest that regeneration of vestibular HCs might originate in the asymmetric cell division and differentiation of SCs and that MSI1 might be involved in controlling the process of vestibular HC regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Reward-Related Behavioral, Neurochemical and Electrophysiological Changes in a Rat Model of Autism Based on Prenatal Exposure to Valproic Acid</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00479</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Prenatal exposure to the antiepileptic drug valproic acid (VPA) induces autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in humans and autistic-like behaviors in rodents, which makes it a good model to study the neural underpinnings of ASD. Rats prenatally exposed to VPA show profound deficits in the social domain. The altered social behavior displayed by VPA-exposed rats may be due to either a deficit in social reward processing or to a more general inability to properly understand and respond to social signals. To address this issue, we performed behavioral, electrophysiological and neurochemical experiments and tested the involvement of the brain reward system in the social dysfunctions displayed by rats prenatally exposed to VPA (500 mg/kg). We found that, compared to control animals, VPA-exposed rats showed reduced play responsiveness together with impaired sociability in the three-chamber test and altered social discrimination abilities. In addition, VPA-exposed rats showed altered expression of dopamine receptors together with inherent hyperexcitability of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). However, when tested for socially-induced conditioned place preference, locomotor response to amphetamine and sucrose preference, control and VPA-exposed rats performed similarly, indicating normal responses to social, drug and food rewards. On the basis of the results obtained, we hypothesize that social dysfunctions displayed by VPA-exposed rats are more likely caused by alterations in cognitive aspects of the social interaction, such as the interpretation and reciprocation of social stimuli and/or the ability to adjust the social behavior of the individual to the changing circumstances in the social and physical environment, rather than to inability to enjoy the pleasurable aspects of the social interaction. The observed neurochemical and electrophysiological alterations in the NAc may contribute to the inability of VPA-exposed rats to process and respond to social cues, or, alternatively, represent a compensatory mechanism towards VPA-induced neurodevelopmental insults.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Microglial Morphometric Parameters Correlate With the Expression Level of IL-1β, and Allow Identifying Different Activated Morphotypes</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00472</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microglia are the resident macrophages in the brain. Traditionally, two forms of microglia have been described: one considered as a resting/surveillant state in which cells have a highly branched morphology, and another considered as an activated state in which they acquire a de-ramified or amoeboid form. However, many studies describe intermediate microglial morphologies which emerge during pathological processes. Since microglial form and function are closely related, it is of interest to correlate microglial morphology with the extent of its activation. To address this issue, we used a rat model of neuroinflammation consisting in a single injection of the enzyme neuraminidase (NA) within the lateral ventricle. Sections from NA-injected animals were co-immunolabeled with the microglial marker IBA1 and the cytokine IL-1β, which highlight features of the cell’s shape and inflammatory activation, respectively. Activated (IL-1β positive) microglial cells were sampled from the dorsal hypothalamus nearby the third ventricle. Images of single microglial cells were processed in two different ways to obtain (1) an accurate measure of the level of expression of IL-1β (indicating the degree of activation), and (2) a set of 15 morphological parameters to quantitatively and objectively describe the cell’s shape. A simple regression analysis revealed a dependence of most of the morphometric parameters on IL-1β expression, demonstrating that the morphology of microglial cells changes progressively with the degree of activation. Moreover, a hierarchical cluster analysis pointed out four different morphotypes of activated microglia, which are characterized not only by morphological parameters values, but also by specific IL-1β expression levels. Thus, these results demonstrate in an objective manner that the activation of microglial cells is a gradual process, and correlates with their morphological change. Even so, it is still possible to categorize activated cells according to their morphometric parameters, each category presenting a different activation degree. The physiological relevance of those activated morphotypes is an issue worth to be assessed in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Crowd Control: Effects of Physical Crowding on Cargo Movement in Healthy and Diseased Neurons</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00470</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;High concentration of cytoskeletal filaments, organelles, and proteins along with the space constraints due to the axon’s narrow geometry lead inevitably to intracellular physical crowding along the axon of a neuron. Local cargo movement is essential for maintaining steady cargo transport in the axon, and this may be impeded by physical crowding. Molecular motors that mediate active transport share movement mechanisms that allow them to bypass physical crowding present on microtubule tracks. Many neurodegenerative diseases, irrespective of how they are initiated, show increased physical crowding owing to the greater number of stalled organelles and structural changes associated with the cytoskeleton. Increased physical crowding may be a significant factor in slowing cargo transport to synapses, contributing to disease progression and culminating in the dying back of the neuronal process. This review explores the idea that physical crowding can impede cargo movement along the neuronal process. We examine the sources of physical crowding and strategies used by molecular motors that might enable cargo to circumvent physically crowded locations. Finally, we describe sub-cellular changes in neurodegenerative diseases that may alter physical crowding and discuss the implications of such changes on cargo movement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Inhibition of HDAC4 Attenuated JNK/c-Jun-Dependent Neuronal Apoptosis and Early Brain Injury Following Subarachnoid Hemorrhage by Transcriptionally Suppressing MKK7</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00468</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/c-Jun cascade-dependent neuronal apoptosis has been identified as a central element for early brain injury (EBI) following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), but the molecular mechanisms underlying this process are still thoroughly undefined to date. In this study, we found that pan-histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition by TSA, SAHA, VPA, and M344 led to a remarkable decrease in the phosphorylation of JNK and c-Jun, concomitant with a significant abrogation of apoptosis caused by potassium deprivation in cultured cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs). Further investigation showed that these effects resulted from HDAC inhibition-induced transcriptional suppression of MKK7, a well-known upstream kinase of JNK. Using small interference RNAs (siRNAs) to silence the respective HDAC members, HDAC4 was screened to be required for MKK7 transcription and JNK/c-Jun activation. LMK235, a specific HDAC4 inhibitor, dose-dependently suppressed MKK7 transcription and JNK/c-Jun activity. Functionally, HDAC4 inhibition via knockdown or LMK235 significantly rescued CGN apoptosis induced by potassium deprivation. Moreover, administration of LMK235 remarkably ameliorated the EBI process in SAH rats, associated with an obvious reduction in MKK7 transcription, JNK/c-Jun activity, and neuronal apoptosis. Collectively, the findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of neuronal apoptosis regarding HDAC4 in the selective regulation of MKK7 transcription and JNK/c-Jun activity. HDAC4 inhibition could be a potential alternative to prevent MKK7/JNK/c-Jun axis-mediated nervous disorders, including SAH-caused EBI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Gpr158 Deficiency Impacts Hippocampal CA1 Neuronal Excitability, Dendritic Architecture, and Affects Spatial Learning</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00465</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;G-protein-coupled receptor 158 (Gpr158) is highly expressed in striatum, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. It gained attention as it was implicated in physiological responses to stress and depression. Recently, Gpr158 has been shown to act as a pathway-specific synaptic organizer in the hippocampus, required for proper mossy fiber-CA3 neurocircuitry establishment, structure, and function. Although rodent Gpr158 expression is highest in CA3, considerable expression occurs in CA1 especially after the first postnatal month. Here, we combined hippocampal-dependent behavioral paradigms with subsequent electrophysiological and morphological analyses from the same group of mice to assess the effects of Gpr158 deficiency on CA1 physiology and function. We demonstrate deficits in spatial memory acquisition and retrieval in the Morris water maze paradigm, along with deficits in the acquisition of extinction memory in the passive avoidance test in Gpr158 KO mice. Electrophysiological recordings from CA1 pyramidal neurons revealed normal basal excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission, however, Schaffer collateral stimulation yielded dramatically reduced post-synaptic currents. Interestingly, intrinsic excitability of CA1 pyramidals was found increased, potentially acting as a compensatory mechanism to the reductions in Schaffer collateral-mediated drive. Both ex vivo and in vitro, neurons deficient for or with lowered levels of Gpr158 exhibited robust reductions in dendritic architecture and complexity, i.e., reduced length, surface, bifurcations, and branching. This effect was localized in the apical but not basal dendrites of adult CA1 pyramidals, indicative of compartment-specific alterations. A significant positive correlation between spatial memory acquisition and extent of complexity of CA1 pyramidals was found. Taken together, we provide first evidence of significant disruptions in hippocampal CA1 neuronal dendritic architecture and physiology, driven by Gpr158 deficiency. Importantly, the hippocampal neuronal morphology deficits appear to support the impairments in spatial memory acquisition observed in Gpr158 KO mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Despite its extensive use in clinical studies, the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) remain to be elucidated. We previously described subacute effects of tDCS on immune- and stem cells in the rat brain. To investigate the more immediate effects of tDCS regulating those cellular responses, we treated rats with a single session of either anodal or cathodal tDCS, and analyzed the gene expression by microarray; sham-stimulated rats served as control. Anodal tDCS increased expression of several genes coding for the major histocompatibility complex I (MHC I), while cathodal tDCS increased the expression of the immunoregulatory protein osteopontin (OPN). We confirmed the effects of gene upregulation by immunohistochemistry at the protein level. Thus, our data show a novel mechanism for the actions of tDCS on immune- and inflammatory processes, providing a target for future therapeutic studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00297</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Rare variants in triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) have been identified as risk factors for AD. Soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a potential and novel biomarker of neuroinflammation implicated in the onset and progression of AD. To explore the roles of CSF sTREM2 on the pathogenesis of AD, we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) by using the data from Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We found CSF sTREM2 levels were elevated with the disease stages, but there was no significant difference between that of AD patients and normal participants. CSF sTREM2 was positively correlated with CSF total tau and phosphorylated-tau levels (ρ &amp;gt; 0.35, p &amp;lt; 1e-06; ρ &amp;gt; 0.32, p &amp;lt; 1e-05, respectively) for all disease states. We identified the most significant CSF sTREM2 related locus was rs7232 (FDR = 3.01e-08), a missense variant in MS4A6A gene of chromosome 11. Moreover, we also detected rs7232 was highly associated with MS4A6A gene expression (FDR = 1.37e-18). In addition, our pathway analysis for our significant GWAS results showed that biological processes for regulation of viruses and immune response were highly overrepresented or enriched. Our study suggests that CSF sTREM2 plays an informative role in AD progression. Moreover, CSF sTREM2 and AD is highly related to viral infections and immune response.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Effect of Systemic Inflammation on Rat Attentional Function and Neuroinflammation: Possible Protective Role for Food Restriction</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00296</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Aging is characterized by subtle cognitive decline, which correlates with increased peripheral inflammation. Acute activation of the peripheral immune system, via lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection, elicits deficits in hippocampal-dependent spatial memory. Little is known concerning the effect of chronic inflammation on prefrontal cortex (PFC)-dependent vigilance. We examined the impact of repeated LPS injections in young and middle-age rats on the 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT), expecting repeated LPS treatment to induce attentional deficits with greater disruption in middle-age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Male Fischer-344 rats, 4- and 12-months-old, were food restricted and trained on the 5-CSRTT. Once rats reached criterion, they were injected with LPS (1 mg/kg, i.p.) weekly for 4 weeks and testing started 48 h after each injection. To examine the possibility that mild food restriction inherent to the behavioral task influenced inflammation markers, a second group of food-restricted or ad-lib-fed rats was assessed for cytokine changes 48 h after one injection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Performing LPS-treated rats exhibited a sickness response, manifesting as reduced initiated and completed trials during the first week but recovered by the second week of testing. After the first week, LPS-treated rats continued to exhibit longer response latencies, despite no change in food retrieval latency, suggestive of LPS-induced cognitive slowing. Similarly, LPS-induced impairment of attention was observed as increased omissions with heightened cognitive demand and increased age. Repeated LPS-treatment increased the level of PFC IL-1α, and PFC IL-6 was marginally higher in middle-age rats. No effect of age or treatment was observed for plasma cytokines in performing rats. Histological examination of microglia indicated increased colocalization of Iba1+ and CD68+ cells from middle-age relative to young rats. Examination of food restriction demonstrated an attenuation of age- and LPS-related increases in plasma cytokine levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Systemic inflammation, induced through LPS treatment, impaired attentional function, which was independent of sickness and exacerbated by increased cognitive demand and increased age. Additional studies revealed that food restriction, associated with the task, attenuated markers of neuroinflammation and plasma cytokines. The results emphasize the need for improved methods for modeling low-level chronic systemic inflammation to effectively examine its impact on attention during aging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pathogenic variants in &lt;i&gt;KCNB1&lt;/i&gt;, encoding the voltage‐gated potassium channel K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1, are associated with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE). Previous functional studies on a limited number of &lt;i&gt;KCNB1&lt;/i&gt; variants indicated a range of molecular mechanisms by which variants affect channel function, including loss of voltage sensitivity, loss of ion selectivity, and reduced cell‐surface expression.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We evaluated a series of 17 &lt;i&gt;KCNB1&lt;/i&gt; variants associated with DEE or other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) to rapidly ascertain channel dysfunction using high‐throughput functional assays. Specifically, we investigated the biophysical properties and cell‐surface expression of variant K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 channels expressed in heterologous cells using high‐throughput automated electrophysiology and immunocytochemistry–flow cytometry.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pathogenic variants exhibited diverse functional defects, including altered current density and shifts in the voltage dependence of activation and/or inactivation, as homotetramers or when coexpressed with wild‐type K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1. Quantification of protein expression also identified variants with reduced total K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 expression or deficient cell‐surface expression.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study establishes a platform for rapid screening of K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 functional defects caused by &lt;i&gt;KCNB1&lt;/i&gt; variants associated with DEE and other NDDs. This will aid in establishing &lt;i&gt;KCNB1&lt;/i&gt; variant pathogenicity and the mechanism of dysfunction, which will enable targeted strategies for therapeutic intervention based on molecular phenotype.

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the present study was to evaluate deep learning-based image-guided surgical planning for deep brain stimulation (DBS). We developed deep learning semantic segmentation-based DBS targeting and prospectively applied the method clinically.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;T2&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; fast gradient-echo images from 102 patients were used for training and validation. Manually drawn ground truth information was prepared for the subthalamic and red nuclei with an axial cut ∼4 mm below the anterior–posterior commissure line. A fully convolutional neural network (FCN-VGG-16) was used to ensure margin identification by semantic segmentation. Image contrast augmentation was performed nine times. Up to 102 original images and 918 augmented images were used for training and validation. The accuracy of semantic segmentation was measured in terms of mean accuracy and mean intersection over the union. Targets were calculated based on their relative distance from these segmented anatomical structures considering the Bejjani target.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Mean accuracies and mean intersection over the union values were high: 0.904 and 0.813, respectively, for the 62 training images, and 0.911 and 0.821, respectively, for the 558 augmented training images when 360 augmented validation images were used. The Dice coefficient converted from the intersection over the union was 0.902 when 720 training and 198 validation images were used. Semantic segmentation was adaptive to high anatomical variations in size, shape, and asymmetry. For clinical application, two patients were assessed: one with essential tremor and another with bradykinesia and gait disturbance due to Parkinson’s disease. Both improved without complications after surgery, and microelectrode recordings showed subthalamic nuclei signals in the latter patient.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The accuracy of deep learning-based semantic segmentation may surpass that of previous methods. DBS targeting and its clinical application were made possible using accurate deep learning-based semantic segmentation, which is adaptive to anatomical variations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Fornix Stimulation Induces Metabolic Activity and Dopaminergic Response in the Nucleus Accumbens</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01109</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Papez circuit, including the fornix white matter bundle, is a well-known neural network that is involved in multiple limbic functions such as memory and emotional expression. We previously reported a large-animal study of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the fornix that found stimulation-induced hemodynamic responses in both the medial limbic and corticolimbic circuits on functional resonance imaging (fMRI) and evoked dopamine responses in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), as measured by fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV). The effects of DBS on the fornix are challenging to analyze, given its structural complexity and connection to multiple neuronal networks. In this study, we extend our earlier work to a rodent model wherein we characterize regional brain activity changes resulting from fornix stimulation using fludeoxyglucose (&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG) micro positron emission tomography (PET) and monitor neurochemical changes using FSCV with pharmacological confirmation. Both global functional changes and local changes were measured in a rodent model of fornix DBS. Functional brain activity was measured by micro-PET, and the neurochemical changes in local areas were monitored by FSCV. Micro-PET images revealed increased glucose metabolism within the medial limbic and corticolimbic circuits. Neurotransmitter efflux induced by fornix DBS was monitored at NAc by FSCV and identified by specific neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitors. We found a significant increase in the metabolic activity in several key regions of the medial limbic circuits and dopamine efflux in the NAc following fornix stimulation. These results suggest that electrical stimulation of the fornix modulates the activity of brain memory circuits, including the hippocampus and NAc within the dopaminergic pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Functional MRI Readouts From BOLD and Diffusion Measurements Differentially Respond to Optogenetic Activation and Tissue Heating</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01104</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Functional blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) MRI provides a brain-wide readout that depends on the hemodynamic response to neuronal activity. Diffusion fMRI has been proposed as an alternative to BOLD fMRI and has been postulated to directly rely on neuronal activity. These complementary functional readouts are versatile tools to be combined with optogenetic stimulation to investigate networks of the brain. The cell-specificity and temporal precision of optogenetic manipulations promise to enable further investigation of the origin of fMRI signals. The signal characteristics of the diffusion fMRI readout vice versa may better resolve network effects of optogenetic stimulation. However, the light application needed for optogenetic stimulation is accompanied by heat deposition within the tissue. As both diffusion and BOLD are sensitive to temperature changes, light application can lead to apparent activations confounding the interpretation of fMRI data. The degree of tissue heating, the appearance of apparent activation in different fMRI sequences and the origin of these phenomena are not well understood. Here, we disentangled apparent activations in BOLD and diffusion measurements in rats from physiological activation upon sensory or optogenetic stimulation. Both, BOLD and diffusion fMRI revealed similar signal shapes upon sensory stimulation that differed clearly from those upon heating. Apparent activations induced by high-intensity light application were dominated by T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;-effects and resulted in mainly negative signal changes. We estimated that even low-intensity light application used for optogenetic stimulation reduces the BOLD response close to the fiber by up to 0.4%. The diffusion fMRI signal contained T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; and diffusion components. The apparent diffusion coefficient, which reflects the isolated diffusion component, showed negative changes upon both optogenetic and electric forepaw stimulation. In contrast, positive changes were detected upon high-intensity light application and thus ruled out heating as a major contributor to the diffusion fMRI signal.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Age-Related Changes in the Plasticity of Neural Networks Assessed by Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation With Electromyography: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00469</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: The excitability of cerebral cortical cells, neural pathway, and neural networks, as well as their plasticity, are key to our exploration of age-related changes in brain structure and function. The combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with electromyography (EMG) can be applied to the primary motor cortex; it activates the underlying neural group and passes through the corticospinal pathway, which can be quantified using EMG. This meta-analysis aimed to analyze changes in cortical excitability and plasticity in healthy elderly individuals vs. young individuals through TMS-EMG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: The Cochrane Library, Medline, and EMBASE databases were searched to identify eligible trials published from database inception to June 3, 2019. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and improved Jadad scale were used to assess the methodological quality. A meta-analysis of the comparative effects was conducted using the Review Manager 5.3 software and Stata 14.0 software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The pooled results revealed that the resting motor threshold values in the elderly group were markedly higher than those reported in the young group (mean difference [MD]: −2.35; 95% confidence interval [CI]: −3.69 to −1.02]; p &amp;lt; (0.00001). The motor evoked potential amplitude significantly reduced in the elderly group vs. the young group (MD: 0.18; 95% CI: 0.09–0.27; p &amp;lt; 0.0001). Moreover, there was significantly longer motor evoked potential latency in the elderly group (MD: −1.07; 95% CI: −1.77 to −0.37]; p =(0.003). There was no significant difference observed in the active motor threshold between the elderly and young groups (MD: −1.52; 95% CI: −3.47 to −0.42]; p =(0.13). Meanwhile, only two studies reported the absence of adverse events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: We found that the excitability of the cerebral cortex declined in elderly individuals vs. young individuals. The findings of the present analysis should be considered with caution owing to the methodological limitations in the included trials. Additional high-quality studies are warranted to validate our findings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: Environmental Enrichment From Birth Impacts Parvalbumin Expressing Cells and Wisteria Floribunda Agglutinin Labelled Peri-Neuronal Nets Within the Developing Murine Striatum</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2019.00090</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Environmental enrichment can dramatically affect both the development and function of neural circuits. This is accomplished, at least in part, by the regulation of inhibitory cellular networks and related extracellular matrix glycoprotein structures known as perineuronal nets. The degree to which enhanced housing can influence brain areas involved in the planning and execution of actions is not well known. We examined the effect of enriching mice from birth on parvalbumin expression and perineuronal net formation in developing and adult striatum. This input nucleus of the basal ganglia consists of topographically discernible regions that serve different functions, providing a means of simultaneously examining the influence of environmental factors on discrete, but related networks. Greater densities of striatal parvalbumin positive cells and wisteria floribunda agglutinin labelled perineuronal nets were present in enriched pups during the second postnatal week, primarily within the lateral portion of the nucleus. Housing conditions continued to have an impact into adulthood, with enriched mice exhibiting higher parvalbumin positive cell densities in both medial and lateral striatum. Curiously, no differences due to housing conditions were detected in striatal perineuronal net densities of mature animals. The degree of overlap between striatal parvalbumin expression and perineuronal net formation was also increased, suggesting that heightened neural activity associated with enrichment may have contributed to greater engagement of networks affiliated with cells that express the calcium binding protein. Brain derived neurotrophic factor, an important regulator of inhibitory network maturation, is also subtly, but significantly affected within the striatum of enriched cohorts. Together, these findings suggest that environmental enrichment can exert cell specific effects within different divisions of an area vital for the regulation of action.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Emerging Cognitive Intervention Technologies to Meet the Needs of an Aging Population: A Systematic Review</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00291</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Cognitive training helps to promote healthy aging and ease activities of daily living for older adults. Recently, experiments have been conducted using robots to perform this cognitive training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A review was conducted to examine the effects of computer-based cognitive interventions for older adults who were either healthy or experiencing mild cognitive impairment (MCI). A second study also examined the evolution of socially assistive robots (SAR) and their effectiveness at administering cognitive training for older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Eighty-one studies published between 2009 and 2019 were identified for review, 56 of which focused on computerized cognitive training (CCT) while 25 examined the use of robotics. Twenty-four of the 56 CCT studies met the inclusion criteria. These were further classified into two groups: studies which used self-designed programs, and studies using commercially available ones. Of the 25 studies examining the use of robotics in cognitive intervention 7 met the inclusion criteria. Review shows that CCT improves cognitive function but that robots are more effective tools for improving cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: It can be concluded that CCT is beneficial for older adults and though there are drawbacks to this approach they are overcome by the introduction of robots into the training process. Culture, language, and socio-economic considerations vis-a-vis robot design and training methodology should be included in future research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Conformational Dynamics of Transmembrane Domain 3 of Presenilin 1 Is Associated with the Trimming Activity of {gamma}-Secretase</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/43/8600?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;-Secretase is an intramembrane-cleaving protease that generates the toxic species of the amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) that is responsible for the pathology of Alzheimer disease. The catalytic subunit of -secretase is presenilin 1 (PS1), which is a polytopic membrane protein with a hydrophilic catalytic pore. The length of the C terminus of Aβ is proteolytically determined by its processive trimming by -secretase, although the precise mechanism still remains largely unknown. Here, we identified that transmembrane domain (TMD) 3 of human PS1 is involved in the formation of the intramembranous hydrophilic pore. Notably, the water accessibility of TMD3 was greatly altered by point mutations and compounds, which modify -secretase activity. The changes in the water accessibility of TMD3 was also correlated with Aβ42 production. Moreover, crosslinking between TMD3 and TMD7 resulted in a loss of sensitivity to a -secretase modulator that reduces Aβ42 production. Therefore, our findings indicate that the conformational dynamics of TMD3 is a prerequisite for regulation of the Aβ trimming activity of -secretase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Modulation of -secretase activity to reduce the level of toxic amyloid-β species is thought to be a therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer disease. However, the detailed mechanism of the regulation of amyloid-β production, as well as the structure-and-activity relationship of -secretase remains unclear. Here we identified that the water accessibility around transmembrane domain 3 in presenilin 1 was increased along with a reduction in toxic amyloid-β production. Our findings demonstrate how the structure of presenilin 1 dynamically changes during amyloid-β production, and provides insights toward the development of treatments against Alzheimer disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Risperidone Ameliorates Prefrontal Cortex Neural Atrophy and Oxidative/Nitrosative Stress in Brain and Peripheral Blood of Rats with Neonatal Ventral Hippocampus Lesion</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/43/8584?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Reduction of the dendritic arbor length and the lack of dendritic spines in the pyramidal cells of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are prevalent pathological features in schizophrenia (SZ). Neonatal ventral hippocampus lesion (NVHL) in male rats reproduces these neuronal characteristics and here we describe how this is a consequence of BDNF/TrkB pathway disruption. Moreover, COX-2 proinflammatory state, as well as Nrf-2 antioxidant impairment, triggers oxidative/nitrosative stress, which also contributes to dendritic spine impairments in the PFC. Interestingly, oxidative/nitrosative stress was also detected in the periphery of NVHL animals. Furthermore, risperidone treatment had a neurotrophic effect on the PFC and antioxidant effects on the brain and periphery of NVHL animals; these cellular effects were related to behavioral improvement. Our data highlight the link between brain development and immune response, as well as several other factors to understand mechanisms related to the pathophysiology of SZ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Prefrontal cortex dysfunction in schizophrenia can be a consequence of morphological abnormalities and oxidative/nitrosative stress, among others. Here, we detailed how impaired plasticity-related pathways and oxidative/nitrosative stress are part of the dendritic spine pathology and their modulation by atypical antipsychotic risperidone treatment in rats with neonatal ventral hippocampus lesion. Moreover, we found that animals with neonatal ventral hippocampus lesion had oxidative/nitrosative stress in the brain as well as in the peripheral blood, an important issue for the translational approaches of this model. Then, risperidone restored plasticity and reduced oxidative/nitrosative stress of prefrontal cortex pyramidal cells, and ultimately improved the behavior of lesioned animals. Moreover, risperidone had differential effects than the brain on peripheral blood oxidative/nitrosative stress.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Depletion of Caveolin-1 in Type 2 Diabetes Model Induces Alzheimer's Disease Pathology Precursors</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/43/8576?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a risk factor for the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanism underlying the development of late-onset AD is largely unknown. Here we show that levels of the endothelial-enriched protein caveolin-1 (Cav-1) are reduced in the brains of T2DM patients compared with healthy aging, and inversely correlated with levels of β-amyloid (Aβ). Depletion of Cav-1 is recapitulated in the brains of &lt;i&gt;db/db&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Lepr&lt;sup&gt;db&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) diabetic mice and corresponds with recognition memory deficits as well as the upregulation of amyloid precursor protein (APP), BACE-1, a trending increase in β-amyloid Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42/40&lt;/sub&gt; ratio and hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) species. Importantly, we show that restoration of Cav-1 levels in the brains of male &lt;i&gt;db/db&lt;/i&gt; mice using adenovirus overexpressing Cav-1 (AAV-Cav-1) rescues learning and memory deficits and reduces pathology (i.e., APP, BACE-1 and p-tau levels). Knocking down Cav-1 using shRNA in HEK cells expressing the familial AD-linked APPswe mutant variant upregulates APP, APP carboxyl terminal fragments, and Aβ levels. In turn, rescue of Cav-1 levels restores APP metabolism. Together, these results suggest that Cav-1 regulates APP metabolism, and that depletion of Cav-1 in T2DM promotes the amyloidogenic processing of APP and hyperphosphorylation of tau. This may suggest that depletion of Cav-1 in T2DM underlies, at least in part, the development of AD and imply that restoration of Cav-1 may be a therapeutic target for diabetic-associated sporadic AD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; More than 95% of the Alzheimer's patients have the sporadic late-onset form (LOAD). The cause for late-onset Alzheimer's disease is unknown. Patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus have considerably higher incidence of cognitive decline and AD compared with the general population, suggesting a common mechanism. Here we show that the expression of caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is reduced in the brain in Type 2 diabetes mellitus. In turn, reduced Cav-1 levels induce AD-associated neuropathology and learning and memory deficits. Restoration of Cav-1 levels rescues these deficits. This study unravels signals underlying LOAD and suggests that restoration of Cav-1 may be an effective therapeutic target.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Acute Focal Seizures Start As Local Synchronizations of Neuronal Ensembles</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/43/8562?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Understanding seizure formation and spread remains a critical goal of epilepsy research. We used fast &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; two-photon calcium imaging in male mouse neocortex to reconstruct, with single-cell resolution, the dynamics of acute (4-aminopyridine) focal cortical seizures as they originate within a spatially confined seizure initiation site (intrafocal region), and subsequently propagate into neighboring cortical areas (extrafocal region). We find that seizures originate as local neuronal ensembles within the initiation site. This abnormal hyperactivity engages increasingly larger areas in a saltatory fashion until it breaks into neighboring cortex, where it proceeds smoothly and is then detected electrophysiologically (LFP). Interestingly, PV inhibitory interneurons have spatially heterogeneous activity in intrafocal and extrafocal territories, ruling out a simple role of inhibition in seizure formation and spread. We propose a two-step model for the progression of focal seizures, where neuronal ensembles activate first, generating a microseizure, followed by widespread neural activation in a traveling wave through neighboring cortex during macroseizures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We have used calcium imaging in mouse sensory cortex &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; to reconstruct the onset of focal seizures elicited by local injection of the chemoconvulsant 4-aminopyridine. We demonstrate at cellular resolution that acute focal seizures originate as increasingly synchronized local neuronal ensembles. Because of its spatial confinement, this process may at first be undetectable even by nearby LFP electrodes. Further, we establish spatial footprints of local neural subtype activity that correspond to consecutive steps of seizure microprogression. Such footprints could facilitate determining the recording location (e.g., inside/outside an epileptogenic focus) in high-resolution studies, even in the absence of a priori knowledge about where exactly a seizure started.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Reward Boosts Neural Coding of Task Rules to Optimize Cognitive Flexibility</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/43/8549?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cognitive flexibility is critical for intelligent behavior. However, its execution is effortful and often suboptimal. Recent work indicates that flexible behavior can be improved by the prospect of reward, which suggests that rewards optimize flexible control processes. Here we investigated how different reward prospects influence neural encoding of task rule information to optimize cognitive flexibility. We applied representational similarity analysis to human electroencephalograms, recorded while female and male participants performed a rule-guided decision-making task. During the task, the prospect of reward varied from trial to trial. Participants made faster, more accurate judgements on high-reward trials. Critically, high reward boosted neural coding of the active task rule, and the extent of this increase was associated with improvements in task performance. Additionally, the effect of high reward on task rule coding was most pronounced on switch trials, where rules were updated relative to the previous trial. These results suggest that reward prospect can promote cognitive performance by strengthening neural coding of task rule information, helping to improve cognitive flexibility during complex behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The importance of motivation is evident in the ubiquity with which reward prospect guides adaptive behavior and the striking number of neurological conditions associated with motivational impairments. In this study, we investigated how dynamic changes in motivation, as manipulated through reward, shape neural coding for task rules during a flexible decision-making task. The results of this work suggest that motivation to obtain reward modulates the encoding of task rules needed for flexible behavior. The extent to which reward increased task rule coding also tracked improvements in behavioral performance under high-reward conditions. These findings help to inform how motivation shapes neural processing in the healthy human brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Rapid Memory Reactivation at Movie Event Boundaries Promotes Episodic Encoding</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/43/8538?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Segmentation of continuous experience into discrete events is driven by rapid fluctuations in encoding stability at context shifts (i.e., event boundaries), yet the mechanisms underlying the online formation of event memories are poorly understood. We investigated the neural per-time point spatial similarity patterns of the scalp electrophysiological (EEG) activity of 30 human participants (male and female) watching a 50 min movie and found that event boundaries triggered the rapid reinstatement of the just-encoded movie event EEG patterns. We also found that the onset of memory reinstatement at boundary onset was accompanied by a left-lateralized anterior negative ERP effect, which likely reflects the detection of a shift in the narrative structure of the movie. A data-driven approach based on Hidden Markov modeling allowed us to detect event boundaries as shifts between stable patterns of brain EEG activity during encoding, and to identify their reactivation during a free recall task. These results provide the first neurophysiological underpinnings for how the memory systems segment a continuous long stream of experience into episodic events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE OF STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Memory for specific episodic events are the building blocks of our autobiographical memory. However, it is still unclear how the memory systems structure the unfolding experience into discrete event units that can be understood and remembered at the long-term. Here, we show that the detection of context shifts, or event boundaries, during a 50 min movie viewing triggers the rapid memory reactivation of the just-encoded event to promote its successful encoding into long-term memory. By finding that memory reactivation, a neural mechanism critical for episodic memory formation and consolidation, takes place under these ecologically valid experimental circumstances, our results provide valuable insights into how the brain shapes the ongoing experience into episodic memories in the real-life.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/43/8527?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human vision combines inputs from the two eyes into one percept. Small differences &quot;fuse&quot; together, whereas larger differences are seen &quot;rivalrously&quot; from one eye at a time. These outcomes are typically treated as mutually exclusive processes, with paradigms targeting one or the other and fusion being unreported in most rivalry studies. Is fusion truly a default, stable state that only breaks into rivalry for non-fusible stimuli? Or are monocular and fused percepts three sub-states of one dynamical system? To determine whether fusion and rivalry are separate processes, we measured human perception of Gabor patches with a range of interocular orientation disparities. Observers (10 female, 5 male) reported rivalrous, fused, and uncertain percepts over time. We found a dynamic &quot;tristable&quot; zone spanning from ~25–35° of orientation disparity where fused, left-eye-, or right-eye-dominant percepts could all occur. The temporal characteristics of fusion and non-fusion periods during tristability matched other bistable processes. We tested statistical models with fusion as a higher-level bistable process alternating with rivalry against our findings. None of these fit our data, but a simple bistable model extended to have three states reproduced many of our observations. We conclude that rivalry and fusion are multistable substates capable of direct competition, rather than separate bistable processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; When inputs to the two eyes differ, they can either fuse together or engage in binocular rivalry, where each eye's view is seen exclusively in turn. Visual stimuli have often been tailored to produce either fusion or rivalry, implicitly treating them as separate mutually-exclusive perceptual processes. We have found that some similar-but-different stimuli can result in both outcomes over time. Comparing various simple models with our results suggests that rivalry and fusion are not independent processes, but compete within a single multistable system. This conceptual shift is a step toward unifying fusion and rivalry, and understanding how they both contribute to the visual system's production of a unified interpretation of the conflicting images cast on the retina by real-world scenes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Disentangling Hippocampal and Amygdala Contribution to Human Anxiety-Like Behavior</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/43/8517?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Anxiety comprises a suite of behaviors to deal with potential threat and is often modeled in approach–avoidance conflict tasks. Collectively, these tests constitute a predominant preclinical model of anxiety disorder. A body of evidence suggests that both ventral hippocampus and amygdala lesions impair anxiety-like behavior, but the relative contribution of these two structures is unclear. A possible reason is that approach–avoidance conflict tasks involve a series of decisions and actions, which may be controlled by distinct neural mechanisms that are difficult to disentangle from behavioral readouts. Here, we capitalize on a human approach–avoidance conflict test, implemented as computer game, that separately measures several action components. We investigate three patients of both sexes with unspecific unilateral medial temporal lobe (MTL) damage, one male with selective bilateral hippocampal (HC), and one female with selective bilateral amygdala lesions, and compare them to matched controls. MTL and selective HC lesions, but not selective amygdala lesions, increased approach decision when possible loss was high. In contrast, MTL and selective amygdala lesions, but not selective HC lesions, increased return latency. Additionally, selective HC and selective amygdala lesions reduced approach latency. In a task targeted at revealing subjective assumptions about the structure of the computer game, MTL and selective HC lesions impacted on reaction time generation but not on the subjective task structure. We conclude that deciding to approach reward under threat relies on hippocampus but not amygdala, whereas vigor of returning to safety depends on amygdala but not on hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Approach–avoidance conflict tests are widely investigated in rodents, and increasingly in humans, to understand the neural basis of anxiety-like behavior. However, the contribution of the most relevant brain regions, ventral hippocampus and amygdala, is incompletely understood. We use a human computerized test that separates different action components and find that hippocampus, but not amygdala, lesions impair approach decisions, whereas amygdala, but not hippocampus, lesions impair the vigor of return to safety.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Chemogenetic Inhibition Reveals That Processing Relative But Not Absolute Threat Requires Basal Amygdala</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/43/8510?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;While our understanding of appetitive motivation has benefited immensely from the use of selective outcome devaluation tools, the same cannot be said about aversive motivation. Findings from appetitive conditioning studies have shown that basal amygdala is required for behaviors that are sensitive to updates in outcome value, but similar results in aversive motivation are difficult to interpret due to a lack of outcome specificity. The studies reported here sought to develop procedures to isolate sensory-specific processes in aversive learning and behavior and to assess the possible contribution of the basal amygdala. Post-training changes to outcome value produced commensurate changes to subsequently tested conditioned responding in male rodents. Specifically, increases in shock intensity (i.e., inflation) augmented, while repeated exposure to (i.e., habituation of) an aversive sound (klaxon-horn) reduced freezing to conditioned stimuli previously paired with these outcomes. This was extended to a discriminative procedure, in which following revaluation of one event, but not the other, responding was found to be dependent on outcome value signaled by each cue. Chemogenetic inactivation of basal amygdala impaired this discrimination between stimuli signaling differently valued outcomes, but did not affect the revaluation process itself. These findings demonstrate a contribution of the basal amygdala to aversive outcome-dependent motivational processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The specific content of pavlovian associative learning has been well studied in appetitive motivation, where the value of different foods can be easily manipulated. This has facilitated our understanding of the neural circuits that generate different forms of motivation (i.e., sensory specific vs general). Studies of aversive learning have not produced the same degree of understanding with regard to sensory specificity due to a lack of tools for evaluating sensory-specific processes. Here we use a variant of outcome devaluation procedures with aversive stimuli to study the role of basal amygdala in discriminating between aversive stimuli conveying different degrees of threat. These findings have implications for how we study generalized threat to identify dysregulation that can contribute to generalized anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Target-Detecting Visual Neuron in the Dragonfly Locks on to Selectively Attended Targets</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/43/8497?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The visual world projects a complex and rapidly changing image onto the retina of many animal species. This presents computational challenges for those animals reliant on visual processing to provide an accurate representation of the world. One such challenge is parsing a visual scene for the most salient targets, such as the selection of prey amid a swarm. The ability to selectively prioritize processing of some stimuli over others is known as 'selective attention'. We recently identified a dragonfly visual neuron called 'Centrifugal Small Target Motion Detector 1' (CSTMD1) that exhibits selective attention when presented with multiple, equally salient targets. Here we conducted &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, electrophysiological recordings from CSTMD1 in wild-caught male dragonflies (&lt;i&gt;Hemicordulia tau&lt;/i&gt;), while presenting visual stimuli on an LCD monitor. To identify the target selected in any given trial, we uniquely modulated the intensity of the moving targets (frequency tagging). We found that the frequency information of the selected target is preserved in the neuronal response, while the distracter is completely ignored. We also show that the competitive system that underlies selection in this neuron can be biased by the presentation of a preceding target on the same trajectory, even when it is of lower contrast than an abrupt, novel distracter. With this improved method for identifying and biasing target selection in CSTMD1, the dragonfly provides an ideal animal model system to probe the neuronal mechanisms underlying selective attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We present the first application of frequency tagging to intracellular neuronal recordings, demonstrating that the frequency component of a stimulus is encoded in the spiking response of an &lt;i&gt;individual&lt;/i&gt; neuron. Using this technique as an identifier, we demonstrate that CSTMD1 'locks on' to a selected target and encodes the absolute strength of this target, even in the presence of abruptly appearing, high-contrast distracters. The underlying mechanism also permits the selection mechanism to switch between targets mid-trial, even among equivalent targets. Together, these results demonstrate greater complexity in this selective attention system than would be expected in a winner-takes-all network. These results are in contrast to typical findings in the primate and avian brain, but display intriguing resemblance to observations in human psychophysics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Premotor Cortical-Cerebellar Reorganization in a Macaque Model of Primary Motor Cortical Lesion and Recovery</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/43/8484?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuromotor systems have the capacity for functional recovery following local damage. The literature suggests a possible role for the premotor cortex and cerebellum in motor recovery. However, the specific changes to interactions between these areas following damage remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate potential rewiring of connections from the ipsilesional ventral premotor cortex (ip-PMv) to cerebellar structures in a nonhuman primate model of primary motor cortex (M1) lesion and motor recovery. Cerebellar connections arising from the ip-PMv were investigated by comparing biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) between two groups of male &lt;i&gt;Macaca mulatta&lt;/i&gt;: M1-lesion/motor recovery group and intact group. There were more BDA-labeled boutons and axons in all ipsilesional deep cerebellar nuclei (fastigial, interposed, and dentate) in the M1-lesion/recovery group than in the intact group. The difference was evident in the ipsilesional fastigial nucleus (ip-FN), and particularly observed in its middle, a putative somatosensory region of the ip-FN, which was characterized by absent or little expression of aldolase C. Some of the altered projections from the ip-PMv to ip-FN neurons were confirmed as functional because the synaptic markers, synaptophysin and vesicular glutamate transporter 1, were colocalized with BDA-labeled boutons. These results suggest that the adult primate brain after motor lesions can reorganize large-scale networks to enable motor recovery by enhancing sensorimotor coupling and motor commands via rewired fronto-cerebellar connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Damaging the motor cortex causes motor deficits, which can be recovered over time. Such motor recovery may result from functional compensation in remaining neuromotor areas, including the ventral premotor cortex. We investigated compensatory changes in neural axonal outputs from ventral premotor to deep cerebellar nuclei in a monkey model of primary motor cortical lesion and motor recovery. The results showed an increase in premotor projections and synaptic formations in deep cerebellar nuclei, especially the sensorimotor region of the fastigial nucleus. Our results provide the first evidence that large-scale reorganization of fronto-cerebellar circuits may underlie functional recovery after motor cortical lesions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Rehabilitative Training Interacts with Ischemia-Instigated Spine Dynamics to Promote a Lasting Population of New Synapses in Peri-Infarct Motor Cortex</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/43/8471?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;After subtotal infarcts of primary motor cortex (M1), motor rehabilitative training (RT) promotes improvements in paretic forelimb function that have been linked with its promotion of structural and functional reorganization of peri-infarct cortex, but how the reorganization unfolds is scantly understood. Cortical infarcts also instigate a prolonged period of dendritic spine turnover in peri-infarct cortex. Here we investigated the possibility that synaptic structural responses to RT in peri-infarct cortex reflect, in part, interactions with ischemia-instigated spine turnover. This was tested after artery-targeted photothrombotic M1 infarcts or Sham procedures in adult (4 months) C57BL/6 male and female GFP-M line (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 24) and male yellow fluorescent protein-H line (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 5) mice undergoing RT in skilled reaching or no-training control procedures. Regardless of training condition, spine turnover was increased out to 5 weeks postinfarct relative to Sham, as was the persistence of new spines formed within a week postinfarct. However, compared with no-training controls, new spines formed during postinfarct weeks 2–4 in mice undergoing RT persisted in much greater proportions to later time points, by a magnitude that predicted behavioral improvements in the RT group. These results indicate that RT interacts with ischemia-instigated spine turnover to promote preferential stabilization of newly formed spines, which is likely to yield a new population of mature synapses in peri-infarct cortex that could contribute to cortical functional reorganization and behavioral improvement. The findings newly implicate ischemia-instigated spine turnover as a mediator of cortical synaptic structural responses to RT and newly establish the experience dependency of new spine fates in the postischemic turnover context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Motor rehabilitation, the main treatment for motor impairments after stroke, is far from sufficient to normalize function. A better understanding of neural substrates of rehabilitation-induced behavioral improvements could be useful for understanding how to optimize it. Here, we investigated the nature and time course of synaptic responses to motor rehabilitative training &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Focal ischemia instigated a period of synapse turnover in peri-infarct motor cortex of mice. Rehabilitative training increased the stability of new synapses formed during the initial weeks after the infarct, the magnitude of which was correlated with improvements in skilled motor performance. Therefore, the maintenance of new synapses formed after ischemia could represent a structural mechanism of rehabilitative training efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Degeneration of Injured Axons and Dendrites Requires Restraint of a Protective JNK Signaling Pathway by the Transmembrane Protein Raw</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/43/8457?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The degeneration of injured axons involves a self-destruction pathway whose components and mechanism are not fully understood. Here, we report a new regulator of axonal resilience. The transmembrane protein Raw is cell autonomously required for the degeneration of injured axons, dendrites, and synapses in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;. In both male and female &lt;i&gt;raw&lt;/i&gt; hypomorphic mutant or knock-down larvae, the degeneration of injured axons, dendrites, and synapses from motoneurons and sensory neurons is strongly inhibited. This protection is insensitive to reduction in the levels of the NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; synthesis enzyme Nmnat (nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferase), but requires the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and the transcription factors Fos and Jun (AP-1). Although these factors were previously known to function in axonal injury signaling and regeneration, Raw's function can be genetically separated from other axonal injury responses: Raw does not modulate JNK-dependent axonal injury signaling and regenerative responses, but instead restrains a protective pathway that inhibits the degeneration of axons, dendrites, and synapses. Although protection in &lt;i&gt;raw&lt;/i&gt; mutants requires JNK, Fos, and Jun, JNK also promotes axonal degeneration. These findings suggest the existence of multiple independent pathways that share modulation by JNK, Fos, and Jun that influence how axons respond to stress and injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Axonal degeneration is a major feature of neuropathies and nerve injuries and occurs via a cell autonomous self-destruction pathway whose mechanism is poorly understood. This study reports the identification of a new regulator of axonal degeneration: the transmembrane protein Raw. Raw regulates a cell autonomous nuclear signaling pathway whose yet unknown downstream effectors protect injured axons, dendrites, and synapses from degenerating. These findings imply that the susceptibility of axons to degeneration is strongly regulated in neurons. Future understanding of the cellular pathway regulated by Raw, which engages the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and Fos and Jun transcription factors, may suggest new strategies to increase the resiliency of axons in debilitating neuropathies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Regulation of Hippocampal Memory by mTORC1 in Somatostatin Interneurons</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/43/8439?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Translational control of long-term synaptic plasticity via Mechanistic Target Of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1) is crucial for hippocampal learning and memory. The role of mTORC1 is well characterized in excitatory principal cells but remains largely unaddressed in inhibitory interneurons. Here, we used cell-type-specific conditional knock-out strategies to alter mTORC1 function selectively in somatostatin (SOM) inhibitory interneurons (SOM-INs). We found that, in male mice, upregulation and downregulation of SOM-IN mTORC1 activity bidirectionally regulates contextual fear and spatial memory consolidation. Moreover, contextual fear learning induced a metabotropic glutamate receptor type 1 (mGluR1)-mediated late long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory input synapses onto hippocampal SOM-INs that was dependent on mTORC1. Finally, the induction protocol for mTORC1-mediated late-LTP in SOM-INs regulated Schaffer collateral pathway LTP in pyramidal neurons. Therefore, mTORC1 activity in somatostatin interneurons contributes to learning-induced persistent plasticity of their excitatory synaptic inputs and hippocampal memory consolidation, uncovering a role of mTORC1 in inhibitory circuits for memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Memory consolidation necessitates synthesis of new proteins. Mechanistic Target Of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling is crucial for translational control involved in long-term memory and in late long-term potentiation (LTP). This is well described in principal glutamatergic pyramidal cells but poorly understood in GABAergic inhibitory interneurons. Here, we show that mTORC1 activity in somatostatin interneurons, a major subclass of GABAergic cells, is important to modulate long-term memory strength and precision. Furthermore, mTORC1 was necessary for learning-induced persistent LTP at excitatory inputs of somatostatin interneurons that depends on type I metabotropic glutamatergic receptors in the hippocampus. This effect was consistent with a newly described role of these interneurons in the modulation of LTP at Schaffer collateral synapses onto pyramidal cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/43/8424?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Discriminating between auditory signals of different affective value is critical for the survival and success of social interaction of an individual. Anatomical, electrophysiological, imaging, and optogenetics approaches have established that the auditory cortex (AC) by providing auditory information to the lateral amygdala (LA) via long-range excitatory glutamatergic projections has an impact on sound-driven aversive/fear behavior. Here we test the hypothesis that the LA also receives GABAergic projections from the cortex. We addressed this fundamental question by taking advantage of optogenetics, anatomical, and electrophysiology approaches and directly examining the functional effects of cortical GABAergic inputs to LA neurons of the mouse (male/female) AC. We found that the cortex, via cortico-lateral-amygdala somatostatin neurons (CLA-SOM), has a direct inhibitory influence on the output of the LA principal neurons. Our results define a CLA long-range inhibitory circuit (CLA-SOM inhibitory projections -&amp;gt; LA principal neurons) underlying the control of spike timing/generation in LA and LA–AC projecting neurons, and attributes a specific function to a genetically defined type of cortical long-range GABAergic neurons in CLA communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; It is very well established that cortical auditory inputs to the lateral amygdala are exclusively excitatory and that cortico-amygdala neuronal activity has been shown to be involved in sound-driven aversive/fear behavior. Here, for the first time, we show that the lateral amygdala receives long-range GABAergic projection from the auditory cortex and these form direct monosynaptic inhibitory connections onto lateral amygdala principal neurons. Our results define a cellular basis for direct inhibitory communication from auditory cortex to the lateral amygdala, suggesting that the timing and ratio of excitation and inhibition, two opposing forces in the mammalian cerebral cortex, can dynamically affect the output of the lateral amygdala, providing a general mechanism for fear/aversive behavior driven by auditory stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Chemogenetic activation of excitatory neurons alters hippocampal neurotransmission in a dose-dependent manner</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0124-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD)-based chemogenetic tools are extensively used to manipulate neuronal activity in a cell-type specific manner. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings indicate membrane depolarization, coupled with increased neuronal firing rate, following administration of the DREADD ligand, Clozapine-N-Oxide (CNO) to activate the Gq-coupled DREADD, hM3Dq. Although hM3Dq has been used to enhance neuronal firing in order to manipulate diverse behaviors, often within thirty minutes to an hour post-CNO administration, the physiological effects on excitatory neurotransmission remain poorly understood. We investigated the influence of CNO-mediated hM3Dq DREADD activation on distinct aspects of hippocampal excitatory neurotransmission at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapse in hippocampal slices derived from mice expressing hM3Dq in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin dependent protein kinase α (CamKIIα)-positive excitatory neurons. Our results indicate a clear dose-dependent effect on fEPSP slope, with no change noted at the lower dose of CNO (1 µM) and a significant, long-term decline in fEPSP slope observed at higher doses (5-20 µM). Further, we noted a robust theta burst stimulus (TBS) induced long-term potentiation (LTP) in the presence of the lower CNO (1 µM) dose, which was significantly attenuated at the higher CNO (20 µM) dose. Whole-cell patch-clamp recording revealed both complex dose-dependent regulation of excitability, and spontaneous and evoked activity of CA1 pyramidal neurons in response to hM3Dq activation across CNO concentrations. Our data indicate that CNO-mediated activation of the hM3Dq DREADD results in dose-dependent regulation of excitatory hippocampal neurotransmission, and highlight the importance of careful interpretation of behavioral experiments involving chemogenetic manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD) are tools to manipulate neuronal activity in specific circuits within the nervous system. Although these tools are routinely used to decipher the neuronal circuits responsible for a wide range of behaviors, effects of DREADD-mediated neuronal activation on excitatory neurotransmission remain poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate using local field and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, the complex dose-dependent effects of Clozapine-N-Oxide (CNO)-mediated activation of excitatory DREADD hM3Dq in hippocampal excitatory neurons on distinct aspects of neurotransmission. Our results underscore the importance of careful interpretation in the use of DREADD-mediated activation of neuronal circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test the hypothesis that Alzheimer's disease and related neuropathologies contribute to the association between hospitalization and cognitive decline in old age.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of a longitudinal clinical–pathologic cohort study, 526 older persons (mean age at death = 90.9 years, 71% female) without dementia at baseline completed annual cognitive testing and were autopsied at death. Hospitalization information was obtained from linked Medicare claims records. Neuropathologic examination assessed β‐amyloid burden, tau tangle density, neocortical Lewy bodies, hippocampal sclerosis, chronic gross and microscopic cerebral infarcts, and transactive response DNA binding protein 43 kDa.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a mean of 5.1 years, a total of 1,383 hospitalizations occurred, and the mean annual rate of hospitalization was 0.5 (standard deviation = 0.6, median = 0.4). Higher rate of hospitalization was not directly related to higher burden for any of the neuropathologic markers. Higher rate of hospitalization was associated with more rapid cognitive decline (estimate = −0.042, standard error [SE] = 0.012, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), and after controlling for all 7 neuropathologic markers, the association was essentially the same (estimate = −0.040, SE = 0.013, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002). In a multivariable model with 3‐way interactions of neuropathologic markers with hospitalization rate and time, the association between hospitalization rate and faster cognitive decline was greater in persons with more tangle pathology (estimate for interaction = −0.007, SE = 0.002, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002) and in persons with neocortical Lewy bodies (estimate for interaction = −0.117, SE = 0.042, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.005).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Older persons with more hospitalizations experienced faster rates of cognitive decline, and this association was more pronounced in persons with more tau tangle density and with neocortical Lewy body pathologies. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Evidence of Hyperacusis in Adult Rats Following Non-traumatic Sound Exposure</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00055</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Manipulations that enhance neuroplasticity may inadvertently create opportunities for maladaptation. We have previously used passive exposures to non-traumatic white noise to open windows of plasticity in the adult rat auditory cortex and induce frequency-specific functional reorganizations of the tonotopic map. However, similar reorganizations in the central auditory pathway are thought to contribute to the generation of hearing disorders such as tinnitus and hyperacusis. Here, we investigate whether noise-induced reorganizations are accompanied by electrophysiological or behavioral evidence of tinnitus or hyperacusis in adult Long-Evans rats. We used a 2-week passive exposure to moderate-intensity (70 dB SPL) broadband white noise to reopen a critical period for spectral tuning such that a second 1-week exposure to 7 kHz tone pips produced an expansion of the 7 kHz frequency region in the primary auditory cortex (A1). We demonstrate for the first time that this expansion also takes place in the ventral auditory field (VAF). Sound exposure also led to spontaneous and sound-evoked hyperactivity in the anterior auditory field (AAF). Rats were assessed for behavioral evidence of tinnitus or hyperacusis using gap and tone prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response. We found that sound exposure did not affect gap-prepulse inhibition. However, sound exposure led to an improvement in prepulse inhibition when the prepulse was a 7 kHz tone, showing that exposed rats had enhanced sensorimotor gating for the exposure frequency. Together, our electrophysiological and behavioral results provide evidence of hyperacusis but not tinnitus in sound-exposed animals. Our findings demonstrate that periods of prolonged noise exposure may open windows of plasticity that can also be understood as windows of vulnerability, potentially increasing the likelihood for maladaptive plasticity to take place.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01141</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The purification of pluripotent stem cell-derived cortico-fugal projection neurons (PSC-CFuPNs) is useful for disease modeling and cell therapies related to the dysfunction of cortical motor neurons, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or stroke. However, no CFuPN-specific surface markers for the purification are known. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported as alternatives to surface markers. Here, we investigated this possibility by applying the miRNA switch, an mRNA technology, to enrich PSC-CFuPNs. An array study of miRNAs in mouse fetal brain tissue revealed that CFuPNs highly express miRNA-124-3p at E14.5 and E16.5. In response, we designed a miRNA switched that responds to miRNA-124-3p and applied it to mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived cortical neurons. Flow cytometry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analyses showed the miRNA-124-3p switch enriched CFuPN-like cells from this population. Immunocytechemical analysis confirmed vGlut1/Emx1/Bcl11b triple positive CFuPN-like cells were increased from 6.5 to 42%. Thus, our miRNA-124-3p switch can uniquely enrich live CFuPN-like cells from mouse ESC-derived cortical neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Origins of the Resting-State Functional MRI Signal: Potential Limitations of the “Neurocentric” Model</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01136</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) is emerging as a research tool for systems and clinical neuroscience. The mechanism underlying resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) signal, however, remains incompletely understood. A widely held assumption is that the spontaneous fluctuations in blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal reflect ongoing neuronal processes (herein called “neurocentric” model). In support of this model, evidence from human and animal studies collectively reveals that the spatial synchrony of spontaneously occurring electrophysiological signal recapitulates BOLD rsFC networks. Two recent experiments from independent labs designed to specifically examine neuronal origins of rsFC, however, suggest that spontaneously occurring neuronal events, as assessed by multiunit activity or local field potential (LFP), although statistically significant, explain only a small portion (∼10%) of variance in resting-state BOLD fluctuations. These two studies, although each with its own limitations, suggest that the spontaneous fluctuations in rsfMRI, may have complex cellular origins, and the “neurocentric” model may not apply to all brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01130</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Up to now relatively little is known about interlimb reflexes (ILR). Especially it is not well known whether ILR may habituate or not to subsequent stimuli. The main aim of the present investigation was to explore the short term habituation behavior of ILR. The electromyogram was recorded over the tonically active biceps brachii (BB) muscle in 11 healthy subjects contralateral and ipsilateral to supramaximum electrical stimuli (9–12 mA) that were delivered at 1.0 and 0.4 Hz over the left sural nerve. In addition, a selective averaging method was used to investigate the influence of preceding stimuli on the ILR. Thus, 30 blocks of 3 subsequent stimuli were used. All 1st ILR of each block were averaged together. Averages were also obtained for 2nd and 3rd ILR. While ILR amplitudes gained significantly both ipsilateral and contralateral to the stimulus (p &amp;lt; 0.05) after train stimuli as compared with single stimuli, ILR amplitudes showed a significant decrease at 1.0 Hz versus 0.4 Hz stimuli. ILR amplitudes decreased significantly after the 2nd and 3rd stimulus relative to the 1st (p &amp;lt; 0.05). ILR can be recorded bilaterally remote from the stimulus site. Furthermore, ILR show clear short term habituation behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Objectives&lt;p&gt;To investigate the diagnostic value of MRI-based texture analysis in discriminating common posterior fossa tumors, including medulloblastoma, brain metastatic tumor, and hemangioblastoma.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A total number of 185 patients were enrolled in the current study: 63 of them were diagnosed with medulloblastoma, 56 were diagnosed with brain metastatic tumor, and 66 were diagnosed with hemangioblastoma. Texture features were extracted from contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (T1C) images and fluid-attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) images within two matrixes. Mann–Whitney U test was conducted to identify whether texture features were significantly different among subtypes of tumors. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess if they could be taken as independent predictors and to establish the integrated models. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was conducted to evaluate their performances in discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;There were texture features from both T1C images and FLAIR images found to be significantly different among the three types of tumors. The integrated model represented that the promising diagnostic performance of texture analysis depended on a series of features rather than a single feature. Moreover, the predictive model that combined texture features and clinical feature implied feasible performance in prediction with an accuracy of 0.80.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;MRI-based texture analysis could potentially be served as a radiological method in discrimination of common tumors located in posterior fossa.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Towards a Multimodal Model of Cognitive Workload Through Synchronous Optical Brain Imaging and Eye Tracking Measures</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00375</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent advances in neuroimaging technologies have rendered multimodal analysis of operators’ cognitive processes in complex task settings and environments increasingly more practical. In this exploratory study, we utilized optical brain imaging and mobile eye tracking technologies to investigate the behavioral and neurophysiological differences among expert and novice operators while they operated a human-machine interface in normal and adverse conditions. In congruence with related work, we observed that experts tended to have lower prefrontal oxygenation and exhibit gaze patterns that are better aligned with the optimal task sequence with shorter fixation durations as compared to novices. These trends reached statistical significance only in the adverse condition where the operators were prompted with an unexpected error message. Comparisons between hemodynamic and gaze measures before and after the error message indicated that experts’ neurophysiological response to the error involved a systematic increase in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) activity accompanied with an increase in fixation durations, which suggests a shift in their attentional state, possibly from routine process execution to problem detection and resolution. The novices’ response was not as strong as that of experts, including a slight increase only in the left dlPFC with a decreasing trend in fixation durations, which is indicative of visual search behavior for possible cues to make sense of the unanticipated situation. A linear discriminant analysis model capitalizing on the covariance structure among hemodynamic and eye movement measures could distinguish experts from novices with 91% accuracy. Despite the small sample size, the performance of the linear discriminant analysis combining eye fixation and dorsolateral oxygenation measures before and after an unexpected event suggests that multimodal approaches may be fruitful for distinguishing novice and expert performance in similar neuroergonomic applications in the field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Orexin-A Excites Airway Vagal Preganglionic Neurons via Activation of Orexin Receptor Type 1 and Type 2 in Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00478</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Airway vagal nerves play a predominant role in the neural control of the airway, and augmented airway vagal activity is known to play important roles in the pathogenesis of some chronic inflammatory airway diseases. Several lines of evidence indicate that dysfunctional central orexinergic system is closely related to the severity of airway diseases, however, whether orexins affect airway vagal activity is unknown. This study investigates whether and how orexin-A regulates the activity of medullary airway vagal preganglionic neurons (AVPNs). The expression of orexin receptor type 1 (OX&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R) and type 2 (OX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R) was examined using immunofluorescent staining. The effects of orexin-A on functionally identified inspiratory-activated AVPNs (IA-AVPNs), which are critical in the control of airway smooth muscle, were examined using patch-clamp in medullary slices of neonatal rats. Airway vagal response to injection of orexin-A into the magna cisterna was examined using plethysmography in juvenile rats. The results show that retrogradely labeled AVPNs were immunoreactive to anti-OX&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R antibody and anti-OX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R antibody. Orexin-A dose-dependently depolarized IA-AVPNs and increased their firing rate. In synaptically isolated IA-AVPNs, the depolarization induced by orexin-A was blocked partially by OX&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R antagonist SB-334867 or OX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R antagonist TCS OX2 29 alone, and completely by co-application of both antagonists. The orexin-A-induced depolarization was also mostly blocked by Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; exchanger inhibitor KB-R7943. Orexin-A facilitated the glutamatergic, glycinergic and GABAergic inputs to IA-AVPNs, and the facilitation of each type of input was blocked partially by SB-334867 or TCS OX2 29 alone, and completely by co-application of both antagonists. Injection of orexin-A into the magna cisterna of juvenile rats significantly increased the inspiratory and expiratory resistance of the airway and consequently decreased the dynamic compliance of the lungs, all of which were prevented by atropine sulfate or bilateral vagotomy. These results demonstrate that orexin-A excites IA-AVPNs via activation of both OX&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R and OX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R, and suggest that increased central synthesis/release of orexins might participate in the pathogenesis of airway diseases via over-activation of AVPNs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Mutual Suppression of Proximal and Distal Axonal Spike Initiation Determines the Output Patterns of a Motor Neuron</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00477</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Axonal spike initiation at sites far from somatodendritic integration occurs in a range of systems, but its contribution to neuronal output activity is not well understood. We studied the interactions of distal and proximal spike initiation in an unmyelinated motor axon of the stomatogastric nervous system in the lobster, Homarus americanus. The peripheral axons of the pyloric dilator (PD) neurons generate tonic spiking in response to dopamine application. Centrally generated bursting activity and peripheral spike initiation had mutually suppressive effects. The two PD neurons and the electrically coupled oscillatory anterior burster (AB) neuron form the pacemaker ensemble of the pyloric central pattern generator, and antidromic invasion of central compartments by peripherally generated spikes caused spikelets in AB. Antidromic spikes suppressed burst generation in an activity-dependent manner: slower rhythms were diminished or completely disrupted, while fast rhythmic activity remained robust. Suppression of bursting was based on interference with the underlying slow wave oscillations in AB and PD, rather than a direct effect on spike initiation. A simplified multi-compartment circuit model of the pacemaker ensemble replicated this behavior. Antidromic activity disrupted slow wave oscillations by resetting the inward and outward current trajectories in each spike interval. Centrally generated bursting activity in turn suppressed peripheral spike initiation in an activity-dependent manner. Fast bursting eliminated peripheral spike initiation, while slower bursting allowed peripheral spike initiation to continue during the intervals between bursts. The suppression of peripheral spike initiation was associated with a small after-hyperpolarization in the sub-millivolt range. A realistic model of the PD axon replicated this behavior and showed that a sub-millivolt cumulative after-hyperpolarization across bursts was sufficient to eliminate peripheral spike initiation. This effect was based on the dynamic interaction between slow activity-dependent hyperpolarization caused by the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-pump and inward rectification through the hyperpolarization-activated inward current, I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;. These results demonstrate that interactions between different spike initiation sites based on spike propagation can shift the relative contributions of different types of activity in an activity-dependent manner. Therefore, distal axonal spike initiation can play an important role in shaping neural output, conditional on the relative level of centrally generated activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00474</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Understanding how neuronal activity patterns in the brain correlate with complex behavior is one of the primary goals of modern neuroscience. Chemical transmission is the major way of communication between neurons, however, traditional methods of detection of neurotransmitter and neuromodulator transients in mammalian brain lack spatiotemporal precision. Modern fluorescent biosensors for neurotransmitters and neuromodulators allow monitoring chemical transmission in vivo with millisecond precision and single cell resolution. Changes in the fluorescent biosensor brightness occur upon neurotransmitter binding and can be detected using fiber photometry, stationary microscopy and miniaturized head-mounted microscopes. Biosensors can be expressed in the animal brain using adeno-associated viral vectors, and their cell-specific expression can be achieved with Cre-recombinase expressing animals. Although initially fluorescent biosensors for chemical transmission were represented by glutamate biosensors, nowadays biosensors for GABA, acetylcholine, glycine, norepinephrine, and dopamine are available as well. In this review, we overview functioning principles of existing intensiometric and ratiometric biosensors and provide brief insight into the variety of neurotransmitter-binding proteins from bacteria, plants, and eukaryotes including G-protein coupled receptors, which may serve as neurotransmitter-binding scaffolds. We next describe a workflow for development of neurotransmitter and neuromodulator biosensors. We then discuss advanced setups for functional imaging of neurotransmitter transients in the brain of awake freely moving animals. We conclude by providing application examples of biosensors for the studies of complex behavior with the single-neuron precision.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Decrease of GSK-3β Activity in the Anterior Cingulate Cortex of Shank3b−/− Mice Contributes to Synaptic and Social Deficiency</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00447</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Social deficiency is one of the core syndromes of autism spectrum disorders (ASD), for which the underlying developmental mechanism still remains elusive. Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) plays a key role in integrating social information and regulating social behavior. Recent studies have indicated that synaptic dysfunction in ACC is essential for ASD social defects. In the present study, we investigated the development of synapses and the roles of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β), which mediates multiple synaptic signaling pathways in ACC by using Shank3b&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice (a widely used ASD mouse model). Our data revealed that Shank3b mutation abolished the social induced c-Fos expression in ACC. From 4 weeks post-birth, neurons in Shank3b&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; ACC exhibited an obvious decrease in spine density and stubby spines. The length and thickness of post-synaptic density (PSD), the expression of vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (vGlut2) and glutamate receptor 2 (GluR2), and the frequency of miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents (mEPSCs) were significantly reduced in Shank3b&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;ACC. Interestingly, the levels of phosphorylated GSK-3β (Ser9), which inhibits the activity of GSK-3β, decreased along the same time course as the levels of GluR2 increased in ACC during development. Shank3b mutation leads to a dramatic increase of pGSK-3β (Ser9), and decrease of pPSD95 (a substrate of GSK-3β) and GluR2. Local delivery of AAV expressing constitutively active GSK-3β restored the expression of GluR2, increased the spine density and the number of mature spines. More importantly, active GSK-3β significantly promoted the social activity of Shank3b&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice. These data, in together, indicate that decrease of GSK-3β activity in ACC may contribute to the synaptic and social defects of Shank3b&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Enhancing GSK-3β activity may be utilized to treat ASD in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00293</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aging is a major risk factor for cerebrovascular disease; however, the molecular mechanisms of cerebrovascular aging remain to be clarified. The aim of this study was to reveal the molecular signaling pathways involved in cerebrovascular aging. This study used high-resolution liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), in combination with quantitative 6-plex tandem mass tag labeling, to profile protein changes in brain vessels from three groups of healthy rhesus macaques (3-years, 6-years, and 20-years). Western blot analyses were used to validate the proteomic data. A total of 2,934 proteins were identified and analyzed. Twenty-two proteins were continuously downregulated with increasing age, while three proteins were continuously upregulated. When comparing Group C vs. Group B, 270 proteins were downregulated, while 73 proteins were upregulated. All these 368 significantly changed proteins were used for further analysis. Bioinformatic analysis showed that the changed proteins were involved in several signaling pathways during cerebrovascular aging. Proteins in the NRF2 pathway, such as Glutathione S-transferase Mu (GSTM), were consistently downregulated especially after 6-years old, whereas proteins related to miRNA targets in the extracellular matrix (ECM) and membrane receptors were upregulated. Protein-protein interaction networks demonstrated that disorders of energy pathways and serine/threonine kinases were critical during cerebrovascular aging. Data are available via ProteomeXchange under the identifier PXD012306. Our results indicated that during aging, the disorders of energy metabolism and dysfunction of antioxidant activity caused over-production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) may exacerbate cerebrovascular aging. In addition, accumulation of ECM proteins during aging might be closely associated with age-related arterial stiffening and decreased compliance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00290</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) still remains an enigma for researchers and clinicians. The onset of AD is insidious, gradually progressive and multifactorial. The recent accumulated scientific evidences suggests that the pathological changes resemble the autoimmune-driven self-sustaining inflammatory process as a result of prolonged oxidative stress and immune dyshomeostasis. Apart from aging, during life span various other factors—mainly environmental, lifestyle, chronic stress, polymicrobial infections and neuroendocrine functions—affect the immune system. Here, we provide crosstalk among “trigger insults/inflammatory stimulus” i.e., polymicrobial infection, chronic stress, pro-inflammatory diet and cholinergic signaling to put forward a “Systemic Immune Dyshomeostasis” model as to connect the events leading to AD development and progression. Our model implicates altered cholinergic signaling and suggests pathological stages with various modifiable risk factors and triggers at different chronological age and stage of cognitive decline. The search of specific autoantibodies for AD which may serve as the suitable blood/CSF biomarkers should be actively pursued for the early diagnosis of AD. The preventive and therapeutic strategies should be directed towards maintaining the normal functioning of the immune system throughout the life span and specific modulation of the immune responses in the brain depending on the stage of changes in brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Chemogenetic Silencing of Prelimbic Cortex to Anterior Dorsomedial Striatum Projection Attenuates Operant Responding</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/5/ENEURO.0125-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Operant (instrumental) conditioning is a laboratory analog for voluntary behavior and involves learning to make a response for a reinforcing outcome. The prelimbic cortex (PL), a region of the rodent medial prefrontal cortex, and the dorsomedial striatum (DMS), have been separately established as important in the acquisition of minimally-trained operant behavior. Despite dense anatomical connections between the two regions, experimenters have only recently linked projections from the PL to the posterior DMS (pDMS) in the acquisition of an operant response. Yet, it is still unknown if these projections mediate behavioral expression, and if more anterior regions of the DMS (aDMS), which receive dense projections from the PL, are also involved. Therefore, we utilized designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) to test whether or not projections from the PL to the aDMS influence the expression of operant behavior. Rats underwent bilateral PL-targeted infusions of either a DREADD virus (AAV8-hSyn-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry) or a control virus (AAV8-hSyn-GFP). In addition, guide cannulae were implanted bilaterally in the aDMS. Rats were tested with both clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) (DREADD ligand) and vehicle infusions into the aDMS. Animals that had received the DREADD virus, but not the control virus, showed attenuated responding when they received CNO microinfusions into the aDMS, compared to vehicle infusions. Patch clamp electrophysiology verified the inhibitory effect of CNO on DREADDs-expressing PL neurons in acute brain slices. GFP-expressing control PL neurons were unaffected by CNO. The results add to the recent literature suggesting that connections between the PL and aDMS are important for the expression of minimally-trained operant responding.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Beta Frequency Oscillations in the Subthalamic Nucleus Are Not Sufficient for the Development of Symptoms of Parkinsonian Bradykinesia/Akinesia in Rats</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/5/ENEURO.0089-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Substantial correlative evidence links the synchronized, oscillatory patterns of neural activity that emerge in Parkinson’s disease (PD) in the beta (β) frequency range (13–30 Hz) with bradykinesia in PD. However, conflicting evidence exists, and whether these changes in neural activity are causal of motor symptoms in PD remains unclear. We tested the hypothesis that the synchronized β oscillations that emerge in PD are causal of symptoms of bradykinesia/akinesia. We designed patterns of stimulation that mimicked the temporal characteristics of single unit β bursting activity seen in PD animals and humans. We applied these β-patterned stimulation patterns along with continuous low-frequency and high-frequency controls to the subthalamic nucleus (STN) of intact and 6-OHDA-lesioned female Long–Evans and Sprague-Dawley rats. β-Patterned paradigms were superior to low-frequency controls at induction of β power in downstream substantia nigra reticulata (SNr) neurons and in ipsilateral motor cortex. However, we did not detect deleterious effects on motor performance across a wide battery of validated behavioral tasks. Our results suggest that β frequency oscillations (BFOs) may not be sufficient for the generation of bradykinesia/akinesia in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Clustering the Brain With “CluB”: A New Toolbox for Quantitative Meta-Analysis of Neuroimaging Data</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01037</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this paper we describe and validate a new coordinate-based method for meta-analysis of neuroimaging data based on an optimized hierarchical clustering algorithm: CluB (Clustering the Brain). The CluB toolbox permits both to extract a set of spatially coherent clusters of activations from a database of stereotactic coordinates, and to explore each single cluster of activation for its composition according to the cognitive dimensions of interest. This last step, called “cluster composition analysis,” permits to explore neurocognitive effects by adopting a factorial-design logic and by testing the working hypotheses using either asymptotic tests, or exact tests either in a classic inference, or in a Bayesian-like context. To perform our validation study, we selected the fMRI data from 24 normal controls involved in a reading task. We run a standard random-effects second level group analysis to obtain a “Gold Standard” of reference. In a second step, the subject-specific reading effects (i.e., the linear t-contrast “reading &amp;gt; baseline”) were extracted to obtain a coordinates-based database that was used to run a meta-analysis using both CluB and the popular Activation Likelihood Estimation method implemented in the software GingerALE. The results of the two meta-analyses were compared against the “Gold Standard” to compute performance measures, i.e., sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. The GingerALE method obtained a high level of accuracy (0.967) associated with a high sensitivity (0.728) and specificity (0.971). The CluB method obtained a similar level of accuracy (0.956) and specificity (0.969), notwithstanding a lower level of sensitivity (0.14) due to the lack of prior Gaussian transformation of the data. Finally, the two methods obtained a good-level of concordance (AC&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.93). These results suggested that methods based on hierarchical clustering (and post-hoc statistics) and methods requiring prior Gaussian transformation of the data can be used as complementary tools, with the GingerALE method being optimal for neurofunctional mapping of pooled data according to simpler designs, and the CluB method being preferable to test more specific, and localized, neurocognitive hypotheses according to factorial designs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Neural Networks Supporting Phoneme Monitoring Are Modulated by Phonology but Not Lexicality or Iconicity: Evidence From British and Swedish Sign Language</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00374</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sign languages are natural languages in the visual domain. Because they lack a written form, they provide a sharper tool than spoken languages for investigating lexicality effects which may be confounded by orthographic processing. In a previous study, we showed that the neural networks supporting phoneme monitoring in deaf British Sign Language (BSL) users are modulated by phonology but not lexicality or iconicity. In the present study, we investigated whether this pattern generalizes to deaf Swedish Sign Language (SSL) users. British and SSLs have a largely overlapping phoneme inventory but are mutually unintelligible because lexical overlap is small. This is important because it means that even when signs lexicalized in BSL are unintelligible to users of SSL they are usually still phonologically acceptable. During fMRI scanning, deaf users of the two different sign languages monitored signs that were lexicalized in either one or both of those languages for phonologically contrastive elements. Neural activation patterns relating to different linguistic levels of processing were similar across SLs; in particular, we found no effect of lexicality, supporting the notion that apparent lexicality effects on sublexical processing of speech may be driven by orthographic strategies. As expected, we found an effect of phonology but not iconicity. Further, there was a difference in neural activation between the two groups in a motion-processing region of the left occipital cortex, possibly driven by cultural differences, such as education. Importantly, this difference was not modulated by the linguistic characteristics of the material, underscoring the robustness of the neural activation patterns relating to different linguistic levels of processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Observation of Both Skilled and Erroneous Object Lifting Can Improve Predictive Force Scaling in the Observer</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00373</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent studies have highlighted that the observation of hand-object interactions can influence perceptual weight judgments made by an observer. Moreover, observing salient motor errors during object lifting allows individuals to update their internal sensorimotor representation about object weight. Embodying observed visuomotor cues for the planning of a motor command further enables individuals to accurately scale their fingertip forces when subsequently lifting the same object. However, it is still unknown whether the observation of a skilled lift is equally able to mediate predictive motor control in the observer. Here, we tested this hypothesis by asking participants to grasp and lift a manipulandum after observing an actor’s lift. The object weight changed unpredictably (light or heavy) every fourth to sixth trial performed by the actor. Participants were informed that they would always lift the same weight as the actor and that, based on the experimental condition, they would have to observe skilled or erroneously performed lifts. Our results revealed that the observation of both skilled and erroneously performed lifts allows participants to update their internal sensorimotor object representation, in turn enabling them to predict force scaling accurately. These findings suggest that the observation of salient motor errors, as well as subtle features of skilled motor performance, are embodied in the observer’s motor repertoire and can drive changes in predictive motor control.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Pulsed Electrical Stimulation of the Human Eye Enhances Retinal Vessel Reaction to Flickering Light</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00371</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent studies indicate therapeutic benefits of electrical stimulation in cases of specific ophthalmic diseases that are associated with dysfunctional ocular microcirculation. This suggests effects of electrical stimulation on vascular functions. In the present study, we investigated the effects of electrical stimulation on retinal vessel reactions using dynamic vessel analysis (DVA). Eighty healthy subjects were randomly assigned to one of three groups receiving electrical stimulation with different current intensities: 400 μA (n = 26); 800 μA (n = 27); 1200 μA (n = 27). The electrode montage for electrical stimulation consisted of a ring-shaped active electrode surrounding one eye and a square return electrode at the occiput. Rectangular, monophasic, positive current pulses were applied at 10 Hz for a duration of 60 s per stimulation period. DVA was used to observe the stimulation-induced reactions of retinal vessel diameters in response to different provocations. In three DVA measurements, three stimulus conditions were investigated: flicker light stimulation (FLS); electrical stimulation (ES); simultaneous electrical and flicker light stimulation (ES+FLS). Retinal vasodilation caused by these stimuli was compared using paired t-test. The subjects receiving electrical stimulation with 800 μA showed significantly increased retinal vasodilation for ES+FLS compared to FLS (p &amp;lt; 0.05). No significant differences in retinal vessel reactions were found between ES+FLS and FLS in the 400 and 1200 μA groups. No retinal vasodilation was observed for ES for all investigated current intensities. The results indicate that positive pulsed electrical stimulation of an adequate intensity enhances the flicker light-induced retinal vasodilation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00480</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) arises from an interplay of genetic mutations and environmental factors. ssRNA viruses are possible ALS risk factors, but testing their interaction with mutations such as in FUS, which encodes an RNA-binding protein, has been difficult due to the lack of a human disease model. Here, we use isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived spinal neurons (SNs) to investigate the interaction between ssRNA viruses and mutant FUS. We find that rabies virus (RABV) spreads ALS phenotypes, including the formation of stress granules (SGs) with aberrant composition due to increased levels of FUS protein, as well as neurodegeneration and reduced restriction activity by FUS mutations. Consistent with this, iPSC-derived SNs harboring mutant FUS are more sensitive to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and Zika viruses (ZIKV). We demonstrate that RABV and HIV-1 exacerbate cytoplasmic mislocalization of FUS. Our results demonstrate that viral infections worsen ALS pathology in SNs with genetic risk factors, suggesting a novel role for viruses in modulating patient phenotypes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Solving an Old Dogma: Is it an Arteriole or a Venule?</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00289</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There are very few reliable methods in the literature to discern with certainty between cerebral arterioles and venules. Smooth muscle cells (SMC) and pericytes are present in both arterioles and venules, so immunocytochemistry for markers specific to intramural cells (IMC) is unreliable. This study employed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and a canine brain to produce robust criteria for the correct identification of cerebral arterioles and venules based on lumen:vessel wall area, tested against the less accurate lumen diameter:vessel wall thickness. We first used morphology of IMC to identify two distinct groups of vessels; group 1 with morphology akin to venules and group 2 with morphology akin to arterioles. We then quantitatively assessed these vessels for lumen:vessel wall area ratio and lumen diameter:wall thickness ratio. After assessing 112 vessels, we show two distinct groups of vessels that can be separated using lumen:vessel wall area (group 1, 1.89 −10.96 vs. group 2, 0.27–1.57; p &amp;lt; 0.001) but not using lumen diameter:vessel wall thickness where a substantial overlap in ranges between groups occurred (group 1, 1.58–22.66 vs. group 2, 1.40–11.63). We, therefore, conclude that lumen:vessel wall area is a more sensitive and preferred method for distinguishing cerebral arterioles from venules. The significance of this study is wide, as cerebral small vessel disease is a key feature of vascular dementia and understanding the pathogenesis relies on correct identification of vessels.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Wet AMD was an independent factor associated with higher concentrations of IL-6 (β = +0.24, p = 0.0004), GM-CSF (β = +0.31, p &amp;lt; 0.001), IFN-γ (β = +0.58, p &amp;lt; 0.001), higher expression of miRNA-23a-3p (β = +0.60, p &amp;lt; 0.0001), miRNA-30b (β = +0.32, p &amp;lt; 0.0001), miRNA-191-5p (β = +0.28, p &amp;lt; 0.0001) and lower concentration of IL-1β (β = −0.25, p = 0.0003), IL-5 (β = −0.45, p &amp;lt; 0.001), IL-10 (β = −0.45, p &amp;lt; 0.001), IL-12 (β = −0.35, p &amp;lt; 0.001), lower expression of miRNA-16-5p (β = −0.31, p &amp;lt; 0.0001), miRNA-17-3p (β = −0.18, p = 0.01), miRNA-150-5p (β = −0.18, p = 0.01) and miRNA-155-5p (β = −0.47, p &amp;lt; 0.0001). Multivariate analysis revealed that dry AMD was an independent factor associated with higher concentration of GM-CSF (β = +0.34, p &amp;lt; 0.001), IL-6 (β = +0.13, p = 0.05), higher expression of miRNA-23a-3p (β = +0.60, p &amp;lt; 0.0001), miRNA-126-3p (β = +0.23, p = 0.0005), miRNA-126-5p (β = +0.16, p = 0.01), miRNA 146a (β = +0.14, p = 0.03), and mRNA191-5p (β = +0.15, p = 0.03) and lower concentrations of TNF-α (β = +0.24, p = 0.0004), IL-1β (β = −0.39, p &amp;lt; 0.001), IL-2 (β = −0.20, p = 0.003), IL-5 (β = −0.54, p &amp;lt; 0.001), IL-10 (β = −0.56, p &amp;lt; 0.001), IL-12 (β = −0.51, p &amp;lt; 0.001), lower expression of miRNA-16-5p (β = −0.23, p = 0.0004), miRNA-17-3p (β = −0.20, p = 0.003) and miRNA-17-5p (β = −0.19, p = 0.004). Negative correlations between visual acuity and WBC, lymphocyte count, TNF-α, IL-1 β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 concentrations and miRNA-191-5p, as well as positive correlations between visual acuity and miRNA-126-3p, -126-5p, and -155-5p PBNCs expression were found in AMD patients. No such correlations were found in the control group. Our results may suggest the role of both intra- and extracellular mechanisms implicated in inflammatory response regulation in multifactorial AMD pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Wearable Sensor-Based Daily Life Walking Assessment of Gait for Distinguishing Individuals With Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00285</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objectives: To characterize gait disorders in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCIs) and determine the association between the performance of the gait function and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methodology: In this study, we enrolled 38 patients with aMCI and 30 cognitively normal individuals normal controls (NC). Neuropsychological assessments included tests of memory, executive function, language, and attention. Using an inertial-sensor-based wearable instrument, we collected the gait data dynamically for at least 1 h/day for 2 weeks. The gait parameters included walking velocity, stride length, stride time, cadence, and stride time variability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The aMCI patients had reduced walking velocity and stride length and increased stride time variability compared with the NCs. The total number of steps, stride time, and cadence did not differ between the two groups. For all the subjects, walking velocity and stride length was positively associated with memory and executive function. Stride time variability was negatively correlated with the cognitive domains including memory, executive function and attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: This study suggested that cognitive impairment-related gait disorders occur (reduced gait speed, gait length, and gait stability) in daily life walking among the aMCI patients. A sensor-based wearable device for gait measurement may be an alternative and convenient tool for screening cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The folded X-pattern is not necessarily a statistical signature of decision confidence</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/NjLsP5Ns8Mk/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Manuel Rausch, Michael Zehetleitner&lt;/p&gt;

Recent studies have traced the neural correlates of confidence in perceptual choices using statistical signatures of confidence. The most widely used statistical signature is the folded X-pattern, which was derived from a standard model of confidence assuming an objective definition of confidence as the posterior probability of making the correct choice given the evidence. The folded X-pattern entails that confidence as the subjective probability of being correct equals the probability of 0.75 if the stimulus in neutral about the choice options, increases with discriminability of the stimulus in correct trials, and decreases with discriminability in incorrect trials. Here, we show that the standard model of confidence is a special case in which there is no reliable trial-by-trial evidence about discriminability itself. According to a more general model, if there is enough evidence about discriminability, objective confidence is characterised by different pattern: For both correct and incorrect choices, confidence increases with discriminability. In addition, we demonstrate the consequence if discriminability is varied in discrete steps within the standard model: confidence in choices about neutral stimuli is no longer .75. Overall, identifying neural correlates of confidence by presupposing the folded X-pattern as a statistical signature of confidence is not legitimate.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NjLsP5Ns8Mk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: LASSI: A lattice model for simulating phase transitions of multivalent proteins</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/LL1AnHvySzs/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Jeong-Mo Choi, Furqan Dar, Rohit V. Pappu&lt;/p&gt;

Many biomolecular condensates form via spontaneous phase transitions that are driven by multivalent proteins. These molecules are biological instantiations of &lt;i&gt;associative polymers&lt;/i&gt; that conform to a so-called &lt;i&gt;stickers&lt;/i&gt;-and-&lt;i&gt;spacers&lt;/i&gt; architecture. The stickers are protein-protein or protein-RNA interaction motifs and / or domains that can form reversible, non-covalent crosslinks with one another. Spacers are interspersed between stickers and their preferential interactions with solvent molecules determine the cooperativity of phase transitions. Here, we report the development of an open source computational engine known as LASSI (LAttice simulation engine for Sticker and Spacer Interactions) that enables the calculation of full phase diagrams for multicomponent systems comprising of coarse-grained representations of multivalent proteins. LASSI is designed to enable computationally efficient phenomenological modeling of spontaneous phase transitions of multicomponent mixtures comprising of multivalent proteins and RNA molecules. We demonstrate the application of LASSI using simulations of linear and branched multivalent proteins. We show that dense phases are best described as droplet-spanning networks that are characterized by reversible physical crosslinks among multivalent proteins. We connect recent observations regarding correlations between apparent stoichiometry and dwell times of condensates to being proxies for the internal structural organization, specifically the convolution of internal density and extent of networking, within condensates. Finally, we demonstrate that the concept of saturation concentration thresholds does not apply to multicomponent systems where obligate heterotypic interactions drive phase transitions. This emerges from the ellipsoidal structures of phase diagrams for multicomponent systems and it has direct implications for the regulation of biomolecular condensates &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LL1AnHvySzs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: The “maternal effect” on epilepsy risk: analysis of familial epilepsies and reassessment of prior evidence</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25625?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have observed that epilepsy risk is higher among offspring of affected women than offspring of affected men. We tested whether this “maternal effect” was present in familial epilepsies, which are enriched for genetic factors that contribute to epilepsy risk.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We assessed evidence of a maternal effect in a cohort of families containing ≥3 persons with epilepsy using three methods: (1) “downward‐looking” analysis, comparing the rate of epilepsy in offspring of affected women versus men; (2) “upward‐looking” analysis, comparing the rate of the epilepsy among mothers versus fathers of affected individuals; (3) lineage analysis, comparing the the proportion of affected individuals with family history of epilepsy on the maternal versus paternal side.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downward‐looking analysis revealed no difference in epilepsy rates among offspring of affected mothers versus fathers (prevalence ratio 1.0, 95% CI 0.8, 1.2). Upward‐looking analysis revealed more affected mothers than affected fathers; this effect was similar for affected and unaffected sibships (odds ratio 0.8, 95% CI 0.5, 1.2) and was explained by a combination of differential fertility and participation rates. Lineage analysis revealed no significant difference in the likelihood of maternal versus paternal family history of epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found no evidence of a maternal effect on epilepsy risk in this familial epilepsy cohort. Confounding sex imbalances can create the appearance of a maternal effect in upward‐looking analyses and may have impacted prior studies. We discuss possible explanations for the lack of evidence, in familial epilepsies, of the maternal effect observed in population‐based studies.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>RSS PAP: Excitation of diverse classes of cholecystokinin interneurons in the basolateral amygdala facilitates fear extinction</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0220-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;There is growing evidence that interneurons orchestrate neural activity and plasticity in corticoamygdala circuits to regulate fear behaviors. However, defining the precise role of cholecystokinin-expressing interneurons (CCK INs) remains elusive due to the technical challenge of parsing this population from CCK-expressing principal neurons (CCK PNs). Here we used an intersectional genetic strategy in CCK-Cre;Dlx5/6-Flpe double-transgenic mice to study the anatomical, molecular and electrophysiological properties of CCK INs in the basal amygdala (BA) and optogenetically manipulate these cells in fear extinction. Electrophysiological recordings confirmed that this strategy targeted GABAergic cells and that a significant proportion expressed functional cannabinoid CB1 receptors; a defining characteristic of CCK-expressing basket cells. However, immunostaining showed that subsets of the genetically-targeted cells expressed either neuropeptide Y (NPY) (29%) or parvalbumin (PV) (17%), but not somatostatin (SOM) or CaMKII-α. Further morphological and electrophysiological analyses showed that four interneuron types could be identified among the EYFP-expressing cells: CCK/CB1R-expressing basket cells, neurogliaform cells, PV+ basket and PV+ axo-axonic cells. At the behavioral level, &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; optogenetic photostimulation of the targeted population during extinction acquisition led to reduced freezing on a light-free extinction retrieval test, indicating extinction memory facilitation; whereas photosilencing was without effect. Conversely, non-selective (i.e., inclusive of INs and PNs) photostimulation or photosilencing of CCK-targeted cells, using CCK-Cre single-transgenic mice, impaired extinction. These data reveal an unexpectedly high degree of phenotypic complexity in a unique population of extinction-modulating BA INs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Distinct types of interneurons in the basolateral amygdala (BA) are known to control principal cell activity, allowing complex behaviors. Despite their importance, the role of cholecystokinin (CCK)-expressing inhibitory cells remains unknown. In this work, we could specifically alter the function of CCK-expressing interneurons in the BA by using an INTRSECT viral strategy. Using a combination of anatomical and electrophysiological methods, we found that CCK+ interneurons in the BA are comprised of CB1R-expressing basket cells, neurogliaform cells, parvalbumin-expressing basket as well as axo-axonic cells. Importantly, we provided the first direct evidence that CCK-expressing interneurons in the BA can modulate fear extinction learning. Our data thus show that CCK is expressed in functionally diverse interneuron populations, positioned to impact amygdala operation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Adult-onset autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD) is a lately described rare form of leukodystrophy with only one family report from China. As the only disease associated with increased lamina B1 encoded by LMNB1, ADLDs have different clinical presentations, ranging from autonomic to pyramidal tract and cerebellar ataxia. Here, we report a case of ADLD that presented with positional tremor as the initial symptom. T2-weighted brain MRI showed brain atrophy and diffuse high signal intensity of the cerebral white matter and the brain stem. The precise diagnosis was made by identification of the mutated gene. To the best of our knowledge, this is perhaps the first case report of ADLD presenting as tremor in China.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To identify circuits active during neonatal hypoxic–ischemic (HI) seizures and seizure propagation using electroencephalography (EEG), behavior, and whole‐brain neuronal activity mapping.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mice were exposed to HI on postnatal day 10 using unilateral carotid ligation and global hypoxia. EEG and video were recorded for the duration of the experiment. Using immediate early gene reporter mice, active cells expressing &lt;i&gt;cfos&lt;/i&gt; were permanently tagged with reporter protein tdTomato during a 90‐minute window. After 1 week, allowing maximal expression of the reporter protein, whole brains were processed, lipid cleared, and imaged with confocal microscopy. Whole‐brain reconstruction and analysis of active neurons (colocalized tdTomato/NeuN) were performed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HI resulted in seizure behaviors that were bilateral or unilateral tonic–clonic and nonconvulsive in this model. Mice exhibited characteristic EEG background patterns such as burst suppression and suppression. Neuronal activity mapping revealed bilateral motor cortex and unilateral, ischemic somatosensory cortex, lateral thalamus, and hippocampal circuit activation. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed regional differences in myelination, which coincide with these activity patterns. Astrocytes and blood vessel endothelial cells also expressed &lt;i&gt;cfos&lt;/i&gt; during HI.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a combination of EEG, seizure semiology analysis, and whole‐brain neuronal activity mapping, we suggest that this rodent model of neonatal HI results in EEG patterns similar to those observed in human neonates. Activation patterns revealed in this study help explain complex seizure behaviors and EEG patterns observed in neonatal HI injury. This pattern may be, in part, secondary to regional differences in development in the neonatal brain. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Peripheral immune biomarkers and neurodegenerative diseases: A prospective cohort study with 20 years of follow‐up</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25614?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assess the associations of several blood immune biomarkers with the future risks of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson disease in a prospective cohort study with 20 years of follow‐up.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Swedish Apolipoprotein‐Related Mortality Risk study is a longitudinal cohort study including 812,073 participants with repeated blood biomarker measurements between 1985 and 1996 and a follow‐up until 2011. Using a Cox model, we first estimated hazard ratios of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson disease in relation to leukocytes, immunoglobulin G, haptoglobin, and uric acid. We further described the temporal changes of these biomarkers during the 20 years prior to the diagnosis of these diseases.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 585 incident cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 3,769 incident cases of Parkinson disease were identified during the follow‐up. Increasing concentrations of leukocytes, haptoglobin, and uric acid were associated with a lower risk of Parkinson disease. No statistically significant association was, however, noted between the studied biomarkers and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Parkinson disease patients appeared to have lower levels of leukocytes and haptoglobin between 20 and 10 years before diagnosis and lower levels of uric acid during the 20 years before diagnosis, compared to controls, although statistically significant differences were only noted during parts of the respective time intervals after multivariable adjustment. No clear differences were noted between patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and controls.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If verified in studies of independent populations, our findings may suggest a different role of systemic inflammation on the risk of Parkinson disease compared to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Intraoperative Low Alpha Power in the Electroencephalogram Is Associated With Postoperative Subsyndromal Delirium</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00056</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Postoperative delirium (PD) and subsyndromal delirium (PSSD) are frequent complications in older patients associated with poor long-term outcome. It has been suggested that certain electroencephalogram features may be capable of identifying patients at risk during surgery. Thus, the goal of this study was to characterize intraoperative electroencephalographic markers to identify patients prone to develop PD or PSSD.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We conducted an exploratory observational study in older patients scheduled for elective major abdominal surgery. Intraoperative 16 channels electroencephalogram was recorded, and PD/PSSD were diagnosed after surgery with the confusion assessment method (CAM). The total power spectra and relative power of alpha band were calculated.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;PD was diagnosed in 2 patients (6.7%), and 11 patients (36.7%) developed PSSD. All of them (13 patients, PD/PSSD group) were compared with patients without any alterations in CAM (17 patients, control group). There were no detectable power spectrum differences before anesthesia between both groups of patients. However, PD/PSSD group in comparison with control group had a lower intraoperative absolute alpha power during anesthesia (4.4 ± 3.8 dB vs. 9.6 ± 3.2 dB, p = 0.0004) and a lower relative alpha power (0.09 ± 0.06 vs. 0.21 ± 0.08, p &amp;lt; 0.0001). These differences were independent of the anesthetic dose. Finally, relative alpha power had a good ability to identify patients with CAM alterations in the ROC analysis (area under the curve 0.90 (CI 0.78-1), p &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;Discussion&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, a low intraoperative alpha power is a novel electroencephalogram marker to identify patients who will develop alterations in CAM – i.e., with PD or PSSD – after surgery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Indomethacin Enhances Type 1 Cannabinoid Receptor Signaling</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00257</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In addition to its known actions as a non-selective cyclooxygenase (COX) 1 and 2 inhibitor, we hypothesized that indomethacin can act as an allosteric modulator of the type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1R) because of its shared structural features with the known allosteric modulators of CB1R. Indomethacin enhanced the binding of [&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H]CP55940 to hCB1R and enhanced AEA-dependent [&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;S]GTPγS binding to hCB1R in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell membranes. Indomethacin (1 μM) also enhanced CP55940-dependent βarrestin1 recruitment, cAMP inhibition, ERK1/2 and PLCβ3 phosphorylation in HEK293A cells expressing hCB1R, but not in cells expressing hCB2R. Finally, indomethacin enhanced the magnitude and duration of CP55940-induced hypolocomotion, immobility, hypothermia, and anti-nociception in C57BL/6J mice. Together, these data support the hypothesis that indomethacin acted as a positive allosteric modulator of hCB1R. The identification of structural and functional features shared amongst allosteric modulators of CB1R may lead to the development of novel compounds designed for greater CB1R or COX selectivity and compounds designed to modulate both the prostaglandin and endocannabinoid systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Is There a Role for GPCR Agonist Radiotracers in PET Neuroimaging?</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00255</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Positron emission tomography (PET) is a molecular imaging modality that enables in vivo exploration of metabolic processes and especially the pharmacology of neuroreceptors. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) play an important role in numerous pathophysiologic disorders of the central nervous system. Thus, they are targets of choice in PET imaging to bring proof concept of change in density in pathological conditions or in pharmacological challenge. At present, most radiotracers are antagonist ligands. In vitro data suggest that properties differ between GPCR agonists and antagonists: antagonists bind to receptors with a single affinity, whereas agonists are characterized by two different affinities: high affinity for receptors that undergo functional coupling to G-proteins, and low affinity for those that are not coupled. In this context, agonist radiotracers may be useful tools to give functional images of GPCRs in the brain, with high sensitivity to neurotransmitter release. Here, we review all existing PET radiotracers used from animals to humans and their role for understanding the ligand-receptor paradigm of GPCR in comparison with corresponding antagonist radiotracers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Cognitive Enhancement by Transcranial Photobiomodulation Is Associated With Cerebrovascular Oxygenation of the Prefrontal Cortex</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01129</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transcranial infrared laser stimulation (TILS) is a novel, safe, non-invasive method of brain photobiomodulation. Laser stimulation of the human prefrontal cortex causes cognitive enhancement. To investigate the hemodynamic effects in prefrontal cortex by which this cognitive enhancement occurs, we used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), which is a safe, non-invasive method of monitoring hemodynamics. We measured concentration changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin, total hemoglobin and differential effects in 18 healthy adults during sustained attention and working memory performance, before and after laser of the right prefrontal cortex. We also measured 16 sham controls without photobiomodulation. fNIRS revealed large effects on prefrontal oxygenation during cognitive enhancement post-laser and provided the first demonstration that cognitive enhancement by transcranial photobiomodulation is associated with cerebrovascular oxygenation of the prefrontal cortex. Sham control data served to rule out that the laser effects were due to pre-post task repetition or other non-specific effects. A laser-fNIRS combination may be useful to stimulate and monitor cerebrovascular oxygenation associated with neurocognitive enhancement in healthy individuals and in those with prefrontal hypometabolism, such as in cognitive aging, dementia and many neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Generating Brain Waves, the Power of Astrocytes</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01125</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Synchronization of neuronal activity in the brain underlies the emergence of neuronal oscillations termed “brain waves”, which serve various physiological functions and correlate with different behavioral states. It has been postulated that at least ten distinct mechanisms are involved in the formulation of these brain waves, including variations in the concentration of extracellular neurotransmitters and ions, as well as changes in cellular excitability. In this mini review we highlight the contribution of astrocytes, a subtype of glia, in the formation and modulation of brain waves mainly due to their close association with synapses that allows their bidirectional interaction with neurons, and their syncytium-like activity via gap junctions that facilitate communication to distal brain regions through Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; waves. These capabilities allow astrocytes to regulate neuronal excitability via glutamate uptake, gliotransmission and tight control of the extracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; levels via a process termed K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; clearance. Spatio-temporal synchrony of activity across neuronal and astrocytic networks, both locally and distributed across cortical regions, underpins brain states and thereby behavioral states, and it is becoming apparent that astrocytes play an important role in the development and maintenance of neural activity underlying these complex behavioral states.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01112</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Diabetes mellitus is one of the major risk factors for cognitive dysfunction. The pathogenesis of brain impairment caused by chronic hyperglycemia is complex and includes mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, neurotransmitters’ alteration, and vascular disease, which lead to cognitive impairment, neurodegeneration, loss of synaptic plasticity, brain aging, and dementia. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), a gut released hormone, is attracting attention as a possible link between metabolic and brain impairment. Several studies have shown the influence of GPL-1 on neuronal functions such as thermogenesis, blood pressure control, neurogenesis, neurodegeneration, retinal repair, and energy homeostasis. Moreover, modulation of GLP-1 activity can influence amyloid β peptide aggregation in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and dopamine (DA) levels in Parkinson’s disease (PD). GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) showed beneficial actions on brain ischemia in animal models, such as the reduction of cerebral infarct area and the improvement of neurological deficit, acting mainly through inhibition of oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. They might also exert a beneficial effect on the cognitive impairment induced by diabetes or obesity improving learning and memory by modulating synaptic plasticity. Moreover, GLP-1RAs reduced hippocampal neurodegeneration. Besides this, there are growing evidences on neuroprotective effects of these agonists in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases, regardless of diabetes. In PD animal models, GPL-1RAs were able to protect motor activity and dopaminergic neurons whereas in AD models, they seemed to improve nearly all neuropathological features and cognitive functions. Although further clinical studies of GPL-1RAs in humans are needed, they seem to be a promising therapy for diabetes-associated cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01102</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease, and the pathogenesis is still quite challenging. Emerging evidence has shown that the brain–gut–microbiota axis served a pivotal role in neurological diseases; however, researches utilizing metagenomic sequencing to analyze the alteration in gut microbiota of MSA patients were quite rare. Here, we carried out metagenomic sequencing in feces of 15 MSA patients and 15 healthy controls, to characterize the alterations in gut microbial composition and function of MSA patients in mainland China. The results showed that gut microbial community of MSA patients was significantly different from healthy controls, characterized by increased genus Akkermansia and species Roseburia hominis, Akkermansia muciniphila, Alistipes onderdonkii, Streptococcus parasanguinis, and Staphylococcus xylosus, while decreased genera Megamonas, Bifidobacterium, Blautia, and Aggregatibacter and species Bacteroides coprocola, Megamonas funiformis, Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, Clostridium nexile, Bacteroides plebeius, and Granulicatella adiacens. Further, functional analysis based on the KEGG database revealed aberrant functional pathways in fecal microbiome of MSA patients. In conclusion, our findings provided evidence for dysbiosis in gut microbiota of Chinese MSA cohorts and helped develop new testable hypotheses on pathophysiology of MSA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Effects of Non-invasive Brain Stimulation on Stimulant Craving in Users of Cocaine, Amphetamine, or Methamphetamine: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01095</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dopamine system plays a pivotal role in specific kinds of substance use disorders (SUD, i. e., cocaine and methamphetamine use disorders). Many studies addressed whether dopamine-involved craving could be alleviated by non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques. Nevertheless, the outcomes were highly inconsistent and the stimulating parameters were highly variable. In the current study, we ran a meta-analysis to identify an overall effect size of NIBS and try to find stimulating parameters of special note. We primarily find 2,530 unduplicated studies in PubMed, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar database involving “Cocaine”/“Amphetamine”/“Methamphetamine” binded with “TMS”/“tDCS”/“non-invasive stimulation” in either field. After visual screening, 26 studies remained. While 16 studies were further excluded due to the lack of data, invalid craving scoring or the absence of sham condition. At last, 16 units of analysis in 12 eligible studies were coded and forwarded to a random-effect analysis. The results showed a large positive main effect of stimulation (Hedge's g = 1.116, CI = [0.597, 1.634]). Further subgroup analysis found that only high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) could elicit a significant decrease in craving, while the outcome of low-frequency stimulation was relatively controversial. Moreover, univariate meta regression revealed that the number of pulses per session could impose negative moderation toward the intervention. No significant moderation effect was found in types of abuse, overall days of stimulation and other variables of stimulating protocol. In conclusion, this meta-analysis offered a persuasive evidence for the feasibility of using NIBS to remit substance addictive behavior directly based on dopamine system. We also give clear methodological guidance that researchers are expected to use high-frequency, sufficiently segmented rTMS to improve the efficacy in future treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01067</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nano-sized particles constitutively released from cells into all biological fluids. Interestingly, these vesicles contain genetic cargoes including proteins, RNA and bioactive lipids that can be functionally delivered and affect recipient cells. As a result, there is growing interest in studying EVs in pathological conditions, including central nervous system (CNS)-related diseases, as EVs may be used for diagnostic purposes or as therapeutic agents. However, one major bottleneck is the need for better EV purification strategies when considering complex biological sources such as serum/protein-rich media or plasma. In this study, we have performed a systematic comparison study between the current gold-standard method: ultracentrifugation, to an alternative: size-exclusion chromatography (LC), using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived complex media as a model system. We demonstrate that LC allows for derivation of purer EVs from iPSCs, which was previously impossible with the original UC method. Importantly, our study further highlights the various drawbacks when using the conventional UC approach that lead to misinterpretation of EV data. Lastly, we describe novel data on our iPSC-EVs; how they could relate to stem cell biology and discuss their potential use as EV therapeutics for CNS diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Alterations of Regional Homogeneity and Functional Connectivity Following Short-Term Mindfulness Meditation in Healthy Volunteers</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00376</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness is described as the non-judgmental awareness of experiences in the present moment. The sustained practice of mindfulness may also have beneficial effects on an individual’s well-being. For instance, mindfulness meditation is an effective approach for improving emotion regulation. Specifically, the early stage of mindfulness meditation training enhances emotional monitoring systems related to attention regulation and executive function. Reduced activity in the default mode network (DMN) would probably be observed corresponding to the attenuated mind wandering. In the present study, we hypothesized that alterations in functional activity in the frontal-parietal cortex and DMN may be induced by short-term mindfulness meditation. In this study, before and after 8 weeks of weekly Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) training, healthy participants were evaluated using a mindfulness questionnaire and an affect schedule, as well as via resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Sixteen right-handed non-meditators were enrolled. Another 16 demographically matched healthy adults without any meditation experience were recruited as controls. Pre- and post-MBSR assessments were compared. Increased regional homogeneity in the right superior parietal lobule and left postcentral gyrus (PoCG), as well as altered functional connectivity in PoCG-related networks, were observed post-MBSR. The mindfulness questionnaire scores also improved and negative affect was significantly decreased after MBSR. Together with reduced involvement of the posterior brain, our results suggest a tendency toward stronger involvement of the parietal cortex in mindfulness beginners. This study provides novel evidence regarding the optimization of emotional processing with short-term mindfulness meditation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Atypical Amygdala–Neocortex Interaction During Dynamic Facial Expression Processing in Autism Spectrum Disorder</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00351</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Atypical reciprocal social interactions involving emotional facial expressions are a core clinical feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have demonstrated that some social brain regions, including subcortical (e.g., amygdala) and neocortical regions (e.g., fusiform gyrus, FG) are less activated during the processing of facial expression stimuli in individuals with ASD. However, the functional networking patterns between the subcortical and cortical regions in processing emotional facial expressions remain unclear. We investigated this issue in ASD (n = 31) and typically developing (TD; n = 31) individuals using fMRI. Participants viewed dynamic facial expressions of anger and happiness and their corresponding mosaic images. Regional brain activity analysis revealed reduced activation of several social brain regions, including the amygdala, in the ASD group compared with the TD group in response to dynamic facial expressions vs. dynamic mosaics (p &amp;lt; 0.05, ηp2 = 0.19). Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) analyses were then used to compare models with forward, backward, and bi-directional effective connectivity between the amygdala and neocortical networks. The results revealed that: (1) the model with effective connectivity from the amygdala to the neocortex best fit the data of both groups; and (2) the same model best accounted for group differences. Coupling parameter (i.e., effective connectivity) analyses showed that the modulatory effects of dynamic facial processing were substantially weaker in the ASD group than in the TD group. These findings suggest that atypical modulation from the amygdala to the neocortex underlies impairment in social interaction involving dynamic facial expressions in individuals with ASD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00066</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many studies have demonstrated that vestibular sensory input is important for spatial learning and memory. However, it has been unclear what contributions the different parts of the vestibular system – the semi-circular canals and otoliths – make to these processes. The advent of mutant otolith-deficient mice has made it possible to isolate the relative contributions of the otoliths, the utricle and saccule. A number of studies have now indicated that the loss of otolithic function impairs normal spatial memory and also impairs the normal function of head direction cells in the thalamus and place cells in the hippocampus. Epidemiological studies have also provided evidence that spatial memory impairment with aging, may be linked to saccular function. The otoliths may be important in spatial cognition because of their evolutionary age as a sensory detector of orientation and the fact that velocity storage is important to the way that the brain encodes its place in space.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Neuroinflammation and the Gut Microbiota: Possible Alternative Therapeutic Targets to Counteract Alzheimer’s Disease?</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00284</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a complex, multi-factorial disease affecting various brain systems. This complexity implies that successful therapies must be directed against several core neuropathological targets rather than single ones. The scientific community has made great efforts to identify the right AD targets beside the historic amyloid-β (Aβ). Neuroinflammation is re-emerging as determinant in the neuropathological process of AD. A new theory, still in its infancy, highlights the role of gut microbiota (GM) in the control of brain development, but also in the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Bidirectional communication between the central and the enteric nervous systems, called gut-brain axes, is largely influenced by GM and the immune system is a potential key mediator of this interaction. Growing evidence points to the role of GM in the maturation and activation of host microglia and peripheral immune cells. Several recent studies have found abnormalities in GM (dysbiosis) in AD populations. These observations raise the intriguing question whether and how GM dysbiosis could contribute to AD development through action on the immune system and whether, in a therapeutic prospective, the development of strategies preserving a healthy GM might become a valuable approach to prevent AD. Here, we review the evidence from animal models and humans of the role of GM in neuroinflammation and AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: A Review of the Application of Virtual Reality Technology in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Cognitive Impairment</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00280</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;At present, with the development of an aging society and an increase in the number of elderly people, in order to ensure the ability and enthusiasm of the elderly to live independently, it is necessary to ensure that they can understand the world in a normal way. More and more elderly people have cognitive impairment, and virtual reality (VR) technology is more effective in cognitive diagnosis and treatment than traditional methods. This review article describes some studies on cognitive diagnosis and training for the elderly, and puts forward some suggestions for current studies, in the hopes that VR technology can be better applied to cognitive diagnosis and training.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: In Vitro Modeling of the Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia Using Patient-Derived Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells with Copy Number Variations of PCDH15 and RELN</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/5/ENEURO.0403-18.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Bipolar disorder (BP) and schizophrenia (SCZ) are major psychiatric disorders, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the complicated pathologies of these disorders remain unclear. It is difficult to establish adequate &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; models for pathological analysis because of the heterogeneity of these disorders. In the present study, to recapitulate the pathologies of these disorders &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, we established &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; models by differentiating mature neurons from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) derived from BP and SCZ patient with contributive copy number variations, as follows: two BP patients with &lt;i&gt;PCDH15&lt;/i&gt; deletion and one SCZ patient with &lt;i&gt;RELN&lt;/i&gt; deletion. Glutamatergic neurons and GABAergic neurons were induced from hiPSCs under optimized conditions. Both types of induced neurons from both hiPSCs exhibited similar phenotypes of MAP2 (microtubule-associated protein 2)-positive dendrite shortening and decreasing synapse numbers. Additionally, we analyzed isogenic &lt;i&gt;PCDH15&lt;/i&gt;- or &lt;i&gt;RELN&lt;/i&gt;-deleted cells. The dendrite and synapse phenotypes of isogenic neurons were partially similar to those of patient-derived neurons. These results suggest that the observed phenotypes are general phenotypes of psychiatric disorders, and our &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; models using hiPSC-based technology may be suitable for analysis of the pathologies of psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: The Reuniens Nucleus of the Thalamus Has an Essential Role in Coordinating Slow-Wave Activity between Neocortex and Hippocampus</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/5/ENEURO.0365-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Sleep is a period of profound neural synchrony throughout the brain, a phenomenon involved in various physiological functions. The coordination between neocortex and hippocampus, in particular, appears to be critical for episodic memory, and, indeed, enhanced synchrony in this circuit is a hallmark of slow-wave sleep. However, it is unclear how this coordination is mediated. To this end, we examined the role of the thalamic nucleus reuniens (RE), a midline body with reciprocal connections to both prefrontal and hippocampal cortices. Using a combination of electrophysiological, optogenetic, and chemogenetic techniques in the urethane-anesthetized rat (a model of forebrain sleep activity), we directly assessed the role of the RE in mediating slow oscillatory synchrony. Using unit recording techniques, we confirmed that RE neurons showed slow rhythmic activity patterns during deactivated forebrain states that were coupled to ongoing slow oscillations. Optogenetic activation of RE neurons or their projection fibers in the cingulum bundle caused an evoked potential in hippocampus that was maximal at the level of stratum lacunosum-moleculare of CA1. A similar but longer-latency response could be evoked by stimulation of the medial prefrontal cortex that was then abolished by chemogenetic inhibition of the RE. Inactivation of the RE also severely reduced the coherence of the slow oscillation across cortical and hippocampal sites, suggesting that its activity is necessary to couple slow-wave activity across these regions. These results indicate an essential role of the RE in coordinating neocortico-hippocampal slow oscillatory activity, which may be fundamental for slow-wave sleep-related episodic memory consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Quantitation and Simulation of Single Action Potential-Evoked Ca2+ Signals in CA1 Pyramidal Neuron Presynaptic Terminals</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/5/ENEURO.0343-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; evokes exocytosis, endocytosis, and synaptic plasticity. However, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; flux and interactions at presynaptic molecular targets are difficult to quantify because fluorescence imaging has limited resolution. In rats of either sex, we measured single varicosity presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; using Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dyes as buffers, and constructed models of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dispersal. Action potentials evoked Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients with little variation when measured with low-affinity dye (peak amplitude 789 ± 39 nM, within 2 ms of stimulation; decay times, 119 ± 10 ms). Endogenous Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; buffering capacity, action potential-evoked free [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, and total Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; amounts entering terminals were determined using Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dyes as buffers. These data constrained Monte Carlo (MCell) simulations of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry, buffering, and removal. Simulations of experimentally-determined Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; fluxes, buffered by simulated calbindin&lt;sub&gt;28K&lt;/sub&gt; well fit data, and were consistent with clustered Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry followed within 4 ms by diffusion throughout the varicosity. Repetitive stimulation caused free varicosity Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to sum. However, simulated in nanometer domains, its removal by pumps and buffering was negligible, while local diffusion dominated. Thus, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; within tens of nanometers of entry, did not accumulate. A model of synaptotagmin1 (syt1)-Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; binding indicates that even with 10 µM free varicosity evoked Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, syt1 must be within tens of nanometers of channels to ensure occupation of all its Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-binding sites. Repetitive stimulation, evoking short-term synaptic enhancement, does not modify probabilities of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; fully occupying syt1’s C2 domains, suggesting that enhancement is not mediated by Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-syt1 interactions. We conclude that at spatiotemporal scales of fusion machines, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; necessary for their activation is diffusion dominated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Sleep Deprivation Disrupts Acquisition of Contextual Fear Extinction by Affecting Circadian Oscillation of Hippocampal-Infralimbic proBDNF</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/5/ENEURO.0165-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Extensive evidence showed that mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor (mBDNF) levels displayed a circadian pattern. Circadian disruption, for example, sleep deprivation (SD), induced functional and behavioral deficits. However, compared with that of mature form, the biological role of the pro-peptide, proBDNF, was poorly understood. Here, we found that proBDNF was expressed under circadian rhythm in the ventral hippocampus (vHPC). SD rats exhibited deficits in acquisition of conditioned extinction and damped rhythmicity in vHPC proBDNF activity that were accompanied by SD between zeitgeber time (ZT)0 and ZT4, but not the late stage of sleep period. Furthermore, SD affected fear extinction through vHPC-IL proBDNF signaling, which was associated with NR2B subunits of NMDA receptors. More importantly, infusion of proBDNF could mitigate SD-induced abnormal neural activity, by suppressing the enhanced basal firing rate of IL-RS and elevating the depressed neural response that evoked by acquisition of conditioned extinction. Therefore, this finding provided the first evidence that circadian oscillation of vHPC proBDNF activity contributed to the effects of SD on acquisition of conditioned fear extinction, and suggested a new therapeutic target to reverse the cognitive deficits in sleep-related mental disorder, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: The TRPA1 ion channel contributes to sensory-guided avoidance of menthol in mice</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0304-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The flavoring agent menthol elicits complex orosensory and behavioral effects including perceived cooling at low concentrations, and irritation and ingestive avoidance at higher intensities. Oral menthol engages the cold-activated transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel TRP melastatin 8 (TRPM8) on trigeminal fibers, although its aversive feature was discussed to involve activation of TRP ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) associated with nociceptive processing. Here we studied the roles of TRPM8 and TRPA1 in orosensory responding to menthol by subjecting mice gene-deficient for either channel to brief-access exposure tests, which measure immediate licking responses to fluid stimuli to capture sensory/tongue control of behavior. Stimuli included aqueous concentration series of (–)-menthol (0 [water], 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.3 mM) and the aversive bitter taste stimulus quinine-HCl (0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, and 3 mM). Concentration-response data were generated from daily brief-access tests conducted in lickometers, which recorded the number of licks water-restricted mice emitted to a randomly selected stimulus concentration over a block of several 10 sec stimulus presentations. Wild-type mice showed aversive orosensory responses to menthol above 0.7 mM. Oral aversion to menthol was reduced in mice deficient for TRPA1, but not TRPM8. Oral aversion to quinine was similar between TRPA1 mutant and control mice but stronger than avoidance of menthol. This implied menthol avoidance under the present conditions represented a moderate form of oral aversion. These data reveal TRPA1 contributes to the oral sensory valence of menthol and have implications for how input from TRPA1 and TRPM8 shapes somatosensory-guided behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Menthol is used in confectionery, tobacco, and oral consumer products to add a pleasant &quot;coolness&quot; to their flavor appeal. Yet menthol’s sensation is complex and includes coolness at low but irritation at high concentrations. Elucidating mechanisms that underlie menthol’s aversive flavor component would facilitate understanding of how trigeminal circuits distinguish noxious from innocuous stimuli. Although engaging the cold receptor TRPM8, menthol was discussed to induce oral irritation through its activation of TRPA1, which is expressed on nociceptive fibers usually devoid of TRPM8. Here we found mice gene-deficient for TRPA1, but not TRPM8, show reduced aversion to menthol in an oral sensory-guided behavioral task. These results have implications for how TRPM8 and TRPA1 afferents contribute to hedonic tone during somatosensory-influenced behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It is currently unclear whether the glymphatic system, a brain‐wide interstitial fluid–cerebrospinal fluid exchange described in rodents, exists in humans. Focal blood–brain barrier disruption using magnetic resonance–guided focused ultrasound allows parenchymal penetration of gadobutrol contrast, creating an opportunity to study glymphatics in vivo noninvasively. We describe patterns of contrast distribution in the perivascular space, subarachnoid space, and space surrounding large veins draining toward the dural sinuses on fluid‐attenuated inversion recovery in subjects with Alzheimer disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This is the first evidence suggesting glymphatic efflux persists in humans. It's relevance to proteinopathies and drug delivery is discussed. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Amyloid, Vascular, and Resilience Pathways Associated with Cognitive Aging</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25600?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate the multifactorial processes underlying cognitive aging based on the hypothesis that multiple causal pathways and mechanisms (amyloid, vascular, and resilience) influence longitudinal cognitive decline in each individual through worsening brain health.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified 1,230 elderly subjects (aged ≥50 years) with an average of 4.9 years of clinical follow‐up and with amyloid positron emission tomography, diffusion tensor imaging, and structural magnetic resonance imaging scans from the population‐based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. We examined imaging markers of amyloid and brain health (white matter microstructural integrity and cortical thinning), systemic vascular health preceding the imaging markers, and early to midlife intellectual enrichment to predict longitudinal cognitive trajectories. We used latent growth curve models for modeling longitudinal cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the pathways (amyloid, vascular, resilience) converged through their effects on cortical thinning and worsening cognition and together explained patterns in cognitive decline. Resilience and vascular pathways (aging process, sex differences, education/occupation, and systemic vascular health) had significant impact on white matter microstructural integrity. Education/occupation levels contributed to white matter integrity through systemic vascular health. Worsening white matter integrity contributed to significant cortical thinning and subsequently longitudinal cognitive decline. Baseline amyloidosis contributed to a significant proportion of cognitive decline that accelerated with longer follow‐up times, and its primary impact was through cortical thinning.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We developed an integrated framework to help explain the dynamic and complex process of cognitive aging by considering key causal pathways. Such an approach is important for both better comprehension of cognitive aging processes and will aid in the development of successful intervention strategies.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Antiepileptic drugs and suicide: the role of prior suicidal behavior and parental psychiatric disorder</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25623?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To examine if prior suicidal behavior and familial predisposition to psychiatric disorders modify the association between antiepileptic drug use and completed suicide.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the Danish National Prescription Register, we identified all incident users of antiepileptic drugs aged 15 years or older in Denmark between July 1997 and December 2015. We carried out a nested case‐control study and defined exposure to antiepileptic drugs at the index date (i.e. time of suicide). Conditional logistic regressions were used to estimate mortality rate ratios (MRR) of suicide in current versus previous users of antiepileptic drugs. We also analyzed suicide risk associated with the nine most commonly used antiepileptic drugs.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified 1,759 individuals completing suicide. Current versus previous use of any antiepileptic drug was associated with an increased risk of suicide (MRR=1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI):1.13‐1.40). This excess risk was observed in individuals with a history of suicidal behavior (MRR=1.28, 95% CI: 1.07‐1.54) and in those without (MRR=1.26, 95% CI: 1.11‐1.43), and in individuals with a familial predisposition to psychiatric disorders (MRR=1.48, 95% CI: 1.18‐1.87), and in those without (MRR=1.21, 95% CI: 1.07‐1.35).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use of antiepileptic drugs was associated with an increased risk of suicide. The findings do not support that the risk of suicide following treatment with antiepileptic drugs identified in randomized trials is explained by prior suicidality or familial predisposition to psychiatric disorders. The additional risk of suicide associated with use of antiepileptic drugs was generally low and should be balanced against benefits of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accurate antemortem diagnosis of Parkinsonism is primarily based on clinical evaluation with limited biomarkers. We evaluated the diagnostic utility of quantitative REM sleep without atonia analysis in the submentalis and anterior tibialis muscles in parkinsonian patients (53 synucleinopathy, 24 tauopathy). Receiver‐operating characteristic curves determined REM sleep without atonia cutoffs distinguishing synucleinopathies from tauopathies. Elevated submentalis muscle activity was highly sensitive (70‐77%) and specific (95‐100%) distinguishing synucleinopathy from tauopathy. In contrast, anterior tibialis synucleinopathy discrimination was poor. Our results suggest that elevated submentalis REM sleep without atonia appears to be a potentially useful biomarker for presumed synucleinopathy etiologies in Parkinsonism.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00254</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The discovery of extracellular RNA (exRNA) has shifted our understanding of the role of RNA in complex cellular functions such as cell-to-cell communication and a variety of pathologies. ExRNAs constitute a heterogenous group of RNAs ranging from small (such as microRNAs) and long non-coding to coding RNAs or ribosomal RNAs. ExRNAs can be liberated from cells in a free form or bound to proteins as well as in association with microvesicles (MVs), exosomes, or apoptotic bodies. Their composition and quantity depend heavily on the cellular or non-cellular component, the origin, and the RNA species being investigated; ribosomal RNA provides the majority of exRNA and miRNAs are predominantly associated with exosomes or MVs. Several studies showed that ribosomal exRNA (rexRNA) constitutes a proinflammatory and prothrombotic alarmin. It is released by various cell types upon inflammatory stimulation and by damaged cells undergoing necrosis or apoptosis and contributes to innate immunity responses. This exRNA has the potential to directly promote the release of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor factor-α (TNF-α) or interleukin-6 from immune cells, thereby leading to a proinflammatory environment and promoting cardiovascular pathologies. The potential role of exRNA in different pathologies of the central nervous system (CNS) has become of increasing interest in recent years. Although various exRNA species including both ribosomal exRNA as well as miRNAs have been associated with CNS pathologies, their precise roles remain to be further elucidated. In this review, the different entities of exRNA and their postulated roles in CNS pathologies including tumors, vascular pathologies and neuroinflammatory diseases will be discussed. Furthermore, the potential role of exRNAs as diagnostic markers for specific CNS diseases will be outlined, as well as possible treatment strategies addressing exRNA inhibition or interference.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00243</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alterations in the homeostasis of either cortical progenitor pool, namely the apically located radial glial (RG) cells or the basal intermediate progenitors (IPCs) can severely impair cortical neuron production. Such changes are reflected by microcephaly and are often associated with cognitive defects. Genes encoding epigenetic regulators are a frequent cause of intellectual disability and many have been shown to regulate progenitor cell growth, including our inactivation of the Smarca1 gene encoding Snf2l, which is one of two ISWI mammalian orthologs. Loss of the Snf2l protein resulted in dysregulation of Foxg1 and IPC proliferation leading to macrocephaly. Here we show that inactivation of the closely related Smarca5 gene encoding the Snf2h chromatin remodeler is necessary for embryonic IPC expansion and subsequent specification of callosal projection neurons. Telencephalon-specific Smarca5 cKO embryos have impaired cell cycle kinetics and increased cell death, resulting in fewer Tbr2+ and FoxG1+ IPCs by mid-neurogenesis. These deficits give rise to adult mice with a dramatic reduction in Satb2+ upper layer neurons, and partial agenesis of the corpus callosum. Mice survive into adulthood but molecularly display reduced expression of the clustered protocadherin genes that may further contribute to altered dendritic arborization and a hyperactive behavioral phenotype. Our studies provide novel insight into the developmental function of Snf2h-dependent chromatin remodeling processes during brain development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01103</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is an adult onset, fatal disease, characterized by an accumulation of alpha-synuclein (α-syn) in oligodendroglial cells. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs involved in post-translational regulation and several biological processes. Disruption of miRNA-related pathways in the central nervous system (CNS) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including MSA. While the exact mechanisms underlying miRNAs in the pathogenesis of MSA remain unclear, it is known that miRNAs can repress the translation of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that regulate the following pathogenesis associated with MSA: autophagy, neuroinflammation, α-syn accumulation, synaptic transmission, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. In this review, the metabolism of miRNAs and their functional roles in the pathogenesis of MSA are discussed, thereby highlighting miRNAs as potential new biomarkers for the diagnosis of MSA and in increasing our understanding of the disease process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01101</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Determining the structure of a network is of central importance to understanding its function in both neuroscience and applied mathematics. However, recovering the structural connectivity of neuronal networks remains a fundamental challenge both theoretically and experimentally. While neuronal networks operate in certain dynamical regimes, which may influence their connectivity reconstruction, there is widespread experimental evidence of a balanced neuronal operating state in which strong excitatory and inhibitory inputs are dynamically adjusted such that neuronal voltages primarily remain near resting potential. Utilizing the dynamics of model neurons in such a balanced regime in conjunction with the ubiquitous sparse connectivity structure of neuronal networks, we develop a compressive sensing theoretical framework for efficiently reconstructing network connections by measuring individual neuronal activity in response to a relatively small ensemble of random stimuli injected over a short time scale. By tuning the network dynamical regime, we determine that the highest fidelity reconstructions are achievable in the balanced state. We hypothesize the balanced dynamics observed in vivo may therefore be a result of evolutionary selection for optimal information encoding and expect the methodology developed to be generalizable for alternative model networks as well as experimental paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Genetic mutations and aging-associated oxidative damage underlie the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, like Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Machado-Joseph disease (MJD). Natural products derived from plants have been regarded as important sources of novel bioactive compounds to counteract neurodegeneration. Here, we tested the neuroprotective effect of an ethanolic extract of rapeseed pomace (RSP), a rapeseed (canola) oil production by-product, in C. elegans models of MJD and PD. The extract, containing sinapine and other phenolics, restored motor function of mutant ataxin-3 (ATXN3) animals (MJD) and prevented degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in one toxin-induced and two genetic models of PD. Whole-organism sensors of antioxidant and xenobiotic response activation revealed the induction of phase II detoxification enzymes, including glutathione S- transferase (GST-4) upon RSP extract supplementation. Furthermore in vivo pharmacogenetic studies confirmed gst-4 is required for the therapeutic effect of RSP extract in the two disease models. The results suggest that GST-4-mediated antioxidant pathways may constitute promising therapeutic co-targets for neurodegenerative diseases and confirm the utility of searching for bioactive compounds in novel sources, including food and agricultural waste/by-products, such as RSP.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01077</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As the capacity to isolate distinct neuronal cell types has advanced over the past several decades, new two- and three-dimensional in vitro models of the interactions between different brain regions have expanded our understanding of human neurobiology and the origins of disease. These cultures develop distinctive patterns of activity, but the extent that these patterns are determined by the molecular identity of individual cell types versus the specific pattern of network connectivity is unclear. To address the question of how individual cell types interact in vitro, we developed a simplified culture using two excitatory neuronal subtypes known to participate in the in vivo reticulospinal circuit: HB9&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; spinal motor neurons and Chx10&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; hindbrain V2a neurons. Here, we report the emergence of cell type-specific patterns of activity in culture; on their own, Chx10&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons developed regular, synchronized bursts of activity that recruited neurons across the entire culture, whereas HB9&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neuron activity consisted of an irregular pattern. When these two subtypes were cocultured, HB9&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons developed synchronized network bursts that were precisely correlated with Chx10&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neuron activity, thereby recreating an aspect of Chx10&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons’ role in driving motor activity. These bursts were dependent on AMPA receptors. Our results demonstrate that the molecular classification of the neurons comprising in vitro networks is a crucial determinant of their activity. It is therefore possible to improve both the reproducibility and the applicability of in vitro neurobiological and disease models by carefully controlling the constituent mixtures of neuronal subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01070</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motoneurons death. Mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) protein have been identified to be related to the disease. Beyond the different altered pathways, the mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the major features that leads to the selective death of motoneurons in ALS. The NSC-34 cell line, overexpressing human SOD1(G93A) mutant protein [NSC-34(G93A)], is considered an optimal in vitro model to study ALS. Here we investigated the energy metabolism in NSC-34(G93A) cells and in particular the effect of the mutated SOD1(G93A) protein on the mitochondrial respiratory capacity (complexes I-IV) by high resolution respirometry (HRR) and cytofluorimetry. We demonstrated that NSC-34(G93A) cells show a reduced mitochondrial oxidative capacity. In particular, we found significant impairment of the complex I-linked oxidative phosphorylation, reduced efficiency of the electron transfer system (ETS) associated with a higher rate of dissipative respiration, and a lower membrane potential. In order to rescue the effect of the mutated SOD1 gene on mitochondria impairment, we evaluated the efficacy of the exosomes, isolated from adipose-derived stem cells, administrated on the NSC-34(G93A) cells. These data show that ASCs-exosomes are able to restore complex I activity, coupling efficiency and mitochondrial membrane potential. Our results improve the knowledge about mitochondrial bioenergetic defects directly associated with the SOD1(G93A) mutation, and prove the efficacy of adipose-derived stem cells exosomes to rescue the function of mitochondria, indicating that these vesicles could represent a valuable approach to target mitochondrial dysfunction in ALS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01063</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Regarding the determination of the biomechanical parameters in a reliable in vitro cell model for diffuse axonal injury (DAI), our study aimed to demonstrate connections between those parameters and secondary axotomy through examination of morphological alterations under a variety of traumatic conditions. An in vitro cell model for DAI was established in primary cultured mouse neurons by uniaxial mechanical stretching of non-myelinated axons under various traumatic conditions: strain (ε) = 5, 10, 20, and 50%; strain time (t) = 500, 100, and 20 ms; strain rate ranging between 0.1 and 25 s&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;. Axonal real strains (strain&lt;sub&gt;axon&lt;/sub&gt;) were measured as 4.53 ± 0.27, 9.02 ± 0.91, 17.75 ± 1.65, and 41.8 ± 4.4%. Axonal real strain rates (SR&lt;sub&gt;axon&lt;/sub&gt;) ranged between 0.096 ± 0.0054 and 20.9 ± 2.2 s&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;. Results showed there was no obvious abnormality of axons with a lower strain condition (strain&lt;sub&gt;axon&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 17.75 ± 1.65%) during the acute phase within 30 min after injury. In contrast, acute axonal degeneration (AAD) was observed in the axons following injury with a higher strain condition (SR&lt;sub&gt;axon&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; 17.75 ± 1.65%). In addition, the incidence and degree of AAD were closely correlated with strain rate. Specifically, AAD occurred to all axons that were examined, when ε = 50% (strain&lt;sub&gt;axon&lt;/sub&gt; = 41.8 ± 4.4%) for 20 ms, while no spontaneous rupture was observed in those axons. Besides, the concentration of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; within the axonal process was significantly increased under such traumatic conditions. Moreover, the continuity of axon cytoskeleton was interrupted, eventually resulting in neuronal death during subacute stage following injury. In this study, we found that there is a minimum strain threshold for the occurrence of AAD in non-myelinated axons of primary cultured mouse neurons, which ranges between 9.02 ± 0.91 and 17.75 ± 1.65%. Basically, the severity of axonal secondary axotomy post DAI is strain rate dependent under a higher strain above the threshold. Hence, a reliable and reproducible in vitro cell model for DAI was established, when ε = 50% (strain&lt;sub&gt;axon&lt;/sub&gt; = 41.8 ± 4.4%) for 20 ms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we describe a Bayesian deep neural network (DNN) for predicting FreeSurfer segmentations of structural MRI volumes, in minutes rather than hours. The network was trained and evaluated on a large dataset (n = 11,480), obtained by combining data from more than a hundred different sites, and also evaluated on another completely held-out dataset (n = 418). The network was trained using a novel spike-and-slab dropout-based variational inference approach. We show that, on these datasets, the proposed Bayesian DNN outperforms previously proposed methods, in terms of the similarity between the segmentation predictions and the FreeSurfer labels, and the usefulness of the estimate uncertainty of these predictions. In particular, we demonstrated that the prediction uncertainty of this network at each voxel is a good indicator of whether the network has made an error and that the uncertainty across the whole brain can predict the manual quality control ratings of a scan. The proposed Bayesian DNN method should be applicable to any new network architecture for addressing the segmentation problem.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Gender- and Age-Specific Differences in Resting-State Functional Connectivity of the Central Autonomic Network in Adulthood</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00369</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Previous functional imaging studies have identified the role of central autonomic network (CAN) in autonomic regulation during various tasks. However, its variability with respect to gender and age, particularly in the resting state, remains poorly understood. Therefore, in this study we systematically investigated gender- and age-related differences in the resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) seeded from core regions of this network, namely posterior mid-cingulate gyrus (pMCC), left amygdala, right anterior and left posterior insula, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), using a large cross-sectional adulthood sample. Results revealed that each of the seeded connectivity maps engaged in at least one of the large-scale brain networks including sensorimotor, attentional, basal ganglia, limbic, and default mode networks (DMN). In the early-adulthood stage, females had stronger negative rsFC in pMCC and right anterior INS (aINS) with the medial DMN than males, possibly reflecting their greater suppression of the sympathoexcitation associated with sex hormonal estrogen. Whereas in the late-adulthood stage, they showed stronger positive rsFC in pMCC with postcentral gyrus and weaker negative rsFC with the most DMN, possibly relating to their higher risk of depression, anxiety, and dementia than males after menopause. Moreover, females demonstrated reduced negative rsFC in pMCC with dorsal PCUN/PCC and left AG with advancing age, whereas males showed the opposite pattern, namely increased positive rsFC, in pMCC with right SMG, and in vmPFC with ventral PCUN. We interpret these results as their differences of altered autonomic regulation associated with pain experience and reflective movement, respectively, due to aging. In sum, our findings add in literature that autonomic responses can be also represented intrinsically in the resting brain, and gender- and age-related differences might be associated with sex hormones and sensorimotor abilities, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Nine were enrolled. The safety and tolerability were assessed over a 3-h period on sqBiP.

Further studies should address effectiveness of sqBIP in select PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00364</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Language is often present when people are encoding visual memories. For bilinguals, this language context can have different forms (i.e., Language A, Language B, or both Language A and B), and can change over the course of events. The current study examined whether a change in language context during a visual event or between visual events affects a bilingual’s ability to remember visual information. English-Spanish bilinguals and control participants encoded three lists of novel shapes amid different task-irrelevant language contexts. Following each list, participants completed a free recall test in which they drew the novel shapes they remembered. Results indicated that a change in language context between events, but not during events, affected visual memory. Specifically, the switch in language context between the second and third event (such as an English context in list 2 switching to a Spanish context in list 3) produced a reliable memory advantage for the English-Spanish bilinguals (relative to the control participants). The results offer preliminary evidence that task-irrelevant language context can influence a bilingual’s ability to remember non-linguistic information, as well as further evidence for context effects and multi-sensory effects in memory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of sex × BMI interactions on gray matter volume (GMV), and to determine the implications of any structural differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: The final sample comprised 653 participants (449 women) who were assessed using voxel-based morphology analysis of T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. We used the voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to build a multiple regression model to explore the association between BMI and GMV, and used analysis of variance (ANOVA) to explore the BMI × sex interaction on GMV. A subset of 410 participants (291 women) underwent whole brain resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) analysis to investigate sex differences in the seed (interaction) region. The cluster with a significant effect in the previous ANOVA analysis was used as a seed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A significant BMI × sex interaction was observed in the left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), while GMV was negatively correlated with BMI in men but not in women. The rsFC between the left ACC and the caudate was lower in men than in women. Within the entire sample, the insula, caudate, and medial frontal cortex activities were negatively correlated with BMI while the cerebellum and postcentral gyrus activities were positively correlated with BMI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Our findings address the interaction effect of BMI and sex on GM alterations. We found that the GMV in men seemed to be more likely to change with BMI than women, and the left ACC may be the reason for the increase in BMI of men, but not women.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Head Down Tilt Bed Rest Plus Elevated CO2 as a Spaceflight Analog: Effects on Cognitive and Sensorimotor Performance</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00355</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Long duration head down tilt bed rest (HDBR) has been widely used as a spaceflight analog environment to understand the effects of microgravity on human physiology and performance. Reports have indicated that crewmembers onboard the International Space Station (ISS) experience symptoms of elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; such as headaches at lower levels of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; than levels at which symptoms begin to appear on Earth. This suggests there may be combinatorial effects of elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the other physiological effects of microgravity including headward fluid shifts and body unloading. The purpose of the current study was to investigate these effects by evaluating the impact of 30 days of 6° HDBR and 0.5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (HDBR + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) on mission relevant cognitive and sensorimotor performance. We found a facilitation of processing speed and a decrement in functional mobility for subjects undergoing HDBR + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; relative to our previous study of HDBR in ambient air. In addition, nearly half of the participants in this study developed signs of Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS), a constellation of ocular structural and functional changes seen in approximately one third of long duration astronauts. This allowed us the unique opportunity to compare the two subgroups. We found that participants who exhibited signs of SANS became more visually dependent and shifted their speed-accuracy tradeoff, such that they were slower but more accurate than those that did not incur ocular changes. These small subgroup findings suggest that SANS may have an impact on mission relevant performance inflight via sensory reweighting.&lt;/p&gt;New And Noteworthy&lt;p&gt;We examined the effects of long duration head down tilt bed rest coupled with elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a spaceflight analog environment on human cognitive and sensorimotor performance. We found enhancements in processing speed and declines in functional mobility. A subset of participants exhibited signs of Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS), which affects approximately one in three astronauts. These individuals increased their visual reliance throughout the intervention in comparison to participants who did not show signs of SANS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Methodological Issues in the Clinical Validation of Biomarkers for Alzheimer’s Disease: The Paradigmatic Example of CSF</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00282</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The use of biomarkers is profoundly transforming medical research and practice. Their adoption has triggered major advancements in the field of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) over the past years. For instance, the analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and neuroimaging changes indicative of neuronal loss and amyloid deposition has led to the understanding that AD is characterized by a long preclinical phase. It is also supporting the transition towards a biology-grounded framework and definition of the disease. Nevertheless, though sufficient evidence exists about the analytical validity (i.e., accuracy, reliability, and reproducibility) of the candidate AD biomarkers, their clinical validity (i.e., how well the test measures the clinical features, and the disease or treatment outcomes) and clinical utility (i.e., if and how the test improves the patient’s outcomes, confirms/changes the diagnosis, identifies at-risk individuals, influences therapeutic choices) have not been fully proven. In the present review, some of the methodological issues and challenges that should be addressed in order to better appreciate the potential benefits and limitations of AD biomarkers are discussed. The ultimate goal is to stimulate a constructive discussion aimed at filling the existing gaps and more precisely defining the directions of future research. Specifically, four main aspects of the clinical validation process are addressed and applied to the most relevant CSF biomarkers: (1) the definition of reference values; (2) the identification of reference standards for the disease of interest (i.e., AD); (3) the inclusion within the diagnostic process; and (4) the statistical process supporting the whole framework.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Age-Related Reductions in Cerebrovascular Reactivity Using 4D Flow MRI</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00281</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), is important for determining future risk of cerebrovascular disease. It is unclear if primary aging is associated with reductions in CVR because previous studies often include participants with vascular risk factors. Additionally, the inconsistency in the literature may be due to the inherent difficulty in quantifying intracranial cerebral blood flow and CVR. To address these limitations, we determined the effect of age on CVR in the large intracranial vessels in adults with low vascular risk using state-of-the-art MRI techniques. We also determined if the effect of age on CVR was sex-specific. Young (n = 20; 25 ± 3 years) and older (n = 19; 61 ± 5 years) healthy, physically active adults participated in the study. CVR was measured in response to hypercapnia using 4D flow MRI, which allows for simultaneous angiographic and quantitative blood flow measurements in the intracranial arteries. Older adults had lower global CVR and CVR in multiple intracranial arteries [right and left internal carotid arteries (ICA), right and left middle cerebral arteries (MCA), and basilar artery (BA)] compared with young adults (p &amp;lt; 0.05 for all). In addition, the MCA dilated significantly in response to hypercapnia in young (p &amp;lt; 0.05), but not older adults. Young men demonstrated higher global CVR and CVR in multiple intracranial arteries (ICAs, MCAs, and BA) compared with young women and older men (p &amp;lt; 0.05 for both); however, CVR did not differ between young women and older women. Our results demonstrate that, using 4D flow MRI, primary aging is associated with lower CVR in adults with low vascular risk. In addition, the effect of age on CVR may be driven by men. The 4D flow MRI technique may provide a promising new alternative to measure cerebrovascular physiology without the limitations of commonly used techniques. Future studies could utilize this MRI technique to examine interventions to maintain CVR with advancing age. This study was registered under clinicaltrials.gov # NCT02840851.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25619?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures (EIMFS) is one of the most severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathies. We delineate the genetic causes and genotype–phenotype correlations of a large EIMFS cohort.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phenotypic and molecular data were analyzed on patients recruited through an international collaborative study.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ascertained 135 patients from 128 unrelated families. Ninety‐three of 135 (69%) had causative variants (42/55 previously reported) across 23 genes, including 9 novel EIMFS genes: de novo dominant &lt;i&gt;GABRA1, GABRB1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ATP1A3&lt;/i&gt;; X‐linked &lt;i&gt;CDKL5&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PIGA&lt;/i&gt;; and recessive &lt;i&gt;ITPA&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;AIMP1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;KARS&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;WWOX&lt;/i&gt;. The most frequently implicated genes were &lt;i&gt;KCNT1&lt;/i&gt; (36/135, 27%) and &lt;i&gt;SCN2A&lt;/i&gt; (10/135, 7%). Mosaicism occurred in 2 probands (&lt;i&gt;SCN2A&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;GABRB3&lt;/i&gt;) and 3 unaffected mothers (&lt;i&gt;KCNT1&lt;/i&gt;). Median age at seizure onset was 4 weeks, with earlier onset in the &lt;i&gt;SCN2A&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;KCNQ2&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;BRAT1&lt;/i&gt; groups. Epileptic spasms occurred in 22% patients. A total of 127 patients had severe to profound developmental impairment. All but 7 patients had ongoing seizures. Additional features included microcephaly, movement disorders, spasticity, and scoliosis. Mortality occurred in 33% at median age 2 years 7 months.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified a genetic cause in 69% of patients with EIMFS. We highlight the genetic heterogeneity of EIMFS with 9 newly implicated genes, bringing the total number to 33. Mosaicism was observed in probands and parents, carrying critical implications for recurrence risk. EIMFS pathophysiology involves diverse molecular processes from gene and protein regulation to ion channel function and solute trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Auditory Cortex Contributes to Discrimination of Pure Tones</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/5/ENEURO.0340-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The auditory cortex is topographically organized for sound frequency and contains highly selective frequency-tuned neurons, yet the role of auditory cortex in the perception of sound frequency remains unclear. Lesion studies have shown that auditory cortex is not essential for frequency discrimination of pure tones. However, transient pharmacological inactivation has been reported to impair frequency discrimination. This suggests the possibility that successful tone discrimination after recovery from lesion surgery could arise from long-term reorganization or plasticity of compensatory pathways. Here, we compared the effects of lesions and optogenetic suppression of auditory cortex on frequency discrimination in mice. We found that transient bilateral optogenetic suppression partially but significantly impaired discrimination performance. In contrast, bilateral electrolytic lesions of auditory cortex had no effect on performance of the identical task, even when tested only 4 h after lesion. This suggests that when auditory cortex is destroyed, an alternative pathway is almost immediately adequate for mediating frequency discrimination. Yet this alternative pathway is insufficient for task performance when auditory cortex is intact but has its activity suppressed. These results indicate a fundamental difference between the effects of brain lesions and optogenetic suppression, and suggest the existence of a rapid compensatory process possibly induced by injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Neuroestrogen-Dependent Transcriptional Activity in the Brains of ERE-Luciferase Reporter Mice following Short- and Long-Term Ovariectomy</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/5/ENEURO.0275-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Previous work has demonstrated that estrogen receptors are transcriptionally active in the absence of ovarian estrogens. The current work aims to determine whether brain-derived estrogens influence estrogen receptor-dependent transcription after short- or long-term loss of ovarian function. Experiments were conducted using estrogen response element (ERE)-Luciferase reporter mice, which express the gene for luciferase driven by consensus ERE, allowing for the quantification of ERE-dependent transcription. Brain regions examined were hippocampus, cortex, and hypothalamus. In Experiment 1, short-term (10 d) ovariectomy had no impact on ERE-dependent transcription across brain regions compared with sham surgery. In Experiment 2, chronic intracerebroventricular administration of the aromatase inhibitor letrozole significantly decreased transcriptional activity in 10-d-old ovariectomized mice across brain regions, indicating that the sustained transcription in short-term ovariectomized mice is mediated at least in part via actions of neuroestrogens. Additionally, intracerebroventricular administration of estrogen receptor antagonist ICI-182,780 blocked transcription in 10-d-old ovariectomized mice across brain regions, providing evidence that sustained transcription in ovariectomized mice is estrogen receptor dependent. In Experiment 3, long-term (70 d) ovariectomy significantly decreased ERE-dependent transcription across brain regions, though some residual activity remained. In Experiment 4, chronic intracerebroventricular letrozole administration had no impact on transcription in 70 d ovariectomized mice across brain regions, indicating that the residual ERE-dependent transcription in long-term ovariectomized mice is not mediated by neuroestrogens. Overall, the results indicate that ERE-dependent transcription in the brain continues after ovariectomy and that the actions of neuroestrogens contribute to the maintenance of ERE-dependent transcription in the brain following short-term, but not long-term, loss of ovarian function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/5/ENEURO.0267-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Apolipoprotein E4 (&lt;i&gt;APOE4&lt;/i&gt;) is the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). &lt;i&gt;APOE4&lt;/i&gt; is also associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome. Obesity is a major environmental risk factor for AD. While &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; genotype and obesity independently affect metabolism and cognition, they may also have synergistic effects. Here, we examined the metabolic and behavioral alterations associated with a high-fat diet (HFD) in male and female &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; knock-in mice. Male and female mice were fed a 45% kcal HFD or a 10% kcal low-fat diet (LFD) for 12 weeks and adipose tissue accumulation, glucose levels, anxiety-like behavior, and spatial memory were examined. We found that with HFD, male &lt;i&gt;APOE4&lt;/i&gt; mice were more susceptible to metabolic disturbances, including visceral adipose tissue (VAT) accumulation and glucose intolerance when compared to &lt;i&gt;APOE3&lt;/i&gt; mice, while female &lt;i&gt;APOE3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;APOE4&lt;/i&gt; mice had similar metabolic responses. Behaviorally, there were no effects of HFD in mice of either genotype. Our results suggest that metabolic responses to HFD are dependent on both sex and APOE genotype.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Sequential Maturation of Olfactory Sensory Neurons in the Mature Olfactory Epithelium</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/5/ENEURO.0266-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The formation of the olfactory nerve and olfactory bulb (OB) glomeruli begins embryonically in mice. However, the development of the olfactory system continues throughout life with the addition of new olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) in the olfactory epithelium (OE). Much attention has been given to the perinatal innervation of the OB by OSN axons, but in the young adult the process of OSN maturation and axon targeting to the OB remains controversial. To address this gap in understanding, we used BrdU to label late-born OSNs in young adult mice at postnatal day 25 (P25-born OSNs) and timed their molecular maturation following basal cell division. We show that OSNs in young adults undergo a sequential molecular development with the expression of GAP 43 (growth-associated protein 43) &amp;gt; AC3 (adenylyl cyclase 3) &amp;gt; OMP (olfactory marker protein), consecutively, in a time frame of ~8 d. To assess OSN axon development, we implemented an &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; fate-mapping strategy to label P25-born OSNs with ZsGreen. Using sampling intervals of 24 h, we demonstrate the progressive extension of OSN axons in the OE, through the foramen of the cribriform plate, and onto the surface of the OB. OSN axons reached the OB and began to target and robustly innervate specific glomeruli ~10 d following basal cell division, a time point at which OMP expression becomes evident. Our data demonstrate a sequential process of correlated axon extension and molecular maturation that is similar to that seen in the neonate, but on a slightly longer timescale and with regional differences in the OE.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Removal of the Potassium Chloride Co-Transporter from the Somatodendritic Membrane of Axotomized Motoneurons Is Independent of BDNF/TrkB Signaling But Is Controlled by Neuromuscular Innervation</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/5/ENEURO.0172-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The potassium-chloride cotransporter (KCC2) maintains the low intracellular chloride found in mature central neurons and controls the strength and direction of GABA/glycine synapses. We found that following axotomy as a consequence of peripheral nerve injuries (PNIs), KCC2 protein is lost throughout the somatodendritic membrane of axotomized spinal cord motoneurons after downregulation of &lt;i&gt;kcc2&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression. This large loss likely depolarizes the reversal potential of GABA/glycine synapses, resulting in GABAergic-driven spontaneous activity in spinal motoneurons similar to previous reports in brainstem motoneurons. We hypothesized that the mechanism inducing KCC2 downregulation in spinal motoneurons following peripheral axotomy might be mediated by microglia or motoneuron release of BDNF and TrkB activation as has been reported on spinal cord dorsal horn neurons after nerve injury, motoneurons after spinal cord injury (SCI), and in many other central neurons throughout development or a variety of pathologies. To test this hypothesis, we used genetic approaches to interfere with microglia activation or delete &lt;i&gt;bdnf&lt;/i&gt; from specifically microglia or motoneurons, as well as pharmacology (ANA-12) and pharmacogenetics (F616A mice) to block TrkB activation. We show that KCC2 dysregulation in axotomized motoneurons is independent of microglia, BDNF, and TrkB. KCC2 is instead dependent on neuromuscular innervation; KCC2 levels are restored only when motoneurons reinnervate muscle. Thus, downregulation of KCC2 occurs specifically while injured motoneurons are regenerating and might be controlled by target-derived signals. GABAergic and glycinergic synapses might therefore depolarize motoneurons disconnected from their targets and contribute to augment motoneuron activity known to promote motor axon regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Resurgent and Gating Pore Currents Induced by De Novo SCN2A Epilepsy Mutations</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/5/ENEURO.0141-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Over 150 mutations in the &lt;i&gt;SCN2A&lt;/i&gt; gene, which encodes the neuronal Nav1.2 protein, have been implicated in human epilepsy cases. Of these, R1882Q and R853Q are two of the most commonly reported mutations. This study utilized voltage-clamp electrophysiology to characterize the biophysical effects of the R1882Q and R853Q mutations on the hNav1.2 channel, including their effects on resurgent current and gating pore current, which are not typically investigated in the study of Nav1.2 channel mutations. HEK cells transiently transfected with DNA encoding either wild-type (WT) or mutant hNav1.2 revealed that the R1882Q mutation induced a gain-of-function phenotype, including slowed fast inactivation, depolarization of the voltage dependence of inactivation, and increased persistent current. In this model system, the R853Q mutation primarily produced loss-of-function effects, including reduced transient current amplitude and density, hyperpolarization of the voltage dependence of inactivation, and decreased persistent current. The presence of a Navβ4 peptide (KKLITFILKKTREK-OH) in the pipette solution induced resurgent currents, which were increased by the R1882Q mutation and decreased by the R853Q mutation. Further study of the R853Q mutation in &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; oocytes indicated a reduced surface expression and revealed a robust gating pore current at negative membrane potentials, a function absent in the WT channel. This not only shows that different epileptogenic point mutations in hNav1.2 have distinct biophysical effects on the channel, but also illustrates that individual mutations can have complex consequences that are difficult to identify using conventional analyses. Distinct mutations may, therefore, require tailored pharmacotherapies in order to eliminate seizures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Persistent Enhancement of Hippocampal Network Connectivity by Parietal rTMS Is Reproducible</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/5/ENEURO.0129-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Wang et al. (2014) found that that five daily sessions of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) significantly increased functional connectivity (FC) in a network centered on the hippocampus, and caused a correlated increase in memory performance. However, this finding has not been reproduced independently and the requirement for five sessions has not been validated. We aimed to reproduce the imaging results of this experiment, focusing on hippocampal FC changes and using fewer days of rTMS. We measured resting state FC before and after three (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 9) or four (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 6) consecutive daily PPC rTMS sessions, using similar delivery parameter settings as Wang et al. (2014). Eight subjects received 3 d of rTMS delivered to the vertex as a control. We employed whole-brain and hypothesis-based statistical approaches to test for hippocampal FC changes. Additionally, we calculated FC in 17 brain networks to determine whether the topographic pattern of FC change was similar between studies. We did not include behavioral testing in this study. PPC, but not vertex, rTMS caused significant changes in hippocampal FC to the same regions as in the previous study. Brain-wide changes in hippocampal FC significantly exceeded changes in global connectedness, indicating that the effect of PPC rTMS was specific to the hippocampal network. Baseline hippocampal FC, measured before receiving stimulation, predicted the degree of rTMS-induced hippocampal FC as in the previous study. These findings reproduce the imaging findings of Wang et al. (2014) and show that FC enhancement can occur after only three to four sessions of PPC rTMS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0229-18.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Network excitability is governed by synaptic efficacy, intrinsic excitability, and the circuitry in which these factors are expressed. The complex interplay between these factors determines how circuits function and, at the extreme, their susceptibility to seizure. We have developed a sensitive, quantitative estimate of network excitability in freely behaving mice using a novel optogenetic intensity-response procedure. Synchronous activation of deep sublayer CA1 pyramidal cells produces abnormal network-wide epileptiform population discharges (PD) that are nearly indistinguishable from spontaneously-occurring interictal spikes. By systematically varying light intensity, and therefore the magnitude of the optogenetically-mediated current, we generated intensity-response curves using the probability of PD as the dependent variable. Manipulations known to increase excitability, such as sub-convulsive doses (20 mg/kg) of the chemoconvulsant pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), produced a leftward shift in the curve compared to baseline. The anti-epileptic drug levetiracetam (40 mk/kg), in combination with PTZ, produced a rightward shift. Optogenetically-induced population discharge threshold (oPDT) baselines were stable over time, suggesting the metric is appropriate for within-subject experimental designs with multiple pharmacological manipulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Abnormal excitability is associated with a number of neurological disorders, including epilepsy. Excitability can be measured in single cells &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, but it is difficult to extrapolate from these values to the functional impact on the associated network. Epileptiform population discharges are network-wide events that represent a distinct transition from normal to abnormal functional modes. We developed a new method that uses light intensity-response curves to precisely determine the threshold for this transition as a surrogate measure of network excitability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25608?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JC virus (JCV) infection is a lytic infection of oligodendrocytes in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy; less common forms of central nervous system manifestations associated with JCV infection include granule cell neuronopathy, encephalopathy, and meningitis. Presented is the first case of fatal JCV encephalopathy after immunosuppressive therapy that included ruxolitinib.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Postmortem analysis included next generation sequencing, Sanger sequencing, tissue immunohistochemistry, and formalin‐fixed hemisphere 7T magnetic resonance imaging.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JCV DNA isolated from postmortem tissue samples identified a novel 12bp insertion that altered the transcription site binding pattern in an otherwise “wild‐type virus,” which has long been thought to be the nonpathogenic form of JCV. Anti‐VP1 staining demonstrated infection in cortical neurons, hippocampal neurons, and glial and endothelial cells.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This expands the spectrum of identified JCV diseases associated with broad‐spectrum immunosuppression, including JAK‐STAT inhibitors, and sheds light on an additional neurotropic virus strain of the archetype variety. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Acupuncture Treatment Reverses Retinal Gene Expression Induced by Optic Nerve Injury via RNA Sequencing Analysis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00059</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Glaucoma and traumatic optic nerve crush (ONC) injury result in progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and defects in visual function. In clinical trials of Traditional Chinese Medicine, acupuncture has been widely used for the treatment of ocular diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms of acupuncture treatment are still unclear. In this study, we used technique of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to study the effects of acupuncture treatment on retinal transcriptome after axotomy injury. RNA-seq results revealed that 436 genes including 31 transcription factors (TFs) were changed after injury, among them were many well-known neural degeneration related TFs such as Jun, Ddit3, Atf3, and Atf4. Interestingly, acupuncture treatment at acupoint GB20 (Fengchi) significantly reversed a series of differential expressed genes (DEGs) induced by optic nerve injury. While treatments at BL1 (Jingming) or GB20 sham control acupoint-GV16 (Fengfu), led to limited DEG reversal. In contrast, treatments at these two sites further enhanced the trend of DEG expression induced by axotomy injury. At last, retina immunostaining results revealed that only GB20 acupoint treatment increased RGC survival, in consistent with RNA-seq results. Therefore, our study first reported that acupuncture treatment regulated retinal transcriptome and reversed the gene expression induced by axotomy injury, and GB20 acupoint treatment increased RGC survival, which will provide novel therapeutic targets for treatment of ocular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: A Novel Method for Assessing Cerebral Edema, Infarcted Zone and Blood-Brain Barrier Breakdown in a Single Post-stroke Rodent Brain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01105</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Stroke is a major cause of global morbidity and mortality. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) has historically been the most common animal model of simulating ischemic stroke. The extent of neurological injury after MCAO is typically measured by cerebral edema, infarct zone, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. A significant limitation of these methods is that separate sets of brains must be used for each measurement. Here we examine an alternative method of measuring cerebral edema, infarct zone and BBB permeability following MCAO in the same set of brain samples. Ninety-six rats were randomly divided into three experimental groups. Group 1 (n = 27) was used for the evaluation of infarct zone and brain edema in rats post-MCAO (n = 17) vs. sham-operated controls (n = 10). Group 2 (n = 27) was used for the evaluation of BBB breakdown in rats post-MCAO (n = 15) vs. sham-operated controls (n = 10). In Group 3 (n = 42), all three parameters were measured in the same set of brain slices in rats post-MCAO (n = 26) vs. sham-operated controls (n = 16). The effect of Evans blue on the accuracy of measuring infarct zone by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining was determined by measuring infarct zone with and without an applied blue filter. The effects of various concentrations of TTC (0, 0.05, 0.35, 0.5, 1, and 2%) on the accuracy of measuring BBB permeability was also assessed. There was an increase in infarct volume (p &amp;lt; 0.01), brain edema (p &amp;lt; 0.01) and BBB breakdown (p &amp;lt; 0.01) in rats following MCAO compared to sham-operated controls, whether measured separately or together in the same set of brain samples. Evans blue had an effect on measuring infarct volume that was minimized by the application of a blue filter on scanned brain slices. There was no difference in the Evans blue extravasation index for the brain tissue samples without TTC compared to brain tissue samples incubated in TTC. Our results demonstrate that measuring cerebral edema, infarct zone and BBB permeability following MCAO can accurately be measured in the same set of brain samples.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Prediction and Classification of Alzheimer’s Disease Based on Combined Features From Apolipoprotein-E Genotype, Cerebrospinal Fluid, MR, and FDG-PET Imaging Biomarkers</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00072</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD), including its mild cognitive impairment (MCI) phase that may or may not progress into the AD, is the most ordinary form of dementia. It is extremely important to correctly identify patients during the MCI stage because this is the phase where AD may or may not develop. Thus, it is crucial to predict outcomes during this phase. Thus far, many researchers have worked on only using a single modality of a biomarker for the diagnosis of AD or MCI. Although recent studies show that a combination of one or more different biomarkers may provide complementary information for the diagnosis, it also increases the classification accuracy distinguishing between different groups. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning-based framework to discriminate subjects with AD or MCI utilizing a combination of four different biomarkers: fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein levels, and Apolipoprotein-E (APOE) genotype. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) baseline dataset was used in this study. In total, there were 158 subjects for whom all four modalities of biomarker were available. Of the 158 subjects, 38 subjects were in the AD group, 82 subjects were in MCI groups (including 46 in MCIc [MCI converted; conversion to AD within 24 months of time period], and 36 in MCIs [MCI stable; no conversion to AD within 24 months of time period]), and the remaining 38 subjects were in the healthy control (HC) group. For each image, we extracted 246 regions of interest (as features) using the Brainnetome template image and NiftyReg toolbox, and later we combined these features with three CSF and two APOE genotype features obtained from the ADNI website for each subject using early fusion technique. Here, a different kernel-based multiclass support vector machine (SVM) classifier with a grid-search method was applied. Before passing the obtained features to the classifier, we have used truncated singular value decomposition (Truncated SVD) dimensionality reduction technique to reduce high dimensional features into a lower-dimensional feature. As a result, our combined method achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AU-ROC) curve of 98.33, 93.59, 96.83, 94.64, 96.43, and 95.24% for AD vs. HC, MCIs vs. MCIc, AD vs. MCIs, AD vs. MCIc, HC vs. MCIc, and HC vs. MCIs subjects which are high relative to single modality results and other state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, combined multimodal methods have improved the classification performance over the unimodal classification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Entorhinal Layer II Calbindin-Expressing Neurons Originate Widespread Telencephalic and Intrinsic Projections</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00054</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the present study we provide the first systematic and quantitative hodological study of the calbindin-expressing (CB+) principal neurons in layer II of the entorhinal cortex and compared the respective projections of the lateral and medial subdivisions of the entorhinal cortex. Using elaborate quantitative retrograde tracing, complemented by anterograde tracing, we report that the layer II CB+ population comprises neurons with diverse, mainly excitatory projections. At least half of them originate local intrinsic and commissural projections which distribute mainly to layer I and II. We further show that long-range CB+ projections from the two entorhinal subdivisions differ substantially in that MEC projections mainly target field CA1 of the hippocampus, whereas LEC CB+ projections distribute much more widely to a substantial number of known forebrain targets. This connectional difference between the CB+ populations in LEC and MEC is reminiscent of the overall projection pattern of the two entorhinal subdivisions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Change-Related Acceleration Effects on Auditory Steady State Response</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00053</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Rapid detection of sensory changes is important for survival. We have previously used change-related cortical responses to study the change detection system and found that the generation of a change-related response was based on sensory memory and comparison processes. However, it remains unclear whether change-related cortical responses reflect processing speed. In the present study, we simultaneously recorded the auditory steady-state response (ASSR) and change-related response using magnetoencephalography to investigate the acceleration effects of sensory change events. Overall, 13 healthy human subjects (four females and nine males) completed an oddball paradigm with a sudden change in sound pressure used as the test stimulus, i.e., the control stimulus was a train of 25-ms pure tones at 75 dB for 1,200 ms, whereas the 29th sound at 700 ms of the test stimulus was replaced with a 90-dB tone. Thereafter, we compared the latency of ASSR among four probabilities of test stimulus (0, 25, 75, and 100%). For both the control and test stimulus, stronger effects of acceleration on ASSR were observed when the stimulus was rarer. This finding indicates that ASSR and change-related cortical response depend on physical changes as well as sensory memory and comparison processes. ASSR was modulated without changes in peripheral inputs, and brain areas higher than the primary cortex could be involved in exerting acceleration effects. Furthermore, the reduced latency of ASSR clearly indicated that a new sensory event increased the speed of ongoing sensory processing. Therefore, changes in the latency of ASSR are a sensitive index of accelerated processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Estimating the Readily-Releasable Vesicle Pool Size at Synaptic Connections in the Neocortex</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2019.00029</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Previous studies based on the ‘Quantal Model’ for synaptic transmission suggest that neurotransmitter release is mediated by a single release site at individual synaptic contacts in the neocortex. However, recent studies seem to contradict this hypothesis and indicate that multi-vesicular release (MVR) could better explain the synaptic response variability observed in vitro. In this study we present a novel method to estimate the number of release sites per synapse, also known as the size of the readily releasable pool (N&lt;sub&gt;RRP&lt;/sub&gt;), from paired whole-cell recordings of connections between layer 5 thick tufted pyramidal cell (L5_TTPC) in the juvenile rat somatosensory cortex. Our approach extends the work of Loebel et al. (2009) by leveraging a recently published data-driven biophysical model of neocortical tissue. Using this approach, we estimated N&lt;sub&gt;RRP&lt;/sub&gt; to be between two to three for synaptic connections between L5_TTPCs. To constrain N&lt;sub&gt;RRP&lt;/sub&gt; values for other connections in the microcircuit, we developed and validated a generalization approach using published data on the coefficient of variation (CV) of the amplitudes of post-synaptic potentials (PSPs) from literature and comparing them against in silico experiments. Our study predicts that transmitter release at synaptic connections in the neocortex could be mediated by MVR and provides a data-driven approach to constrain the MVR model parameters in the microcircuit.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Gradient of Expression of Dopamine D2 Receptors Along the Dorso-Ventral Axis of the Hippocampus</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2019.00028</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dopamine D2-like receptors (D2R) play an important role in the regulation of hippocampal neuronal excitability and contribute to the regulation of synaptic plasticity, the encoding of hippocampus-dependent memories and the regulation of affective state. In line with this, D2R are targeted in the treatment of psychosis and affective disorders. It has been proposed that the dorso-ventral axis of the hippocampus can be functionally delineated into the dorsal pole that predominantly processes spatial information and the ventral pole that mainly addresses hippocampal processing of emotional and affective state. Although dopaminergic control of hippocampal information processing has been the focus of a multitude of studies, very little is known about the precise distribution of D2R both within anatomically defined sublayers of the hippocampus and along its dorsoventral axis, that could in turn yield insights as to the functional significance of this receptor in supporting hippocampal processing of spatial and affective information. Here, we used an immunohistochemical approach to precisely scrutinize the protein expression of D2R both within the cellular and dendritic layers of the hippocampal subfields, and along the dorso-ventral hippocampal axis. In general, we detected significantly higher levels of protein expression of D2R in the ventral, compared to the dorsal poles with regard to the CA1, CA2, CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) regions. Effects were very consistent: the molecular layer, granule cell layer and polymorphic layer of the DG exhibited higher D2R levels in the ventral compared to dorsal hippocampus. D2R levels were also significantly higher in the ventral Stratum oriens, Stratum radiatum, and Stratum lacunosum-moleculare layers of the CA1 and CA3 regions. The apical dendrites of the ventral CA2 region also exhibited higher D2R expression compared to the dorsal pole. Taken together, our study suggests that the higher D2R expression levels of the ventral hippocampus may contribute to reported gradients in the degree of expression of synaptic plasticity along the dorso-ventral hippocampal axis, and may support behavioral information processing by the ventral hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Selective Functional Interaction Between the Lateral Habenula and Hippocampus During Different Tests of Response Flexibility</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00245</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The lateral habenula (LHb) has been shown to play critical roles in a variety of appetitive tasks (e.g., spatial memory and object recognition) that require animals to flexibly respond to changing task conditions. These types of tasks are known to be dependent on hippocampus (HPC) and/or medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), suggesting that the LHb contributes to the limbic memory circuit. Here we provide new evidence that the LHb and HPC play distinct but complimentary roles in tasks that require flexible responding to changing task conditions. Experiment 1 tested whether the LHb is needed for the performance of a HPC-dependent maze-based spatial delayed alternation task. The importance of interactions between the LHb and HPC to accomplish the same spatial delayed alternation task was tested in Experiment 2 where the LHb and HPC were disconnected both ipsilaterally and contralaterally. Experiment 3 tested LHb’s involvement in a standard behavioral economic task that requires flexible responding (maze-based delayed discounting), a task previously shown to rely on HPC. Results of Experiment 1, revealed that LHb inactivation impairs spatial delayed alternation during asymptotic performance but not during initial learning. Importantly, working memory did not appear to be affected as performance remained above chance levels both during initial learning and asymptotic testing. Experiment 2 showed that ipsilateral and contralateral disconnection of the LHb and HPC led to impaired performance on the spatial delayed alternation task. Impairments were not observed after unilateral inactivation of only one structure. Results of Experiment 3 were similar to our previous report of the effects of HPC inactivation: LHb inactivation impaired delayed discounting. All effects could not be accounted for by changes in reward magnitude discrimination, reward location per se, or sex of the animal. These findings, combined with other recent publications confirms and extends our working hypothesis that the LHb enables adaptive and flexible responding, particularly when established rules must be flexibly applied on a trial by trial basis. Since there are no known direct anatomical connections between LHb and HPC, future research is needed to understand how these structures communicate to enable flexible and rapid responding.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Prenatal Ozone Exposure Induces Memory Deficiencies in Newborns Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00244</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Air pollution is fully acknowledged to represent a major public health issue. Toxic environmental substances, such as ozone, interfere with prenatal development. Animals exposed to ozone (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) in utero develop biochemical and morphological alterations. This gas has been proven to decrease cognitive capacity in different species. In the present study, we assessed the possible alterations in memory and spatial learning in the offspring of female rats who were exposed to 1.0 ppm of O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; embryonic development. Two instruments were used to evaluate possible alterations: the T-maze and a Skinner box. MAPK, ERK, p-ERK, and NR2B proteins, which are widely regarded as responsible for the learning process in the hippocampus and cortex, were also assessed by immunohistochemistry. We found that male rats exposed to O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;in utero displayed a significant delay to reach the correct response using the spatial learning test as compared to the control group. The female rats exposed to O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; showed a significant delay to reach the correct response as compared to the female control group in the Skinner box. We also found that while the male rats showed decrease in significant differences in the expression of NR2B, ERK and increase in MAPK. Females only showed increase in MAPK, p-ERK and decrease in ERK, when compared to their respective control group. It is possible that the deficits are associated to hormonal expression, inflammation and oxidative stress alterations. In summary, these results suggest that exposure to O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can interfere with prenatal development, resulting in learning and memory deficiencies in rats.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00242</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;While nuclear tau plays a role in DNA damage response (DDR) and chromosome relaxation, the mechanisms behind these functions are not fully understood. Here, we show that tau forms complex(es) with factors involved in nuclear mRNA processing such as tumor suppressor p53 and poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) deadenylase. Tau induces PARN activity in different cellular models during DDR, and this activation is further increased by p53 and inhibited by tau phosphorylation at residues implicated in neurological disorders. Tau’s binding factor Pin1, a mitotic regulator overexpressed in cancer and depleted in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), also plays a role in the activation of nuclear deadenylation. Tau, Pin1 and PARN target the expression of mRNAs deregulated in AD and/or cancer. Our findings identify novel biological roles of tau and toxic effects of hyperphosphorylated-tau. We propose a model in which factors involved in cancer and AD regulate gene expression by interactions with the mRNA processing machinery, affecting the transcriptome and suggesting insights into alternative mechanisms for the initiation and/or developments of these diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Does Electroacupuncture Have Different Effects on Peripheral and Central Sensitization in Humans: A Randomized Controlled Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00061</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Acupuncture is used to reduce chronic musculoskeletal pain. The common mechanism underlying these types of pain are peripheral and/or central sensitization. In the clinical setting, it is difficult to separate the peripheral from the central component of pain. Heat/capsaicin 45°C/0.075%-induced hyperalgesia provides a stable, human central sensitization model in which the peripheral component is also assessed.&lt;/p&gt;Aim&lt;p&gt;This randomized, sham-controlled study aimed to investigate the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on the severity of heat (peripheral sensitization) and mechanical hyperalgesia (central sensitization) in a heat/capsaicin pain model in humans.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Twenty-six healthy young participants (24 ± 3.9 years) were recruited. After baseline assessment, heat/capsaicin 45°C/0.075% was applied to the non-dominant forearm to induce hyperalgesia. The primary outcome measures were the size of the area of mechanical hyperalgesia, intensity of pain to heat stimulation and heat pain thresholds. The intensity of pain was recorded using modified 10-cm visual analogues scales (VAS). Participants were assessed at 70 min after the initial application of capsaicin then randomly allocated to receive either real electroacupuncture (REA, n = 14) or sham non-invasive EA (SEA, n = 12) for 30 min. The main outcome measures were assessed again immediately and then 90 min following EA. Credibility of blinding was assessed. Data were analyzed with t-tests or analysis of variance (ANOVA) where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;After the model was established, the area of mechanical hyperalgesia was formed (55.64 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), as was heat hyperalgesia, as the rating to heat stimulation, increased from 2/10 to 6/10. The REA and SEA groups were comparable. Immediately after the allocated acupuncture treatment, the rating to heat stimulation was statistically significantly lower in the REA group (2.94 ± 1.64) than in the SEA group (4.62 ± 2.26) (p &amp;lt; 0.05). The area of mechanical hyperalgesia reduced significantly without any group difference. No group difference was detected in heat pain threshold. Blinding of the participants was successful.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Peripheral and central sensitization in the heat/capsaicin 45°C/0.075% model responded to EA differently, suggesting that acupuncture analgesia could vary, depending on the types of pain. This observation may explain some inconsistent findings from clinical trials of acupuncture.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A possible framework to characterize nervous system dynamics and its organization in conscious and unconscious states is introduced, derived from a high level perspective on the coordinated activity of brain cell ensembles. Some questions are best addressable in a global framework and here we build on past observations about the structure of configurations of brain networks in conscious and unconscious states and about neurophysiological results. Aiming to bind some results together into some sort of coherence with a central theme, the scenario that emerges underscores the crucial importance of the creation and dissipation of energy gradients in brain cellular ensembles resulting in maximization of the configurations in the functional connectivity among those networks that favor conscious awareness and healthy conditions. These considerations are then applied to indicate approaches that can be used to improve neuropathological syndromes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01096</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Here, we have blocked the signaling pathway of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) in a mouse model of traumatic neuropathy using a small cell permeable molecule (R7050) that inhibits TNFα/TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) complex internalization. Adult pigmented mice were subjected to intraorbital optic nerve crush (ONC). Animals received daily intraperitoneal injections of R7050, and/or a single intravitreal administration the day of the surgery. Some animals received a combinatorial treatment with R7050 (systemic or local) and a single intravitreal injection of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). As controls, untreated animals were used. Retinas were analyzed for RGC survival 5 and 14 days after the lesion i.e., during the quick and slow phase of axotomy-induced RGC death. qPCR analyses were done to verify that Tnfr1 and TNFα were up-regulated after ONC. At 5 days post-lesion, R7050 intravitreal or systemic treatment neuroprotected RGCs as much as BDNF alone. At 14 days, RGC rescue by systemic or intravitreal administration of R7050 was similar. At this time point, intravitreal treatment with BDNF was significantly better than intravitreal R7050. Combinatory treatment was not better than BDNF alone, although at both time points, the mean number of surviving RGCs was higher. In conclusion, antagonism of the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis rescues axotomized RGCs as it does the activation of survival pathways by BDNF. However, manipulation of both pathways at the same time, does not improve RGC survival.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01071</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;People could behave in two different ways when engaging in interpersonal coordination activities: moving at the same frequency (isofrequency pattern, IP; the movement frequency ratio is 1:1) or at different frequencies (multifrequency pattern, MP; the movement frequency ratio is non 1:1). However, how the interpersonal coordination pattern modulates coordination outcome and the related brain-to-brain connectivity is not fully understood. Here, we adopted a continuous joint drawing task in which two participants co-drew parallelogram shapes according to two coordination patterns (i.e., IP vs. MP) while their brain activities were simultaneously recorded by the functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) based hyperscanning technique. Dyads showed better coordination performance, as well as relatively greater interpersonal brain synchronization (IBS) at the left frontopolar area, in the MP condition compared to the IP condition. Granger causality analyses further disclosed the bidirectional influences between the brains of the coordinating individuals. Such interpersonal influences were enhanced when individuals coordinated in the MP condition. Finally, the IBS during coordination was related to the dyadic self-control level. Taken together, our study revealed that interpersonal multifrequency coordination pattern facilitates the coordination efficiency, which was associated with the enhanced brain-to-brain connectivity. Our work also suggests the potentially positive role of self-control during the interpersonal coordination process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01061</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This paper exploits the unidirectional synchronization dynamics of two Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neurons under transcranial magneto-acoustical stimulation (TMAS). The major purpose is to explore a control scheme to make the spiking modes of the neural potentials stimulated by TMAS achieve synchronization states under the feedback input. For this purpose, an adaptive neural controller, which makes the neurons satisfy the prescribed master-slaver synchronization performance, is designed by introducing a tracking error into Lyapunov analysis. Under the proposed control scheme, the slaver neuron can not only overcome the model uncertainties and the difficulties brought by prescribed performance, but also track the spiking patterns of the master neuron. Finally, the simulations are implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller, that is, the TMAS induced synchronization states of the HH neuron system can achieve the prescribed performance under the proposed controller.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent findings suggest an implication of the gut microbiome in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients. PD onset and progression has also been linked with various environmental factors such as physical activity, exposure to pesticides, head injury, nicotine, and dietary factors. In this study, we used a mouse model, overexpressing the complete human SNCA gene (SNCA-TG mice) modeling familial and sporadic forms of PD to study whether environmental conditions such as standard vs. enriched environment changes the gut microbiome and influences disease progression. We performed 16S rRNA DNA sequencing on fecal samples for microbiome analysis and studied fecal inflammatory calprotectin from the colon of control and SNCA-TG mice kept under standard environment (SE) and enriched environment (EE) conditions. The overall composition of the gut microbiota was not changed in SNCA-TG mice compared with WT in EE with respect to SE. However, individual gut bacteria at genus level such as Lactobacillus sp. was a significant changed in the SNCA-TG mice. EE significantly reduced colon fecal inflammatory calprotectin protein in WT and SNCA-TG EE compared to SE. Moreover, EE reduces the pro-inflammatory cytokines in the feces and inflammation inducing genes in the colon. Our data suggest that an enriched social environment has a positive effect on the induction of SNCA mediated inflammation in the intestine and by modulating anti-inflammatory gut bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2019.00064</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Non-invasive estimation of brain microstructure features using diffusion MRI (dMRI)—known as Microstructure Imaging—has become an increasingly diverse and complicated field over the last decades. Multi-compartment (MC)-models, representing the measured diffusion signal as a linear combination of signal models of distinct tissue types, have been developed in many forms to estimate these features. However, a generalized implementation of MC-modeling as a whole, providing deeper insights in its capabilities, remains missing. To address this fact, we present Diffusion Microstructure Imaging in Python (Dmipy), an open-source toolbox implementing PGSE-based MC-modeling in its most general form. Dmipy allows on-the-fly implementation, signal modeling, and optimization of any user-defined MC-model, for any PGSE acquisition scheme. Dmipy follows a “building block”-based philosophy to Microstructure Imaging, meaning MC-models are modularly constructed to include any number and type of tissue models, allowing simultaneous representation of a tissue's diffusivity, orientation, volume fractions, axon orientation dispersion, and axon diameter distribution. In particular, Dmipy is geared toward facilitating reproducible, reliable MC-modeling pipelines, often allowing the whole process from model construction to parameter map recovery in fewer than 10 lines of code. To demonstrate Dmipy's ease of use and potential, we implement a wide range of well-known MC-models, including IVIM, AxCaliber, NODDI(x), Bingham-NODDI, the spherical mean-based SMT and MC-MDI, and spherical convolution-based single- and multi-tissue CSD. By allowing parameter cascading between MC-models, Dmipy also facilitates implementation of advanced approaches like CSD with voxel-varying kernels and single-shell 3-tissue CSD. By providing a well-tested, user-friendly toolbox that simplifies the interaction with the otherwise complicated field of dMRI-based Microstructure Imaging, Dmipy contributes to more reproducible, high-quality research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Upper-limb exercise was achieved in a sitting position by using a specially designed device (Angel’s Wings&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;). Clinical data, computerized dynamic posturography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (resting-state MRI and arterial spin labeling), and neuropsychological tests were used before and after 2 months’ exercise training. We found a significant long-lasting improvement in Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)-III and cognitive scales, along with improvement in balance and postural control (better alignment of the gravity center and improvement in weight symmetry and in anticipatory motor strategies). Computerized dynamic posturography pointed out an enhanced central ability to integrate the vestibular signals with afferents from other sensory systems. Neuroimaging analyses after 2 months’ exercise training showed, with respect to pretraining condition, many changes. An increase of the cerebral blood flow was evident in the left primary motor cortex (M1), left supplementary motor cortical area, and left cerebellar cortex. The bilateral globus pallidus showed an increased functional connectivity to the right central operculum, right posterior cingulate gyrus, and left sensorimotor cortex. Seed-to-voxel analysis demonstrated a functional connectivity between M1 and the left superior frontal gyrus. Left crus II showed strengthened connections with the left pre-rolandic area, left post-rolandic area, and left supramarginal area. These findings likely reflect compensatory mechanisms to the neuropathological hallmark of PD. Overall, our results show that this upper-limb exercise model, conceptually comparable with the FE already tested in the lower limbs, leads to a global improvement (involving non-exercised limbs) likely consistent with the functional changes observed in the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Novel Word Learning: Event-Related Brain Potentials Reflect Pure Lexical and Task-Related Effects</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00347</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Previous research has pointed out that the combination of orthographic and semantic-associative training is a more advantageous strategy for the lexicalization of novel written word-forms than their single orthographic training. However, paradigms used previously involve explicit stimuli categorization (lexical decision), which likely influence word learning. In the present study, we used a more automatic task (silent reading) to determine the advantage of the associative training, by comparing the brain electrical signals elicited in combined (orthographic and semantic) and single (only orthographic) training conditions. In addition, the learning effect (in terms of similar neurophysiological activity between novel and known words) was also tested under a categorization paradigm, enabling determination of the possible influence of the training task in the lexicalization process. Results indicated that novel words repeatedly associated with meaningful cues showed a higher attenuation of N400 responses than those trained in the single orthographic condition, confirming the higher facilitation in the lexico-semantic processing of these stimuli, as a consequence of semantic associations. Moreover, only when the combined training was carried out in the reading task did novel words show similar N400 responses to those elicited by known words, suggesting the achievement of a similar lexical processing to known words. Crucially, when the training is carried out under a demanding task context (lexical decision), known words exhibited positive enhancement within the N400 time window, contributing to maintaining N400 differences with novel trained words and confounding the outcome of the learning. Such deflection—compatible with the modulation of the categorization-related P300 component—suggests that novel word learning could be influenced by the activation of categorization-related processes. Thus, the use of low-demand tasks arises as a more appropriate approach to study novel word learning, enabling the build-up process of mental representations, which probably depends on pure lexical and semantic factors rather than being guided by categorization demands.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Neural Oscillation Profiles of a Premise Monotonicity Effect During Semantic Category-Based Induction</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00338</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A premise monotonicity effect during category-based induction is a robust effect, in which participants are more likely to generalize properties shared by many instances rather than those shared by few instances. Previous studies have shown the event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by this effect. However, the neural oscillations in the brain underlying this effect are not well known, and such oscillations can convey task-related cognitive processing information which is lost in traditional ERP analysis. In the present study, the phase-locked and non-phase-locked power of neural oscillations related to this effect were measured by manipulating the premise sample size [single (S) vs. two (T)] in a semantic category-based induction task. For phase-locked power, the results illustrated that the premise monotonicity effect was revealed by anterior delta power, suggesting differences in working memory updating. The results also illustrated that T arguments evoked larger posterior theta-alpha power than S arguments, suggesting that T arguments led to enhanced subjectively perceived inductive confidence than S arguments. For non-phase-locked power, the results illustrated that the premise monotonicity effect was indicated by anterior theta power, suggesting that the differences in sample size were related to a change in the need for cognitive control and the implementation of adaptive cognitive control. Moreover, the results illustrated that the premise monotonicity effect was revealed by alpha-beta power, which suggested the unification of sentence and inference-driven information. Therefore, the neural oscillation profiles of the premise monotonicity effect during semantic category-based induction were elucidated, and supported the connectionist models of category-based induction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Elevations in Serum Dickkopf-1 and Disease Progression in Community-Dwelling Older Adults With Mild Cognitive Impairment and Mild-to-Moderate Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00278</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Disruption of Wnt signaling has been implicated in dysfunctional synaptic plasticity, the degree of which correlates with Alzheimer’s disease severity. We sought to examine whether serum levels of Dickkopf-1 (Dkk-1), a Wnt antagonist, are associated with global disease progression in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild-to-moderate AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We prospectively followed 88 older adults with MCI and mild-to-moderate AD attending a Memory Clinic. Cognitive performance, functional performance and neuropsychological symptoms were assessed at baseline and after 1 year. We reviewed neuroimaging for white matter changes and medial temporal atrophy, and performed ApoE genotyping at baseline. Serum Dkk-1 was assayed at baseline and 1 year, along with blood biomarkers of inflammation and endocrine dysfunction. We defined global disease progression (“progressors”) as an increase in Clinical Dementia Rating Sum-of-Boxes (CDR-SB) score by &amp;gt;2 points at 1 year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Fifteen (17.0%) participants had global disease progression. At baseline, there was no difference in cognitive performance and neuropsychiatric symptoms between groups, although progressors were more impaired in instrumental activities of daily living (p = 0.008). Progressors had significantly greater deterioration in cognitive performance (p = 0.002), with significantly worse functional performance and more severe neuropsychiatric symptoms (p = 0.042) at follow-up. Serum inflammatory and endocrine biomarkers at baseline and 1 year were similar between progressors and non-progressors. Serum Dkk-1 had increased significantly from baseline amongst progressors, while non-progressors exhibited decremental Dkk-1 over time (Dkk-1&lt;sub&gt;change&lt;/sub&gt;: 354.304 ± 670.467 vs. −173.582 ± 535.676 ng/ml, p = 0.001). Adjusting for age, gender and baseline cognitive performance, incremental Dkk-1 independently predicted global cognitive decline (p = 0.012).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our results suggest progressively dysfunctional Wnt signaling through Dkk-1 antagonism contributes to disease progression amongst older adults with MCI and mild-moderate AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Alterations of Regional Homogeneity in Parkinson’s Disease Patients With Freezing of Gait: A Resting-State fMRI Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00276</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;The purposes of this study are to investigate the regional homogeneity (ReHo) of spontaneous brain activities in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients with freeze of gait (FOG) and to investigate the neural correlation of movement function through resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A total of 35 normal controls (NC), 33 PD patients with FOG (FOG+), and 35 PD patients without FOG (FOG−) were enrolled. ReHo was applied to evaluate the regional synchronization of spontaneous brain activities. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed on ReHo maps of the three groups, followed by post hoc two-sample t-tests between every two groups. Moreover, the ReHo signals of FOG+ and FOG− were extracted across the whole brain and correlated with movement scores (FOGQ, FOG questionnaire; GFQ, gait and falls questionnaire).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Significant ReHo differences were observed in the left cerebrum. Compared to NC subjects, the ReHo of PD subjects was increased in the left angular gyrus (AG) and decreased in the left rolandic operculum/postcentral gyrus (Rol/PostC), left inferior opercular-frontal cortex, left middle occipital gyrus, and supramarginal gyrus (SMG). Compared to that of FOG−, the ReHo of FOG+ was increased in the left caudate and decreased in the left Rol/PostC. Within the significant regions, the ReHo of FOG+ was negatively correlated with FOGQ in the left SMG/PostC (r = −0.39, p &amp;lt; 0.05). Negative correlations were also observed between ReHo and GFQ/FOGQ (r = −0.36/−0.38, p &amp;lt; 0.05) in the left superior temporal gyrus (STG) of the whole brain analysis based on AAL templates.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The ReHo analysis suggested that the regional signal synchronization of brain activities in FOG+ subjects was most active in the left caudate and most hypoactive in the left Rol/PostC. It also indicated that ReHo in the left caudate and left Rol/PostC was critical for discriminating the three groups. The correlation between ReHo and movement scores (GFQ/FOGQ) in the STG has the potential to differentiate FOG+ from FOG−. This study provided new insight into the understanding of PD with and without FOG.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00267</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the present study, we aimed at examining selective neural changes after task-switching training in old age by not only considering the spatial location but also the timescale of brain activation changes (i.e., sustained/block-related or transient/trial-related timescales). We assigned a sample of 50 older adults to a task-switching training or an active single-task control group. We administered two task paradigms, either sensitive to transient (i.e., a context-updating task) or sustained (i.e., a delayed-recognition working-memory task) dynamics of cognitive control. These dynamics were captured by utilizing an appropriate event-related or block-related functional magnetic resonance imaging design. We captured selective changes in task activation during the untrained tasks after task-switching training compared to an active control group. Results revealed changes at the neural level that were not evident from only behavioral data. Importantly, neural changes in the transient-sensitive context updating task were found on the same timescale but in a different region (i.e., in the left inferior parietal lobule) than in the task-switching training task (i.e., ventrolateral PFC, inferior frontal junction, superior parietal lobule), only pointing to temporal overlap, while neural changes in the sustained-sensitive delayed-recognition task overlapped in both timescale and region with the task-switching training task (i.e., in the basal ganglia), pointing to spatio-temporal overlap. These results suggest that neural changes after task-switching training seem to be critically supported by the temporal organization of neural processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01056</link>
	<content:encoded>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Recent neuroimaging studies suggest that anorexia nervosa (AN) symptoms emerge from failures in the relationships between spatially distributed networks that support different cognitive, emotional, and somatosensory functions. The 5-HTTLPR genotype has been shown to modulate all these abilities in AN, as well as the connectivity patterns between brain regions that support their functioning. This study aims at exploring the presence of any difference in functional connectome properties between AN patients and healthy controls (HC) by means of graph theory tools. The effect of 5-HTTLPR genotype on regional and global network characteristics in AN and HC was also explored.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A sample of 74 subjects (38 HC, 36 AN) underwent a resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging and was genotyped for 5-HTTLPR polymorphism. Comparisons of network properties were made between the AN and HC groups and, within each group, between 5-HTTLPR carriers of low-functioning alleles and carriers of the long–long genotype.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Patients with AN displayed lower network clustering than HC (p = 0.04 at Mann–Whitney U test). Based on both degree and betweenness, a different distribution of network hubs emerged in the two groups. In particular, the anterior part of the anterior cingulate cortex was a hub only in the patient group. A correlation emerged between differences in brain volumes between patients and HC and differences in degree values of basal ganglia, nodes in the insula, and those in the parietal cortex. Carriers of the short allele of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism were characterized by lower small-world properties (p = 0.027) and modularity (p = 0.031) in the patient group, and a trend toward higher modularity (p = 0.033) and small-world values (p = 0.123) in the HC group.&lt;/p&gt;Discussion&lt;p&gt;Patients with AN showed differences in hubs distribution, providing evidence of the presence of a different functional architectural backbone in this group. Since some correlation emerged between different degree values of nodes and differences in volumes, further longitudinal studies are warranted to better understand the role of malnutrition on brain network architecture. The opposite effects of 5-HTTLPR polymorphism on global network characteristics in the two groups suggest an interaction of the short allele and malnutrition in modulating brain network properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01054</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded (GAA) trinucleotide repeat in the FXN gene. The extended repeats expansion results in reduced transcription and, thereby, decreased expression of the mitochondrial protein, frataxin. Given the ongoing drug trials, identification of reliable and easily accessible biomarkers for monitoring disease progression and therapeutic intervention is a foremost requirement. In this study, comparative proteomic profiling of PBMC proteins from FRDA patients and age- and gender-matched healthy controls was done using 2D-Differential in-Gel Electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). Protein–protein interaction (PPI) was analyzed using BioGRID and STRING pathway analysis tools. Using biological variance analysis (BVA) and LC/MS, we found eight differentially expressed proteins with fold change ≥1.5; p ≤ 0.05. Based on their cellular function, the identified proteins showed a strong pathological role in neuroinflammation, cardiomyopathy, compromised glucose metabolism, and iron transport, which are the major clinical manifestations of FRDA. Protein–protein network analysis of differentially expressed proteins with frataxin further supports their involvement in the pathophysiology of FRDA. Considering their crucial role in the cardiac and neurological complications, respectively, the two down-regulated proteins, actin α cardiac muscle 1 (ACTC1) and pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit β (PDHE1), are suggested as potential prognostic markers for FRDA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Anatomy and Physiology of Neurons in Layer 9 of the Chicken Optic Tectum</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00063</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Visual information in birds is to great extent processed in the optic tectum (TeO), a prominent laminated midbrain structure. Retinal input enters the TeO in its superficial layers, while output is limited to intermediate and deeper layers. In addition to visual information, the TeO receives multimodal input from the auditory and somatosensory pathway. The TeO gives rise to a major ascending tectofugal projection where neurons of tectal layer 13 project to the thalamic nucleus rotundus, which then projects to the entopallium. A second tectofugal projection system, called the accessory pathway, has however not been studied as thoroughly. Again, cells of tectal layer 13 form an ascending projection that targets a nucleus known as either the caudal part of the nucleus dorsolateralis posterior of the thalamus (DLPc) or nucleus uveaformis (Uva). This nucleus is known for multimodal integration and receives additional input from the lateral pontine nucleus (PL), which in turn receives projections from layer 8–15 of the TeO. Here, we studied a particular cell type afferent to the PL that consists of radially oriented neurons in layer 9. We characterized these neurons with respect to their anatomy, their retinal input, and the modulation of retinal input by local circuits. We found that comparable to other radial neurons in the tectum, cells of layer 9 have columnar dendritic fields and reach up to layer 2. Sholl analysis demonstrated that dendritic arborization concentrates on retinorecipient layers 2 and 4, with additional arborization in layers 9 and 10. All neurons recorded in layer 9 received retinal input via glutamatergic synapses. We analyzed the influence of modulatory circuits of the TeO by application of antagonists to γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and acetylcholine (ACh). Our data show that the neurons of layer 9 are integrated in a network under strong GABAergic inhibition, which is controlled by local cholinergic activation. Output to the PL and to the accessory tectofugal pathway thus appears to be under strict control of local tectal networks, the relevance of which for multimodal integration is discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00253</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) refers to a heterogeneous group of complex neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by social skill and communication deficits, along with stereotyped repetitive behavior. miRNAs, small non-coding RNAs that have been recognized as critical regulators of gene expression, play a key role in the neurodevelopmental transcriptional networks of the human brain. Previous investigations have proven that circulating miRNAs open up new possibilities for the emerging roles of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in human disorders and diseases. Biomarker development has been progressively becoming more recognized as a cornerstone in medical diagnosis, paving the way to drug discoveries and limiting the progression of various diseases. Due to the complexity of ASD, considerable endeavors have either unsuccessfully identified biomarkers for the disorder or have not yet been established. Cell-free circulating miRNAs in biofluids are extraordinarily stable and considered to represent the next-generation of clinical, non-invasive, biomarkers for many pathologies including neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, we conducted a review of all peer-reviewed articles addressing the circulating profiles of miRNAs, mostly performed in serum and saliva samples in individuals with ASD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Orphan Cytokine Receptor CRLF3 Emerged With the Origin of the Nervous System and Is a Neuroprotective Erythropoietin Receptor in Locusts</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00251</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The orphan cytokine receptor-like factor 3 (CRLF3) was identified as a neuroprotective erythropoietin receptor in locust neurons and emerged with the evolution of the eumetazoan nervous system. Human CRLF3 belongs to class I helical cytokine receptors that mediate pleiotropic cellular reactions to injury and diverse physiological challenges. It is expressed in various tissues including the central nervous system but its ligand remains unidentified. A CRLF3 ortholog in the holometabolous beetle Tribolium castaneum was recently shown to induce anti-apoptotic mechanisms upon stimulation with human recombinant erythropoietin. To test the hypothesis that CRLF3 represents an ancient cell-protective receptor for erythropoietin-like cytokines, we investigated its presence across metazoan species. Furthermore, we examined CRLF3 expression and function in the hemimetabolous insect Locusta migratoria. Phylogenetic analysis of CRLF3 sequences indicated that CRLF3 is absent in Porifera, Placozoa and Ctenophora, all lacking the traditional nervous system. However, it is present in all major eumetazoan groups ranging from cnidarians over protostomians to mammals. The CRLF3 sequence is highly conserved and abundant amongst vertebrates. In contrast, relatively few invertebrates express CRLF3 and these sequences show greater variability, suggesting frequent loss due to low functional importance. In L. migratoria, we identified the transcript Lm-crlf3 by RACE-PCR and detected its expression in locust brain, skeletal muscle and hemocytes. These findings correspond to the ubiquitous expression of crlf3 in mammalian tissues. We demonstrate that the sole addition of double-stranded RNA to the culture medium (called soaking RNA interference) specifically interferes with protein expression in locust primary brain cell cultures. This technique was used to knock down Lm-crlf3 expression and to abolish its physiological function. We confirmed that recombinant human erythropoietin rescues locust brain neurons from hypoxia-induced apoptosis and showed that this neuroprotective effect is absent after knocking down Lm-crlf3. Our results affirm the erythropoietin-induced neuroprotective function of CRLF3 in a second insect species from a different taxonomic group. They suggest that the phylogenetically conserved CRLF3 receptor may function as a cell protective receptor for erythropoietin or a structurally related cytokine also in other animals including vertebrate and mammalian species.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00250</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Netrin-G ligand-1 (NGL-1), encoded by Lrrc4c, is a post-synaptic adhesion molecule implicated in various brain disorders, including bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and developmental delay. Although previous studies have explored the roles of NGL-1 in the regulation of synapse development and function, the importance of NGL-1 for specific behaviors and the nature of related neural circuits in mice remain unclear. Here, we report that mice lacking NGL-1 (Lrrc4c&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;) show strong hyperactivity and anxiolytic-like behavior. They also display impaired spatial and working memory, but normal object-recognition memory and social interaction. c-Fos staining under baseline and anxiety-inducing conditions revealed suppressed baseline neuronal activity as well as limited neuronal activation in widespread brain regions, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), motor cortex, endopiriform nucleus, bed nuclei of the stria terminalis, and dentate gyrus. Neurons in the ACC, motor cortex, and dentate gyrus exhibit distinct alterations in excitatory synaptic transmission and intrinsic neuronal excitability. These results suggest that NGL-1 is important for normal locomotor activity, anxiety-like behavior, and learning and memory, as well as synapse properties and excitability of neurons in widespread brain regions under baseline and anxiety-inducing conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00239</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive disease with early degeneration of the central cholinergic neurons. Currently, three of four AD drugs act by inhibiting the acetylcholine (ACh) degrading enzyme, acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Efficacy of these drugs depends on available amount of ACh, which is biosynthesized by choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). We investigated whether treatment with a cholinesterase-inhibitor, galantamine, alters the relative levels of AChE to ChAT in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and whether levels of these CSF biomarkers correlate with in vivo AChE activity and nicotinic binding sites in the brain assessed by positron emission tomography (PET). Protein concentrations and activities of ChAT and AChE were measured in CSF of 18 patients with mild AD prior to and after 3 months of treatment with galantamine (n = 12) or placebo (n = 6), followed by nine additional months of galantamine treatment in all patients. A Cholinergic index was defined as the ratio of ChAT to AChE in CSF and was evaluated in relation to the in vivo AChE activity, the nicotinic binding sites and different measures of cognition. Besides an expected inhibition of AChE activity, galantamine treatment was accompanied by a mild increase in CSF ChAT activity. Thereby, the Cholinergic index was significantly increased in the Galantamine group (60% ± 14) after 3 months compared to baseline (p &amp;lt; 0.0023) or (p &amp;lt; 0.0004). This index remained high in the Galantamine group compared to baseline (54% ± 11) at 12 months follow-up, while it showed an increase in the Placebo group when they switched to active galantamine treatment (44% ± 14 vs. baseline, 61% ± 14 vs. 3 months, all p-values &amp;lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the in vivo brain AChE activity (assessed by PET) correlated with the CSF Cholinergic index at 12 months (r = 0.98, p &amp;lt; 0.001). The CSF Cholinergic index also correlated with ADAS-Cog and some other neuropsychological tests at 12 months. This is the first study assessing a CSF Cholinergic index in relation to treatment with a cholinesterase inhibitor. The treatment-specific increase in CSF ChAT activity suggests that cholinesterase-inhibitors may also increase the ACh-biosynthesis capacity in the patients. Additional studies are warranted to evaluate the utility of the CSF Cholinergic index as a biomeasure of therapeutic effect in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: A Safe and Effective Magnetic Labeling Protocol for MRI-Based Tracking of Human Adult Neural Stem Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01092</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a unique tool for in vivo visualization and tracking of stem cells in the brain. This is of particular importance when assessing safety of experimental cell treatments in the preclinical or clinical setup. Yet, specific imaging requires an efficient and non-perturbing cellular magnetic labeling which precludes adverse effects of the tag, e.g., the impact of iron-oxide-nanoparticles on the critical differentiation and integration processes of the respective stem cell population investigated. In this study we investigated the effects of very small superparamagnetic iron oxide particle (VSOP) labeling on viability, stemness, and neuronal differentiation potential of primary human adult neural stem cells (haNSCs). Cytoplasmic VSOP incorporation massively reduced the transverse relaxation time T2, an important parameter determining MR contrast. Cells retained cytoplasmic label for at least a month, indicating stable incorporation, a necessity for long-term imaging. Using a clinical 3T MRI, 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; haNSCs were visualized upon injection in a gel phantom, but detection limit was much lower (5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; cells) in layer phantoms and using an imaging protocol feasible in a clinical scenario. Transcriptional analysis and fluorescence immunocytochemistry did not reveal a detrimental impact of VSOP labeling on important parameters of cellular physiology with cellular viability, stemness and neuronal differentiation potential remaining unaffected. This represents a pivotal prerequisite with respect to clinical application of this method.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01087</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sleep is a complex and dynamic process for maintaining homeostasis, and a lack of sleep can disrupt whole-body functioning. No organ is as vulnerable to the loss of sleep as the brain. Accordingly, we examined a set of task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data by using graph theory to assess brain topological changes in subjects in a state of chronic sleep restriction, and then identified diurnal variability in the graph-theoretic measures. Task-based fMRI data were collected in a 1.5T MR scanner from the same participants on two days: after a week of fully restorative sleep and after a week with 35% sleep curtailment. Each day included four scanning sessions throughout the day (at approximately 10:00 AM, 2:00 PM, 6:00 PM, and 10:00 PM). A modified spatial cueing task was applied to evaluate sustained attention. After sleep restriction, the characteristic path length significantly increased at all measurement times, and small-worldness significantly decreased. Assortativity, a measure of network fault tolerance, diminished over the course of the day in both conditions. Local graph measures were altered primarily across the limbic system (particularly in the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and amygdala), default mode network, and visual network.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: A Comparative Study of Different EEG Reference Choices for Event-Related Potentials Extracted by Independent Component Analysis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01068</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the event-related potential (ERP) of scalp electroencephalography (EEG) studies, the vertex reference (Cz), linked mastoids or ears (LM), and average reference (AVG) are popular reference methods, and the reference electrode standardization technique (REST) is increasingly applied. Because scalp EEG recordings are considered as spatially degraded signals, independent component analysis (ICA) is a widely used data-driven method for obtaining ERPs by decomposing EEG data. However, the accurate estimation of the differences in ERP components extracted by ICA with different references remains unclear. In this study, we first provided formal descriptions of the above reference methods (Cz, LM, AVG, and REST) and ICA decomposition in ERP and then investigated the influences of different reference techniques on simulation and real EEG datasets. The results revealed that (1) the reference method did not change the peak amplitudes and latencies of relative ERPs corresponding to some IC time courses; (2) there were non-negligible effects of different reference methods on both temporal ERPs and spatial topographies of some ICs; and (3) compared to Cz, LM, and AR, considering both the performances of temporal ERPs and spatial topographies, the REST reference had overall superiority. These findings provide a recommended choice of REST for ICA analysis at the trial level and contribute to empirical investigations regarding the use of reference methods in ERP domains with ICA analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: NeurodegenERation: The Central Role for ER Contacts in Neuronal Function and Axonopathy, Lessons From Hereditary Spastic Paraplegias and Related Diseases</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01051</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are a group of inherited neurodegenerative conditions whose characteristic feature is degeneration of the longest axons within the corticospinal tract which leads to progressive spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs. Though highly genetically heterogeneous, the majority of HSP cases are caused by mutations in genes encoding proteins that are responsible for generating and organizing the tubular endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Despite this, the role of the ER within neurons, particularly the long axons affected in HSP, is not well understood. Throughout axons, ER tubules make extensive contacts with other organelles, the cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane. At these ER contacts, protein complexes work in concert to perform specialized functions including organelle shaping, calcium homeostasis and lipid biogenesis, all of which are vital for neuronal survival and may be disrupted by HSP-causing mutations. In this article we summarize the proteins which mediate ER contacts, review the functions these contacts are known to carry out within neurons, and discuss the potential contribution of disruption of ER contacts to axonopathy in HSP.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00972</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are analyzed on the group level. Standard group-level analyses, however, come with severe drawbacks: First, they assume functional homogeneity within the group, building on the idea that we use our brains in similar ways. Second, group-level analyses require spatial warping and substantial smoothing to accommodate for anatomical variability across subjects. Such procedures massively distort the underlying fMRI data, which hampers the spatial specificity. Taken together, group statistics capture the effective overlap, rendering the modeling of individual deviations impossible – a major source of false positivity and negativity. The alternative analysis approach is to leave the data in the native subject space, but this makes comparison across individuals difficult. Here, we propose a new framework for visualizing group-level information, better preserving the information of individual subjects. Our proposal is to limit the use of invasive data procedures such as spatial smoothing and warping and rather extract regional information from the individuals. This information is then visualized for all subjects and brain areas at one glance – hence we term the method brainglance. Additionally, our method incorporates a means for clustering individuals to further identify common traits. We showcase our method on two publicly available data sets and discuss our findings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: The Organization of the Second Optic Chiasm of the Drosophila Optic Lobe</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00065</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Visual pathways from the compound eye of an insect relay to four neuropils, successively the lamina, medulla, lobula, and lobula plate in the underlying optic lobe. Among these neuropils, the medulla, lobula, and lobula plate are interconnected by the complex second optic chiasm, through which the anteroposterior axis undergoes an inversion between the medulla and lobula. Given their complex structure, the projection patterns through the second optic chiasm have so far lacked critical analysis. By densely reconstructing axon trajectories using a volumetric scanning electron microscopy (SEM) technique, we reveal the three-dimensional structure of the second optic chiasm of Drosophila melanogaster, which comprises interleaving bundles and sheets of axons insulated from each other by glial sheaths. These axon bundles invert their horizontal sequence in passing between the medulla and lobula. Axons connecting the medulla and lobula plate are also bundled together with them but do not decussate the sequence of their horizontal positions. They interleave with sheets of projection neuron axons between the lobula and lobula plate, which also lack decussations. We estimate that approximately 19,500 cells per hemisphere, about two thirds of the optic lobe neurons, contribute to the second chiasm, most being Tm cells, with an estimated additional 2,780 T4 and T5 cells each. The chiasm mostly comprises axons and cell body fibers, but also a few synaptic elements. Based on our anatomical findings, we propose that a chiasmal structure between the neuropils is potentially advantageous for processing complex visual information in parallel. The EM reconstruction shows not only the structure of the chiasm in the adult brain, the previously unreported main topic of our study, but also suggest that the projection patterns of the neurons comprising the chiasm may be determined by the proliferation centers from which the neurons develop. Such a complex wiring pattern could, we suggest, only have arisen in several evolutionary steps.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Aging Reduces the Functional Brain Networks Strength—a Resting State fMRI Study of Healthy Mouse Brain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00277</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) is increasingly used to unravel the functional neuronal networks in health and disease. In particular, this technique of simultaneously probing the whole brain has found high interest in monitoring brain wide effects of cerebral disease and in evaluating therapeutic strategies. Such studies, applied in preclinical experimental mouse models, often require long-term observations. In particular during regeneration studies, easily several months of continuous monitoring are required to detect functional improvements. These long periods of following the functional deficits during disease evolution as well as the functional recoveries during therapeutic interventions represent a substantial fraction of the life span of the experimental animals. We have therefore aimed to decipher the role of healthy aging alone for changes in functional neuronal networks in mice, from developmental adolescence via adulthood to progressing aging. For this purpose, four different groups of C57Bl6 mice of varying age between 2 and 13 months were studied twice with 4 weeks separation using resting state fMRI at 9.4T. Dedicated data analysis including both Independent Component Analysis (ICA) followed by seed-based connectivity matrix compilation resulted in an inverse U-shape curve of functional connectivity (FC) strength in both the sensorimotor and default mode network (DMN). This inverse U-shape pattern presented a distinct maximum of FC strength at 8–9 months of age, followed by a continuous decrease during later aging phases. At progressed aging at 12–13 months, the reduction of connectivity strength varied between 25% and 70% with most connectivities showing a reduction in strength by approximately 50%. We recommend that these substantial age-dependent changes in FC strength must be considered in future longitudinal studies to discriminate focused disease-based functional deficits and therapy-related functional improvements from underlying independent age effects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Stress has pronounced effects on the brain, and thus behavioral outputs. This is particularly true when the stress occurs during vulnerable points in development. A review of the clinical literature regarding the moderating effects of sex on psychopathology in individuals exposed to childhood maltreatment (CM) is complicated by a host of variables that are difficult to quantify and control in clinical settings. As a result, the precise role of sex in moderating the consequences of CM remains elusive. In this review, we explore the rationale for studying this important question and their implications for treatment. We examine this issue using the threat/deprivation conceptual framework and highlight a growing body of work demonstrating important sex differences in human studies and in animal models of early life stress (ELS). The challenges and obstacles for effectively studying this question are reviewed and are followed by recommendations on how to move forward at the clinical and preclinical settings. We hope that this review will help inspire additional studies on this important topic.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01081</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Down Syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic disorder associated with intellectual disability (ID). Excitatory neurons of DS patients and mouse models show decreased size of dendritic field and reduction of spine density. Whether these defects are caused by cell autonomous alterations or by abnormal multicellular circuitry is still unknown. In this work, we explored this issue by culturing cortical neurons obtained from two mouse models of DS: the widely used Ts65Dn and the less characterized Ts2Cje. We observed that, in the in vitro conditions, axon specification and elongation, as well as dendritogenesis, take place without evident abnormalities, indicating that the initial phases of neuronal differentiation do not suffer from the presence of an imbalanced genetic dosage. Conversely, our analysis highlighted differences between trisomic and euploid neurons in terms of reduction of spine density, in accordance with in vivo data obtained by other groups, proposing the presence of a cell-intrinsic malfunction. This work suggests that the characteristic morphological defects of DS neurons are likely to be caused by the possible combination of cell-intrinsic defects together with cell-extrinsic cues. Additionally, our data support the possibility of using the more sustainable line Ts2Cje as a standard model for the study of DS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Auranofin Mediates Mitochondrial Dysregulation and Inflammatory Cell Death in Human Retinal Pigment Epithelial Cells: Implications of Retinal Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01065</link>
	<content:encoded>Purpose&lt;p&gt;Photoreceptor degeneration occurs in various retinal diseases including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), and diabetic retinopathy (DR). However, molecular mechanisms are not fully understood yet. The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) forms the outer blood retinal barrier (oBRB) and supplies glucose, oxygen and nutrients from the fenestrated choriocapillaris to photoreceptors for visual function. Therefore, RPE dysfunction leads to photoreceptor injury/death and progression of blinding eye diseases. This study aims to understand the role of the thioredoxin (Trx) and its reductase (TrxR) redox signaling in human RPE dysfunction and cell death mechanism(s) in an in vitro system.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A human RPE cell line (APRE-19) was cultured in DMEM/F12 medium and treated with auranofin (AF – 4 μM, an inhibitor of TrxR) for 4 and 24 h. Mitochondrial and lysosomal function, cellular oxidative stress and NLRP3 inflammasome activity were measured using cell assays, Western blotting, and confocal microscopy. Antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds were tested for blocking AF effects on RPE damage. Cell death mechanisms (LDH release to culture media) were determined using necroptosis, ferroptosis and pyroptosis inhibitors. P &amp;lt; 0.05 was considered significant in statistical analysis.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Auranofin causes mitochondrial dysfunction (Δψm↓ and ATP↓), oxidative stress (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;↑) and mitophagic flux to lysosomes. Furthermore, the lysosomal enzyme (cathepsin L) activity is reduced while that of pro-inflammatory caspase-1 (NLRP3 inflammasome) is enhanced in ARPE-19. These effects of AF on ARPE-19 are inhibited by antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (5 mM, NAC) and significantly by a combination of SS31 (mitochondrial antioxidant) and anti-inflammatory drugs (amlexanox and tranilast). AF also causes cell death as measured by cytosolic LDH release/leakage, which is not inhibited by either ferrostatin-1 or necrostatin-1 (ferroptosis and necroptosis inhibitors, respectively). Conversely, AF-induced LDH release is significantly reduced by MCC950 and Ac-YVAD-cmk (NLRP3 and Caspase-1 inhibitors, respectively), suggesting a pro-inflammatory cell death by pyroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The Trx/TrxR redox system is critical for RPE function and viability. We previously showed that thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) is strongly induced in DR inhibiting the Trx/TrxR system and RPE dysfunction. Therefore, our results suggest that the TXNIP-Trx-TrxR redox pathway may participate in RPE dysfunction in DR and other retinal neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Non-motor symptoms are common in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and can even be used as part of the supportive criteria for diagnosis. Chronic inflammation is involved in every stage of PD. Disorders of the immune system affect the peripheral blood. Whether the humoral immune response is associated with the non-motor symptoms of PD remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Mann–Whitney tests and Bonferroni correction were used to compare the serum levels of IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, and C4 between 180 sporadic PD patients and 187 healthy controls. Multiple regression models were conducted to assess the associations among these indicators of humoral immunity and the clinical features of PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Male PD patients had lower levels of C3 and C4 than healthy controls [0.87 (0.22) vs. 0.96 (0.19); 0.19 (0.06) vs. 0.22 (0.07), respectively, Pc &amp;lt; 0.01] and lower levels of C3 than female PD patients [0.87 (0.22) vs. 1.02 (0.23), Pc &amp;lt; 0.01]. Patients suffering from attention/memory problems had significantly lower levels of IgA and C3 than those without these problems [1.92 (1.21) vs. 2.57 (0.76); 0.89 (0.24) vs. 0.97 (0.24), respectively, Pc &amp;lt; 0.04]. In addition, serum IgG levels were negatively associated with mood/cognition problem scores and were positively associated with gastrointestinal tract problem scores (adjusted R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.063, F = 1.805, p = 0.038).

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00050</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent studies demonstrate that after classical conditioning the conditioned stimulus (CS) triggers a delayed complex spike. This new finding revolutionizes our view on the role of complex spike activity. The classical view of the complex spike as an error signal has been replaced by a signal that encodes for expectation, prediction and reward. In this brief perspective, we review some of these works, focusing on the characteristic delay of the response (~80 ms), its independence on the time interval between CS and the unconditioned stimulus (US) and its relationship to movement onset. In view of these points, we suggest that the generation of complex spike activity following learning, encodes for timing of movements onset. We then provide original data recorded from Purkinje and cerebellar nuclei neurons, demonstrating that delayed complex spike activity is an intrinsic property of the cerebellar circuit. We, therefore, suggest that learning of classical conditioning involves modulation of cerebellar circuitry where timing is provided by the inferior olive and the movement kinematic is delivered by the cerebellar nuclei projection neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Alpha1-Adrenergic Receptor Mediated Long-Term Depression at CA3-CA1 Synapses Can Be Induced via Accumulation of Endogenous Norepinephrine and Is Preserved Following Noradrenergic Denervation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2019.00027</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Locus coeruleus (LC) provides the sole source of noradrenergic (NA) innervation to hippocampus, and it undergoes significant degeneration early in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Norepinephrine (NE) modulates synaptic transmission and plasticity at hippocampal synapses which likely contributes to hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. We previously reported that pharmacological activation of α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; adrenergic receptors (α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;ARs) induces long-term depression (LTD) at CA3-CA1 synapses. Here, we investigated whether accumulation of endogenous NE via pharmacological blockade of norepinephrine transporters (NETs) and the NE degradative enzyme, monoamine oxidase (MAO), can induce α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;AR LTD, as these inhibitors are used clinically. Further, we sought to determine how degeneration of hippocampal NA innervation, as occurs in AD, impacts α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;AR function and α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;AR LTD. Bath application of NET and MAO inhibitors in slices from control rats reliably induced α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;AR LTD when β adrenergic receptors were inhibited. To induce degeneration of LC-NA innervation, rats were treated with the specific NA neurotoxin DSP-4 and recordings performed 1–3 weeks later when NA axon degeneration had stabilized. Even with 85% loss of hippocampal NA innervation, α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;AR LTD was successfully induced using either the α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;AR agonist phenylephrine or the combined NET and MAO inhibitors, and importantly, the LTD magnitude was not different from saline-treated control. These data suggest that despite significant decreases in NA input to hippocampus, the mechanisms necessary for the induction of α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;AR LTD remain functional. Furthermore, we posit that α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;AR activation could be a viable therapeutic target for pharmacological intervention in AD and other diseases involving malfunctions of NA neurotransmission.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels and α-Synuclein: Implications in Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00237</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alpha-synuclein (α-syn) is biochemically and genetically linked to Parkinson’s disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies. It is now widely accepted that α-syn can be released in the extracellular space, even though the mechanism of its release is still unclear. In addition, pathology-related aggregated species of α-syn have been shown to propagate between neurons in synaptically connected areas of the brain thereby assisting the spreading of pathology in healthy neighboring neuronal cells. In neurons, calcium channels are key signaling elements that modulate the release of bioactive molecules (hormones, proteins, and neurotransmitters) through calcium sensing. Such calcium sensing activity is determined by the distinct biophysical and pharmacological properties and the ability of calcium channels to interact with other modulatory proteins. Although the function of extracellular α-syn is currently unknown, previous work suggested the presence of a calcium-dependent mechanism for α-syn secretion both in vitro, in neuronal cells in culture, and also in vivo, in the context of a trans-neuronal network in brain. Mechanisms regulating extracellular α-syn levels may be of particular importance as they could represent novel therapeutic targets. We discuss here how calcium channel activity may contribute to α-syn aggregation and secretion as a pathway to disease progression in synucleinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;EF-hand Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-binding protein family members, α- and β-parvalbumins have been studied for decades. Yet, considerable information is lacking distinguishing functional differences between mammalian α-parvalbumin (PVALB) and oncomodulin (OCM), a branded β-parvalbumin. Herein, we provide an overview detailing the current body of work centered around OCM as an EF-Hand Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-binding protein and describe potential mechanisms of OCM function within the inner ear and immune cells. Additionally, we posit that OCM is evolutionarily distinct from PVALB and most other β-parvalbumins. This review summarizes recent studies pertaining to the function of OCM and emphasizes OCM as a parvalbumin possessing a unique cell and tissue distribution, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; buffering capacity and phylogenetic origin.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Auditory EEG Biomarkers in Fragile X Syndrome: Clinical Relevance</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00060</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sensory hypersensitivities are common and distressing features of Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). While there are many drug interventions that reduce behavioral deficits in Fmr1 mice and efforts to translate these preclinical breakthroughs into clinical trials for FXS, evidence-based clinical interventions are almost non-existent potentially due to lack of valid neural biomarkers. Local circuit function in sensory networks is dependent on the dynamic balance of activity in inhibitory/excitatory synapses. Studies are needed to examine the association of electrophysiological alterations in neural systems with sensory and other clinical features of FXS to establish their clinical relevance. Adolescents and adults with FXS (n = 38, Mean age = 25.5, std = 10.1; 13 females) and age matched typically developing controls (n = 40, Mean age = 27.7, std = 12.1; 17 females) completed auditory chirp and auditory habituation tasks while undergoing dense array electroencephalography (EEG). Amplitude, latency, and percent change (habituation) in N1 and P2 event-related potential (ERP) components were characterized for the habituation task; time-frequency calculations using Morlet wavelets characterized phase-locking and single trial power for the habituation and chirp tasks. FXS patients showed increased amplitude but some evidence for reduced habituation of the N1 ERP, and reduced phase-locking in the low and high gamma frequency range and increased low gamma power to the chirp stimulus. FXS showed increased theta power in both tasks. While the habituation finding was weaker than previously found, the remaining findings replicate our previous work in a new sample of patients with FXS. Females showed less deficit in the chirp task but not the habituation task. Abnormal increases in gamma power were related to more severe behavioral and psychiatric features as well as reductions in neurocognitive abilities. Replicating electrophysiological deficits in a new group of patients using different EEG equipment at a new data collection site with differing levels of environmental noise that were robust to data processing techniques utilizing multiple researchers, indicates a potential for scalability to multi-site clinical trials. Given the robust replicability, relevance to clinical measures, and preclinical evidence for sensitivity of these EEG measures to pharmacological intervention, the observed abnormalities may provide novel translational markers of target engagement and potentially outcome measures in large-scale studies evaluating new treatments targeting neural hyperexcitability in FXS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01066</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Modern high field and ultra high field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) experiments routinely collect multi-dimensional data with high spatial resolution, whether multi-parametric structural, diffusion or functional MRI. While diffusion and functional imaging have benefited from recent advances in multi-dimensional signal analysis and denoising, structural MRI has remained untouched. In this work, we propose a denoising technique for multi-parametric quantitative MRI, combining a highly popular denoising method from diffusion imaging, over-complete local PCA, with a reconstruction of the complex-valued MR signal in order to define stable estimates of the noise in the decomposition. With this approach, we show signal to noise ratio (SNR) improvements in high resolution MRI without compromising the spatial accuracy or generating spurious perceptual boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Proteomic Profiling of Extracellular Vesicles Isolated From Cerebrospinal Fluid of Former National Football League Players at Risk for Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01059</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) is a tauopathy that affects individuals with a history of repetitive mild traumatic brain injury, such as American football players. Initial neuropathologic changes in CTE include perivascular deposition of phosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau (p-tau) neurofibrillary tangles and other aggregates in neurons, astrocytes and cell processes in an irregular pattern often at the depths of the cortical sulci. In later stages, the p-tau depositions become widespread and is associated with neurodegeneration. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are known to carry neuropathogenic molecules, most notably p-tau. We therefore examined the protein composition of EVs isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of former National Football League (NFL) players with cognitive and neuropsychiatric dysfunction, and an age-matched control group (CTRL) with no history of contact sports or traumatic brain injury. EVs were isolated from the CSF samples using an affinity purification kit. Total tau (t-tau) and tau phosphorylated on threonine181 (p-tau&lt;sub&gt;181&lt;/sub&gt;) in CSF-derived EVs from former NFL players and CTRL participants were measured by ultrasensitive immunoassay. The t-tau and p-tau&lt;sub&gt;181&lt;/sub&gt; levels of CSF-derived EV were positively correlated with the t-tau and p-tau&lt;sub&gt;181&lt;/sub&gt; levels of total CSF in former NFL players, respectively, but not in the CTRL group. 429 unique proteins were identified from CSF-derived EVs and quantified by TMT-10 plex method. The identified protein molecules were significantly enriched for the extracellular exosome molecules, Alzheimer’s disease pathway and Age/Telomere Length ontology as determined by DAVID Gene Ontology analysis. Ingenuity pathway analysis of the differentially expressed EV proteins revealed enrichment of canonical liver/retinoid X receptor activation pathway. Upstream effect analysis predicted MAPT (tau) as an upstream regulator in former NFL players. These data will be useful for understanding the EV-mediated disease spread and development of novel EV biomarkers for CTE and related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Region-Specific Response of Astrocytes to Prion Infection</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01048</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chronic neuroinflammation involves reactive microgliosis and astrogliosis, and is regarded as a common pathological hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, ALS and prion diseases. Reactive astrogliosis, routinely observed immunohistochemically as an increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) signal, is a well-documented feature of chronic neuroinflammation associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies on single-cell transcriptional profiling of a mouse brain revealed that, under normal conditions, several distinct subtypes of astrocytes with regionally specialized distribution exist. However, it remains unclear whether astrocytic response to pro-inflammatory pathological conditions is uniform across whole brain or is region-specific. The current study compares the response of microglia and astrocytes to prions in mice infected with 22L mouse-adapted prion strain. While the intensity of reactive microgliosis correlated well with the extent of PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt; deposition, reactive astrogliosis displayed a different, region-specific pattern. In particular, the thalamus and stratum oriens of hippocampus, which are both affected by 22L prions, displayed strikingly different response of astrocytes to PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt;. Astrocytes in stratum oriens of hippocampus responded to accumulation of PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt; with visible hypertrophy and increased GFAP, while in the thalamus, despite stronger PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt; signal, the increase of GFAP was milder than in hippocampus, and the change in astrocyte morphology was less pronounced. The current study suggests that astrocyte response to prion infection is heterogeneous and, in part, defined by brain region. Moreover, the current work emphasizes the needs for elucidating region-specific changes in functional states of astrocytes and exploring the impact of these changes to chronic neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Neuroprotective Potential of Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase Activating Polypeptide in Retinal Degenerations of Metabolic Origin</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01031</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP1-38) is a highly conserved member of the secretin/glucagon/VIP family. The repressive effect of PACAP1-38 on the apoptotic machinery has been an area of active research conferring a significant neuroprotective potential onto this peptide. A remarkable number of studies suggest its importance in the etiology of neurodegenerative disorders, particularly in relation to retinal metabolic disorders. In our review, we provide short descriptions of various pathological conditions (diabetic retinopathy, excitotoxic retinal injury and ischemic retinal lesion) in which the remedial effect of PACAP has been well demonstrated in various animal models. Of all the pathological conditions, diabetic retinopathy seems to be the most intriguing as it develops in 75% of patients with type 1 and 50% of patients with type 2 diabetes, with concomitant progression to legal blindness in about 5%. Several animal models have been developed in recent years to study retinal degenerations and out of these glaucoma and age-related retina degeneration models bear human recapitulations. PACAP neuroprotection is thought to operate through enhanced cAMP production upon binding to PAC1-R. However, the underlying signaling network that leads to neuroprotection is not fully understood. We observed that (i) PACAP is not equally efficient in the above conditions; (ii) in some cases more than one signaling pathways are activated; (iii) the coupling of PAC1-R and signaling is stage dependent; and (iv) PAC1-R is not the only receptor that must be considered to interpret the effects in our experiments. These observations point to a complex signaling mechanism, that involves alternative routes besides the classical cAMP/protein kinase A pathway to evoke the outstanding neuroprotective action. Consequently, the possible contribution of the other two main receptors (VPAC1-R and VPAC2-R) will also be discussed. Finally, the potential medical use of PACAP in some retinal and ocular disorders will also be reviewed. By taking advantage of, low-cost synthesis technologies today, PACAP may serve as an alternative to the expensive treatment modelities currently available in ocular or retinal conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics | New and Recent Articles: Exploring EEG Effective Connectivity Network in Estimating Influence of Color on Emotion and Memory</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2019.00066</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Color is a perceptual stimulus that has a significant impact on improving human emotion and memory. Studies have revealed that colored multimedia learning materials (MLMs) have a positive effect on learner’s emotion and learning where it was assessed by subjective/objective measurements. This study aimed to quantitatively assess the influence of colored MLMs on emotion, cognitive processes during learning, and long-term memory (LTM) retention using electroencephalography (EEG). The dataset consisted of 45 healthy participants, and MLMs were designed in colored or achromatic illustrations to elicit emotion and that to assess its impact on LTM retention after 30-min and 1-month delay. The EEG signal analysis was first started to estimate the effective connectivity network (ECN) using the phase slope index and expand it to characterize the ECN pattern using graph theoretical analysis. EEG results showed that colored MLMs had influences on theta and alpha networks, including (1) an increased frontal-parietal connectivity (top–down processing), (2) a larger number of brain hubs, (3) a lower clustering coefficient, and (4) a higher local efficiency, indicating that color influences information processing in the brain, as reflected by ECN, together with a significant improvement in learner’s emotion and memory performance. This is evidenced by a more positive emotional valence and higher recall accuracy for groups who learned with colored MLMs than that of achromatic MLMs. In conclusion, this paper demonstrated how the EEG ECN parameters could help quantify the influences of colored MLMs on emotion and cognitive processes during learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01060</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hemodynamic fluctuations in the default mode network (DMN), observed through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), have been linked to electrophysiological oscillations detected by electroencephalography (EEG). It has been reported that, among the electrophysiological oscillations, those in the alpha frequency range (8–13 Hz) are the most dominant during resting state. We hypothesized that DMN spatial configuration closely depends on the specific neuronal oscillations considered, and that alpha oscillations would mainly correlate with increased blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal in the DMN. To test this hypothesis, we used high-density EEG (hdEEG) data simultaneously collected with fMRI scanning in 20 healthy volunteers at rest. We first detected the DMN from source reconstructed hdEEG data for multiple frequency bands, and we then mapped the correlation between temporal profile of hdEEG-derived DMN activity and fMRI–BOLD signals on a voxel-by-voxel basis. In line with our hypothesis, we found that the correlation map associated with alpha oscillations, more than with any other frequency bands, displayed a larger overlap with DMN regions. Overall, our study provided further evidence for a primary role of alpha oscillations in supporting DMN functioning. We suggest that simultaneous EEG–fMRI may represent a powerful tool to investigate the neurophysiological basis of human brain networks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Visualization and Quantification of Post-stroke Neural Connectivity and Neuroinflammation Using Serial Two-Photon Tomography in the Whole Mouse Brain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01055</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Whole-brain volumetric microscopy techniques such as serial two-photon tomography (STPT) can provide detailed information on the roles of neuroinflammation and neuroplasticity throughout the whole brain post-stroke. STPT automatically generates high-resolution images of coronal sections of the entire mouse brain that can be readily visualized in three dimensions. We developed a pipeline for whole brain image analysis that includes supervised machine learning (pixel-wise random forest models via the “ilastik” software package) followed by registration to a standardized 3-D atlas of the adult mouse brain (Common Coordinate Framework v3.0; Allen Institute for Brain Science). These procedures allow the detection of cellular fluorescent signals throughout the brain in an unbiased manner. To illustrate our imaging techniques and automated image quantification, we examined long-term post-stroke motor circuit connectivity in mice that received a motor cortex photothrombotic stroke. Two weeks post-stroke, mice received intramuscular injections of pseudorabies virus (PRV-152), a trans-synaptic retrograde herpes virus driving expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP), into the affected contralesional forelimb to label neurons in descending tracts to the forelimb musculature. Mice were sacrificed 3 weeks post-stroke. We also quantified sub-acute neuroinflammation in the post-stroke brain in a separate cohort of mice following a 60 min transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAo). Naive e450&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-labeled splenic CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cytotoxic T cells were intravenously injected at 7, 24, 48, and 72 h post-tMCAo. Mice were sacrificed 4 days after stroke. Detailed quantification of post-stroke neural connectivity and neuroinflammation indicates a role for remote brain regions in stroke pathology and recovery. The workflow described herein, incorporating STPT and automated quantification of fluorescently labeled features of interest, provides a framework by which one can objectively evaluate labeled neuronal or lymphocyte populations in healthy and injured brains. The results provide region-specific quantification of neural connectivity and neuroinflammation, which could be a critical tool for investigating mechanisms of not only stroke recovery, but also a wide variety of brain injuries or diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Quantifying Neurodegenerative Progression With DeepSymNet, an End-to-End Data-Driven Approach</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01053</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder worldwide and is one of the leading sources of morbidity and mortality in the aging population. There is a long preclinical period followed by mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Clinical diagnosis and the rate of decline is variable. Progression monitoring remains a challenge in AD, and it is imperative to create better tools to quantify this progression. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is commonly used for patient assessment. However, current approaches for analysis require strong a priori assumptions about regions of interest used and complex preprocessing pipelines including computationally expensive non-linear registrations and iterative surface deformations. These preprocessing steps are composed of many stacked processing layers. Any error or bias in an upstream layer will be propagated throughout the pipeline. Failures or biases in the non-linear subject registration and the subjective choice of atlases of specific regions are common in medical neuroimaging analysis and may hinder the translation of many approaches to the clinical practice. Here we propose a data-driven method based on an extension of a deep learning architecture, DeepSymNet, that identifies longitudinal changes without relying on prior brain regions of interest, an atlas, or non-linear registration steps. Our approach is trained end-to-end and learns how a patient's brain structure dynamically changes between two-time points directly from the raw voxels. We compare our approach with Freesurfer longitudinal pipelines and voxel-based methods using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Our model can identify AD progression with comparable results to existing Freesurfer longitudinal pipelines without the need of predefined regions of interest, non-rigid registration algorithms, or iterative surface deformation at a fraction of the processing time. When compared to other voxel-based methods which share some of the same benefits, our model showed a statistically significant performance improvement. Additionally, we show that our model can differentiate between healthy subjects and patients with MCI. The model's decision was investigated using the epsilon layer-wise propagation algorithm. We found that the predictions were driven by the pallidum, putamen, and the superior temporal gyrus. Our novel longitudinal based, deep learning approach has the potential to diagnose patients earlier and enable new computational tools to monitor neurodegeneration in clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01046</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The dynamical systems view of movement generation in motor cortical areas has emerged as an effective way to explain the firing properties of populations of neurons recorded from these regions. Recently, many studies have focused on finding low-dimensional representations of these dynamical systems during voluntary reaching and grasping behaviors carried out by the forelimbs. One such model, the Poisson linear-dynamical-system (PLDS) model, has been shown to extract dynamics which can be used to decode reaching kinematics. However, few have investigated these dynamics, especially in non-human primates, during behaviors such as locomotion, which may involve motor cortex to a lesser degree. Here, we focused on unconstrained quadrupedal locomotion, and investigated whether unsupervised latent state-space models can extract low-dimensional dynamics while preserving information about hind-limb kinematics. Spiking activity from the leg area of primary motor cortex of rhesus macaques was recorded simultaneously with hind-limb joint positions during ambulation across a corridor, ladder, and on a treadmill at various speeds. We found that PLDS models can extract stereotyped low-dimensional neural trajectories from these neurons phase-locked to the gait cycle, and that distinct trajectories emerge depending on the speed and class of behavior. Additionally, it was possible to decode both the hind-limb kinematics and the gait phase from these inferred trajectories just as well or better than from the full neural population (18-80 neurons) with only 12 dimensions. Our results demonstrate that kinematics and gait phase during various locomotion tasks are well represented in low-dimensional latent dynamics inferred from motor cortex population activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01026</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) biomarker identification is important for pathogenesis research and diagnosis in routine clinical practice. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood cytokines as potential biomarkers that can inform MS pathogenesis, diagnosis and response to treatment have been assessed in numerous studies. However, there have been no comprehensive meta-analyses to pool cytokine data and to address their diagnostic performance. We systematically reviewed literature with meta-analyses to assess the alteration levels of cytokines and chemokines in MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We searched PubMed and Web of Science for articles published between January 1, 1990 and April 30, 2018 for this systematic review and meta-analysis. Data were extracted from 226 included studies encompassing 13,526 MS patients and 8,428 controls. Biomarker performance was rated by a random-effects meta-analysis based on the standard mean difference between cytokine concentration in patients with MS and controls, or patients before and after treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Of the 26 CSF cytokines and 37 blood cytokines for potential differentiation between MS patients and controls, the random-effects meta-analysis showed that 13 CSF cytokines and 21 blood cytokines were significantly increased in MS patients in comparison to the controls. Interestingly, TNF-α, CXCL8, IL-15, IL-12p40, and CXCL13 were increased in both blood and CSF of MS patients. For those cytokines analyzed in at least 10 studies, differentiation between case and control was strong for CSF CXCL13, blood IL-2R, and blood IL-23; CSF CXCL8, blood IL-2, and blood IL-17 also performed well in differentiating between MS patients and controls, whereas those of CSF TNF-α and blood TNF-α, CXCL8, IL-12, IFN-γ were moderate. Furthermore, CSF IL-15, CCL19, CCL11, CCL-3, and blood CCL20, IL-12p40, IL-21, IL-17F, IL-22 had large effective sizes when differentiating between MS patients and controls but had a relatively small number of studies (three to seven studies).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our findings clarified the circulating cytokine profile in MS, which provide targets for disease modifying treatments, and suggest that cytokines have the potential to be used as biomarkers for MS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: An Adult Brain Atlas Reveals Broad Neuroanatomical Changes in Independently Evolved Populations of Mexican Cavefish</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2019.00088</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A shift in environmental conditions impacts the evolution of complex developmental and behavioral traits. The Mexican cavefish, Astyanax mexicanus, is a powerful model for examining the evolution of development, physiology, and behavior because multiple cavefish populations can be compared to an extant, ancestral-like surface population of the same species. Many behaviors have diverged in cave populations of A. mexicanus, and previous studies have shown that cavefish have a loss of sleep, reduced stress, an absence of social behaviors, and hyperphagia. Despite these findings, surprisingly little is known about the changes in neuroanatomy that underlie these behavioral phenotypes. Here, we use serial sectioning to generate brain atlases of surface fish and three independent cavefish populations. Volumetric reconstruction of serial-sectioned brains confirms convergent evolution on reduced optic tectum volume in all cavefish populations tested. In addition, we quantified volumes of specific neuroanatomical loci within several brain regions that have previously been implicated in behavioral regulation, including the hypothalamus, thalamus, and habenula. These analyses reveal an enlargement of the hypothalamus in all cavefish populations relative to surface fish, as well as subnuclei-specific differences within the thalamus and prethalamus. Taken together, these analyses support the notion that changes in environmental conditions are accompanied by neuroanatomical changes in brain structures associated with behavior. This atlas provides a resource for comparative neuroanatomy of additional brain regions and the opportunity to associate brain anatomy with evolved changes in behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: Equine Stereotaxtic Population Average Brain Atlas With Neuroanatomic Correlation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2019.00089</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There is growing interest in the horse for behavioral, neuroanatomic and neuroscientific research due to its large and complex brain, cognitive abilities and long lifespan making it neurologically interesting and a potential large animal model for several neuropsychological diseases. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful neuroscientific research tool that can be performed in vivo, with adapted equine facilities, or ex-vivo in the research setting. The brain atlas is a fundamental resource for neuroimaging research, and have been created for a multitude animal models, however, none currently exist for the equine brain. In this study, we document the creation of a high-resolution stereotaxic population average brain atlas of the equine. The atlas was generated from nine unfixed equine cadaver brains imaged within 4 h of euthanasia in a 3-tesla MRI. The atlas was generated using linear and non-linear registration methods and quality assessed using signal and contrast to noise calculations. Tissue segmentation maps (TSMs) for white matter (WM), gray matter (GM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), were generated and manually segmented anatomic priors created for multiple subcortical brain structures. The resulting atlas was validated and correlated to gross anatomical specimens and is made freely available at as an online resource for researchers (https://doi.org/10.7298/cyrs-7b51.2). The mean volume metrics for the whole brain, GM and WM for the included subjects were documented and the effect of age and laterality assessed. Alterations in brain volume in relation to age were identified, though these variables were not found to be significantly correlated. All subjects had higher whole brain, GM and WM volumes on the right side, consistent with the well documented right forebrain dominance of horses. This atlas provides an important tool for automated processing in equine and translational neuroimaging research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Precision Sensorimotor Control in Aging FMR1 Gene Premutation Carriers</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00056</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Individuals with premutation alleles of the FMR1 gene are at risk of developing fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), a neurodegenerative condition affecting sensorimotor function. Information on quantitative symptom traits associated with aging in premutation carriers is needed to clarify neurodegenerative processes contributing to FXTAS.&lt;/p&gt;Materials and Methods&lt;p&gt;26 FMR1 premutation carriers ages 44–77 years and 31 age-matched healthy controls completed rapid (2 s) and sustained (8 s) visually guided precision gripping tasks. Individuals pressed at multiple force levels to determine the impact of increasing the difficulty of sensorimotor actions on precision behavior. During initial pressing, reaction time, the rate at which individuals increased their force, the duration of pressing, and force accuracy were measured. During sustained gripping, the complexity of the force time series, force variability, and mean force were examined. During relaxation, the rate at which individuals decreased their force was measured. We also examined the relationships between visuomotor behavior and cytosine-guanine-guanine (CGG) repeat length and clinically rated FXTAS symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Relative to controls, premutation carriers showed reduced rates of initial force generation during rapid motor actions and longer durations of their initial pressing with their dominant hand. During sustained force, premutation carriers demonstrated reduced force complexity, though this effect was specific to younger premutation carries during dominant hand pressing and was more severe for younger relative to older premutation carriers at low and medium force levels. Increased reaction time and lower sustained force complexity each were associated with greater CGG repeat length for premutation carriers. Increased reaction time and increased sustained force variability were associated with more severe clinically rated FXTAS symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Overall our findings suggest multiple sensorimotor processes are disrupted in aging premutation carriers, including initial force control guided by feedforward mechanisms and sustained sensorimotor behaviors guided by sensory feedback control processes. Results indicating that sensorimotor issues in aging premutation carriers relate to both greater CGG repeat length and clinically rated FXTAS symptoms suggest that quantitative tests of precision sensorimotor ability may serve as key targets for monitoring FXTAS risk and progression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: A JAR of Chirps: The Gymnotiform Chirp Can Function as Both a Communication Signal and a Jamming Avoidance Response</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00055</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The weakly electric gymnotiform fish produce a rhythmic electric organ discharge (EOD) used for communication and active electrolocation. The EOD frequency is entrained to a medullary pacemaker nucleus. During communication and exploration, this rate can be modulated by a pre-pacemaker network, resulting in specific patterns of rate modulation, including stereotyped communication signals and dynamic interactions with conspecifics known as a Jamming Avoidance Response (JAR). One well-known stereotyped signal is the chirp, a brief upward frequency sweep usually lasting less than 500 ms. The abrupt change in frequency has dramatic effects on phase precession between two signalers. We report here on chirping in Brachyhypopmus cf. sullivani, Microsternarchus cf. bilineatus Lineage C, and Steatogenys cf. elegans during conspecific playback experiments. Microsternarchus also exhibits two behaviors that include chirp-like extreme frequency modulations, EOD interruptions with hushing silence and tumultuous rises, and these are described in terms of receiver impact. These behaviors all have substantial impact on interference caused by conspecifics and may be a component of the JAR in some species. Chirps are widely used in electronic communications systems, sonar, and other man-made active sensing systems. The brevity of the chirp, and the phase disruption it causes, makes chirps effective as attention-grabbing or readiness signals. This conforms to the varied assigned functions across gymnotiforms, including pre-combat aggressive or submissive signals or during courtship and mating. The specific behavioral contexts of chirp expression vary across species, but the physical structure of the chirp makes it extremely salient to conspecifics. Chirps may be expected in a wide range of behavioral contexts where their function depends on being noticeable and salient. Further, in pulse gymnotiforms, the chirp is well structured to comprise a robust jamming signal to a conspecific receiver if specifically timed to the receiver’s EOD cycle. Microsternarchus and Steatogenys exploit this feature and include chirps in dynamic jamming avoidance behaviors. This may be an evolutionary re-use of a circuitry for a specific signal in another context.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Tonality Tunes the Statistical Characteristics in Music: Computational Approaches on Statistical Learning</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00070</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Statistical learning is a learning mechanism based on transition probability in sequences such as music and language. Recent computational and neurophysiological studies suggest that the statistical learning contributes to production, action, and musical creativity as well as prediction and perception. The present study investigated how statistical structure interacts with tonalities in music based on various-order statistical models. To verify this in all 24 major and minor keys, the transition probabilities of the sequences containing the highest pitches in Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier, which is a collection of two series (No. 1 and No. 2) of preludes and fugues in all of the 24 major and minor keys, were calculated based on nth-order Markov models. The transition probabilities of each sequence were compared among tonalities (major and minor), two series (No. 1 and No. 2), and music types (prelude and fugue). The differences in statistical characteristics between major and minor keys were detected in lower- but not higher-order models. The results also showed that statistical knowledge in music might be modulated by tonalities and composition periods. Furthermore, the principal component analysis detected the shared components of related keys, suggesting that the tonalities modulate statistical characteristics in music. The present study may suggest that there are at least two types of statistical knowledge in music that are interdependent on and independent of tonality, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Cortical Regions Encoding Hardness Perception Modulated by Visual Information Identified by Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging With Multivoxel Pattern Analysis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00052</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent studies have revealed that hardness perception is determined by visual information along with the haptic input. This study investigated the cortical regions involved in hardness perception modulated by visual information using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA). Twenty-two healthy participants were enrolled. They were required to place their left and right hands at the front and back, respectively, of a mirror attached to a platform placed above them while lying in a magnetic resonance scanner. In conditions SFT, MED, and HRD, one of three polyurethane foam pads of varying hardness (soft, medium, and hard, respectively) was presented to the left hand in a given trial, while only the medium pad was presented to the right hand in all trials. MED was defined as the control condition, because the visual and haptic information was congruent. During the scan, the participants were required to push the pad with the both hands while observing the reflection of the left hand and estimate the hardness of the pad perceived by the right (hidden) hand based on magnitude estimation. Behavioral results showed that the perceived hardness was significantly biased toward softer or harder in &amp;gt;73% of the trials in conditions SFT and HRD; we designated these trials as visually modulated (SFTvm and HRDvm, respectively). The accuracy map was calculated individually for each of the pair-wise comparisons of (SFTvm vs. MED), (HRDvm vs. MED), and (SFTvm vs. HRDvm) by a searchlight MVPA, and the cortical regions encoding the perceived hardness with visual modulation were identified by conjunction of the three accuracy maps in group analysis. The cluster was observed in the right sensory motor cortex, left anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS), bilateral parietal operculum (PO), and occipito-temporal cortex (OTC). Together with previous findings on such cortical regions, we conclude that the visual information of finger movements processed in the OTC may be integrated with haptic input in the left aIPS, and the subjective hardness perceived by the right hand with visual modulation may be processed in the cortical network between the left PO and aIPS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: EGTA Can Inhibit Vesicular Release in the Nanodomain of Single Ca2+ Channels</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2019.00026</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The exogenous Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; chelator EGTA (ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid) has been widely used to probe the coupling distance between Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels and vesicular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensors for neurotransmitter release. Because of its slow forward rate for binding, EGTA is thought to not capture calcium ions in very proximity to a channel, whereas it does capture calcium ions at the remote distance. However, in this study, our reaction diffusion simulations (RDSs) of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; combined with a release calculation using vesicular sensor models indicate that a high concentration of EGTA decreases Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and vesicular release in the nanodomain of single channels. We found that a key determinant of the effect of EGTA on neurotransmitter release is the saturation of the vesicular sensor. When the sensor is saturated, the reduction in the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration by EGTA is masked. By contrast, when the sensor is in a linear range, even a small reduction in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; by EGTA can decrease vesicular release. In proximity to a channel, the vesicular sensor is often saturated for a long voltage step, but not for a brief Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx typically evoked by an action potential. Therefore, when EGTA is used as a diagnostic tool to probe the coupling distance, care must be taken regarding the presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry duration as well as the property of the vesicular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensor.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00054</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Activity patterns of cerebral cortical regions represent the current environment in which animals receive multi-modal inputs. These patterns are also shaped by the history of activity that reflects learned information on past multimodal exposures. We studied the long-term dynamics of cortical activity patterns during the formation of multimodal memories by analyzing in vivo high-resolution 2-photon mouse brain imaging data of Immediate Early Gene (IEG) expression, resolved by cortical layers. Strikingly, in superficial layers II/III, the patterns showed similar dynamics across structurally and functionally distinct cortical areas and the consistency of dynamic patterns lasted for one to several days. By contrast, in deep layer V, the activity dynamics varied across different areas, and the current activities were sensitive to the previous activities at different time points, depending on the cortical locations, indicating that the information stored in the cortex at different time points was distributed across different cortical areas. These results suggest different roles of superficial and deep layer neurons in the long-term multimodal representation of the environment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Online Detection of Multiple Stimulus Changes Based on Single Neuron Interspike Intervals</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00069</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Nervous systems need to detect stimulus changes based on their neuronal responses without using any additional information on the number, times, and types of stimulus changes. Here, two relatively simple, biologically realistic change point detection methods are compared with two common analysis methods. The four methods are applied to intra- and extracellularly recorded responses of a single cricket interneuron (AN2) to acoustic simulation. Solely based on these recorded responses, the methods should detect an unknown number of different types of sound intensity in- and decreases shortly after their occurrences. For this task, the methods rely on calculating an adjusting interspike interval (ISI). Both simple methods try to separate responses to intensity in- or decreases from activity during constant stimulation. The Pure-ISI method performs this task based on the distribution of the ISI, while the ISI-Ratio method uses the ratio of actual and previous ISI. These methods are compared to the frequently used Moving-Average method, which calculates mean and standard deviation of the instantaneous spike rate in a moving interval. Additionally, a classification method provides the upper limit of the change point detection performance that can be expected for the cricket interneuron responses. The classification learns the statistical properties of the actual and previous ISI during stimulus changes and constant stimulation from a training data set. The main results are: (1) The Moving-Average method requires a stable activity in a long interval to estimate the previous activity, which was not always given in our data set. (2) The Pure-ISI method can reliably detect stimulus intensity increases when the neuron bursts, but it fails to identify intensity decreases. (3) The ISI-Ratio method detects stimulus in- and decreases well, if the spike train is not too noisy. (4) The classification method shows good performance for the detection of stimulus in- and decreases. But due to the statistical learning, this method tends to confuse responses to constant stimulation with responses triggered by a stimulus change. Our results suggest that stimulus change detection does not require computationally costly mechanisms. Simple nervous systems like the cricket's could effectively apply ISI-Ratios to solve this fundamental task.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Response Dynamics in an Olivocerebellar Spiking Neural Network With Non-linear Neuron Properties</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00068</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sensorimotor signals are integrated and processed by the cerebellar circuit to predict accurate control of actions. In order to investigate how single neuron dynamics and geometrical modular connectivity affect cerebellar processing, we have built an olivocerebellar Spiking Neural Network (SNN) based on a novel simplification algorithm for single point models (Extended Generalized Leaky Integrate and Fire, EGLIF) capturing essential non-linear neuronal dynamics (e.g., pacemaking, bursting, adaptation, oscillation and resonance). EGLIF models specifically tuned for each neuron type were embedded into an olivocerebellar scaffold reproducing realistic spatial organization and physiological convergence and divergence ratios of connections. In order to emulate the circuit involved in an eye blink response to two associated stimuli, we modeled two adjacent olivocerebellar microcomplexes with a common mossy fiber input but different climbing fiber inputs (either on or off). EGLIF-SNN model simulations revealed the emergence of fundamental response properties in Purkinje cells (burst-pause) and deep nuclei cells (pause-burst) similar to those reported in vivo. The expression of these properties depended on the specific activation of climbing fibers in the microcomplexes and did not emerge with scaffold models using simplified point neurons. This result supports the importance of embedding SNNs with realistic neuronal dynamics and appropriate connectivity and anticipates the scale-up of EGLIF-SNN and the embedding of plasticity rules required to investigate cerebellar functioning at multiple scales.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Selection of the Best Electroencephalogram Channel to Predict the Depth of Anesthesia</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00065</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Precise cerebral dynamics of action of the anesthetics are a challenge for neuroscientists. This explains why there is no gold standard for monitoring the Depth of Anesthesia (DoA) and why experimental studies may use several electroencephalogram (EEG) channels, ranging from 2 to 128 EEG-channels. Our study aimed at finding the scalp area providing valuable information about brain activity under general anesthesia (GA) to select the more optimal EEG channel to characterized the DoA. We included 30 patients undergoing elective, minor surgery under GA and used a 32-channel EEG to record their electrical brain activity. In addition, we recorded their physiological parameters and the BIS monitor. Each individual EEG channel data were processed to test their ability to differentiate awake from asleep states. Due to strict quality criteria adopted for the EEG data and the difficulties of the real-life setting of the study, only 8 patients recordings were taken into consideration in the final analysis. Using 2 classification algorithms, we identified the optimal channels to discriminate between asleep and awake states: the frontal and temporal F8 and T7 were retrieved as being the two bests channels to monitor DoA. Then, using only data from the F8 channel, we tried to minimize the number of features required to discriminate between the awake and asleep state. The best algorithm turned out to be the Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB) requiring only 5 features (Area Under the ROC Curve - AUC- of 0.93 ± 0.04). This finding may pave the way to improve the assessment of DoA by combining one EEG channel recordings with a multimodal physiological monitoring of the brain state under GA. Further work is needed to see if these results may be valid to asses the depth of sedation in ICU.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Primary Role of the Amygdala in Spontaneous Inflammatory Pain- Associated Activation of Pain Networks – A Chemogenetic Manganese-Enhanced MRI Approach</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00058</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chronic pain is a major health problem, affecting 10–30% of the population in developed countries. While chronic pain is defined as “a persistent complaint of pain lasting for more than the usual period for recovery,” recently accumulated lines of evidence based on human brain imaging have revealed that chronic pain is not simply a sustained state of nociception, but rather an allostatic state established through gradually progressing plastic changes in the central nervous system. To visualize the brain activity associated with spontaneously occurring pain during the shift from acute to chronic pain under anesthetic-free conditions, we used manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) with a 9.4-T scanner to visualize neural activity-dependent accumulation of manganese in the brains of mice with hind paw inflammation. Time-differential analysis between 2- and 6-h after formalin injection to the left hind paw revealed a significantly increased MEMRI signal in various brain areas, including the right insular cortex, right nucleus accumbens, right globus pallidus, bilateral caudate putamen, right primary/secondary somatosensory cortex, bilateral thalamus, right amygdala, bilateral substantial nigra, and left ventral tegmental area. To analyze the role of the right amygdala in these post-formalin MEMRI signals, we repeatedly inhibited right amygdala neurons during this 2–6-h period using the “designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs” (DREADD) technique. Pharmacological activation of inhibitory DREADDs expressed in the right amygdala significantly attenuated MEMRI signals in the bilateral infralimbic cortex, bilateral nucleus accumbens, bilateral caudate putamen, right globus pallidus, bilateral ventral tegmental area, and bilateral substantia nigra, suggesting that the inflammatory pain-associated activation of these structures depends on the activity of the right amygdala and DREADD-expressing adjacent structures. In summary, the combined use of DREADD and MEMRI is a promising approach for revealing regions associated with spontaneous pain-associated brain activities and their causal relationships.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01023</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mechanical forces are increasingly recognized as major regulators of several physiological processes at both the molecular and cellular level; therefore, a deep understanding of the sensing of these forces and their conversion into electrical signals are essential for studying the mechanosensitive properties of soft biological tissues. To contribute to this field, we present a dual-purpose device able to mechanically stimulate retinal tissue and to record the spiking activity of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). This new instrument relies on combining ferrule-top micro-indentation, which provides local measurements of viscoelasticity, with high-density multi-electrode array (HD-MEAs) to simultaneously record the spontaneous activity of the retina. In this paper, we introduce this instrument, describe its technical characteristics, and present a proof-of-concept experiment that shows how RGC spiking activity of explanted mice retinas respond to mechanical micro-stimulations of their photoreceptor layer. The data suggest that, under specific conditions of indentation, the retina perceive the mechanical stimulation as modulation of the visual input, besides the longer time-scale of activation, and the increase in spiking activity is not only localized under the indentation probe, but it propagates across the retinal tissue.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics | New and Recent Articles: odMLtables: A User-Friendly Approach for Managing Metadata of Neurophysiological Experiments</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2019.00062</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An essential aspect of scientific reproducibility is a coherent and complete acquisition of metadata along with the actual data of an experiment. The high degree of complexity and heterogeneity of neuroscience experiments requires a rigorous management of the associated metadata. The odML framework represents a solution to organize and store complex metadata digitally in a hierarchical format that is both human and machine readable. However, this hierarchical representation of metadata is difficult to handle when metadata entries need to be collected and edited manually during the daily routines of a laboratory. With odMLtables, we present an open-source software solution that enables users to collect, manipulate, visualize, and store metadata in tabular representations (in xls or csv format) by providing functionality to convert these tabular collections to the hierarchically structured metadata format odML, and to either extract or merge subsets of a complex metadata collection. With this, odMLtables bridges the gap between handling metadata in an intuitive way that integrates well with daily lab routines and commonly used software products on the one hand, and the implementation of a complete, well-defined metadata collection for the experiment in a standardized format on the other hand. We demonstrate usage scenarios of the odMLtables tools in common lab routines in the context of metadata acquisition and management, and show how the tool can assist in exploring published datasets that provide metadata in the odML format.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Neural Dynamics Indicate Parallel Integration of Environmental and Self-Motion Information by Place and Grid Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00059</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Place cells and grid cells in the hippocampal formation are thought to integrate sensory and self-motion information into a representation of estimated spatial location, but the precise mechanism is unknown. We simulated a parallel attractor system in which place cells form an attractor network driven by environmental inputs and grid cells form an attractor network performing path integration driven by self-motion, with inter-connections between them allowing both types of input to influence firing in both ensembles. We show that such a system is needed to explain the spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of place cell firing when rats run on a linear track in which the familiar correspondence between environmental and self-motion inputs is changed. In contrast, the alternative architecture of a single recurrent network of place cells (performing path integration and receiving environmental inputs) cannot reproduce the place cell firing dynamics. These results support the hypothesis that grid and place cells provide two different but complementary attractor representations (based on self-motion and environmental sensory inputs, respectively). Our results also indicate the specific neural mechanism and main predictors of hippocampal map realignment and make predictions for future studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Supraspinal Shaping of Adaptive Transitions in the State of Functional Connectivity Between Segmentally Distributed Dorsal Horn Neuronal Populations in Response to Nociception and Antinociception</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00047</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the anesthetized cat the correlation between the ongoing cord dorsum potentials (CDPs) recorded from different lumbar spinal segments has a non-random structure, suggesting relatively stable patterns of functional connectivity between the dorsal horn neuronal ensembles involved in the generation of these potentials. During the nociception induced by the intradermic injection of capsaicin, the patterns of segmental correlation between the spontaneous CDPs acquire other non-random configurations that are temporarily reversed to their pre-capsaicin state by the systemic injection of lidocaine, a procedure known to decrease the manifestation of neuropathic pain in both animals and humans. We have now extended these studies and utilized machine learning for the automatic extraction and selection of particular classes of CDPs according to their shapes and amplitudes. By using a Markovian analysis, we disclosed the transitions between the different kinds of CDPs induced by capsaicin and lidocaine and constructed a global model based on the changes in the behavior of the CDPs generated along the whole set of lumbar segments. This allowed the identification of the different states of functional connectivity within the whole ensemble of dorsal horn neurones attained during nociception and their transitory reversal by systemic administration of lidocaine in preparations with the intact neuroaxis and after spinalization. The present observations provide additional information on the state of self-organized criticality that leads to the adaptive behavior of the dorsal horn neuronal networks during nociception and antinociception both shaped by supraspinal descending influences.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Computational Modeling of Genetic Contributions to Excitability and Neural Coding in Layer V Pyramidal Cells: Applications to Schizophrenia Pathology</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00066</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Pyramidal cells in layer V of the neocortex are one of the most widely studied neuron types in the mammalian brain. Due to their role as integrators of feedforward and cortical feedback inputs, they are well-positioned to contribute to the symptoms and pathology in mental disorders—such as schizophrenia—that are characterized by a mismatch between the internal perception and external inputs. In this modeling study, we analyze the input/output properties of layer V pyramidal cells and their sensitivity to modeled genetic variants in schizophrenia-associated genes. We show that the excitability of layer V pyramidal cells and the way they integrate inputs in space and time are altered by many types of variants in ion-channel and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transporter-encoding genes that have been identified as risk genes by recent genome-wide association studies. We also show that the variability in the output patterns of spiking and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients in layer V pyramidal cells is altered by these model variants. Importantly, we show that many of the predicted effects are robust to noise and qualitatively similar across different computational models of layer V pyramidal cells. Our modeling framework reveals several aspects of single-neuron excitability that can be linked to known schizophrenia-related phenotypes and existing hypotheses on disease mechanisms. In particular, our models predict that single-cell steady-state firing rate is positively correlated with the coding capacity of the neuron and negatively correlated with the amplitude of a prepulse-mediated adaptation and sensitivity to coincidence of stimuli in the apical dendrite and the perisomatic region of a layer V pyramidal cell. These results help to uncover the voltage-gated ion-channel and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transporter-associated genetic underpinnings of schizophrenia phenotypes and biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Projections of Brodmann Area 6 to the Pyramidal Tract in Humans: Quantifications Using High Angular Resolution Data</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00062</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Primate studies indicate that the pyramidal tract (PyT) could originate from Brodmann area (BA) 6. However, in humans, the accurate origin of PyT from BA 6 is still uncertain owing to difficulties in visualizing anatomical features such as the fanning shape at the corona radiata and multiple crossings at the semioval centrum. High angular-resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) could reliably replicate these anatomical features. We explored the origin of the human PyT from BA 6 using HARDI. With HARDI data of 30 adults from the Massachusetts General Hospital-Human Connectome Project (MGH-HCP) database and the HCP 1021 template (average of 1021 HCP diffusion data), we visualized the PyT at the 30-averaged group level and the 1021 large-sample level and validated the observations in each of the individuals. Endpoints of the fibers within each subregion were quantified. PyT fibers originating from the BA 6 were consistently visualized in all images. Specifically, the bilateral supplementary motor area (SMA) and dorsal premotor area (dPMA) were consistently found to contribute to the PyT. PyT fibers from BA 6 and those from BA 4 exhibited a twisting topology. The PyT contains fibers originating from the SMA and dPMA in BA 6. Infarction of these regions or aging would result in incomplete provision of information to the PyT and concomitant decreases in motor planning and coordination abilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Spontaneous Activity Patterns Are Altered in the Developing Visual Cortex of the Fmr1 Knockout Mouse</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00057</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most prevalent inherited cause of autism and is accompanied by behavioral and sensory deficits. Errors in the wiring of the brain during early development likely contribute to these deficits, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Spontaneous activity patterns, which are required for fine-tuning neuronal networks before the senses become active, are perturbed in rodent models of FXS. Here, we investigated spontaneous network activity patterns in the developing visual cortex of the Fmr1 knockout mouse using in vivo calcium imaging during the second postnatal week, before eye opening. We found that while the frequency, mean amplitude and duration of spontaneous network events were unchanged in the knockout mouse, pair-wise correlations between neurons were increased compared to wild type littermate controls. Further analysis revealed that interneuronal correlations were not generally increased, rather that low-synchronization events occurred relatively less frequently than high-synchronization events. Low-, but not high-, synchronization events have been associated with retinal inputs previously. Since we found that spontaneous retinal waves were normal in the knockout, our results suggest that peripherally driven activity is underrepresented in the Fmr1 KO visual cortex. Therefore, we propose that central gating of retinal inputs may be affected in FXS and that peripherally and centrally driven activity patterns are already unbalanced before eye opening in this disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurogenesis section | New and Recent Articles: Negative Regulation of mTOR Signaling Restricts Cell Proliferation in the Floor Plate</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01022</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The neural tube is composed of a number of neural progenitors and postmitotic neurons distributed in a quantitatively and spatially precise manner. The floor plate, located in the ventral-most region of the neural tube, has a lot of unique characteristics, including a low cell proliferation rate. The mechanisms by which this region-specific proliferation rate is regulated remain elusive. Here we show that the activity of the mTOR signaling pathway, which regulates the proliferation of the neural progenitor cells, is significantly lower in the floor plate than in other domains of the embryonic neural tube. We identified the forkhead-type transcription factor FoxA2 as a negative regulator of mTOR signaling in the floor plate, and showed that FoxA2 transcriptionally induces the expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF152, which together with its substrate RagA, regulates cell proliferation via the mTOR pathway. Silencing of RNF152 led to the aberrant upregulation of the mTOR signal and aberrant cell division in the floor plate. Taken together, the present findings suggest that floor plate cell number is controlled by the negative regulation of mTOR signaling through the activity of FoxA2 and its downstream effector RNF152.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Early Sensory Loss Alters the Dendritic Branching and Spine Density of Supragranular Pyramidal Neurons in Rodent Primary Sensory Cortices</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00061</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Multisensory integration in primary auditory (A1), visual (V1), and somatosensory cortex (S1) is substantially mediated by their direct interconnections and by thalamic inputs across the sensory modalities. We have previously shown in rodents (Mongolian gerbils) that during postnatal development, the anatomical and functional strengths of these crossmodal and also of sensory matched connections are determined by early auditory, somatosensory, and visual experience. Because supragranular layer III pyramidal neurons are major targets of corticocortical and thalamocortical connections, we investigated in this follow-up study how the loss of early sensory experience changes their dendritic morphology. Gerbils were sensory deprived early in development by either bilateral sciatic nerve transection at postnatal day (P) 5, ototoxic inner hair cell damage at P10, or eye enucleation at P10. Sholl and branch order analyses of Golgi-stained layer III pyramidal neurons at P28, which demarcates the end of the sensory critical period in this species, revealed that visual and somatosensory deprivation leads to a general increase of apical and basal dendritic branching in A1, V1, and S1. In contrast, dendritic branching, particularly of apical dendrites, decreased in all three areas following auditory deprivation. Generally, the number of spines, and consequently spine density, along the apical and basal dendrites decreased in both sensory deprived and non-deprived cortical areas. Therefore, we conclude that the loss of early sensory experience induces a refinement of corticocortical crossmodal and other cortical and thalamic connections by pruning of dendritic spines at the end of the critical period. Based on present and previous own results and on findings from the literature, we propose a scenario for multisensory development following early sensory loss.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
