	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Networks of piecewise linear neural mass models. (arXiv:1801.08366v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.08366</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural mass models are ubiquitous in large scale brain modelling. At the node
level they are written in terms of a set of ODEs with a nonlinearity that is
typically a sigmoidal shape. Using structural data from brain atlases they may
be connected into a network to investigate the emergence of functional dynamic
states, such as synchrony. With the simple restriction of the classic sigmoidal
nonlinearity to a piecewise linear caricature we show that the famous
Wilson-Cowan neural mass model can be analysed at both the node and network
level. The construction of periodic orbits at the node level is achieved by
patching together matrix exponential solutions, and stability is determined
using Floquet theory. For networks with interactions described by circulant
matrices, we show that the stability of the synchronous state can be determined
in terms of a low-dimensional Floquet problem parameterised by the eigenvalues
of the interaction matrix. This network Floquet problem is readily solved using
linear algebra, to predict the onset of spatio-temporal network patterns
arising from a synchronous instability. We consider the case of a discontinuous
choice for the node nonlinearity, namely the replacement of the sigmoid by a
Heaviside nonlinearity. This gives rise to a continuous-time switching network.
At the node level this allows for the existence of unstable sliding periodic
orbits, which we construct. The stability of a periodic orbit is now treated
with a modification of Floquet theory to treat the evolution of small
perturbations through switching manifolds via saltation matrices. At the
network level the stability analysis of the synchronous state is considerably
more challenging. Here we report on the use of ideas originally developed for
the study of Glass networks to treat the stability of periodic network states
in neural mass models with discontinuous interactions.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The role of spatial heterogeneity in the evolution of local and global infections of viruses</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/QvuUxAMbOWQ/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Koich Saeki, Akira Sasaki&lt;/p&gt;

Viruses have two modes spread in a host body, one is to release infectious particles from infected cells (global infection) and the other is to infect directly from an infected cell to an adjacent cell (local infection). Since the mode of spread affects the evolution of life history traits, such as virulence, it is important to reveal what level of global and local infection is selected. Previous studies of the evolution of global and local infection have paid little attention to its dependency on the measures of spatial configuration. Here we show the evolutionarily stable proportion of global and local infection, and how it depends on the distribution of target cells. Using an epidemic model on a regular lattice, we consider the infection dynamics by pair approximation and check the evolutionarily stable strategy. We also conduct the Monte-Carlo simulation to observe evolutionary dynamics. We show that a higher local infection is selected as target cells become clustered. Surprisingly, the selected strategy depends not only on the degree of clustering but also the abundance of target cells per se.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QvuUxAMbOWQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Although gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) is generally regarded as an alternative biomarker for alcohol consumption, its independent role in vascular diseases emerged recently. However, its role in stroke remains unknown. The aim of this study is to clarify the impact of GGT on stroke in a large-sized, national, standardized population cohort in Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: In Korea, the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) provides full-coverage health insurance service for all citizens. Using data from the NHIS, the NHIS-National Sample Cohort (NHIS-NSC) was designed by randomly selecting 2% of Koreans, carefully considering demographic characteristics. We analyzed eligible individuals from this standardized cohort. The Cox proportional hazards model was used for the longitudinal study investigating the relationship between GGT and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Among the 456,100 eligible participants, 7,459 patients (1.64%) developed stroke as follows: 5,789 ischemic strokes, 1,046 intracerebral hemorrhages (ICHs), and 624 subarachnoid hemorrhages. GGT was independently correlated with increased risk of stroke after adjustment for alcohol consumption and stroke risk factors (hazard ratio (HR), 1.39; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.29–1.51). The risks of both ischemic stroke (HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.32–1.58) and ICH (HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.18–1.80) were significantly elevated with increasing GGT. Despite some effect modifications by sex, age and alcohol, the risk of total stroke and ischemic stroke in association with GGT remained significant in all subgroups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: In a standard Korean population, GGT was a novel biomarker predicting stroke risk, independently from alcohol consumption and other risk factors.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Pallidal deep brain stimulation modulates cortical excitability and plasticity</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25156</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Internal globus pallidus (GPi) deep brain stimulation (DBS) relieves symptoms in dystonia patients. However, the physiological effects produced by GPi DBS are not fully understood. In particular, how a single-pulse GPi DBS changes cortical circuits has never been investigated. We studied the modulation of motor cortical excitability and plasticity with single-pulse GPi DBS in dystonia patients with bilateral implantation of GPi DBS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: The cortical evoked potentials from DBS were recorded with electroencephalography. Transcranial magnetic stimulation with a conditioning-test paired-pulse paradigm was used to investigate the effect of GPi DBS on the primary motor cortex. How GPi DBS might modulate the motor cortical plasticity was tested using a paired associative stimulation paradigm with repetitive pairs of GPi DBS and motor cortical stimulation at specific time intervals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: GPi stimulation produced two peaks of cortical evoked potentials with latencies of ∼10 and ∼25 ms in the motor cortical area. Cortical facilitation was observed at ∼10 ms after single-pulse GPi DBS and cortical inhibition was observed at ∼25 ms interval. Repetitive pairs of GPi stimulation with cortical stimulation at these two time intervals produced long term potentiation-like effects in the motor cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Single-pulse DBS modulates cortical excitability and plasticity at specific time intervals. These effects may be related to the mechanism of action of DBS. Combination of DBS with cortical stimulation at appropriate timing has therapeutic potential and could be explored in the future as a method to enhance the effects of neuromodulation for neurological and psychiatric diseases.

&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess the association between incident Parkinson's disease (PD) and subsequent incident epileptic seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conducted a retrospective cohort study with a nested case-control analysis using data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink. We identified patients aged ≥40 years with an incident diagnosis of PD between 1995 and 2016 and a matched comparison group of PD-free individuals. We calculated crude incidence rates (IRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of epileptic seizures in PD patients and the PD-free comparison group, and corresponding crude incidence rate ratios (IRRs). In the nested case-control analysis, we calculated adjusted odds ratios (adj. ORs) of incident PD among cases with incident epileptic seizures and seizure-free controls overall and stratified by various, seizure-provoking comorbidities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among 23,086 incident PD patients and 92,343 PD-free individuals, we identified 898 patients with incident epileptic seizures. The crude IR of epileptic seizures in PD patients was 266.7/100,000 person years (95% CI 235.6-297.7), and in PD-free individuals 112.4/100,000 person years (95% CI 103.5-121.3) [IRR: 2.37, 95% CI 2.06-2.37]. The adj. OR of epileptic seizures was 1.68 [95% CI 1.43-1.98]) in PD patients compared with PD-free individuals. PD patients with comorbid brain disorders (adj. OR 12.36 [95% CI 8.74-17.48]) or with &amp;gt;1 seizure-provoking comorbidity (adj. OR 13.24 [95% CI 10.15-17.25]) were at the highest risk of epileptic seizures compared with PD-free individuals with no seizure-provoking comorbidities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study suggests that incident PD is associated with an increased risk of incident epileptic seizures. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Neutrophil hyperactivation correlates with Alzheimer's disease progression</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25159</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Recent studies have underlined the effect of systemic inflammation on the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. Neutrophils are key components of early innate immunity and contribute to uncontrolled systemic inflammation if not tightly regulated. The aim of our study was to fully characterize human circulating neutrophils at different disease stages in Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We analyzed neutrophil phenotypes and functions in forty-two patients with Alzheimer's disease (sixteen with mild cognitive impairment and twenty-six with dementia), and compared them with twenty-two age-matched healthy subjects. This study was performed directly in whole blood to avoid issues with data interpretation related to cell isolation procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Blood samples from Alzheimer's diseases patients with dementia revealed neutrophil hyperactivation associated with increased reactive oxygen species production and increased levels of intravascular neutrophil extravascular traps. The homeostasis of circulating neutrophils in these patients also changed: the ratio between the harmful hyperreactive CXCR4&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt;/CD62L&lt;sup&gt;low&lt;/sup&gt; senescent and the CD16&lt;sup&gt;bright&lt;/sup&gt;/CD62L&lt;sup&gt;dim&lt;/sup&gt; immunosuppressive neutrophil subsets rose in the later stage of the disease. These abnormalities were greater in fast-decliner than in slow-decliner patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Our results indicate that the inflammatory properties of circulating neutrophils shift as the percentage of aged neutrophils expands in patients with Alzheimer's disease — changes that may play an instrumental role in establishing systemic chronic inflammation. Most important, our data strongly suggest that the neutrophil phenotype may be associated with the rate of cognitive decline and may thus constitute an innovative and prognostic blood biomarker in patients with Alzheimer's disease.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Metallothioneins are Neuroprotective Agents in Lysosomal Storage Disorders</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25161</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Lysosomal Storage Disorders (LSDs) are a broad class of inherited metabolic diseases caused by the defective activity of lysosomal enzymes. Central nervous system (CNS) manifestations are present in roughly 50% of LSD patients and represent an unmet medical need for them. We explored the therapeutic potential of Metallothioneins (MTs), a newly identified family of proteins with reported neuroprotective roles, in the murine models of two LSDs with CNS involvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: MT-1 over-expressing transgenic mice (MTtg) were crossed with the murine models of Batten and Krabbe diseases. Changes in the survival and in the manifestations of the disease in the MTtg setting were assessed. In addition, we analyzed the therapeutic effects of MT-1 CNS gene delivery in one of these LSD models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Constitutive expression of MT-1 exerted favorable phenotypic effects in both LSD models. MT-LSD mice showed a 5-10% increase in survival and slower disease progression as compared to not-transgenic LSD mice. Rescue of Purkinje cells from degeneration and apoptosis was also observed in the MT- LSD models. This phenotypic amelioration was accompanied by a modulation of the disease-associated activated inflammatory microglia phenotype, and by a reduction of oxidative stress. Importantly for the clinical translation of our findings, the very same effects were obtained when MTs were delivered to the brains by systemic AAV gene transfer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: MTs can be considered novel therapeutic agents (and targets) in LSDs and potentiate the effects of approaches aiming at correction of the disease-causing enzyme deficiency in the CNS.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Expression profiling suggests microglial impairment in HIV neuropathogenesis</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25160</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: CD16&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CD163&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; macrophages (MΦ)s and microglia accumulate in the brains of patients with HIV encephalitis (HIVE), a neuropathological correlate of the most severe form of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), HIV-associated dementia (HIV-D). Recently, we found that some parenchymal microglia in brain of HIV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; subjects without encephalitis (HIV/noE) but with varying degrees of neurocognitive impairment express CD16 and CD163, even in the absence of detectable virus production. To further our understanding of microglial activation in HIV, we investigated expression of specific genes by profiling parenchymal microglia from archival brain tissue of patients with HIVE, HIV/noE, and HIV&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Single-population microarray analyses were performed on ∼2,500 laser capture microdissected CD163&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, CD16&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or CD68&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; MΦs/microglia per case, using terminal continuation (TC) RNA amplification and a custom-designed array platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Several classes of microglial transcripts in HIVE and HIV/noE, were altered, relative to HIV&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; subjects, including factors related to cell stress, immune activation, and apoptosis. Additionally, several neurotrophic factors are reduced in HIV infection, suggesting an additional mechanism of neuropathogenesis. The majority of transcripts altered in HIVE displayed intermediate changes in HIV/noE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Our results support the notion that microglia contribute to the maintenance of brain homeostasis and their potential loss of function in the context of chronic inflammation contributes to neuropathogenesis. Furthermore, they indicate the utility of profiling MΦs/microglia to increase our understanding of microglia function, as well as ascertain alterations in specific pathways, genes, and, ostensibly, encoded proteins that may be amenable to targeted treatment modalities in diseases affecting the brain.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Neuromodulation Influences Synchronization and Intrinsic Read-out. (arXiv:q-bio/0507037v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0507037</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The roles of neuromodulation in a neural network, such as in a cortical
microcolumn, are still incompletely understood. Neuromodulation influences
neural processing by presynaptic and postsynaptic regulation of synaptic
efficacy. Synaptic efficacy modulation can be an effective way to rapidly alter
network density and topology. We show that altering network topology, together
with density, will affect its synchronization. Fast synaptic efficacy
modulation may therefore influence the amount of correlated spiking in a
network. Neuromodulation also affects ion channel regulation for intrinsic
excitability, which alters the neuron's activation function. We show that
synchronization in a network influences the read-out of these intrinsic
properties. Highly synchronous input drives neurons, such that differences in
intrinsic properties disappear, while asynchronous input lets intrinsic
properties determine output behavior. Thus, altering network topology can alter
the balance between intrinsically vs. synaptically driven network activity. We
conclude that neuromodulation may allow a network to shift between a more
synchronized transmission mode and a more asynchronous intrinsic read-out mode.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Psychlab is a simulated psychology laboratory inside the first-person 3D game
world of DeepMind Lab (Beattie et al. 2016). Psychlab enables implementations
of classical laboratory psychological experiments so that they work with both
human and artificial agents. Psychlab has a simple and flexible API that
enables users to easily create their own tasks. As examples, we are releasing
Psychlab implementations of several classical experimental paradigms including
visual search, change detection, random dot motion discrimination, and multiple
object tracking. We also contribute a study of the visual psychophysics of a
specific state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning agent: UNREAL (Jaderberg
et al. 2016). This study leads to the surprising conclusion that UNREAL learns
more quickly about larger target stimuli than it does about smaller stimuli. In
turn, this insight motivates a specific improvement in the form of a simple
model of foveal vision that turns out to significantly boost UNREAL's
performance, both on Psychlab tasks, and on standard DeepMind Lab tasks. By
open-sourcing Psychlab we hope to facilitate a range of future such studies
that simultaneously advance deep reinforcement learning and improve its links
with cognitive science.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the central nervous systems of animals like pigeons and locusts, neurons
were identified which signal objects approaching the animal on a direct
collision course. Unraveling the neural circuitry for collision avoidance, and
identifying the underlying computational principles, is promising for building
vision-based neuromorphic architectures, which in the near future could find
applications in cars or planes. At the present there is no published model
available for robust detection of approaching objects under real-world
conditions. Here we present a computational architecture for signalling
impending collisions, based on known anatomical data of the locust \emph{lobula
giant movement detector} (LGMD) neuron. Our model shows robust performance even
in adverse situations, such as with approaching low-contrast objects, or with
highly textured and moving backgrounds. We furthermore discuss which components
need to be added to our model to convert it into a full-fledged
real-world-environment collision detector. KEYWORDS: Locust, LGMD, collision

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Fractal analyses of networks of integrate-and-fire stochastic spiking neurons. (arXiv:1801.08087v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.08087</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Although there is increasing evidence of criticality in the brain, the
processes that guide neuronal networks to reach or maintain criticality remain
unclear. The present research examines the role of neuronal gain plasticity in
time-series of simulated neuronal networks composed of integrate-and-fire
stochastic spiking neurons, and the utility of fractal methods in assessing
network criticality. Simulated time-series were derived from a network model of
fully connected discrete-time stochastic excitable neurons. Monofractal and
multifractal analyses were applied to neuronal gain time-series. Fractal
scaling was greatest in networks with a mid-range of neuronal plasticity,
versus extremely high or low levels of plasticity. Peak fractal scaling
corresponded closely to additional indices of criticality, including average
branching ratio. Networks exhibited multifractal structure, or multiple scaling
relationships. Multifractal spectra around peak criticality exhibited elongated
right tails, suggesting that the fractal structure is relatively insensitive to
high-amplitude local fluctuations. Networks near critical states exhibited
mid-range multifractal spectra width and tail length, which is consistent with
literature suggesting that networks poised at quasi-critical states must be
stable enough to maintain organization but unstable enough to be adaptable.
Lastly, fractal analyses may offer additional information about critical state
dynamics of networks by indicating scales of influence as networks approach
critical states.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07938</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the mechanisms of neural communication in large-scale brain
networks remains a major goal in neuroscience. We investigated whether
navigation is a parsimonious routing model for connectomics. Navigating a
network involves progressing to the next node that is closest in distance to a
desired destination. We developed a measure to quantify navigation efficiency
and found that connectomes in a range of mammalian species (human, mouse and
macaque) can be successfully navigated with near-optimal efficiency (&amp;gt;80% of
optimal efficiency for typical connection densities). Rewiring network topology
or repositioning network nodes resulted in 45%-60% reductions in navigation
performance. Specifically, we found that brain networks cannot be progressively
rewired (randomized or clusterized) to result in topologies with significantly
improved navigation performance. Navigation was also found to: i) promote a
resource-efficient distribution of the information traffic load, potentially
relieving communication bottlenecks; and, ii) explain significant variation in
functional connectivity. Unlike prevalently studied communication strategies in
connectomics, navigation does not mandate biologically unrealistic assumptions
about global knowledge of network topology. We conclude that the wiring and
spatial embedding of brain networks is conducive to effective decentralized
communication. Graph-theoretic studies of the connectome should consider
measures of network efficiency and centrality that are consistent with
decentralized models of neural communication.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07936</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is a neurological disorder arising from anomalies of the electrical
activity in the brain, affecting about 0.5--0.8\% of the world population.
Several studies investigated the relationship between seizures and brainwave
synchronization patterns, pursuing the possibility of identifying interictal,
preictal, ictal and postictal states. In this work, we introduce a graph-based
model of the brain interactions developed to study synchronization patterns in
the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The aim is to develop a
patient-specific approach, also for a real-time use, for the prediction of
epileptic seizures' occurrences. Different synchronization measures of the EEG
signals and easily computable functions able to capture in real-time the
variations of EEG synchronization have been considered. Both standard and
ad-hoc classification algorithms have been developed and used. Results on scalp
EEG signals show that this simple and computationally viable processing is able
to highlight the changes in the synchronization corresponding to the preictal
state.

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Extracellular recording studies have revealed diverse and selective neural responses in the primary auditory cortex (A1) of awake animals. However, we have limited knowledge on subthreshold events that give rise to these responses, especially in non-human primates, as intracellular recordings in awake animals pose substantial technical challenges. We developed a novel intracellular recording technique in awake marmosets to systematically study subthreshold activity of A1 neurons that underlies their diverse and selective spiking responses. Our findings showed that in contrast to predominantly transient depolarization observed in A1 of anesthetized animals, both transient and sustained depolarization (during or beyond the stimulus period) were observed. Comparing with spiking responses, subthreshold responses were often longer lasting in duration and more broadly tuned in frequency, and showed narrower intensity tuning in non-monotonic neurons and lower response threshold in monotonic neurons. These observations demonstrated the enhancement of stimulus selectivity from subthreshold to spiking responses in individual A1 neurons. Furthermore, A1 neurons classified as regular- or fast-spiking subpopulation based on their spike shapes exhibited distinct response properties in frequency and intensity domains. These findings provide valuable insights into cortical integration and transformation of auditory information at the cellular level in auditory cortex of awake non-human primates.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Genetic Influences on the Development of Cerebral Cortical Thickness During Childhood and Adolescence in a Dutch Longitudinal Twin Sample: The Brainscale Study</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Previous studies have demonstrated that cortical thickness (CT) is under strong genetic control across the life span. However, little is known about genetic influences that cause changes in cortical thickness (ΔCT) during brain development. We obtained 482 longitudinal MRI scans at ages 9, 12, and 17 years from 215 twins and applied structural equation modeling to estimate genetic influences on (1) cortical thickness between regions and across time, and (2) changes in cortical thickness between ages. Although cortical thickness is largely mediated by the same genetic factor throughout late childhood and adolescence, we found evidence for influences of distinct genetic factors on regions across space and time. In addition, we found genetic influences for cortical thinning during adolescence that is mostly due to fluctuating influences from the same genetic factor, with evidence of local influences from a second emerging genetic factor. This fluctuating core genetic factor and emerging novel genetic factor might be implicated in the rapid cognitive and behavioral development during childhood and adolescence, and could potentially be targets for investigation into the manifestation of psychiatric disorders that have their origin in childhood and adolescence.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Prior work shows that both surface area (SA) and cortical thickness (CT) are heritable. However, we do not yet understand the extent to which region-specific genetic factors (i.e., independent of global effects) play a dominant role in the regional patterning or inter-regional associations across the cortex. Using a population sample of young adult twins (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 923), we show that the heritability of SA and CT varies widely across regions, generally independent of measurement error. When global effects are controlled for, we detected a complex pattern of genetically mediated clusters of inter-regional associations, which varied between hemispheres. There were generally weak associations between the SA of different regions, except within the occipital lobe, whereas CT was positively correlated within lobar divisions and negatively correlated across lobes, mostly due to genetic covariation. These findings were replicated in an independent sample of twins and siblings (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 698) from the Human Connectome Project. The different genetic contributions to SA and CT across regions reveal the value of quantifying sources of covariation to appreciate the genetic complexity of cortical structures.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Functional gradients of the cerebellum: a fundamental movement-to-thought principle</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/254326v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>A central principle for understanding the cerebral cortex is that macroscale anatomy reflects a functional hierarchy from primary to transmodal processing. In contrast, the central axis of motor and nonmotor macroscale organization in the cerebellum remains unknown. Here we applied diffusion map embedding to resting-state data from the Human Connectome Project dataset (n=1003), and show for the first time that cerebellar functional regions follow a gradual organization which progresses from primary (motor) to transmodal (DMN, task-unfocused) regions. A secondary axis extends from task-unfocused to task-focused processing. Further, these two principal gradients reveal functional properties of the well-established cerebellar double motor representation, and its relationship with the recently described triple nonmotor representation. These interpretations are further supported by data-driven clustering and cerebello-cerebral functional connectivity analyses. Importantly, these descriptions remain observable at the individual subject level. These findings, from an exceptionally large and high-quality dataset, provide new and fundamental insights into the functional organization of the human cerebellum, unmask new testable hypotheses for future studies, and yield an unprecedented tool for the topographical, macroscale interpretation of cerebellar findings.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Acute antidepressant effect of ayahuasca in juvenile non-human primate model of depression.</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/254268v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The incidence of major depression in adolescents, aged between 15 to 18 years, reaches approximately 14%. Usually, this disorder presents a recurrent way, without remission of symptoms even after several pharmacological treatments, persisting through adult life. Due to the relatively low efficacy of commercially available antidepressant, new pharmacological therapies are under continuous exploration. Recent evidence suggests that classic psychedelics, such as ayahuasca, produce rapid and robust antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant depression patients. In this study, we evaluated the potential of antidepressant effects of ayahuasca in a juvenile model of depression in a non-human primate, common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). The model induces depressive-like symptoms by chronic social isolation (60 days) and antidepressant effects monitoring included fecal cortisol, body weight, and behavioral parameters. The animals presented hypocortisolemia and the recovery of cortisol to baseline levels started already at 24h after the ingestion of ayahuasca, but not the vehicle. Moreover, in males, ayahuasca, and not the vehicle, reduced the scratching, a stereotypic behavior, and increased the feeding. Ayahuasca also improving body weight to baseline levels in male and female common marmosets. The behavioral response induced by ayahuasca shows long effect, lasting 14 days. Therefore, for this translational animal model of juvenile depression, it could be proposed that ayahuasca treatment presented more notable antidepressant effects than tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline, investigated by our group, using this same protocol in an anterior study. Ayahuasca produced faster and more durable effect on reversion of physiological changes and depressive-like symptoms. Therefore, the results found for ayahuasca treatment corroborates in the validation of this substance as an effective antidepressant drug and encourages the return of studies with psychedelic drugs in the treatment of humor disorders, including adolescents with early-age depression. Keywords: translational animal model, non-human primate, common marmoset, behaviors, cortisol, early-age depression, psychedelic drugs.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/254110v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Delineation of functional topography is critical to the evolving understanding of the cerebellum's role in a wide range of nervous system functions. We used data from the Human Connectome Project (n=787) to analyze cerebellar fMRI task activation (motor, working memory, language, social and emotion processing) and resting-state functional connectivity calculated from cerebral cortical seeds corresponding to the peak Cohen's d of each task contrast. The combination of exceptional statistical power, activation from both motor and multiple non-motor tasks in the same participants, and convergent resting-state networks in the same participants revealed novel aspects of the functional topography of the human cerebellum. Consistent with prior studies there were two distinct representations of motor activation. Newly revealed were three distinct representations each for working memory, language, social, and emotional task processing that were largely separate for these four cognitive and affective domains. In most cases, the task-based activations and the corresponding resting-network correlations were congruent in identifying the two motor representations and the three non-motor representations that were unique to working memory, language, social cognition, and emotion. The definitive localization and characterization of distinct triple representations for cognition and emotion task processing in the cerebellum opens up new basic science questions as to why there are triple representations (what different functions are enabled by the different representations?) and new clinical questions (what are the differing consequences of lesions to the different representations?).</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Understanding the role of alterations in cortical D1 receptor sensitivity in shaping working memory maintenance through mesocortical dynamics</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/253948v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The dopamine (DA) hypothesis of cognitive deficits suggests that too low or too high extracellular DA concentration in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) can severely impair the working memory (WM) maintenance during delay period. Thus, there exists only an optimal range of DA where the sustained-firing activity, the neural correlate of WM maintenance, in the cortex possesses optimal firing frequency as well as robustness against noisy distractions. Empirical evidences demonstrate changes even in the D1 receptor (D1R)-sensitivity to extracellular DA, collectively manifested through D1R density and DA-binding affinity, in the PFC under neuropsychiatric conditions such as ageing and schizophrenia. However, the impact of alterations in the cortical D1R-sensitivity on WM maintenance has yet remained poorly addressed. Using a quantitative neural mass model of the prefronto-mesoprefrontal system, the present study reveals that higher D1R-sensitivity may not only effectuate shrunk optimal DA range but also shift of the range to lower concentrations. Moreover, higher sensitivity may significantly reduce the WM-robustness even within the optimal DA range and exacerbates the decline at abnormal DA levels. These findings project important clinical implications, such as dosage precision and variability of DA-correcting drugs across patients, and failure in acquiring healthy WM maintenance even under drug-controlled normal cortical DA levels.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/253831v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Efficacious neuronal inhibition is sustained by the neuronal K+Cl- co-transporter KCC2, and loss of KCC2 function through injury or mutation is associated with altered GABAergic signalling and neuronal seizures. Here we report a transgenic mouse with conditional KCC2 overexpression that results in increased membrane transport function. Increased KCC2 has little impact on behavioural and in vitro assays of neuronal excitability and GABAA receptor responses under resting conditions. In contrast, increased KCC2 imparts resistance to seizure-like neuronal activity in hippocampal slices and prevents the progression of mice into behavioural status epilepticus following multiple kainic acid doses. Our results demonstrate a transgenic mouse to facilitate investigations into the role of KCC2 in brain function, and provide a proof of principle that targeting KCC2 may be an effective way to selectively enhance neuronal inhibition to mitigate against diseases that involve an imbalance between excitation and inhibition.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/253740v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The attentional sampling hypothesis suggests attention periodically enhances sensory processing. We investigated whether periodic sampling also acts as a gateway for attended stimuli competing for perceptual dominance. Here we report that during binocular rivalry crossmodal cues directed towards perceptually dominant stimuli resulted in an ~8 Hz attentional sampling rate, consistent with undivided attention. Conversely, crossmodal cues directed towards perceptually suppressed visual images resulted in an ~3.5 Hz attentional sampling rate, indicating that attentional sampling can be divided away from a conscious visual image. At these attentional sampling frequencies, the strength of inter-trial phase coherence over lateral-occipital and fronto-temporal cortex correlated with behavioral measures of changes in conscious perception, suggesting this mechanism acted to bind crossmodal stimuli into a single perceptual object. When crossmodal cues were not task-relevant, these effects disappeared, confirming that changes in conscious perception were dependent upon the allocation of attention, which flexibly samples stimuli in a task-dependent manner.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/253641v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>When making choices, collecting more information is beneficial but comes at the cost of sacrificing time that could be allocated to making other potentially rewarding decisions. To investigate how the brain balances these costs and benefits, we conducted a series of novel experiments in humans and simulated various computational models. Under six levels of time pressure, subjects made decisions either by integrating sensory information over time or by dynamically combining sensory and reward information over time. We found that during sensory integration, time pressure reduced performance as the deadline approached, and choice was more strongly influenced by the most recent sensory evidence. By fitting performance and reaction time with various models we found that our experimental results are more compatible with leaky integration of sensory information with an urgency signal or a decision process based on stochastic transitions between discrete states modulated by an urgency signal. When combining sensory and reward information, subjects spent less time on integration than optimally prescribed when reward decreased slowly over time, and the most recent evidence did not have the maximal influence on choice. The suboptimal pattern of reaction time was partially mitigated in an equivalent control experiment in which sensory integration over time was not required, indicating that the suboptimal response time was influenced by the perception of imperfect sensory integration. Meanwhile, during combination of sensory and reward information, performance did not drop as the deadline approached, and response time was not different between correct and incorrect trials. These results indicate a decision process different from what is involved in the integration of sensory information over time. Together, our results not only reveal limitations in sensory integration over time but also illustrate how these limitations influence dynamic combination of sensory and reward information.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/253468v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The perception of gender and age of unfamiliar faces is reported to vary idiosyncratically across retinal locations such that, for example, the same androgynous face may appear to be male at one location but female at another. Here we test spatial heterogeneity for the recognition of the identity of personally familiar faces. We found idiosyncratic biases that were stable within subjects and that varied more across locations for low as compared to high familiar faces. These data suggest that like face gender and age, face identity is processed, in part, by independent populations of neurons monitoring restricted spatial regions and that the recognition responses vary for the same face across these different locations. Moreover, repeated exposure to the same face in different portions of the visual field due to repeated and varied social interactions appears to lead to adjustment of these independent face recognition neurons so that the same familiar face is eventually more likely to elicit the same recognition response across widely separated regions.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/253393v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Many of our everyday decisions are based not only on memories of direct experiences, but on memories that are integrated across multiple distinct experiences. Sometimes memory integration between existing memories and newly learnt information occurs rapidly, without requiring inference at the time of a decision. Such fast memory integration is known to be supported by the hippocampus but not the neocortex. In this study, we explore an alternative mechanism of fast memory integration, through related prior knowledge (i.e., schema), which is associated with neocortical learning. Paired associates were selected to be schema consistent or inconsistent, and confirmed with a latent semantic analysis of text corpora. We observed that after enabling fast learning by using material that is consistent with a schema, faster memory integration can occur. This result suggests that the hippocampus-mediated integration of new information is not the only available mechanism that supports fast memory integration.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/253328v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Planning an accurate reach involves the transformation of the neural representation of target location in sensory coordinates into a command for hand motion in motor coordinates. Although imaging techniques such as fMRI reveal the cortical topography of such transformations, and neurophysiological recordings provide local dynamics, we do not yet know the real-time dynamics of sensorimotor transformations at the whole brain level. We used high spatiotemporal resolution magnetoencephalography (MEG) during a pro-/anti-reaching task to determine (1) which brain areas are involved in transforming visual signals into appropriate motor commands for the arm, and (2) how this transformation occurs on a millisecond time scale, both within and across the regions involved. We performed time-frequency response analysis and identified 16 bilateral brain regions using adaptive hierarchical clustering (Alikhanian et al. 2013). We then computed sensory, motor, and sensorimotor indices for direction coding based on hemispherically lateralized de/synchronization in the alpha (7-15Hz) and beta (15-35Hz) bands. Importantly, we found a visuomotor progression both within and across these areas, from pure sensory codes in some early areas (V1/2, V3/3a and SPL), to a temporal transition from sensory to motor coding in the majority of parietal-frontal areas (SPOC, AG, POJ, mIPS, VIP, IPL, STS, S1, M1, SMA, PMd and FEF), to a pure motor code (PMv only), in both the alpha and beta bands. Further, the timing of these transformations revealed a pro/anti cue influence that proceeded from frontal to posterior cortex. These data directly demonstrate a progressive, real-time transformation both within and across the entire occipital-parietal-frontal reach network that follows specific rules of spatial distribution and temporal order.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Sex-specific impact of prenatal androgens on intrinsic functional connectivity between social brain default mode subsystems</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/253310v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Many early-onset neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism affect males more frequently than females and affect corresponding domains such as social cognition, social-communication, language, emotion, and reward. Testosterone is well-known for its role as a sex-related biological mechanism and affects these conditions and domains of functioning. Developmentally, testosterone may sex-differentially impact early fetal brain development by influencing early neuronal development and synaptic mechanisms behind cortical circuit formation, particularly for circuits that later develop specialized roles in such cognitive domains. Here we find that variation in fetal testosterone (FT) exerts sex-specific effects on later adolescent functional connectivity between social brain default mode network (DMN) subsystems. Increased FT is associated with dampening of functional connectivity between DMN subsystems in adolescent males, but has no effect in females. To isolate specific prenatal neurobiological mechanisms behind this effect, we examined changes in gene expression identified following a treatment with a potent androgen, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in an in-vitro model of human neural stem cell (hNSC). We previously showed that DHT-dysregulates genes enriched with known syndromic causes for autism and intellectual disability. DHT dysregulates genes in hNSCs involved in early neurodevelopmental processes such as neurogenesis, cell differentiation, regionalization, and pattern specification. A significant number of these DHT-dysregulated genes shows spatial expression patterns in the adult brain that highly correspond to the spatial layout of the cortical midline DMN subsystem. These DMN-related and DHT-affected genes (e.g., MEF2C) are involved in a number of synaptic processes, many of which impact excitation/inhibition imbalance. Focusing on MEF2C, we find replicable upregulation of expression after DHT treatment as well as dysregulated expression in induced pluripotent stem cells and neurons of individuals with autism. This work highlights sex-specific prenatal androgen influence on social brain DMN circuitry and autism-related mechanisms and suggests that such influence may impact early neurodevelopmental processes (e.g., neurogenesis, cell differentiation) and later developing synaptic processes.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Online educational materials are largely disseminated through videos, and yet there is little understanding of how these videos engage students and fuel academic success. We hypothesized that components of the electroencephalogram (EEG), previously shown to reflect video engagement, would be predictive of academic performance in the context of educational videos. Two groups of subjects watched educational videos in either an intentional learning paradigm, in which they were aware of an upcoming test, or in an incidental learning paradigm, in which they were unaware that they would be tested. Neural engagement was quantified by the inter-subject correlation of the EEG that was evoked by the videos. In both groups, students with higher neural engagement retained more information. Neural engagement also discriminated between attentive and inattentive video viewing. These results suggest that this EEG metric is a marker of the stimulus-related attentional mechanisms necessary to retain information. In the future, EEG may be used as a tool to design and assess online educational content.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/253138v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Estimating the effort someone has spent on a task is a core dimension for evaluating own and others actions. Interestingly, it has been shown that self-judgments of effort are influenced by the magnitude of obtained rewards (Pooresmaeili et al., 2015). However, it is unclear whether the influence of reward on effort estimations is limited to self-judgments (i.e. a form of self-serving bias) or whether reward information is invariably incorporated when judging effort, thus extending also to social contexts. Here we show that people also integrate reward magnitude when judging the effort exerted by another person. Participants (N=48, 24 pairs) performed an effortful task interleaved with a partner. In half of the trials, participants performed the task themselves and rated their own effort. In the other half, participants rated the other persons effort after watching them performing the task. After each trial but before the effort rating, both participants were informed of the gained reward for that trial. Our results show that higher rewards led to higher estimations of exerted effort. Importantly, this was true for self- as well as other-judgments. In line with a Bayesian cue integration framework, reward magnitude had a stronger effect when judging the effort of another person, compared to self-judgments, since people should have more reliable internal estimates of own effort. Supporting this claim, computational modelling revealed that reward information and objective performance criteria related to the exertion level were combined in a Bayes optimal manner to form effort estimates. Interestingly, the extent to which rewards influenced effort judgments was positively correlated with conservative world-views, suggesting links between this effect and broader social attitudes.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/253054v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic responses is essential for hippocampal memory function. Perforant-path (PP) synapses on hippocampal granule cells (GCs) contribute to the formation of associative memories, which are considered the cellular correlates of memory engrams. However, the mechanisms of LTP at these synapses are not well understood. Due to sparse firing activity and the voltage attenuation in their dendrites, it remains unclear how associative LTP at distal synapses occurs. Here we show that NMDA receptor-dependent LTP can be induced at PP-GC synapses without backpropagating action potentials (bAPs) in acute rat brain slices. Dendritic recordings reveal substantial attenuation of bAPs as well as local dendritic Na+-spike generation during PP-GC input. Inhibition of Na+-spikes impairs LTP suggesting that LTP at PP-GC synapse requires local Na+-spikes. Thus, dendritic spikes are essential for LTP induction at PP-GC synapse and may constitute a key cellular mechanism for memory formation in the dentate gyrus.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Large-scale two-photon imaging revealed super-sparse population codes in V1 superficial layer of awake monkeys</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/252940v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Efficient coding has been proposed as a general principle for sensory systems. The efficient coding hypothesis predicts that neuronal population responses should be sparse, but limited by the measurement techniques, the precise estimates of the population sparseness of visual cortical neurons are still uncertain. Here, we employed large-scale two-photon calcium imaging to examine the neuronal population activities in V1 superficial layers of awake macaques in response to a large set of natural images. We found that only 0.5% of these neurons on average responded strongly to any given natural image with response strength above half of their individual peak responses, which is more than tenfold sparse over those reported by early studies. We further showed that these sparse population activities contain sufficient information for discriminating images with high accuracy. This study provided the first accurate measure of sparseness in V1 neuronal population responses, which support super-sparse neural codes in primates.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Noradrenaline modulates decision urgency during sequential information gathering</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/252932v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Arbitrating between timely choice and extended information gathering is critical in effective decision making. Aberrant information gathering behaviour is said to be a feature of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder. We know little about the neurocognitive control mechanisms that drive such information gathering. In a double-blind placebo-controlled drug study with 60 healthy humans (30 female), we examined the effects of noradrenaline and dopamine antagonism on information gathering. We show that modulating noradrenaline function with propranolol leads to decreased information gathering behaviour and this contrasts with no effect following a modulation of dopamine function. Using a Bayesian computational model, we show sampling behaviour is best explained when including an urgency signal that promotes commitment to an early decision. We demonstrate that noradrenaline blockade promotes the expression of this decision-related urgency signal during information gathering. We discuss the findings with respect to psychopathological conditions that are linked to aberrant information gathering.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Structure, Asymmetry and Segmentation of the Human Parietal Aslant and Vertical Occipital Fasciculi</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/252825v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>We previously proposed a bipartite 'dorsal-ventral' model of human arcuate fasciculus (AF) morphology. This model does not, however, account for the 'vertical,' temporoparietal subdivision of the AF described in earlier dissection and tractographic studies. In an effort to address the absence of the vertical AF (VAF) within the 'dorsal-ventral' model, we conducted a dedicated tractographic and white-matter dissection study of this tract and another short, vertical, posterior-hemispheric fascicle: the vertical occipital fasciculus (VOF). We conducted atlas-based, non-tensor, deterministic tractography in 30 single subjects from the Human Connectome Project database and verified our results using an average diffusion atlas comprising 842 separate normal subjects. We also performed white-matter dissection in 4 cadaveric hemispheres. Our tractographic results demonstrate that the VAF is in fact a bipartite system connecting the ventral-parietal and ventral-temporal regions, with variable connective and no volumetric lateralization. The VOF is a non-lateralized, non-segmented system connecting lateral occipital areas with basal-temporal regions. Importantly, the VOF was distinctly dissociated from the VAF. As the VAF demonstrates no overall connective or volumetric lateralization, we postulate its distinction from the AF system and propose its re-naming to the 'parietal aslant tract,' (PAT) with unique dorsal and ventral subdivisions. Our tractography results were supported by diffusion atlas and white matter dissection findings.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/252205v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Miniaturized fluorescence microscopes for imaging calcium transients are a promising tool for investigating the relationship between behaviour and population-level neuronal activity in rodents. However, commercially available miniature microscopes may be costly, and, because they are closed-source, may not be easily modified based on particular experimental requirements. Here, we describe how to build and use a low-cost compact head-mounted endoscope (CHEndoscope) system for in vivo calcium imaging. The CHEndoscope uses an implanted gradient index (GRIN) lens along with the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6 to image calcium transients from hundreds of neurons simultaneously in awake behaving mice. This system is affordable, open-source, and flexible, permitting modification depending on the particular experiment. This Unit describes in detail the assembly, surgical implantation, data collection, and processing of calcium signals using the CHEndoscope system. The aim of this open framework model is to provide an accessible set of miniaturized calcium imaging tools for the neuroscience research community.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Predicting peak spectral sensitivities of vertebrate cone visual pigments using atomistic molecular simulations</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/zs0zKBCg8z8/article</link>

Vision is the dominant sensory modality in many organisms for foraging, predator avoidance, and social behaviors including mate selection. Vertebrate visual perception is initiated when light strikes rod and cone photoreceptors within the neural retina of the eye. Sensitivity to individual colors, i.e., peak spectral sensitivities (λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) of visual pigments, are a function of the type of chromophore and the amino acid sequence of the associated opsin protein in the photoreceptors. Large differences in peak spectral sensitivities can result from minor differences in amino acid sequence of cone opsins. To determine how minor sequence differences could result in large spectral shifts we selected a spectrally-diverse group of 14 teleost Rh2 cone opsins for which sequences and λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; are experimentally known. Classical molecular dynamics simulations were carried out after embedding chromophore-associated homology structures within explicit bilayers and water. These simulations revealed structural features of visual pigments, particularly within the chromophore, that contributed to diverged spectral sensitivities. Statistical tests performed on all the observed structural parameters associated with the chromophore revealed that a two-term, first-order regression model was sufficient to accurately predict λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; over a range of 452–528 nm. The approach was accurate, efficient and simple in that site-by-site molecular modifications or complex quantum mechanics models were not required to predict λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;. These studies identify structural features associated with the chromophore that may explain diverged spectral sensitivities, and provide a platform for future, functionally predictive opsin modeling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zs0zKBCg8z8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Membraneless organelles important to intracellular compartmentalization have recently been shown to comprise assemblies of proteins which undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). However, many proteins involved in this phase separation are at least partially disordered. The molecular mechanism and the sequence determinants of this process are challenging to determine experimentally owing to the disordered nature of the assemblies, motivating the use of theoretical and simulation methods. This work advances a computational framework for conducting simulations of LLPS with residue-level detail, and allows for the determination of phase diagrams and coexistence densities of proteins in the two phases. The model includes a short-range contact potential as well as a simplified treatment of electrostatic energy. Interaction parameters are optimized against experimentally determined radius of gyration data for multiple unfolded or intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). These models are applied to two systems which undergo LLPS: the low complexity domain of the RNA-binding protein FUS and the DEAD-box helicase protein LAF-1. We develop a novel simulation method to determine thermodynamic phase diagrams as a function of the total protein concentration and temperature. We show that the model is capable of capturing qualitative changes in the phase diagram due to phosphomimetic mutations of FUS and to the presence or absence of the large folded domain in LAF-1. We also explore the effects of chain-length, or multivalency, on the phase diagram, and obtain results consistent with Flory-Huggins theory for polymers. Most importantly, the methodology presented here is flexible so that it can be easily extended to other pair potentials, be used with other enhanced sampling methods, and may incorporate additional features for biological systems of interest.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0oaYFiuLVmE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

We hypothesize that when glycogen utilization cannot match synaptic energy demand, extracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; can rise to levels that activate neuronal pannexin-1 channels and downstream inflammatory pathway, which might be one of the mechanisms initiating migraine headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Six-hour SD induced pannexin-1 mRNA. DAB and SD also lowered the cortical spreading depression (CSD) induction threshold, which was reversed by glucose or lactate supplement, suggesting that glycogen-derived energy substrates are needed to prevent CSD generation. Supporting this, knocking down the neuronal lactate transporter MCT2 with an antisense oligonucleotide or inhibiting glucose transport from vessels to astrocytes with intracerebroventricularly delivered phloretin reduced the CSD threshold. In vivo recordings with a K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-sensitive/selective fluoroprobe, Asante Potassium Green-4, revealed that DAB treatment or SD caused a significant rise in extracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; during whisker stimulation, illustrating the critical role of glycogen in extracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; clearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Single muscle fibers with varying degrees of deficiency were selected from 6 patient biopsies for determination of mtDNA deletion level and copy number by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Single fiber analyses showed that fibers with greater respiratory chain deficiency harbored higher levels of mtDNA deletion with an increase in total mtDNA copy number. For the first time, we have demonstrated that threshold levels for complex I and complex IV deficiency differ based on deletion class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

These novel findings provide valuable insight into the pathogenic mechanisms associated with these mutations. Ann Neurol 2018;83:115–130&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

Rates of these markers and several combinations—spikes co-occurring with HFOs or FRs and cross-rate (Spk⊗HFO)—were compared to a quantified measure of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) by performing a receiver operating characteristic analysis for each patient individually.

To see how these antibodies interact with Caspr2, cultured rat hippocampal neurons were stained with antibodies against the Caspr2 protein on the cell surface (red) and with antibodies against the Caspr2 protein that can penetrate the cell (green). Nearly all of the stained protein is golden colored (overlap of red and green), indicating that it was stained with both antibodies because it was on the surface of the cell. Caspr2 antibodies may cause encephalitis by binding to nerve cells in the brain and blocking their cell surface interactions with other cells.

This study reports results at a 2- year follow-up after MRgFUS thalamotomy for ET.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25126-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 76 patients with moderate-to-severe ET, who had not responded to at least two trials of medical therapy, were enrolled in the original randomized study of unilateral thalamotomy and evaluated using the clinical rating scale for tremor. Sixty-seven of the patients continued in the open-label extension phase of the study with monitoring for 2 years. Nine patients were excluded by 2 years, for example, because of alternative therapy such as deep brain stimulation (n = 3) or inadequate thermal lesioning (n = 1). However, all patients in each follow-up period were analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25126-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mean hand tremor score at baseline (19.8 ± 4.9; 76 patients) improved by 55% at 6 months (8.6 ± 4.5; 75 patients). The improvement in tremor score from baseline was durable at 1 year (53%; 8.9 ± 4.8; 70 patients) and at 2 years (56%; 8.8 ± 5.0; 67 patients). Similarly, the disability score at baseline (16.4 ± 4.5; 76 patients) improved by 64% at 6 months (5.4 ± 4.7; 75 patients). This improvement was also sustained at 1 year (5.4 ± 5.3; 70 patients) and at 2 years (6.5 ± 5.0; 67 patients). Paresthesias and gait disturbances were the most common adverse effects at 1 year—each observed in 10 patients with an additional 5 patients experiencing neurological adverse effects. None of the adverse events worsened over the period of follow-up, and 2 of these resolved. There were no new delayed complications at 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Latent or delayed complications do not develop after treatment. Ann Neurol 2018;83:107–114&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monoclonal antibodies that target CD20 expressing B cells represent an important new treatment option for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). B-cell-depleting therapy is highly effective against relapsing forms of the disease and is also the first treatment approach proven to protect against disability worsening in primary progressive MS. Moreover, evolving clinical experience with B-cell therapy, combined with a more sophisticated understanding of humoral immunity in preclinical models and in patients with MS, has led to major progress in deciphering the immune pathogenesis of MS. Here, we review the nuanced roles of B cells in MS autoimmunity, the clinical data supporting use of ocrelizumab and other anti-CD20 therapies in the treatment of MS, as well as safety and practical considerations for prescribing. Last, we summarize remaining unanswered questions regarding the proper role of anti-CD20 therapy in MS, its limitations, and the future landscape of B-cell-based approaches to treatment.

Primary outcome was the association of prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) administration with hematoma enlargement. Subanalyses were calculated for blood pressure management and its association with the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include associations with in-hospital mortality and functional outcome at 3 months assessed using the modified Rankin Scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Hematoma enlargement occurred in 49/146 (33.6%) patients with NOAC-related ICH. Parameters associated with hematoma enlargement were blood pressure ≥ 160mmHg within 4 hours and—in the case of factor Xa inhibitor ICH—anti-Xa levels on admission. PCC administration prior to follow-up imaging was not significantly associated with a reduced rate of hematoma enlargement either in overall NOAC-related ICH or in patients with factor Xa inhibitor intake (NOAC: risk ratio [RR] = 1.150, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.632–2.090; factor Xa inhibitor: RR = 1.057, 95% CI = 0.565–1.977), regardless of PCC dosage given or time interval until imaging or treatment. Systolic blood pressure levels &amp;lt; 160mmHg within 4 hours after admission were significantly associated with a reduction in the proportion of patients with hematoma enlargement (RR = 0.598, 95% CI = 0.365–0.978). PCC administration had no effect on mortality and functional outcome either at discharge or at 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Disrupted sleep increases soluble amyloid β, suggesting a mechanism for sleep disturbances to increase Alzheimer disease risk. We tested this response in humans using indwelling lumbar catheters to serially sample cerebrospinal fluid while participants were sleep-deprived, treated with sodium oxybate, or allowed to sleep normally. All participants were infused with &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-leucine to measure amyloid β kinetics. We found that sleep deprivation increased overnight amyloid β38, amyloid β40, and amyloid β42 levels by 25 to 30% via increased overnight amyloid β production relative to sleeping controls.

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Unifying Motif for Spatial and Directional Surround Suppression</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/4/989?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the visual system, the response to a stimulus in a neuron's receptive field can be modulated by stimulus context, and the strength of these contextual influences vary with stimulus intensity. Recent work has shown how a theoretical model, the stabilized supralinear network (SSN), can account for such modulatory influences, using a small set of computational mechanisms. Although the predictions of the SSN have been confirmed in primary visual cortex (V1), its computational principles apply with equal validity to any cortical structure. We have therefore tested the generality of the SSN by examining modulatory influences in the middle temporal area (MT) of the macaque visual cortex, using electrophysiological recordings and pharmacological manipulations. We developed a novel stimulus that can be adjusted parametrically to be larger or smaller in the space of all possible motion directions. We found, as predicted by the SSN, that MT neurons integrate across motion directions for low-contrast stimuli, but that they exhibit suppression by the same stimuli when they are high in contrast. These results are analogous to those found in visual cortex when stimulus size is varied in the space domain. We further tested the mechanisms of inhibition using pharmacological manipulations of inhibitory efficacy. As predicted by the SSN, local manipulation of inhibitory strength altered firing rates, but did not change the strength of surround suppression. These results are consistent with the idea that the SSN can account for modulatory influences along different stimulus dimensions and in different cortical areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Visual neurons are selective for specific stimulus features in a region of visual space known as the receptive field, but can be modulated by stimuli outside of the receptive field. The SSN model has been proposed to account for these and other modulatory influences, and tested in V1. As this model is not specific to any particular stimulus feature or brain region, we wondered whether similar modulatory influences might be observed for other stimulus dimensions and other regions. We tested for specific patterns of modulatory influences in the domain of motion direction, using electrophysiological recordings from MT. Our data confirm the predictions of the SSN in MT, suggesting that the SSN computations might be a generic feature of sensory cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Computational Account of Optimizing Social Predictions Reveals That Adolescents Are Conservative Learners in Social Contexts</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/4/974?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As adolescents transition to the complex world of adults, optimizing predictions about others' preferences becomes vital for successful social interactions. Mounting evidence suggests that these social learning processes are affected by ongoing brain development across adolescence. A mechanistic understanding of how adolescents optimize social predictions and how these learning strategies are implemented in the brain is lacking. To fill this gap, we combined computational modeling with functional neuroimaging. In a novel social learning task, male and female human adolescents and adults predicted the preferences of peers and could update their predictions based on trial-by-trial feedback about the peers' actual preferences. Participants also rated their own preferences for the task items and similar additional items. To describe how participants optimize their inferences over time, we pitted simple reinforcement learning models against more specific &quot;combination&quot; models, which describe inferences based on a combination of reinforcement learning from past feedback and participants' own preferences. Formal model comparison revealed that, of the tested models, combination models best described how adults and adolescents update predictions of others. Parameter estimates of the best-fitting model differed between age groups, with adolescents showing more conservative updating. This developmental difference was accompanied by a shift in encoding predictions and the errors thereof within the medial prefrontal and fusiform cortices. In the adolescent group, encoding of own preferences and prediction errors scaled with parent-reported social traits, which provides additional external validity for our learning task and the winning computational model. Our findings thus help to specify adolescent-specific social learning processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Adolescence is a unique developmental period of heightened awareness about other people. Here we probe the suitability of various computational models to describe how adolescents update their predictions of others' preferences. Within the tested model space, predictions of adults and adolescents are best described by the same learning model, but adolescents show more conservative updating. Compared with adults, brain activity of adolescents is modulated less by predictions themselves and more by prediction errors per se, and this relationship scales with adolescents' social traits. Our findings help specify social learning across adolescence and generate hypotheses about social dysfunctions in psychiatric populations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Causal Evidence for Learning-Dependent Frontal Lobe Contributions to Cognitive Control</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/4/962?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) plays a central role in the prioritization of sensory input based on task relevance. Such top-down control of perception is of fundamental importance in goal-directed behavior, but can also be costly when deployed excessively, necessitating a mechanism that regulates control engagement to align it with changing environmental demands. We have recently introduced the &quot;flexible control model&quot; (FCM), which explains this regulation as resulting from a self-adjusting reinforcement-learning mechanism that infers latent statistical structure in dynamic task environments to predict forthcoming states. From this perspective, LPFC-based control is engaged as a function of anticipated cognitive demand, a notion for which we previously obtained correlative neuroimaging evidence. Here, we put this hypothesis to a rigorous, causal test by combining the FCM with a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) intervention that transiently perturbed the LPFC. Human participants (male and female) completed a nonstationary version of the Stroop task with dynamically changing probabilities of conflict between task-relevant and task-irrelevant stimulus features. TMS was given on each trial before stimulus onset either over the LPFC or over a control site. In the control condition, we observed adaptive performance fluctuations consistent with demand predictions that were inferred from recent and remote trial history and effectively captured by our model. Critically, TMS over the LPFC eliminated these fluctuations while leaving basic cognitive and motor functions intact. These results provide causal evidence for a learning-based account of cognitive control and delineate the nature of the signals that regulate top-down biases over stimulus processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; A core function of the human prefrontal cortex is to control the signal flow in sensory brain regions to prioritize processing of task-relevant information. Abundant work suggests that such control is flexibly recruited to accommodate dynamically changing environmental demands, yet the nature of the signals that serve to engage control remains unknown. Here, we combined computational modeling with noninvasive brain stimulation to show that changes in control engagement are captured by a self-adjusting reinforcement-learning mechanism that tracks changing environmental statistics to predict forthcoming processing demands and that transient perturbation of the prefrontal cortex abolishes these adjustments. These findings delineate the learning signals that underpin adaptive engagement of prefrontal control functions and provide causal evidence for their relevance in behavioral control.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neuronal Glutamate Transporters Control Dopaminergic Signaling and Compulsive Behaviors</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/4/937?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There is an ongoing debate on the contribution of the neuronal glutamate transporter EAAC1 to the onset of compulsive behaviors. Here, we used behavioral, electrophysiological, molecular, and viral approaches in male and female mice to identify the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which EAAC1 controls the execution of repeated motor behaviors. Our findings show that, in the striatum, a brain region implicated with movement execution, EAAC1 limits group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluRI) activation, facilitates D1 dopamine receptor (D1R) expression, and ensures long-term synaptic plasticity. Blocking mGluRI in slices from mice lacking EAAC1 restores D1R expression and synaptic plasticity. Conversely, activation of intracellular signaling pathways coupled to mGluRI in D1R-containing striatal neurons of mice expressing EAAC1 leads to reduced D1R protein level and increased stereotyped movement execution. These findings identify new molecular mechanisms by which EAAC1 can shape glutamatergic and dopaminergic signals and control repeated movement execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Genetic studies implicate &lt;i&gt;Slc1a1&lt;/i&gt;, a gene encoding the neuronal glutamate transporter EAAC1, with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). EAAC1 is abundantly expressed in the striatum, a brain region that is hyperactive in OCD. What remains unknown is how EAAC1 shapes synaptic function in the striatum. Our findings show that EAAC1 limits activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRIs) in the striatum and, by doing so, promotes D1 dopamine receptor (D1R) expression. Targeted activation of signaling cascades coupled to mGluRIs in mice expressing EAAC1 reduces D1R expression and triggers repeated motor behaviors. These findings provide new information on the molecular basis of OCD and suggest new avenues for its treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Common Pathophysiology in Multiple Mouse Models of Pitt-Hopkins Syndrome</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/4/918?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mutations or deletions of the transcription factor &lt;i&gt;TCF4&lt;/i&gt; are linked to Pitt–Hopkins syndrome (PTHS) and schizophrenia, suggesting that the precise pathogenic mutations dictate cellular, synaptic, and behavioral consequences. Here, we generated two novel mouse models of PTHS, one that mimics the most common pathogenic &lt;i&gt;TCF4&lt;/i&gt; point mutation (human R580W, mouse R579W) and one that deletes three pathogenic arginines, and explored phenotypes of these lines alongside models of pan-cellular or CNS-specific heterozygous &lt;i&gt;Tcf4&lt;/i&gt; disruption. We used mice of both sexes to show that impaired &lt;i&gt;Tcf4&lt;/i&gt; function results in consistent microcephaly, hyperactivity, reduced anxiety, and deficient spatial learning. All four PTHS mouse models demonstrated exaggerated hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), consistent with deficits in hippocampus-mediated behaviors. We further examined R579W mutant mice and mice with pan-cellular &lt;i&gt;Tcf4&lt;/i&gt; heterozygosity and found that they exhibited hippocampal NMDA receptor hyperfunction, which likely drives the enhanced LTP. Together, our data pinpoint convergent neurobiological features in PTHS mouse models and provide a foundation for preclinical studies and a rationale for testing whether NMDAR antagonists might be used to treat PTHS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Pitt–Hopkins syndrome (PTHS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder associated with &lt;i&gt;TCF4&lt;/i&gt; mutations/deletions. Despite this genetic insight, there is a need to identify the function of TCF4 in the brain. Toward this goal, we developed two mouse lines, including one harboring the most prevalent pathogenic point mutation, and compared them with two existing models that conditionally delete &lt;i&gt;Tcf4&lt;/i&gt;. Our data identify a set of overlapping phenotypes that may serve as outcome measures for preclinical studies of PTHS treatments. We also discovered penetrant enhanced synaptic plasticity across mouse models that may be linked to increased NMDA receptor function. These data reveal convergent neurobiological characteristics of PTHS mouse models and support the further investigation of NMDA receptor antagonists as a possible PTHS treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Proteolytic Processing of Neurexins by Presenilins Sustains Synaptic Vesicle Release</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/4/901?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Proteolytic processing of synaptic adhesion components can accommodate the function of synapses to activity-dependent changes. The adhesion system formed by neurexins (Nrxns) and neuroligins (Nlgns) bidirectionally orchestrate the function of presynaptic and postsynaptic terminals. Previous studies have shown that presenilins (PS), components of the gamma-secretase complex frequently mutated in familial Alzheimer's disease, clear from glutamatergic terminals the accumulation of Nrxn C-terminal fragments (Nrxn-CTF) generated by ectodomain shedding. Here, we characterized the synaptic consequences of the proteolytic processing of Nrxns in cultured hippocampal neurons from mice and rats of both sexes. We show that activation of presynaptic Nrxns with postsynaptic Nlgn1 or inhibition of ectodomain shedding in axonal Nrxn1-β increases presynaptic release at individual terminals, likely reflecting an increase in the number of functional release sites. Importantly, inactivation of PS inhibits presynaptic release downstream of Nrxn activation, leaving synaptic vesicle recruitment unaltered. Glutamate-receptor signaling initiates the activity-dependent generation of Nrxn-CTF, which accumulate at presynaptic terminals lacking PS function. The sole expression of Nrxn-CTF decreases presynaptic release and calcium flux, recapitulating the deficits due to loss of PS function. Our data indicate that inhibition of Nrxn processing by PS is deleterious to glutamatergic function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; To gain insight into the role of presenilins (PS) in excitatory synaptic function, we address the relevance of the proteolytic processing of presynaptic neurexins (Nrxns) in glutamatergic differentiation. Using synaptic fluorescence probes in cultured hippocampal neurons, we report that trans-synaptic activation of Nrxns produces a robust increase in presynaptic calcium levels and neurotransmitter release at individual glutamatergic terminals by a mechanism that depends on normal PS activity. Abnormal accumulation of Nrxn C-terminal fragments resulting from impaired PS activity inhibits presynaptic calcium signal and neurotransmitter release, assigning synaptic defects to Nrxns as a specific PS substrate. These data may provide links into how loss of PS activity inhibits glutamatergic synaptic function in Alzheimer's disease patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Orai1 Plays a Crucial Role in Central Sensitization by Modulating Neuronal Excitability</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/4/887?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Pathological pain is a common and debilitating condition that is often poorly managed. Central sensitization is an important mechanism underlying pathological pain. However, candidate molecules involved in central sensitization remain unclear. Store-operated calcium channels (SOCs) mediate important calcium signals in nonexcitable and excitable cells. SOCs have been implicated in a wide variety of human pathophysiological conditions, including immunodeficiency, occlusive vascular diseases, and cancer. However, the role of SOCs in CNS disorders has been relatively unexplored. Orai1, a key component of SOCs, is expressed in the human and rodent spinal cord dorsal horn, but its functional significance in dorsal horn neurons is poorly understood. Here we sought to explore a potential role of Orai1 in the modulation of neuronal excitability and A-type potassium channels involved in pain plasticity. Using both male and female Orai1 knock-out mice, we found that activation of Orai1 increased neuronal excitability and reduced A-type potassium channels via the protein kinase C–extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (PKC–ERK) pathway in dorsal horn neurons. Orai1 deficiency significantly decreased acute pain induced by noxious stimuli, nearly eliminated the second phase of formalin-induced nociceptive response, markedly attenuated carrageenan-induced ipsilateral pain hypersensitivity and abolished carrageenan-induced contralateral mechanical allodynia. Consistently, carrageenan-induced increase in neuronal excitability was abolished in the dorsal horn from Orai1 mutant mice. These findings uncover a novel signaling pathway involved in the pain process and central sensitization. Our study also reveals a novel link among Orai1, ERK, A-type potassium channels, and neuronal excitability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Orai1 is a key component of store-operated calcium channels (SOCs) in many cell types. It has been implicated in such pathological conditions as immunodeficiency, autoimmunity, and cancer. However, the role of Orai1 in CNS disorders remains poorly understood. The functional significance of Orai1 in neurons is elusive. Here we demonstrate that activation of Orai1 modulates neuronal excitability and Kv4-containing A-type potassium channels via the protein kinase C–extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (PKC–ERK) pathway. Genetic knock-out of Orai1 nearly eliminates the second phase of formalin-induced pain and markedly attenuates carrageenan-induced pain hypersensitivity and neuronal excitability. These findings reveal a novel link between Orai1 and neuronal excitability and advance our understanding of central sensitization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Early Procedural Pain Is Associated with Regionally-Specific Alterations in Thalamic Development in Preterm Neonates</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/4/878?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Very preterm human neonates are exposed to numerous invasive procedures as part of life-saving care. Evidence suggests that repetitive neonatal procedural pain precedes long-term alterations in brain development. However, to date the link between pain and brain development has limited temporal and anatomic specificity. We hypothesized that early exposure to painful stimuli during a period of rapid brain development, before pain modulatory systems reach maturity, will predict pronounced changes in thalamic development, and thereby cognitive and motor function. In a prospective cohort study, 155 very preterm neonates (82 males, 73 females) born 24–32 weeks' gestation underwent two MRIs at median postmenstrual ages 32 and 40 weeks that included structural, metabolic, and diffusion imaging. Detailed day-by-day clinical data were collected. Cognitive and motor abilities were assessed at 3 years, corrected age. The association of early (skin breaks, birth–Scan 1) and late pain (skin breaks, Scans 1–2) with thalamic volumes and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylaspartate (NAA)/choline (Cho), and fractional anisotropy of white-matter pathways was assessed. Early pain was associated with slower thalamic macrostructural growth, most pronounced in extremely premature neonates. Deformation-based morphometry analyses confirmed early pain-related volume losses were localized to somatosensory regions. In extremely preterm neonates early pain was associated with decreased thalamic NAA/Cho and microstructural alterations in thalamocortical pathways. Thalamic growth was in turn related to cognitive and motor outcomes. We observed regionally-specific alterations in the lateral thalamus and thalamocortical pathways in extremely preterm neonates exposed to more procedural pain. Findings suggest a sensitive period leading to lasting alterations in somatosensory-system development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Early exposure to repetitive procedural pain in very preterm neonates may disrupt the development of regions involved in somatosensory processing, leading to poor functional outcomes. We demonstrate that early pain is associated with thalamic volume loss in the territory of the somatosensory thalamus and is accompanied by disruptions thalamic metabolic growth and thalamocortical pathway maturation, particularly in extremely preterm neonates. Thalamic growth was associated with cognitive and motor outcome at 3 years corrected age. Findings provide evidence for a developmentally sensitive period whereby subcortical structures in young neonates may be most vulnerable to procedural pain. Furthermore, results suggest that the thalamus may play a key role underlying the association between neonatal pain and poor neurodevelopmental outcomes in these high-risk neonates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Miz1 Controls Schwann Cell Proliferation via H3K36me2 Demethylase Kdm8 to Prevent Peripheral Nerve Demyelination</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/4/858?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Schwann cell differentiation and myelination depends on chromatin remodeling, histone acetylation, and methylation, which all affect Schwann cell proliferation. We previously reported that the deletion of the POZ (POxvirus and Zinc finger) domain of the transcription factor Miz1 (Myc-interacting zinc finger protein; encoded by &lt;i&gt;Zbtb17&lt;/i&gt;) in mouse Schwann cells (&lt;i&gt;Miz1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;POZ&lt;/i&gt;) causes a neuropathy at 90 d after birth [postnatal day (P) 90], with a subsequent spontaneous regeneration. Here we show that RNA sequencing from &lt;i&gt;Miz1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;POZ&lt;/i&gt; and control animals at P30 revealed a set of upregulated genes with a strong correlation to cell-cycle regulation. Consistently, a subset of Schwann cells did not exit the cell cycle as observed in control animals and the growth fraction increased over time. From the RNAseq gene list, two direct Miz1 target genes were identified, one of which encodes the histone H3K36&lt;sup&gt;me2&lt;/sup&gt; demethylase Kdm8. We show that the expression of &lt;i&gt;Kdm8&lt;/i&gt; is repressed by Miz1 and that its release in &lt;i&gt;Miz1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;POZ&lt;/i&gt; cells induces a decrease of H3K36&lt;sup&gt;me2&lt;/sup&gt;, especially in deregulated cell-cycle-related genes. The linkage between elevated &lt;i&gt;Kdm8&lt;/i&gt; expression, hypomethylation of H3K36 at cell-cycle-relevant genes, and the subsequent re-entering of adult Schwann cells into the cell cycle suggests that the release of &lt;i&gt;Kdm8&lt;/i&gt; repression in the absence of a functional Miz1 is a central issue in the development of the &lt;i&gt;Miz1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;POZ&lt;/i&gt; phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The deletion of the Miz1 (Myc-interacting zinc finger protein 1) POZ (POxvirus and Zinc finger) domain in Schwann cells causes a neuropathy. Here we report sustained Schwann cell proliferation caused by an increased expression of the direct Miz1 target gene &lt;i&gt;Kdm8&lt;/i&gt;, encoding a H3K36me2 demethylase. Hence, the demethylation of H3K36 is linked to the pathogenesis of a neuropathy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: ELMOD1 Stimulates ARF6-GTP Hydrolysis to Stabilize Apical Structures in Developing Vestibular Hair Cells</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/4/843?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sensory hair cells require control of physical properties of their apical plasma membranes for normal development and function. Members of the ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) small GTPase family regulate membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal assembly in many cells. We identified ELMO domain-containing protein 1 (ELMOD1), a guanine nucleoside triphosphatase activating protein (GAP) for ARF6, as the most highly enriched ARF regulator in hair cells. To characterize ELMOD1 control of trafficking, we analyzed mice of both sexes from a strain lacking functional ELMOD1 [roundabout (&lt;i&gt;rda&lt;/i&gt;)]. In &lt;i&gt;rda/rda&lt;/i&gt; mice, cuticular plates of utricle hair cells initially formed normally, then degenerated after postnatal day 5; large numbers of vesicles invaded the compromised cuticular plate. Hair bundles initially developed normally, but the cell's apical membrane lifted away from the cuticular plate, and stereocilia elongated and fused. Membrane trafficking in type I hair cells, measured by FM1-43 dye labeling, was altered in &lt;i&gt;rda/rda&lt;/i&gt; mice. Consistent with the proposed GAP role for ELMOD1, the ARF6 GTP/GDP ratio was significantly elevated in &lt;i&gt;rda/rda&lt;/i&gt; utricles compared with controls, and the level of ARF6-GTP was correlated with the severity of the &lt;i&gt;rda/rda&lt;/i&gt; phenotype. These results suggest that conversion of ARF6 to its GDP-bound form is necessary for final stabilization of the hair bundle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Assembly of the mechanically sensitive hair bundle of sensory hair cells requires growth and reorganization of apical actin and membrane structures. Hair bundles and apical membranes in mice with mutations in the &lt;i&gt;Elmod1&lt;/i&gt; gene degenerate after formation, suggesting that the ELMOD1 protein stabilizes these structures. We show that ELMOD1 is a GTPase-activating protein in hair cells for the small GTP-binding protein ARF6, known to participate in actin assembly and membrane trafficking. We propose that conversion of ARF6 into the GDP-bound form in the apical domain of hair cells is essential for stabilizing apical actin structures like the hair bundle and ensuring that the apical membrane forms appropriately around the stereocilia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Non-Newly Generated, &quot;Immature&quot; Neurons in the Sheep Brain Are Not Restricted to Cerebral Cortex</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/4/826?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A newly proposed form of brain structural plasticity consists of non-newly generated, &quot;immature&quot; neurons of the adult cerebral cortex. Similar to newly generated neurons, these cells express the cytoskeletal protein Doublecortin (DCX), yet they are generated prenatally and then remain in a state of immaturity for long periods. In rodents, the immature neurons are restricted to the paleocortex, whereas in other mammals, they are also found in neocortex. Here, we analyzed the DCX-expressing cells in the whole sheep brain of both sexes to search for an indicator of structural plasticity at a cellular level in a relatively large-brained, long-living mammal. Brains from adult and newborn sheep (injected with BrdU and analyzed at different survival times) were processed for DCX, cell proliferation markers (Ki-67, BrdU), pallial/subpallial developmental origin (&lt;i&gt;Tbr1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Sp8&lt;/i&gt;), and neuronal/glial antigens for phenotype characterization. We found immature-like neurons in the whole sheep cortex and in large populations of DCX-expressing cells within the external capsule and the surrounding gray matter (claustrum and amygdala). BrdU and Ki-67 detection at neonatal and adult ages showed that all of these DCX&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells were generated during embryogenesis, not after birth. These results show that the adult sheep, unlike rodents, is largely endowed with non-newly generated neurons retaining immature features, suggesting that such plasticity might be particularly important in large-brained, long-living mammals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Brain plasticity is important in adaptation and brain repair. Structural changes span from synaptic plasticity to adult neurogenesis, the latter being highly reduced in large-brained, long-living mammals (e.g., humans). The cerebral cortex contains &quot;immature&quot; neurons, which are generated prenatally and then remain in an undifferentiated state for long periods, being detectable with markers of immaturity. We studied the distribution and developmental origin of these cells in the whole brain of sheep, relatively large-brained, long-living mammals. In addition to the expected cortical location, we also found populations of non-newly generated neurons in several subcortical regions (external capsule, claustrum, and amygdala). These results suggests that non-neurogenic, parenchymal structural plasticity might be more important in large mammals with respect to adult neurogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Synaptic Regulator {alpha}-Synuclein in Dopaminergic Fibers Is Essentially Required for the Maintenance of Subependymal Neural Stem Cells</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/4/814?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Synaptic protein α-synuclein (α-SYN) modulates neurotransmission in a complex and poorly understood manner and aggregates in the cytoplasm of degenerating neurons in Parkinson's disease. Here, we report that α-SYN present in dopaminergic nigral afferents is essential for the normal cycling and maintenance of neural stem cells (NSCs) in the brain subependymal zone of adult male and female mice. We also show that premature senescence of adult NSCs into non-neurogenic astrocytes in mice lacking α-SYN resembles the effects of dopaminergic fiber degeneration resulting from chronic exposure to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetra-hydropyridine or intranigral inoculation of aggregated toxic α-SYN. Interestingly, NSC loss in α-SYN-deficient mice can be prevented by viral delivery of human α-SYN into their sustantia nigra or by treatment with l-DOPA, suggesting that α-SYN regulates dopamine availability to NSCs. Our data indicate that α-SYN, present in dopaminergic nerve terminals supplying the subependymal zone, acts as a niche component to sustain the neurogenic potential of adult NSCs and identify α-SYN and DA as potential targets to ameliorate neurogenic defects in the aging and diseased brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We report an essential role for the protein α-synuclein present in dopaminergic nigral afferents in the regulation of adult neural stem cell maintenance, identifying the first synaptic regulator with an implication in stem cell niche biology. Although the exact role of α-synuclein in neural transmission is not completely clear, our results indicate that it is required for stemness and the preservation of neurogenic potential in concert with dopamine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Overexpression of the Histone Dimethyltransferase G9a in Nucleus Accumbens Shell Increases Cocaine Self-Administration, Stress-Induced Reinstatement, and Anxiety</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/4/803?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Repeated exposure to cocaine induces lasting epigenetic changes in neurons that promote the development and persistence of addiction. One epigenetic alteration involves reductions in levels of the histone dimethyltransferase G9a in nucleus accumbens (NAc) after chronic cocaine administration. This reduction in G9a may enhance cocaine reward because overexpressing G9a in the NAc decreases cocaine-conditioned place preference. Therefore, we hypothesized that HSV-mediated G9a overexpression in the NAc shell (NAcSh) would attenuate cocaine self-administration (SA) and cocaine-seeking behavior. Instead, we found that G9a overexpression, and the resulting increase in histone 3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2), increases sensitivity to cocaine reinforcement and enhances motivation for cocaine in self-administering male rats. Moreover, when G9a overexpression is limited to the initial 15 d of cocaine SA training, it produces an enduring postexpression enhancement in cocaine SA and prolonged (over 5 weeks) increases in reinstatement of cocaine seeking induced by foot-shock stress, but in the absence of continued global elevations in H3K9me2. The increase in stress-induced reinstatement is paralleled by heightened anxiety measures, suggesting that countering the cocaine-induced decreases in endogenous G9a with ectopic G9a overexpression leads to lasting anxiogenic effects. Finally, we found an enduring reduction in phosphorylated cAMP-response element binding protein levels in the NAcSh that could account for the increased anxiety. These data demonstrate a novel role for G9a in promoting comorbid cocaine addiction and anxiety and suggest that increased epigenetic repression of transcription through H3K9 during cocaine use can have long-lasting and unexpected negative consequences on behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Cocaine addiction is a neuropsychiatric disorder that is detrimental to society and currently has no effective treatments. The difficulty in treating drug addiction is compounded by the high comorbidity with other psychiatric illnesses, including anxiety disorders. Here, we demonstrate that G9a, an epigenetic repressor of gene expression, acting in the nucleus accumbens, a brain reward region, is capable of increasing both addiction- and anxiety-like behaviors in rats. These findings are intriguing because repeated cocaine exposure decreases G9a in this region and thereby enhances expression of certain addiction-promoting genes. However, our results suggest that countering this cocaine-induced decrease in G9a activity actually exacerbates addiction and sensitivity to relapse under stressful situations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Shp2 Regulates Oligodendrocyte Differentiation and Early Myelination and Contributes to Timely Remyelination</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/4/787?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Shp2 is a nonreceptor protein tyrosine phosphatase that has been shown to influence neurogenesis, oligodendrogenesis, and oligodendrocyte differentiation. Furthermore, Shp2 is a known regulator of the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin and ERK signaling pathways in multiple cellular contexts, including oligodendrocytes. Its role during later postnatal CNS development or in response to demyelination injury has not been examined. Based on the current studies, we hypothesize that Shp2 is a negative regulator of CNS myelination. Using transgenic mouse technology, we show that Shp2 is involved in oligodendrocyte differentiation and early myelination, but is not necessary for myelin maintenance. We also show that Shp2 regulates the timely differentiation of oligodendrocytes following lysolecithin-induced demyelination, although apparently normal remyelination occurs at a delayed time point. These data suggest that Shp2 is a relevant therapeutic target in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In the present study, we show that the protein phosphatase Shp2 is an important mediator of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination, both during developmental myelination as well as during myelin regeneration. We provide important insight into the signaling mechanisms regulating myelination and propose that Shp2 acts as a transient brake to the developmental myelination process. Furthermore, we show that Shp2 regulates oligodendrocyte differentiation following demyelination and therefore has important therapeutic implications in diseases such as multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Folding of the cerebral cortex is as highly intriguing as poorly understood. At first sight, this may appear as simple tissue crumpling inside an excessively small cranium, but the process is clearly much more complex and developmentally predetermined.

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: How Forces Fold the Cerebral Cortex</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/4/767?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Improved understanding of the factors that govern folding of the cerebral cortex is desirable for many reasons. The existence of consistent patterns in folding within and between species suggests a fundamental role in brain function. Abnormal folding patterns found in individuals affected by a diverse array of neurodevelopmental disorders underline the clinical relevance of understanding the folding process. Recent experimental and computational efforts to elucidate the biomechanical forces involved in cerebral cortical folding have converged on a consistent approach. Brain growth is modeled with two components: an expanding outer zone, destined to become the cerebral cortex, is mechanically coupled to an inner zone, destined to become white matter, that grows at a slower rate, perhaps in response to stress induced by expansion from the outer layer. This framework is consistent with experimentally observed internal forces in developing brains, and with observations of the folding process in physical models. In addition, computational simulations based on this foundation can produce folding patterns that recapitulate the characteristics of folding patterns found in gyroencephalic brains. This perspective establishes the importance of mechanical forces in our current understanding of how brains fold, and identifies realistic ranges for specific parameters in biophysical models of developing brain tissue. However, further refinement of this approach is needed. An understanding of mechanical forces that arise during brain development and their cellular-level origins is necessary to interpret the consequences of abnormal brain folding and its role in functional deficits as well as neurodevelopmental disease.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The human brain is able to learn, generalize, and predict crossmodal stimuli.
Learning by expectation fine-tunes crossmodal processing at different levels,
thus enhancing our power of generalization and adaptation in highly dynamic
environments. In this paper, we propose a deep neural architecture trained by
using expectation learning accounting for unsupervised learning tasks. Our
learning model exhibits a self-adaptable behavior, setting the first steps
towards the development of deep learning architectures for crossmodal stimuli
association.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Presynaptic GABAA Receptors Modulate Thalamocortical Inputs in Layer 4 of Rat V1</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Fast inhibitory GABAergic transmission plays a fundamental role in neural circuits. Current theories of cortical function assume that fast GABAergic inhibition acts via GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors on postsynaptic neurons, while presynaptic effects of GABA depend on GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptor activation. Manipulations of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor activity in vivo produced different effects on cortical function, which were generally ascribed to the mode of action of a drug, more than its site of action. Here we show that in rodent primary visual cortex, α4-containing GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors can be located on subsets of glutamatergic and GABAergic presynaptic terminals and decrease synaptic transmission. Our data provide a novel mechanistic insight into the effects of changes in cortical inhibition; the ability to modulate inputs onto cortical circuits locally, via presynaptic regulation of release by GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Cortical Responses to Input From Distant Areas are Modulated by Local Spontaneous Alpha/Beta Oscillations</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx361/4823221?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Any given area in human cortex may receive input from multiple, functionally heterogeneous areas, potentially representing different processing threads. Alpha (8–13 Hz) and beta oscillations (13–20 Hz) have been hypothesized by other investigators to gate local cortical processing, but their influence on cortical responses to input from other cortical areas is unknown. To study this, we measured the effect of local oscillatory power and phase on cortical responses elicited by single-pulse electrical stimulation (SPES) at distant cortical sites, in awake human subjects implanted with intracranial electrodes for epilepsy surgery. In 4 out of 5 subjects, the amplitudes of corticocortical evoked potentials (CCEPs) elicited by distant SPES were reproducibly modulated by the power, but not the phase, of local oscillations in alpha and beta frequencies. Specifically, CCEP amplitudes were higher when average oscillatory power just before distant SPES (−110 to −10 ms) was high. This effect was observed in only a subset (0–33%) of sites with CCEPs and, like the CCEPs themselves, varied with stimulation at different distant sites. Our results suggest that although alpha and beta oscillations may gate local processing, they may also enhance the responsiveness of cortex to input from distant cortical sites.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Genital cortex microstimulation-evoked movements of legs, trunk and genitals, which showed sex-specific differences related to mating behaviors and included thrusting in males and lordosis-like movements in females. Erections/tumescence of penis or clitoris could not be evoked, however. Anterograde tracer injections into penis/clitoris cortex revealed eleven corticocortical and 10 subcortical projection targets, which were qualitatively similar in both sexes. Corticocortical genital-cortex-projections innervated about 3% of the cortical surface and most were analog to other somatosensory projections targeting motor cortex, secondary somatosensory cortex, parietal cortex and perirhinal cortex. Corticocortical projections that differed from other parts of somatosensory cortex targeted male scrotum cortex, female vulva cortex, the somatosensory–ear–auditory-cortex-region and the caudal parietal area. Aligning cytoarchitectonic borders with motor topography, sensory genital responses and corticocortical projections identified a candidate region for genital motor cortex. Most subcortical genital-cortex-projections were analog to other thalamic, tectal or pontine projections of somatosensory cortex. Genital-cortex-specific subcortical projections targeted amygdala and nucleus submedius and accumbens. Microstimulation-effects and projections support a sexual function of genital cortex and suggest that genital cortex is a major hub of sexual sensorimotor processing in rodents.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Intertemporal choice requires a dynamic interaction between valuation and deliberation processes. While evidence identifying candidate brain areas for each of these processes is well established, the precise mechanistic role carried out by each brain region is still debated. In this article, we present a computational model that clarifies the unique contribution of frontoparietal cortex regions to intertemporal decision making. The model we develop samples reward and delay information stochastically on a moment-by-moment basis. As preference for the choice alternatives evolves, dynamic inhibitory processes are executed by way of asymmetric lateral inhibition. We find that it is these lateral inhibition processes that best explain the contribution of frontoparietal regions to intertemporal decision making exhibited in our data.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: A Brief History of the Encoding of Hand Position by the Cerebral Cortex: Implications for Motor Control and Cognition</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx354/4823218?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Encoding hand position by the cerebral cortex is essential not only for the neural representation of the body image but also for different actions based on eye–hand coordination. These include reaching for visual objects as well as complex movement sequences, such as tea-making, tool use, and object construction, among many others. All these functions depend on a continuous refreshing of the hand position representation, relying on both predictive signaling and afferent information. The hand position influence on neural activity in the parietofrontal system, together with eye position signals, are the basic elements of an eye–hand matrix from which all the above functions can emerge and could be regarded as key features of a network with several entry points, command nodes and outflow pathways, as confirmed by the discovery of a direct parietospinal projection for the control of hand action. The integrity of this system is crucial for daily life, as testified by the consequences of cortical lesions, spanning from severe paralysis to complex forms of apraxia. In this review, I will sketch my personal understanding of the scientific and conceptual trajectory of a line of investigation with many unexpected influences on cortical function and disease, from motor behavior to cognition.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Fear Extinction Recall Modulates Human Frontomedial Theta and Amygdala Activity</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx353/4823217?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) studies, as well as animal studies, indicate that the amygdala and frontomedial brain regions are critically involved in conditioned fear and that frontomedial oscillations in the theta range (4–8 Hz) may support communication between these brain regions. However, few studies have used a multimodal approach to probe interactions among these key regions in humans. Here, our goal was to bridge the gap between prior human fMRI, EEG, and animal findings. Using simultaneous EEG–fMRI recordings 24 h after fear conditioning and extinction, conditioned stimuli presented (CS+E, CS−E) and not presented during extinction (CS+N, CS−N) were compared to identify effects specific to extinction versus fear recall. Differential (CS+ vs. CS−) electrodermal, frontomedial theta (EEG) and amygdala responses (fMRI) were reduced for extinguished versus nonextinguished stimuli. Importantly, effects on theta power covaried with effects on amygdala activation. Fear and extinction recall as indicated by theta explained 60% of the variance for the analogous effect in the right amygdala. Our findings show for the first time the interplay of amygdala and frontomedial theta activity during fear and extinction recall in humans and provide insight into neural circuits consistently linked with top-down amygdala modulation in rodents.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Modeling visual-based pitch, lift and speed control strategies in hoverflies</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/4F046xHmM_I/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Roman Goulard, Jean-Louis Vercher, Stéphane Viollet&lt;/p&gt;

To avoid crashing onto the floor, a free falling fly needs to trigger its wingbeats quickly and control the orientation of its thrust accurately and swiftly to stabilize its pitch and hence its speed. Behavioural data have suggested that the vertical optic flow produced by the fall and crossing the visual field plays a key role in this anti-crash response. Free fall behavior analyses have also suggested that flying insect may not rely on graviception to stabilize their flight. Based on these two assumptions, we have developed a model which accounts for hoverflies´ position and pitch orientation recorded in 3D with a fast stereo camera during experimental free falls. Our dynamic model shows that optic flow-based control combined with closed-loop control of the pitch suffice to stabilize the flight properly. In addition, our model sheds a new light on the visual-based feedback control of fly´s pitch, lift and thrust. Since graviceptive cues are possibly not used by flying insects, the use of a vertical reference to control the pitch is discussed, based on the results obtained on a complete dynamic model of a virtual fly falling in a textured corridor. This model would provide a useful tool for understanding more clearly how insects may or not estimate their absolute attitude.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4F046xHmM_I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Extensive works during the past decade yield ample insights into the molecular and cellular functions of MeCP2 in neural development. Furthermore, genetic manipulations in Mecp2 mouse models strongly suggested that deficiency in synaptic plasticity and various behaviors of Mecp2 null or transgenic mice could be rescued in adulthood. Further studies elucidating neural circuits responsible for symptoms in MECP2-associated disorders in rodent and non-human primate models will shed light on the development of potential therapeutic interventions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Clinical and animal model studies have shown that changes in PFC excitation and inhibition are important for cognitive functions as well as related disorders. Here, we discuss recent findings revealing the roles of the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic proteins neuroligin 1 (NLGN1) and NLGN2 in the PFC in memory formation and modulation of memory strength. We propose that shifts in NLGN1 and NLGN2 expression in specific excitatory and inhibitory neuronal subpopulations in response to experience regulate the dynamic processes of memory consolidation and strengthening. Because excitatory/inhibitory imbalances accompany neuropsychiatric disorders in which strength and flexibility of representations play important roles, understanding these mechanisms may suggest novel therapies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

These limitations reflect what has been dichotomy between the structure and mechanical properties of living brain tissue and non-living neural probes. To bridge the gap between neural and electronic networks, we have introduced the new concept of mesh electronics probes designed with structural and mechanical properties such that the implant begins to ‘look and behave’ like neural tissue. Syringe-implanted mesh electronics have led to the realization of probes that are neuro-attractive and free of the chronic immune response, as well as capable of stable long-term mapping and modulation of brain activity at the single-neuron level. This review provides a historical overview of a 10-year development of mesh electronics by highlighting the tissue-like design, syringe-assisted delivery, seamless neural tissue integration, and single-neuron level chronic recording stability of mesh electronics. We also offer insights on unique near-term opportunities and future directions for neuroscience and neurology that now are available or expected for mesh electronics neurotechnologies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Human neuroimaging studies consistently show a hunger-dependent, selective enhancement of responses to images of food in association cortex and amygdala. More recently, cellular-resolution imaging combined with circuit mapping experiments in behaving mice have revealed underlying neuronal population dynamics and enabled tracing of pathways by which hunger circuits influence the assignment of value to visual objects in visual association cortex, insular cortex, and amygdala. These experiments begin to provide a mechanistic understanding of motivation-specific neural processing of need-relevant cues in healthy humans and in disease states such as obesity and other eating disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Since the earliest days of embryology, lineage questions have been addressed with methods of increasing specificity, capacity, and resolution. Yet, a full realization of individual cell lineages remains challenging for complex systems. A recent explosion of technical advances in genome-editing and single-cell sequencing has enabled lineage analysis in an unprecedented scale, speed, and depth across different species. In this review, we discuss the application of available as well as future genetic labeling techniques for tracking neural lineages in vivo in the mammalian nervous system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

During development, individual gene activity can dynamically engage different signaling networks; thus genetic mutations can lead to different functional changes at different times. Interpretation of phenotypes can be further complicated if initial functional changes trigger compensatory mechanisms. Examining genetic mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders reveals cellular phenotypes that change over the course of development and exist long before behavioral deficits are assessed. Correspondingly, earlier genetic interventions in these disorder models have often been more effective at improving behavioral deficits than late interventions. The restricted period of effective intervention demonstrates that identifying a target window is an essential component of treatment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

During the first three weeks of postnatal development, immature astrocytes express mGlu5 and expands several fold while undergoing a transition towards their mature phase. Although mGlu5-mediated signalling in astrocyte functions has been extensively studied in the last decades, whether this signalling is implicated in the mechanisms governing their development, as well as the effects of dysregulated astrocytic development on neurodevelopmental disorders, are still unclear. The aim of this review is to examine what is known about the mGlu5-mediated signalling in the developing astrocytes and its possible contribution to the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

This neural activity reflects internal processes by which the brain plans and executes volitional movements. The study of motor planning offers an opportunity to understand how the structure and dynamics of neural circuits support persistent internal states and how these states influence behavior. Recent advances in large-scale neural recordings are beginning to decipher the relationship of the dynamics of populations of neurons during motor planning and movements. New behavioral tasks in rodents, together with quantified perturbations, link dynamics in specific nodes of neural circuits to behavior. These studies reveal a neural network distributed across multiple brain regions that collectively supports motor planning. We review recent advances and highlight areas where further work is needed to achieve a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying motor planning and related cognitive processes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

These functions rely on the computation of the local cerebellar microcircuits and long-range connectivity that relays cerebellar output to various brain areas. In this review, we discuss recent work on two of the circuit elements, which are thought to be fundamental for a wide range of non-sensorimotor behaviors: The role for cerebellar granule cells in multimodal integration in the cerebellar cortex and the long-range connectivity between the deep cerebellar nuclei and the basal ganglia. Lastly, we discuss how studies on synapses and circuits of the cerebellum in rodent models of autism-spectrum disorders might contribute to our understanding of the pathophysiology of this class of neurodevelopmental disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Studies have found that sensory, prefrontal, hippocampal, cerebellar, and striatal regions, as well as the circuits that connect them, are perturbed in mouse models of ASD and ID. Dissecting the disruptions in morphology and activity in these neural circuits might help us to understand the shared risk between the two disorders as well as their clinical heterogeneity. Treatments that target the balance between excitation and inhibition in these regions are able to reverse pathological phenotypes, elucidating this deficit as a commonality across models and opening new avenues for intervention. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

These platforms leverage basic advances in biocompatible materials, semiconductor device designs and systems engineering concepts to afford modes of operation that are qualitatively distinct from those of conventional approaches that tether animals to external hardware by means of optical fibers, electrical cables and/or fluidic tubing. Neuroscience studies that exploit the unique features of these technologies enable insights into neural function through targeted stimulation, inhibition and recording, with spatially and genetically precise manipulation of neural circuit activity. Experimental possibilities include studies in naturalistic, three dimensional environments, investigations of pair-wise or group related social interactions and many other scenarios of interest that cannot be addressed using traditional hardware. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Individual network components in the mushroom bodies of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster represent cues, learning signals and behavioral outcomes of learned experience. Recent findings have highlighted the importance of dopamine-driven plasticity and activity in feedback and feedforward connections, between various elements of the mushroom body neural network. These computational motifs have been shown to be crucial for long term olfactory memory consolidation, integration of internal states, re-evaluation and updating of learned information. The often recurrent circuit anatomy and a prolonged requirement for activity in parts of these underlying networks, suggest that self-sustained and precisely timed activity is a fundamental feature of network computations in the insect brain. Together these processes allow flies to continuously adjust the content of their learned knowledge and direct their behavior in a way that best represents learned expectations and serves their most pressing current needs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Numerous genes in the endo-lysosomal pathways have been found to associate with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mutations of these genes lead to dysfunction in multiple steps of the endo-lysosomal network: autophagy, endocytic trafficking and lysosomal degradation, resulting in accumulation of pathogenic proteins. Although the exact pathogenic mechanism varies for different disease-associated genes, dysfunction of the endo-lysosomal pathways represents a converging mechanism shared by these diseases. Therefore, strategies that correct or compensate for endo-lysosomal dysfunction may be promising therapeutic approaches to treat neurodegenerative diseases. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

These devices, usually sensing cell activity via microelectrodes, should be characterized by safe working conditions in the biological milieu together with a well-controlled operation-life. The stable device/neuronal electrical coupling at the interface requires tight interactions between the electrode surface and the cell membrane. This neuro-electrode hybrid represents the hyphen between the soft nature of neural tissue, generating electrical signals via ion motions, and the rigid realm of microelectronics and medical devices, dealing with electrons in motion. Efficient integration of these entities is essential for monitoring, analyzing and controlling neuronal signaling but poses significant technological challenges. Improving the cell/electrode interaction and thus the interface performance requires novel engineering of (nano)materials: tuning at the nanoscale electrode's properties may lead to engineer interfacing probes that better camouflaged with their biological target. In this brief review, we highlight the most recent concepts in nanotechnologies and nanomaterials that might help reducing the mismatch between tissue and electrode, focusing on the device's mechanical properties and its biological integration with the tissue. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Activation of excitatory glutamatergic synapses leads to their shuttling from the synapse to the nucleus, mostly importin-mediated, and subsequent regulation of gene transcription needed for long lasting modifications of synaptic function. Accordingly, increasing evidences show that alterations of the activity of synaptonuclear messengers are correlated to synaptic failure as observed in different synaptopathies. Specifically, recent studies demonstrate that the modulation of the activity of synaptonuclear messengers could represent a novel molecular target in the pathogenesis of both neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

negative electrical brain potential, the Bereitschaftspotential (BP), that can
be recorded over the human scalp using electroencephalography (EEG). Up to now,
the BP required to initiate voluntary acts has only been recorded under
well-controlled laboratory conditions. It is thus not known if this form of
brain activity also underlies motor initiation in possible life-threatening
decision making, such as jumping into a 192-meter abyss, an act requiring
extraordinary willpower. Here, we report BP before self-initiated 192-meter
extreme bungee jumping across two semi-professional cliff divers (both male,
mean age 19.3 years). We found that the spatiotemporal dynamics of the BP is
comparable to that recorded under laboratory conditions. These results,
possible through recent advancements in wireless and portable EEG technology,
document for the first time pre-movement brain activity preceding possible
life-threatening decision making.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: What drives the perceptual change resulting from speech motor adaptation? Evaluation of hypotheses in a Bayesian modeling framework</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/847yCSUjhhw/article</link>

Shifts in perceptual boundaries resulting from speech motor learning induced by perturbations of the auditory feedback were taken as evidence for the involvement of motor functions in auditory speech perception. Beyond this general statement, the precise mechanisms underlying this involvement are not yet fully understood. In this paper we propose a quantitative evaluation of some hypotheses concerning the motor and auditory updates that could result from motor learning, in the context of various assumptions about the roles of the auditory and somatosensory pathways in speech perception. This analysis was made possible thanks to the use of a Bayesian model that implements these hypotheses by expressing the relationships between speech production and speech perception in a joint probability distribution. The evaluation focuses on how the hypotheses can (1) predict the location of perceptual boundary shifts once the perturbation has been removed, (2) account for the magnitude of the compensation in presence of the perturbation, and (3) describe the correlation between these two behavioral characteristics. Experimental findings about changes in speech perception following adaptation to auditory feedback perturbations serve as reference. Simulations suggest that they are compatible with a framework in which motor adaptation updates both the auditory-motor internal model and the auditory characterization of the perturbed phoneme, and where perception involves both auditory and somatosensory pathways.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/847yCSUjhhw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Collision Selective Visual Neural Network Inspired by LGMD2 Neurons in Juvenile Locusts. (arXiv:1801.06452v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06452</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For autonomous robots in dynamic environments mixed with human, it is vital
to detect impending collision quickly and robustly. The biological visual
systems evolved over millions of years may provide us efficient solutions for
collision detection in complex environments. In the cockpit of locusts, two
Lobula Giant Movement Detectors, i.e. LGMD1 and LGMD2, have been identified
which respond to looming objects rigorously with high firing rates. Compared to
LGMD1, LGMD2 matures early in the juvenile locusts with specific selectivity to
dark moving objects against bright background in depth while not responding to
light objects embedded in dark background - a similar situation which ground
vehicles and robots are facing with. However, little work has been done on
modeling LGMD2, let alone its potential in robotics and other vision-based
applications. In this article, we propose a novel way of modeling LGMD2 neuron,
with biased ON and OFF pathways splitting visual streams into parallel channels
encoding brightness increments and decrements separately to fulfill its
selectivity. Moreover, we apply a biophysical mechanism of spike frequency
adaptation to shape the looming selectivity in such a collision-detecting
neuron model. The proposed visual neural network has been tested with
systematic experiments, challenged against synthetic and real physical stimuli,
as well as image streams from the sensor of a miniature robot. The results
demonstrated this framework is able to detect looming dark objects embedded in
bright backgrounds selectively, which make it ideal for ground mobile
platforms. The robotic experiments also showed its robustness in collision
detection - it performed well for near range navigation in an arena with many
obstacles. Its enhanced collision selectivity to dark approaching objects
versus receding and translating ones has also been verified via systematic
experiments.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06226</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The means by which neuronal activity yields robust behavior is a ubiquitous
question in neuroscience. In the songbird, the timing of a highly stereotyped
song motif is attributed to the cortical nucleus HVC, and to feedback to HVC
from downstream nuclei in the song motor pathway. Control of the acoustic
structure appears to be shared by various structures, whose functional
connectivity is largely unknown. Currently there exists no model for functional
synaptic architecture that links HVC to song output in a manner consistent with
experiments. Here we build on a previous model of HVC in which a distinct
functional architecture may act as a pattern generator to drive downstream
regions. Using a specific functional connectivity of the song motor pathway, we
show how this HVC mechanism can generate simple representations of the driving
forces for song. The model reproduces observed correlations between neuronal
and respiratory activity and acoustic features of song. It makes testable
predictions regarding the electrophysiology of distinct populations in the
robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA), the connectivity within HVC and RA and
between them, and the activity patterns of vocal-respiratory neurons in the
brainstem.

differ from conventional ANNs in many aspects, but the key difference is that
instead of a layered architecture, with each node performing the same function,
Markov Brains are networks built from individual computational components.
These computational components interact with each other, receive inputs from
sensors, and control motor outputs. The function of the computational
components, their connections to each other, as well as connections to sensors
and motors are all subject to evolutionary optimization. Here we describe in

Subplate neurons (SPNs) are among the first-born cortical neurons and are necessary for normal cerebral development. While moderate or severe HI at P1 in rats leads to SPN loss, it is unclear if HI, esp. forms not associated with overt cell loss lead to altered SPN circuits. Thus, we used two HI models with different severities in P1 rats. Cauterization of the common carotid artery (CCA) causes a largely transient and thus milder ischemia (HI-Caut) while CCA ligation causes more severe ischemia (HI-Lig). While HI-Lig caused subplate damage, HI-Caut did not cause overt histological damage on the light microscopic level. We used laser-scanning photostimulation (LSPS) in acute thalamocortical slices of auditory cortex during P5–10 to study the functional connectivity of SPNs. Both HI categories resulted in hyperconnectivity of excitatory and inhibitory circuits to SPNs. Thus, alterations on the circuit level are present in the absence of cell loss. Our results show that SPN circuits are uniquely susceptible to HI. Given the key developmental role of SPNs, our results suggest that altered SPN circuits might underlie the abnormal development of cortical function after HI.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;In order to efficiently process incoming visual information, selective attention acts as a filter that enhances relevant and suppresses irrelevant information. In this study, we used an event-related potential (ERP) approach with systematic lateralization to investigate enhancement and suppression during encoding of information into visual working memory (WM) separately. We used a change detection task in which observers had to memorize some items while ignoring other items. We found that the to-be-ignored items elicited a PD component in the ERP, suggesting that irrelevant information is actively suppressed from WM. The PD amplitude increased with distractor load and decreased with the ability to group distractors according to Gestalt principles. This suggests that the PD can be used as an indicator of how efficiently items can be suppressed from entering WM. Furthermore, while lateral memory-targets elicited a “traditional” CDA (starting ~300 ms), lateral memory-distractors elicited a sustained positivity contralateral to memory-distractors (CDAp, starting ~400 ms). In sum the results suggest that inhibition of irrelevant information is an important factor for efficient WM and is reflected in spontaneous (PD) and sustained suppression (CDAp).&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The perception of an acoustic rhythm is invariant to the absolute temporal intervals constituting a sound sequence. It is unknown where in the brain temporal Gestalt, the percept emerging from the relative temporal proximity between acoustic events, is encoded. Two different relative temporal patterns, each induced by three experimental conditions with different absolute temporal patterns as sensory basis, were presented to participants. A linear support vector machine classifier was trained to differentiate activation patterns in functional magnetic resonance imaging data to the 2 different percepts. Across the sensory constituents the classifier decoded which percept was perceived. A searchlight analysis localized activation patterns specific to the temporal Gestalt bilaterally to the temporoparietal junction, including the planum temporale and supramarginal gyrus, and unilaterally to the right inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis). We show that auditory areas not only process absolute temporal intervals, but also integrate them into percepts of Gestalt and that encoding of these percepts persists in high-level associative areas. The findings complement existing knowledge regarding the processing of absolute temporal patterns to the processing of relative temporal patterns relevant to the sequential binding of perceptual elements into Gestalt.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

The cochlea not only transduces sound-induced vibration into neural spikes, it also amplifies weak sound to boost its detection. Actuators of this active process are sensory outer hair cells in the organ of Corti, whereas the inner hair cells transduce the resulting motion into electric signals that propagate via the auditory nerve to the brain. However, how the outer hair cells modulate the stimulus to the inner hair cells remains unclear. Here, we combine theoretical modeling and experimental measurements near the cochlear apex to study the way in which length changes of the outer hair cells deform the organ of Corti. We develop a geometry-based kinematic model of the apical organ of Corti that reproduces salient, yet counter-intuitive features of the organ’s motion. Our analysis further uncovers a mechanism by which a static length change of the outer hair cells can sensitively tune the signal transmitted to the sensory inner hair cells. When the outer hair cells are in an elongated state, stimulation of inner hair cells is largely inhibited, whereas outer hair cell contraction leads to a substantial enhancement of sound-evoked motion near the hair bundles. This novel mechanism for regulating the sensitivity of the hearing organ applies to the low frequencies that are most important for the perception of speech and music. We suggest that the proposed mechanism might underlie frequency discrimination at low auditory frequencies, as well as our ability to selectively attend auditory signals in noisy surroundings.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XnGbn1GAfJQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Targeting key regulators of the cancer stem cell phenotype to overcome their critical influence on tumor growth is a promising new strategy for cancer treatment. Here we present a modeling framework that operates at both the cellular and molecular levels, for investigating IL-6 mediated, cancer stem cell driven tumor growth and targeted treatment with anti-IL6 antibodies. Our immediate goal is to quantify the influence of IL-6 on cancer stem cell self-renewal and survival, and to characterize the subsequent impact on tumor growth dynamics. By including the molecular details of IL-6 binding, we are able to quantify the temporal changes in fractional occupancies of bound receptors and their influence on tumor volume. There is a strong correlation between the model output and experimental data for primary tumor xenografts. We also used the model to predict tumor response to administration of the humanized IL-6R monoclonal antibody, tocilizumab (TCZ), and we found that as little as 1mg/kg of TCZ administered weekly for 7 weeks is sufficient to result in tumor reduction and a sustained deceleration of tumor growth.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9hxzc5PneJY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06168</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We study a deterministic version of a one- and two-dimensional attractor
neural network model of hippocampal activity first studied by Itskov et al
2011. We analyze the dynamics of the system on the ring and torus domain with
an even periodized weight matrix, assum- ing weak and slow spike frequency
adaptation and a weak stationary input current. On these domains, we find
transitions from spatially localized stationary solutions (&quot;bumps&quot;) to
(periodically modulated) solutions (&quot;sloshers&quot;), as well as constant and
non-constant velocity traveling bumps depending on the relative strength of
external input current and adaptation. The weak and slow adaptation allows for
a reduction of the system from a distributed partial integro-differential
equation to a system of scalar Volterra integro-differential equations
describing the movement of the centroid of the bump solution. Using this
reduction, we show that on both domains, sloshing solutions arise through an
Andronov-Hopf bifurcation and derive a normal form for the Hopf bifurcation on
the ring. We also show existence and stability of constant velocity solutions
on both domains using Evans functions. In contrast to existing studies, we
assume a general weight matrix of Mexican-hat type in addition to a smooth
firing rate function.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06079</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brains are spatially embedded networks whose architecture has been shaped by
physical and biochemical constraints throughout evolution. While these networks
provide global connectivity and sustain the broad spectrum of the functions of
the brain, the underlying routing strategies for communication between the
different areas and their control remain to be elucidated. Here, we investigate
the flow of information in connectomes of several species using greedy routing
as a distributed navigation protocol. In Euclidean space, in which brains have
evolved, our results unveil that the navigability of brains vary highly across
species. On the one hand, this result may suggest that the more evolved an
organism is, the more the structure of the connectome is encoded in the spatial
organization of the brain. On the other hand, conclusions obtained using
coarse-grained connectomes, where nodes correspond to areas instead of
individual neurones, may not apply to connectomes obtained at the microscopic,
neuronal level. Moreover, we prove that the effective geometry of the brain is
better described as hyperbolic rather than Euclidean. This indicates that other
factors besides degrees and Euclidean distance play a significant role in the
existence of connections. On a more practical perspective, hyperbolic
embeddings offer a universal and meaningful representations to compare brain
networks across species on an equal footing.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Conditions for traveling waves in spiking neural networks. (arXiv:1801.06046v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06046</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spatiotemporal patterns such as traveling waves are frequently observed in
recordings of neural activity. The mechanisms underlying the generation of such
patterns are largely unknown. Previous studies have investigated the existence
and uniqueness of different types of waves or bumps of activity using
neural-field models, phenomenological coarse-grained descriptions of
neural-network dynamics. But it remains unclear how these insights can be
transferred to more biologically realistic networks of spiking neurons, where
individual neurons fire irregularly. Here, we employ mean-field theory to
reduce a microscopic model of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons with
distance-dependent connectivity to an effective neural-field model. In contrast
to existing phenomenological descriptions, the dynamics in this neural-field
model depends on the mean and the variance in the synaptic input, both
determining the amplitude and the temporal structure of the resulting effective
coupling kernel. For the neural-field model we derive conditions for the
existence of spatial and temporal oscillations and periodic traveling waves
using linear stability analysis. We first prove that periodic traveling waves
cannot occur in a single homogeneous population of neurons, irrespective of the
form of distance dependence of the connection probability. Compatible with the
architecture of cortical neural networks, traveling waves emerge in
two-population networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons as a combination
of delay-induced temporal oscillations and spatial oscillations due to
distance-dependent connectivity profiles. Finally, we demonstrate quantitative
agreement between predictions of the analytically tractable neural-field model
and numerical simulations of both networks of nonlinear rate-based units and
networks of LIF neurons.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Threshold of front propagation in neural fields: An interface dynamics approach. (arXiv:1801.05878v1 [nlin.PS])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05878</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural field equations model population dynamics of large-scale networks of
neurons. Wave propagation in neural fields is often studied by constructing
traveling wave solutions in the wave coordinate frame. Nonequilibrium dynamics
are more challenging to study, due to the nonlinearity and nonlocality of
neural fields, whose interactions are described by the kernel of an integral
term. Here, we leverage interface methods to describe the threshold of wave
initiation away from equilibrium. In particular, we focus on traveling front
initiation in an excitatory neural field. In a neural field with a Heaviside
firing rate, neural activity can be described by the dynamics of the
interfaces, where the neural activity is at the firing threshold. This allows
us to derive conditions for the portion of the neural field that must be
activated for traveling fronts to be initiated in a purely excitatory neural
field. Explicit equations are possible for a single active (superthreshold)
region, and special cases of multiple disconnected active regions. The dynamic
spreading speed of the excited region can also be approximated asymptotically.
We also discuss extensions to the problem of finding the critical
spatiotemporal input needed to initiate waves.

The shaping of individual cells requires a tight coordination of cell mechanics and growth. However, it is unclear how information about the mechanical state of the wall is relayed to the molecular processes building it, thereby enabling the coordination of cell wall expansion and assembly during morphogenesis. Combining theoretical and experimental approaches, we show that a mechanical feedback coordinating cell wall assembly and expansion is essential to sustain mating projection growth in budding yeast (&lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;). Our theoretical results indicate that the mechanical feedback provided by the Cell Wall Integrity pathway, with cell wall stress sensors Wsc1 and Mid2 increasingly activating membrane-localized cell wall synthases Fks1/2 upon faster cell wall expansion, stabilizes mating projection growth without affecting cell shape. Experimental perturbation of the osmotic pressure and cell wall mechanics, as well as compromising the mechanical feedback through genetic deletion of the stress sensors, leads to cellular phenotypes that support the theoretical predictions. Our results indicate that while the existence of mechanical feedback is essential to stabilize mating projection growth, the shape and size of the cell are insensitive to the feedback.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HJHfrBF1fQE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Education and training are two essential ingredients for a successful career. On one hand, universities provide students a curriculum for specializing in one’s field of study, and on the other, internships complement coursework and provide invaluable training experience for a fruitful career. Consequently, undergraduates and graduates are encouraged to undertake an internship during the course of their degree. The opportunity to explore one’s research interests in the early stages of their education is important for students because it improves their skill set and gives their career a boost. In the long term, this helps to close the gap between skills and employability among students across the globe and balance the research capacity in the field of computational biology. However, training opportunities are often scarce for computational biology students, particularly for those who reside in less-privileged regions. Aimed at helping students develop research and academic skills in computational biology and alleviating the divide across countries, the Student Council of the International Society for Computational Biology introduced its Internship Program in 2009. The Internship Program is committed to providing access to computational biology training, especially for students from developing regions, and improving competencies in the field. Here, we present how the Internship Program works and the impact of the internship opportunities so far, along with the challenges associated with this program.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6wQOmQXfI-k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Functional optimality of the sulcus pattern of the human brain. (arXiv:1801.05703v2 [physics.bio-ph] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05703</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We develop a mathematical model of information transmission across the
biological neural network of the human brain. The overall function of the brain
consists of the emergent processes resulting from the spread of information
through the neural network. The capacity of the brain is therefore related to
the rate at which it can transmit information through the neural network. The
particular transmission model under consideration allows for information to be
transmitted along multiple paths between points of the cortex. The resulting
transmission rates are governed by potential theory. According to this theory,
the brain has preferred and quantized transmission modes that correspond to
eigenfunctions of the classical Steklov eigenvalue problem, with the reciprocal
eigenvalues quantifying the corresponding transmission rates. We take the model
as a basis for testing the hypothesis that the sulcus pattern of the human
brain has evolved to maximize the rate of transmission of information between
points in the cerebral cortex. We show that the introduction of sulci, or cuts,
in an otherwise smooth domain indeed increases the overall transmission rate.
We demonstrate this result by means of numerical experiments concerned with a
spherical domain with a varying number of slits on its surface.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Permutation relative entropy in quantifying time irreversibility: loss of temporal asymmetries in epileptic EEG. (arXiv:1801.05421v1 [physics.med-ph])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05421</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Permutation relative entropy is proposed to quantify time irreversibility in
our nonlinear dynamics analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG). Ordinal patterns
in multi-dimension phase space of time series are symbolized, and the
probabilistic divergences of all symmetric ordinal pairs are measured by
relative entropy as time irreversibility. Analyzing multi-channel EEG from 18
healthy volunteers and 18 epileptic patients (all in their seize-free
intervals), the derived relative entropy of symmetrical ordinal patterns shows
advantages to other time irreversible parameters and significantly distinguish
two kinds of brain electric signals (the epileptic have lower temporal
asymmetries than the healthy). Test results prove that it is effective to
quantity time irreversibility by measuring probabilistic divergence of
symmetrical ordinal patterns and validate our hypothesis that epilepsy has
lasting impacts on brain' nonlinear dynamics, leading to a decline in brain
signals directional asymmetry or time irreversibility, and the losing temporal
asymmetries stemming from our findings may contribute to the preclinical
diagnosis of epilepsy.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A theory of how active behavior stabilises neural activity: Neural gain modulation by closed-loop environmental feedback</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/Rfk3vZoQIs4/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Christopher L. Buckley, Taro Toyoizumi&lt;/p&gt;

During active behaviours like running, swimming, whisking or sniffing, motor actions shape sensory input and sensory percepts guide future motor commands. Ongoing cycles of sensory and motor processing constitute a closed-loop feedback system which is central to motor control and, it has been argued, for perceptual processes. This closed-loop feedback is mediated by brainwide neural circuits but how the presence of feedback signals impacts on the dynamics and function of neurons is not well understood. Here we present a simple theory suggesting that closed-loop feedback between the brain/body/environment can modulate neural gain and, consequently, change endogenous neural fluctuations and responses to sensory input. We support this theory with modeling and data analysis in two vertebrate systems. First, in a model of rodent whisking we show that negative feedback mediated by whisking vibrissa can suppress coherent neural fluctuations and neural responses to sensory input in the barrel cortex. We argue this suppression provides an appealing account of a &lt;i&gt;brain state transition&lt;/i&gt; (a marked change in global brain activity) coincident with the onset of whisking in rodents. Moreover, this mechanism suggests a novel signal detection mechanism that selectively accentuates &lt;i&gt;active&lt;/i&gt;, rather than &lt;i&gt;passive&lt;/i&gt;, whisker touch signals. This mechanism is consistent with a predictive coding strategy that is sensitive to the consequences of motor actions rather than the difference between the predicted and actual sensory input. We further support the theory by re-analysing previously published two-photon data recorded in zebrafish larvae performing closed-loop optomotor behaviour in a virtual swim simulator. We show, as predicted by this theory, that the degree to which each cell contributes in linking sensory and motor signals well explains how much its neural fluctuations are suppressed by closed-loop optomotor behaviour. More generally we argue that our results demonstrate the dependence of neural fluctuations, across the brain, on closed-loop brain/body/environment interactions strongly supporting the idea that brain function cannot be fully understood through open-loop approaches alone.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Rfk3vZoQIs4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Eligibility Traces and Plasticity on Behavioral Time Scales: Experimental Support of neoHebbian Three-Factor Learning Rules. (arXiv:1801.05219v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05219</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Most elementary behaviors such as moving the arm to grasp an object or
walking into the next room to explore a museum evolve on the time scale of
seconds; in contrast, neuronal action potentials occur on the time scale of a
few milliseconds. Learning rules of the brain must therefore bridge the gap
between these two different time scales.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern theories of synaptic plasticity have postulated that the co-activation
of pre- and postsynaptic neurons sets a flag at the synapse, called an
eligibility trace, that leads to a weight change only if an additional factor
is present while the flag is set. This third factor, signaling reward,
punishment, surprise, or novelty, could be implemented by the phasic activity
of neuromodulators or specific neuronal inputs signaling special events. While
the theoretical framework has been developed over the last decades,
experimental evidence in support of eligibility traces on the time scale of
seconds has been collected only during the last few years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we review, in the context of three-factor rules of synaptic plasticity,
four key experiments that support the role of synaptic eligibility traces in
combination with a third factor as a biological implementation of neoHebbian
three-factor learning rules.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Roles of Left Versus Right Anterior Temporal Lobes in Semantic Memory: A Neuropsychological Comparison of Postsurgical Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Patients</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx362/4812493?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The presence and degree of specialization between the anterior temporal lobes (ATLs) is a key issue in debates about the neural architecture of semantic memory. Here, we comprehensively assessed multiple aspects of semantic cognition in a large group of postsurgical temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients with left versus right anterior temporal lobectomy (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 40). Both subgroups showed deficits in expressive and receptive verbal semantic tasks, word and object recognition, naming and recognition of famous faces and perception of faces and emotions. Graded differences in performance between the left and right groups were secondary to the overall mild semantic impairment; primarily, left resected TLE patients showed weaker performance on tasks that required naming or accessing semantic information from a written word. Right resected TLE patients were relatively more impaired at recognizing famous faces as familiar, although this effect was observed less consistently. These findings unify previous partial, inconsistent results and also align directly with fMRI and transcranial magnetic stimulation results in neurologically intact participants. Taken together, these data support a model in which the 2 ATLs act as a coupled bilateral system for the representation of semantic knowledge, and in which graded hemispheric specializations emerge as a consequence of differential connectivity to lateralized speech production and face perception regions.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Lack of Methyl-CpG Binding Protein 2 (MeCP2) Affects Cell Fate Refinement During Embryonic Cortical Development</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx360/4812492?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;During differentiation, neurons progressively restrict their fate repressing the expression of specific genes. Here we describe the involvement in such developmental steps of the methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), an epigenetic factor that participates to chromatin folding and transcriptional regulation. We previously reported that, due to transcriptional impairments, the maturation of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Mecp2&lt;/span&gt; null neurons is delayed. To evaluate whether this could stem from altered progenitors proliferation and differentiation, we investigated whether lack of Mecp2 affects these features both in vitro and in vivo. We show that in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Mecp2&lt;/span&gt; null embryonic cortexes the expression of genes defining the identity of proliferating neuroprogenitors is enriched and that their permanence in the G1 phase is prolonged. Moreover, the number of cells transitioning from a stage of maturation to a more mature one is increased in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Mecp2&lt;/span&gt; null embryonic cortices, in line with the central role of G1 for cell identity refinement. We thus suggest that, possibly due to the lack of proper transcriptional control normally exerted by Mecp2, fate refinement is impaired in developing null cells. We propose that the maturation delay affecting the developing &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Mecp2&lt;/span&gt; null cortex originates, at least in part, from deranged mechanisms of cell fate refinement.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) are more resilient than those in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in aging, schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s disease. The current study compared glutamate and neuromodulatory actions in macaque V1 to those in dlPFC, and found striking regional differences. V1 neuronal firing to visual stimuli depended on AMPA receptors, with subtle NMDA receptor contributions, while dlPFC depends primarily on NMDA receptors. Neuromodulatory actions also differed between regions. In V1, cAMP signaling increased neuronal firing, and the phosphodiesterase PDE4A was positioned to regulate cAMP effects on glutamate release from axons. HCN channels in V1 were classically located on distal dendrites, and enhanced cell firing. These data contrast with dlPFC, where PDE4A and HCN channels are concentrated in thin spines, and cAMP-HCN signaling gates inputs and weakens firing. These regional differences may explain why V1 neurons are more resilient than dlPFC neurons to the challenges of age and disease.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Haploid cells are increasingly used for screening of complex pathways in animal genomes. Hemizygous mutations introduced through viral insertional mutagenesis can be directly selected for phenotypic changes. Here we present HaSAPPy a tool for analysing sequencing datasets of screens using insertional mutations in large pools of haploid cells. Candidate gene prediction is implemented through identification of enrichment of insertional mutations after selection by simultaneously evaluating several parameters. We have developed HaSAPPy for analysis of genetic screens for silencing factors of X chromosome inactivation in haploid mouse embryonic stem cells. To benchmark the performance, we further analyse several datasets of genetic screens in human haploid cells for which candidates have been validated. Our results support the effective candidate prediction strategy of HaSAPPy. HaSAPPy is implemented in Python, licensed under the MIT license, and is available from https://github.com/gdiminin/HaSAPPy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3K4LRTS9Xj4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The E&lt;sup&gt;2.65&lt;/sup&gt;A mutation disrupts dynamic binding poses of SB269652 at the dopamine D2 and D3 receptors</title>

The dopamine D2 and D3 receptors (D2R and D3R) are important targets for antipsychotics and for the treatment of drug abuse. SB269652, a bitopic ligand that simultaneously binds both the orthosteric binding site (OBS) and a secondary binding pocket (SBP) in both D2R and D3R, was found to be a negative allosteric modulator. Previous studies identified Glu&lt;sup&gt;2.65&lt;/sup&gt; in the SBP to be a key determinant of both the affinity of SB269652 and the magnitude of its cooperativity with orthosteric ligands, as the E&lt;sup&gt;2.65&lt;/sup&gt;A mutation decreased both of these parameters. However, the proposed hydrogen bond (H-bond) between Glu&lt;sup&gt;2.65&lt;/sup&gt; and the indole moiety of SB269652 is not a strong interaction, and a structure activity relationship study of SB269652 indicates that this H-bond may not be the only element that determines its allosteric properties. To understand the structural basis of the observed phenotype of E&lt;sup&gt;2.65&lt;/sup&gt;A, we carried out molecular dynamics simulations with a cumulative length of ~77 μs of D2R and D3R wild-type and their E&lt;sup&gt;2.65&lt;/sup&gt;A mutants bound to SB269652. In combination with Markov state model analysis and by characterizing the equilibria of ligand binding modes in different conditions, we found that in both D2R and D3R, whereas the tetrahydroisoquinoline moiety of SB269652 is stably bound in the OBS, the indole-2-carboxamide moiety is dynamic and only intermittently forms H-bonds with Glu&lt;sup&gt;2.65&lt;/sup&gt;. Our results also indicate that the E&lt;sup&gt;2.65&lt;/sup&gt;A mutation significantly affects the overall shape and size of the SBP, as well as the conformation of the N terminus. Thus, our findings suggest that the key role of Glu&lt;sup&gt;2.65&lt;/sup&gt; in mediating the allosteric properties of SB269652 extends beyond a direct interaction with SB269652, and provide structural insights for rational design of SB269652 derivatives that may retain its allosteric properties.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vUXB3FyjueQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Microbiota contribute to many dimensions of host phenotype, including disease. To link specific microbes to specific phenotypes, microbiome-wide association studies compare microbial abundances between two groups of samples. Abundance differences, however, reflect not only direct associations with the phenotype, but also indirect effects due to microbial interactions. We found that microbial interactions could easily generate a large number of spurious associations that provide no mechanistic insight. Using techniques from statistical physics, we developed a method to remove indirect associations and applied it to the largest dataset on pediatric inflammatory bowel disease. Our method corrected the inflation of p-values in standard association tests and showed that only a small subset of associations is directly linked to the disease. Direct associations had a much higher accuracy in separating cases from controls and pointed to immunomodulation, butyrate production, and the brain-gut axis as important factors in the inflammatory bowel disease.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ghtaTpcnfg4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A dynamical systems approach for estimating phase interactions between rhythms of different frequencies from experimental data</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/2Kx1kMq3n-k/article</link>

Synchronization of neural oscillations as a mechanism of brain function is attracting increasing attention. Neural oscillation is a rhythmic neural activity that can be easily observed by noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG). Neural oscillations show the same frequency and cross-frequency synchronization for various cognitive and perceptual functions. However, it is unclear how this neural synchronization is achieved by a dynamical system. If neural oscillations are weakly coupled oscillators, the dynamics of neural synchronization can be described theoretically using a phase oscillator model. We propose an estimation method to identify the phase oscillator model from real data of cross-frequency synchronized activities. The proposed method can estimate the coupling function governing the properties of synchronization. Furthermore, we examine the reliability of the proposed method using time-series data obtained from numerical simulation and an electronic circuit experiment, and show that our method can estimate the coupling function correctly. Finally, we estimate the coupling function between EEG oscillation and the speech sound envelope, and discuss the validity of these results.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2Kx1kMq3n-k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Inferring cell state by quantitative motility analysis reveals a dynamic state system and broken detailed balance</title>

Cell populations display heterogeneous and dynamic phenotypic states at multiple scales. Similar to molecular features commonly used to explore cell heterogeneity, cell behavior is a rich phenotypic space that may allow for identification of relevant cell states. Inference of cell state from cell behavior across a time course may enable the investigation of dynamics of transitions between heterogeneous cell states, a task difficult to perform with destructive molecular observations. Cell motility is one such easily observed cell behavior with known biomedical relevance. To investigate heterogenous cell states and their dynamics through the lens of cell behavior, we developed Heteromotility, a software tool to extract quantitative motility features from timelapse cell images. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), myoblasts, and muscle stem cells (MuSCs), Heteromotility analysis identifies multiple motility phenotypes within the population. In all three systems, the motility state identity of individual cells is dynamic. Quantification of state transitions reveals that MuSCs undergoing activation transition through progressive motility states toward the myoblast phenotype. Transition rates during MuSC activation suggest non-linear kinetics. By probability flux analysis, we find that this MuSC motility state system breaks detailed balance, while the MEF and myoblast systems do not. Balanced behavior state transitions can be captured by equilibrium formalisms, while unbalanced switching between states violates equilibrium conditions and would require an external driving force. Our data indicate that the system regulating cell behavior can be decomposed into a set of attractor states which depend on the identity of the cell, together with a set of transitions between states. These results support a conceptual view of a cell populations as dynamical systems, responding to inputs from signaling pathways and generating outputs in the form of state transitions and observable motile behaviors.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zgpmnQO7N_w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Ideal decision-makers should constantly assess all sources of information about opportunities and threats, and be able to redetermine their choices promptly in the face of change. However, perpetual monitoring and reassessment impose inordinate sensing and computational costs, making them impractical for animals and machines alike. The obvious alternative of committing for extended periods of time to limited sensory strategies associated with particular courses of action can be dangerous and wasteful. Here, we explore the intermediate possibility of making provisional temporal commitments whilst admitting interruption based on limited broader observation. We simulate foraging under threat of predation to elucidate the benefits of such a scheme. We relate our results to diseases of distractibility and roving attention, and consider mechanistic substrates such as noradrenergic neuromodulation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/k-qhdPPb-R0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A model for cooperative gating of L-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels and its effects on cardiac alternans dynamics</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/bxIzGj3eW-A/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Daisuke Sato, Rose E. Dixon, Luis F. Santana, Manuel F. Navedo&lt;/p&gt;

In ventricular myocytes, membrane depolarization during the action potential (AP) causes synchronous activation of multiple L-type Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 channels (LTCCs), which trigger the release of calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). This results in an increase in intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (Ca&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) that initiates contraction. During &lt;i&gt;pulsus alternans&lt;/i&gt;, cardiac contraction is unstable, going from weak to strong in successive beats despite a constant heart rate. These cardiac alternans can be caused by the instability of membrane potential (V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) due to steep AP duration (APD) restitution (V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;-driven alternans), instability of Ca&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; cycling (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-driven alternans), or both, and may be modulated by functional coupling between clustered Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 (e.g. cooperative gating). Here, mathematical analysis and computational models were used to determine how changes in the strength of cooperative gating between LTCCs may impact membrane voltage and intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dynamics in the heart. We found that increasing the degree of coupling between LTCCs increases the amplitude of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; currents (I&lt;sub&gt;CaL&lt;/sub&gt;) and prolongs AP duration (APD). Increased AP duration is known to promote cardiac alternans, a potentially arrhythmogenic substrate. In addition, our analysis shows that increasing the strength of cooperative activation of LTCCs makes the coupling of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; on the membrane voltage (Ca&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;→V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; coupling) more positive and destabilizes the V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;-Ca&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; dynamics for V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;-driven alternans and Ca&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;-driven alternans, but not for quasiperiodic oscillation. These results suggest that cooperative gating of LTCCs may have a major impact on cardiac excitation-contraction coupling, not only by prolonging APD, but also by altering Ca&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;→V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; coupling and potentially promoting cardiac arrhythmias.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bxIzGj3eW-A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Transcriptome-wide time series expression profiling is used to characterize the cellular response to environmental perturbations. The first step to analyzing transcriptional response data is often to cluster genes with similar responses. Here, we present a nonparametric model-based method, Dirichlet process Gaussian process mixture model (DPGP), which jointly models cluster number with a Dirichlet process and temporal dependencies with Gaussian processes. We demonstrate the accuracy of DPGP in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches using hundreds of simulated data sets. To further test our method, we apply DPGP to published microarray data from a microbial model organism exposed to stress and to novel RNA-seq data from a human cell line exposed to the glucocorticoid dexamethasone. We validate our clusters by examining local transcription factor binding and histone modifications. Our results demonstrate that jointly modeling cluster number and temporal dependencies can reveal shared regulatory mechanisms.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Modeling the assembly order of multimeric heteroprotein complexes</title>

Protein-protein interactions are the cornerstone of numerous biological processes. Although an increasing number of protein complex structures have been determined using experimental methods, relatively fewer studies have been performed to determine the assembly order of complexes. In addition to the insights into the molecular mechanisms of biological function provided by the structure of a complex, knowing the assembly order is important for understanding the process of complex formation. Assembly order is also practically useful for constructing subcomplexes as a step toward solving the entire complex experimentally, designing artificial protein complexes, and developing drugs that interrupt a critical step in the complex assembly. There are several experimental methods for determining the assembly order of complexes; however, these techniques are resource-intensive. Here, we present a computational method that predicts the assembly order of protein complexes by building the complex structure. The method, named Path-LzerD, uses a multimeric protein docking algorithm that assembles a protein complex structure from individual subunit structures and predicts assembly order by observing the simulated assembly process of the complex. Benchmarked on a dataset of complexes with experimental evidence of assembly order, Path-LZerD was successful in predicting the assembly pathway for the majority of the cases. Moreover, when compared with a simple approach that infers the assembly path from the buried surface area of subunits in the native complex, Path-LZerD has the strong advantage that it can be used for cases where the complex structure is not known. The path prediction accuracy decreased when starting from unbound monomers, particularly for larger complexes of five or more subunits, for which only a part of the assembly path was correctly identified. As the first method of its kind, Path-LZerD opens a new area of computational protein structure modeling and will be an indispensable approach for studying protein complexes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mNJcOk2YMNo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Gli2 Rescues Delays in Brain Development Induced by Kif3a Dysfunction</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx356/4802222?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The primary cilium in neural stem cells plays distinct roles in different stages during cortical development. Ciliary dysfunctions in human (i.e., ciliopathy) cause developmental defects in multiple organs, including brain developmental delays, which lead to intellectual disabilities and cognitive deficits. However, effective treatment to this devastating developmental disorder is still lacking. Here, we first investigated the effects of ciliopathy on neural stem cells by knocking down Kif3a, a kinesin II motor required for ciliogenesis, in the neurogenic stage of cortical development by in utero electroporation of mouse embryos. Brains electroporated with Kif3a shRNA showed defects in neuronal migration and differentiation, delays in neural stem cell cycle progression, and failures in interkinetic nuclear migration. Interestingly, introduction of Gli1 and Gli2 both can restore the cell cycle progression by elevating cyclin D1 in neural stem cells. Remarkably, enforced Gli2 expression, but not Gli1, partially restored the ability of Kif3a-knockdown neurons to differentiate and move from the germinal ventricular zone to the cortical plate. Moreover, Cyclin D1 knockdown abolished Gli2’s rescue effect. These findings suggest Gli2 may rescue neural stem cell proliferation, differentiation and migration through Cyclin D1 pathway and may serve as a potential therapeutic target for human ciliopathy syndromes through modulating the progression of neural stem cell cycle.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Rhythmic Spontaneous Activity Mediates the Age-Related Decline in Somatosensory Function</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx349/4802218?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Sensory gating is a neurophysiological process whereby the response to a second stimulus in a pair of identical stimuli is attenuated, and it is thought to reflect the capacity of the CNS to preserve neural resources for behaviorally relevant stimuli. Such gating is observed across multiple sensory modalities and is modulated by age, but the mechanisms involved are not understood. In this study, we examined somatosensory gating in 68 healthy adults using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and advanced oscillatory and time-domain analysis methods. MEG data underwent source reconstruction and peak voxel time series data were extracted to evaluate the dynamics of somatosensory gating, and the impact of spontaneous neural activity immediately preceding the stimulation. We found that gating declined with increasing age and that older adults had significantly reduced gating relative to younger adults, suggesting impaired local inhibitory function. Most importantly, older adults had significantly elevated spontaneous activity preceding the stimulation, and this effect fully mediated the impact of aging on sensory gating. In conclusion, gating in the somatosensory system declines with advancing age and this effect is directly tied to increased spontaneous neural activity in the primary somatosensory cortices, which is likely secondary to age-related declines in local GABA inhibitory function.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Roles of Subdivisions of Human Insula in Emotion Perception and Auditory Processing</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx334/4802217?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Previous studies have shown insular activations involving sensory, motor, and affective processing. However, the functional roles of subdivisions within the human insula are still not well understood. In the present study, we used intracranial electroencephalography and electrical cortical stimulation to investigate the causal roles of subdivisions of the insula in auditory emotion perception in epilepsy patients implanted with depth electrodes in this brain region. The posterior and the anterior subdivisions of the human insula, identified based on structural and functional analyses, showed distinct response properties to auditory emotional stimuli. The posterior insula showed auditory responses that resemble those observed in Heschl’s gyrus, whereas the anterior insula (AI) responded to the emotional contents of the auditory stimuli in a similar way as observed in the amygdala. Furthermore, the degree of the differentiation between various emotion types increased from the posterior to the AI. Our findings suggest different roles played by the two regions of the human insula and a transformation from sensory to affective representations in auditory modality along the posterior-to-anterior axis in the human insula.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

In this Review, Mattson and colleagues discuss how intermittent metabolic switching impacts brain function and vulnerability to injury and disease.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nrn/rss/current/~4/8H9Q5L93JbM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

In this perspective, Crunelli and colleagues propose that thalamic oscillations of these low-vigilance states also have a plasticity function that modifies the strength of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in local neuronal assemblies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nrn/rss/current/~4/OOC4hJI4h9Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Morphological and Functional Characterization of Non-fast-Spiking GABAergic Interneurons in Layer 4 Microcircuitry of Rat Barrel Cortex</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx352/4796916?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;GABAergic interneurons are notorious for their heterogeneity, despite constituting a small fraction of the neuronal population in the neocortex. Classification of interneurons is crucial for understanding their widespread cortical functions as they provide a complex and dynamic network, balancing excitation and inhibition. Here, we investigated different types of non-fast-spiking (nFS) interneurons in Layer 4 (L4) of rat barrel cortex using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings with biocytin-filling. Based on a quantitative analysis on a combination of morphological and electrophysiological parameters, we identified 5 distinct types of L4 nFS interneurons: 1) &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;trans-columnar projecting interneurons,&lt;/span&gt;2) &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;locally projecting non-Martinotti-like interneurons,&lt;/span&gt; 3) &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;supra-granular projecting Martinotti-like interneurons,&lt;/span&gt;4) &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;intra-columnar projecting VIP-like interneurons&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;5) &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;locally projecting neurogliaform-like interneurons.&lt;/span&gt; Trans-columnar projecting interneurons are one of the most striking interneuron types, which have not been described so far in Layer 4. They feature extensive axonal collateralization not only in their home barrel but also in adjacent barrels. Furthermore, we identified that most of the L4 nFS interneurons express somatostatin, while few are positive for the transcription factor Prox1. The morphological and electrophysiological characterization of different L4 nFS interneuron types presented here provides insights into their synaptic connectivity and functional role in cortical information processing.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Reassessing the Evidence for Capacity Limits in Neural Signals Related to Working Memory</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx351/4796921?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;In 2004, two landmark studies described the discovery of brain imaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography) signals that increase with the number of items held in visual working memory (WM). These studies claimed that the signals leveled off (plateaued) once the number of memoranda reached the capacity of WM, as estimated by the prevailing model of the time. However, alternative models were not considered, and changing concepts of WM in the more than a decade since these studies were published necessitate a re-evaluation of their findings; newer models that provide the most accurate account of behavioral data do not incorporate a fixed limit on the number of items stored. Furthermore, an important claim made about the original studies, that signals plateau at each individual’s estimated capacity, has never been tested. Here, we pit the plateau model of signal strength against an alternative, saturation model, a biophysically plausible account in which signals increase continuously without plateau. We show that the saturation model provides a better description of the original data, challenging the assumption that imaging results provide evidence for a fixed item limit in WM.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Mechanisms of Memory Disruption in Depression</title>
	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30250-3?rss=yes</link>
	<content:encoded>Depressed individuals typically show poor memory for positive events, potentiated memory for negative events, and impaired recollection. These phenomena are clinically important but poorly understood. Compelling links between stress and depression suggest promising candidate mechanisms. Stress can suppress hippocampal neurogenesis, inhibit dopamine neurons, and sensitize the amygdala. We argue that these phenomena may impair pattern separation, disrupt the encoding of positive experiences, and bias retrieval toward negative events, respectively, thus recapitulating core aspects of memory disruption in depression.</content:encoded>
