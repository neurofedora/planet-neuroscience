	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Measuring the Complexity of Consciousness. (arXiv:1801.03880v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03880</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The quest for a scientific description of consciousness has given rise to new
theoretical and empirical paradigms for the investigation of phenomenological
contents as well as clinical disorders of consciousness. An outstanding
challenge in the field is to develop measures that uniquely quantify global
brain states tied to consciousness. In particular, information-theoretic
complexity measures such as integrated information have recently been proposed
as measures of conscious awareness. This suggests a new framework to
quantitatively classify states of consciousness. However, it has proven
increasingly difficult to apply these complexity measures to realistic brain
networks. In part, this is due to high computational costs incurred when
implementing these measures on realistically large network dimensions.
Nonetheless, complexity measures for quantifying states of consciousness are
important for assisting clinical diagnosis and therapy. This article is meant
to serve as a lookup table of measures of consciousness, with particular
emphasis on clinical applicability of these measures. We consider both,
principle-based complexity measures as well as empirical measures tested on
patients. We address challenges facing these measures with regard to realistic
brain networks, and where necessary, suggest possible resolutions.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Deep Classification of Epileptic Signals. (arXiv:1801.03610v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03610</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electrophysiological observation plays a major role in epilepsy evaluation.
However, human interpretation of brain signals is subjective and prone to
misdiagnosis. Automating this process, especially seizure detection relying on
scalp-based Electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial EEG, has been the
focus of research over recent decades. Nevertheless, its numerous challenges
have inhibited a definitive solution. Inspired by recent advances in deep
learning, we propose a new classification approach for EEG time series based on
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) via the use of Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM)
networks. The proposed deep network effectively learns and models
discriminative temporal patterns from EEG sequential data. Especially, the
features are automatically discovered from the raw EEG data without any
pre-processing step, eliminating humans from laborious feature design task. We
also show that, in the epilepsy scenario, simple architectures can achieve
competitive performance. Using simple architectures significantly benefits in
the practical scenario considering their low computation complexity and reduced
requirement for large training datasets. Using a public dataset, a multi-fold
cross-validation scheme exhibited an average validation accuracy of 95.54\% and
an average AUC of 0.9582 of the ROC curve among all sets defined in the
experiment. This work reinforces the benefits of deep learning to be further
attended in clinical applications and neuroscientific research.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Gli2 Rescues Delays in Brain Development Induced by Kif3a Dysfunction</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx356/4802222?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The primary cilium in neural stem cells plays distinct roles in different stages during cortical development. Ciliary dysfunctions in human (i.e., ciliopathy) cause developmental defects in multiple organs, including brain developmental delays, which lead to intellectual disabilities and cognitive deficits. However, effective treatment to this devastating developmental disorder is still lacking. Here, we first investigated the effects of ciliopathy on neural stem cells by knocking down Kif3a, a kinesin II motor required for ciliogenesis, in the neurogenic stage of cortical development by in utero electroporation of mouse embryos. Brains electroporated with Kif3a shRNA showed defects in neuronal migration and differentiation, delays in neural stem cell cycle progression, and failures in interkinetic nuclear migration. Interestingly, introduction of Gli1 and Gli2 both can restore the cell cycle progression by elevating cyclin D1 in neural stem cells. Remarkably, enforced Gli2 expression, but not Gli1, partially restored the ability of Kif3a-knockdown neurons to differentiate and move from the germinal ventricular zone to the cortical plate. Moreover, Cyclin D1 knockdown abolished Gli2’s rescue effect. These findings suggest Gli2 may rescue neural stem cell proliferation, differentiation and migration through Cyclin D1 pathway and may serve as a potential therapeutic target for human ciliopathy syndromes through modulating the progression of neural stem cell cycle.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Rhythmic Spontaneous Activity Mediates the Age-Related Decline in Somatosensory Function</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx349/4802218?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Sensory gating is a neurophysiological process whereby the response to a second stimulus in a pair of identical stimuli is attenuated, and it is thought to reflect the capacity of the CNS to preserve neural resources for behaviorally relevant stimuli. Such gating is observed across multiple sensory modalities and is modulated by age, but the mechanisms involved are not understood. In this study, we examined somatosensory gating in 68 healthy adults using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and advanced oscillatory and time-domain analysis methods. MEG data underwent source reconstruction and peak voxel time series data were extracted to evaluate the dynamics of somatosensory gating, and the impact of spontaneous neural activity immediately preceding the stimulation. We found that gating declined with increasing age and that older adults had significantly reduced gating relative to younger adults, suggesting impaired local inhibitory function. Most importantly, older adults had significantly elevated spontaneous activity preceding the stimulation, and this effect fully mediated the impact of aging on sensory gating. In conclusion, gating in the somatosensory system declines with advancing age and this effect is directly tied to increased spontaneous neural activity in the primary somatosensory cortices, which is likely secondary to age-related declines in local GABA inhibitory function.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx334/4802217?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Previous studies have shown insular activations involving sensory, motor, and affective processing. However, the functional roles of subdivisions within the human insula are still not well understood. In the present study, we used intracranial electroencephalography and electrical cortical stimulation to investigate the causal roles of subdivisions of the insula in auditory emotion perception in epilepsy patients implanted with depth electrodes in this brain region. The posterior and the anterior subdivisions of the human insula, identified based on structural and functional analyses, showed distinct response properties to auditory emotional stimuli. The posterior insula showed auditory responses that resemble those observed in Heschl’s gyrus, whereas the anterior insula (AI) responded to the emotional contents of the auditory stimuli in a similar way as observed in the amygdala. Furthermore, the degree of the differentiation between various emotion types increased from the posterior to the AI. Our findings suggest different roles played by the two regions of the human insula and a transformation from sensory to affective representations in auditory modality along the posterior-to-anterior axis in the human insula.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Identifying human diamine sensors for death related putrescine and cadaverine molecules</title>

Pungent chemical compounds originating from decaying tissue are strong drivers of animal behavior. Two of the best-characterized death smell components are putrescine (PUT) and cadaverine (CAD), foul-smelling molecules produced by decarboxylation of amino acids during decomposition. These volatile polyamines act as ‘necromones’, triggering avoidance or attractive responses, which are fundamental for the survival of a wide range of species. The few studies that have attempted to identify the cognate receptors for these molecules have suggested the involvement of the seven-helix trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs), localized in the olfactory epithelium. However, very little is known about the precise chemosensory receptors that sense these compounds in the majority of organisms and the molecular basis of their interactions. In this work, we have used computational strategies to characterize the binding between PUT and CAD with the TAAR6 and TAAR8 human receptors. Sequence analysis, homology modeling, docking and molecular dynamics studies suggest a tandem of negatively charged aspartates in the binding pocket of these receptors which are likely to be involved in the recognition of these small biogenic diamines.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ACfXAu-7iOM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The development of tracking methods for automatically quantifying individual behavior and social interactions in animal groups has open up new perspectives for building quantitative and predictive models of collective behavior. In this work, we combine extensive data analyses with a modeling approach to measure, disentangle, and reconstruct the actual functional form of interactions involved in the coordination of swimming in Rummy-nose tetra (&lt;i&gt;Hemigrammus rhodostomus&lt;/i&gt;). This species of fish performs burst-and-coast swimming behavior that consists of sudden heading changes combined with brief accelerations followed by quasi-passive, straight decelerations. We quantify the spontaneous stochastic behavior of a fish and the interactions that govern wall avoidance and the reaction to a neighboring fish, the latter by exploiting general symmetry constraints for the interactions. In contrast with previous experimental works, we find that both attraction and alignment behaviors control the reaction of fish to a neighbor. We then exploit these results to build a model of spontaneous burst-and-coast swimming and interactions of fish, with all parameters being estimated or directly measured from experiments. This model quantitatively reproduces the key features of the motion and spatial distributions observed in experiments with a single fish and with two fish. This demonstrates the power of our method that exploits large amounts of data for disentangling and fully characterizing the interactions that govern collective behaviors in animals groups.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FrGkfbLqiNY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Assessing an effective undergraduate module teaching applied bioinformatics to biology students</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/8EoH1CnNvgc/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Andreas Madlung&lt;/p&gt;

Applied bioinformatics skills are becoming ever more indispensable for biologists, yet incorporation of these skills into the undergraduate biology curriculum is lagging behind, in part due to a lack of instructors willing and able to teach basic bioinformatics in classes that don’t specifically focus on quantitative skill development, such as statistics or computer sciences. To help undergraduate course instructors who themselves did not learn bioinformatics as part of their own education and are hesitant to plunge into teaching big data analysis, a module was developed that is written in plain-enough language, using publicly available computing tools and data, to allow novice instructors to teach next-generation sequence analysis to upper-level undergraduate students. To determine if the module allowed students to develop a better understanding of and appreciation for applied bioinformatics, various tools were developed and employed to assess the impact of the module. This article describes both the module and its assessment. Students found the activity valuable for their education and, in focus group discussions, emphasized that they saw a need for more and earlier instruction of big data analysis as part of the undergraduate biology curriculum.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8EoH1CnNvgc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Alternative diagnostic criteria for idiopathic hypersomnia: A 32-hour protocol</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25141</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: To assess the diagnostic value of extended sleep duration on a controlled 32-hour bed-rest protocol in idiopathic hypersomnia (IH).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: 116 patients with high suspicion of IH (37 clear-cut-IH according to multiple sleep latency test criteria and 79 probable-IH), 32 with hypersomnolence associated with a comorbid disorder (non-IH) and 21 controls underwent a polysomnography, modified-sleep latency tests and a 32-h bed-rest protocol. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to find optimal total sleep time (TST) cut-off values on various periods that discriminate patients to controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: TST was longer in patients with clear-cut-IH than other groups (probable-IH, non-IH and controls) and in patients with probable-IH than non-IH and controls. TST cut-off best discriminating clear-cut-IH and controls was 19h for the 32-h recording (sensitivity 91.9%, specificity 85.7%) and 12h (100%, 85.7%) for the first 24h. The 19-h cut-off displayed a specificity and sensitivity of 91.9% and 81.2% between IH and non-IH patients. Patients with IH above the 19h cut-off were overweight, had more sleep inertia and higher TST on all periods compared to patients below 19h, while no differences were found for the 12h cut-off. An inverse correlation was found between the mean sleep latency and TST during 32-h recording in IH patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: In standardized and controlled stringent conditions, the optimal cut-off best discriminating patients to controls was 19h over 32-h that allows a clear-cut phenotypical characterization of major interest for research purposes. Sleepier patients on MSLT were also the more severe in terms of extended sleep. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: [18F]AV-1451 clustering of entorhinal and cortical uptake in Alzheimer's disease</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25142</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: To use a cluster analysis of [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV-1451 tau-PET data to determine how subjects with Alzheimer's disease vary in the relative involvement of the entorhinal cortex and neocortex, and determine whether relative involvement of these two regions can help explain variability in age and clinical phenotype in Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;METHODS: We calculated [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV-1451 uptake in entorhinal cortex and neocortex in 62 amyloid-positive Alzheimer's disease patients (39 typical and 23 atypical presentation). Tau-PET values were normalized to the cerebellum to create SUVRs. Tau-PET SUVRs were log-transformed and clustered blinded to clinical information into three groups using K-median cluster analysis. Demographics, clinical phenotype, cognitive performance, and apolipoprotein e4 frequency were compared across clusters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;RESULTS: The cluster analysis identified a cluster with low entorhinal and cortical uptake (E&lt;sup&gt;Lo&lt;/sup&gt;/C&lt;sup&gt;Lo&lt;/sup&gt;), one with low entorhinal but high cortical uptake (E&lt;sup&gt;Lo&lt;/sup&gt;/C&lt;sup&gt;Hi&lt;/sup&gt;), and one with high cortical and entorhinal uptake (E&lt;sup&gt;Hi&lt;/sup&gt;/C&lt;sup&gt;Hi&lt;/sup&gt;). Clinical phenotype differed across clusters, with typical AD most commonly observed in the E&lt;sup&gt;Lo&lt;/sup&gt;/C&lt;sup&gt;Lo&lt;/sup&gt; and E&lt;sup&gt;Hi&lt;/sup&gt;/C&lt;sup&gt;Hi&lt;/sup&gt; clusters, and atypical AD most commonly observed in the E&lt;sup&gt;Lo&lt;/sup&gt;/C&lt;sup&gt;Hi&lt;/sup&gt; cluster. The E&lt;sup&gt;Lo&lt;/sup&gt;/C&lt;sup&gt;Lo&lt;/sup&gt; cluster had an older age at PET and onset than the other clusters. The apolipoprotein e4 frequency was lower in the E&lt;sup&gt;Lo&lt;/sup&gt;/C&lt;sup&gt;Hi&lt;/sup&gt; cluster. The E&lt;sup&gt;Hi&lt;/sup&gt;/C&lt;sup&gt;Hi&lt;/sup&gt; cluster had the worst memory impairment, while the E&lt;sup&gt;Lo&lt;/sup&gt;/C&lt;sup&gt;Hi&lt;/sup&gt; cluster had the worst impairment in non-memory domains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;INTERPRETATION: This study demonstrates considerable variability in [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV-1451 tau-PET uptake in AD, but shows that a straight-forward clustering based on entorhinal and cortical uptake maps well onto age and clinical presentation in AD.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Prognostication of disorders of consciousness using brain functional networks and clinical features. (arXiv:1801.03268v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03268</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Disorders of consciousness are a heterogeneous mixture of different diseases
or injuries. Although some indicators and models have been proposed for
prognostication, any single method when used alone carries a high risk of false
prediction. This study aimed to investigate whether a multivariable paradigm
that combined resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging and clinical
characteristics could predict the outcome at an individual level and identify
the patient who would later recover consciousness. Three datasets comprising a
total of 112 patients with disorders of consciousness from two medical centers
in China were involved in the study. Of the three datasets, one was used as the
training dataset to establish a prediction model, and the other two were used
only for validation. Combining the features extracted from the resting state
functional magnetic resonance imaging and three clinical characteristics, i.e.
etiology, incidence age and duration of unconsciousness, we built a regression
model to predict the prognosis of the patients at the individual level. Each
patient was then classified based on whether or not they were expected to
recover consciousness. The classification accuracy was assessed by comparing
these results with the actual outcome during at least 12 months follow-up. The
model discriminated between patients who would later recover consciousness and
those who would not with an accuracy of around 90%. Notably, our method could
accurately identify the patients who were initially diagnosed as being in a
vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome but subsequently recovered
consciousness. The presented model was also able to identify the prognostic
importance of different predictors, including brain functions and clinical
characteristics. We therefore suggest that this novel multivariable prognostic
model is accurate, robust, and interpretable.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Data-driven approaches improve Tau-PET biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/244574v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective: Previous positron emission tomography (PET) studies have quantified filamentous tau pathology using regions-of-interest (ROIs) based on observations of the topographical distribution of neurofibrillary tangles in post-mortem tissue. However, such approaches may not take full advantage of information contained in neuroimaging data. The present study employs an unsupervised data-driven method to identify spatial patterns of tau-PET distribution, and to compare these patterns to previously published &quot;pathology-driven&quot; ROIs. Method: Tau-PET patterns were identified from a discovery sample comprised of 123 normal controls and patients with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia from the Swedish BioFINDER cohort, who underwent [18F]AV1451 PET scanning. Associations with cognition were tested in a separate sample of 90 individuals from ADNI. BioFINDER [18F]AV1451 images were entered into a voxelwise clustering algorithm, which resulted in five clusters. Mean [18F]AV1451 uptake in the data-driven, clusters and 35 previously published pathology-driven ROIs, was extracted from ADNI [18F]AV1451 scans. We performed linear models comparing [18F]AV1451 signal across all 40 ROIs to Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, adjusting for age, sex and education. Results: Significant relationships emerged only in two ROIs, both of which were data-driven. Inputting all regions plus demographics into a feature selection routine resulted in selection of three ROIs (two data-driven, one pathology-driven) and education, which together explained 25% of variance in MMSE scores. These results generalized to other tests of global cognition. Interpretation: Our findings suggest that hypothesis-free, data-derived ROIs may offer enhanced clinical utility compared to theory-driven ROIs, by utilizing information specific to tau-PET signal.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Bayesian inference of phylogenetic networks from bi-allelic genetic markers</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/7jukor-zhbs/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Jiafan Zhu, Dingqiao Wen, Yun Yu, Heidi M. Meudt, Luay Nakhleh&lt;/p&gt;

Phylogenetic networks are rooted, directed, acyclic graphs that model reticulate evolutionary histories. Recently, statistical methods were devised for inferring such networks from either gene tree estimates or the sequence alignments of multiple unlinked loci. Bi-allelic markers, most notably single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), provide a powerful source of genome-wide data. In a recent paper, a method called SNAPP was introduced for statistical inference of species trees from unlinked bi-allelic markers. The generative process assumed by the method combined both a model of evolution for the bi-allelic markers, as well as the multispecies coalescent. A novel component of the method was a polynomial-time algorithm for exact computation of the likelihood of a fixed species tree via integration over all possible gene trees for a given marker. Here we report on a method for Bayesian inference of phylogenetic networks from bi-allelic markers. Our method significantly extends the algorithm for exact computation of phylogenetic network likelihood via integration over all possible gene trees. Unlike the case of species trees, the algorithm is no longer polynomial-time on all instances of phylogenetic networks. Furthermore, the method utilizes a reversible-jump MCMC technique to sample the posterior of phylogenetic networks given bi-allelic marker data. Our method has a very good performance in terms of accuracy and robustness as we demonstrate on simulated data, as well as a data set of multiple New Zealand species of the plant genus &lt;i&gt;Ourisia&lt;/i&gt; (Plantaginaceae). We implemented the method in the publicly available, open-source PhyloNet software package.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7jukor-zhbs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Distinct Roles of Different Presynaptic and Postsynaptic NCAM Isoforms in Early Motoneuron-Myotube Interactions Required for Functional Synapse Formation</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/2/498?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) is expressed both presynaptically and postsynaptically during neuromuscular junction formation. Genetic deletion in mice of all three isoforms (180, 140, and 120 kDa), or just the 180 isoform, suggested that different isoforms played distinct roles in synaptic maturation. Here we characterized in mice of either sex the earliest adhesive contacts between the growth cones of motoneurons and myotubes and their subsequent maturation into functional synapses in cocultures of motoneurons and myotubes, which expressed their normal complement of NCAM isoforms, or were lacking all isoforms either presynaptically or postsynaptically. Growth cone contact with +/+ mouse myotubes resulted in immediate adhesive contacts and the rapid downregulation of growth cone motility. When contacting NCAM&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; myotubes, growth cones touched and retracted/collapsed multiple times and failed to form stable contacts, even after 10 h. Exogenous expression in myotubes of either the 180 or 140 isoform, but not the 120 kDa isoform, rescued the rapid formation of stable contacts, the accumulation of presynaptic and postsynaptic molecules, and functional transmission. When NCAM was absent only in motoneurons, growth cones did not retract upon myotube contact, but, since their motility was not downregulated, they grew off the ends of the myotubes, failing to form synapses. The agrin receptor Lrp4 was strongly downregulated in NCAM-negative myotubes, and motoneuron growth cones did not make stable contacts with Lrp4-negative myotubes. These studies have identified novel roles for presynaptic and postsynaptic NCAM in mediating early cell–cell interactions required for synapse formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Although many molecular signals needed to form the functionally effective neuromuscular synapses required for normal movement have been described, the earliest signals that let motoneuron growth cones make stable adhesive contacts with myotubes and cease motility are not well understood. Using dynamic imaging of motoneuron–myotube cocultures, we show that NCAM is required on both the growth cone and myotube and that different NCAM isoforms mediate initial adhesion and the downregulation of growth cone motility. The agrin receptor Lrp4 was also essential for initial adhesive contacts and was downregulated on NCAM&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; myotubes. Our identification of novel roles for NCAM and Lrp4 and possible interactions between them in transforming motile growth cones into stable contacts opens interesting new avenues for exploration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Amphetamine Reverses Escalated Cocaine Intake via Restoration of Dopamine Transporter Conformation</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/2/484?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cocaine abuse disrupts dopamine system function, and reduces cocaine inhibition of the dopamine transporter (DAT), which results in tolerance. Although tolerance is a hallmark of cocaine addiction and a DSM-V criterion for substance abuse disorders, the molecular adaptations producing tolerance are unknown, and testing the impact of DAT changes on drug taking behaviors has proven difficult. In regard to treatment, amphetamine has shown efficacy in reducing cocaine intake; however, the mechanisms underlying these effects have not been explored. The goals of this study were twofold; we sought to (1) identify the molecular mechanisms by which cocaine exposure produces tolerance and (2) determine whether amphetamine-induced reductions in cocaine intake are connected to these mechanisms. Using cocaine self-administration and fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in male rats, we show that low-dose, continuous amphetamine treatment, during self-administration or abstinence, completely reversed cocaine tolerance. Amphetamine treatment also reversed escalated cocaine intake and decreased motivation to obtain cocaine as measured in a behavioral economics task, thereby linking tolerance to multiple facets of cocaine use. Finally, using fluorescence resonance energy transfer imaging, we found that cocaine tolerance is associated with the formation of DAT-DAT complexes, and that amphetamine disperses these complexes. In addition to extending our basic understanding of DATs and their role in cocaine reinforcement, we serendipitously identified a novel therapeutic target: DAT oligomer complexes. We show that dispersion of oligomers is concomitant with reduced cocaine intake, and propose that pharmacotherapeutics aimed at these complexes may have potential for cocaine addiction treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Tolerance to cocaine's subjective effects is a cardinal symptom of cocaine addiction and a DSM-V criterion for substance abuse disorders. However, elucidating the molecular adaptions that produce tolerance and determining its behavioral impact have proven difficult. Using cocaine self-administration in rats, we link tolerance to cocaine effects at the dopamine transporter (DAT) with aberrant cocaine-taking behaviors. Further, tolerance was associated with multi-DAT complexes, which formed after cocaine exposure. Treatment with amphetamine deconstructed DAT complexes, reversed tolerance, and decreased cocaine seeking. These data describe the behavioral consequence of cocaine tolerance, provide a putative mechanism for its development, and suggest that compounds that disperse DAT complexes may be efficacious treatments for cocaine addiction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Zinc Inhibits TRPV1 to Alleviate Chemotherapy-Induced Neuropathic Pain</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/2/474?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Zinc is a transition metal that has a long history of use as an anti-inflammatory agent. It also soothes pain sensations in a number of animal models. However, the effects and mechanisms of zinc on chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy remain unknown. Here we show that locally injected zinc markedly reduces neuropathic pain in male and female mice induced by paclitaxel, a chemotherapy drug, in a TRPV1-dependent manner. Extracellularly applied zinc also inhibits the function of TRPV1 expressed in HEK293 cells and mouse DRG neurons, which requires the presence of zinc-permeable TRPA1 to mediate entry of zinc into the cytoplasm. Moreover, TRPA1 is required for zinc-induced inhibition of TRPV1-mediated acute nociception. Unexpectedly, zinc transporters, but not TRPA1, are required for zinc-induced inhibition of TRPV1-dependent chronic neuropathic pain produced by paclitaxel. Together, our study demonstrates a novel mechanism underlying the analgesic effect of zinc on paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain that relies on the function of TRPV1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy is a major limiting factor affecting the chemotherapy patients. There is no effective treatment available currently. We demonstrate that zinc prevents paclitaxel-induced mechanical hypersensitivity via inhibiting the TRPV1 channel, which is involved in the sensitization of peripheral nociceptors in chemotherapy. Zinc transporters in DRG neurons are required for the entry of zinc into the intracellular side, where it inhibits TRPV1. Our study provides insight into the mechanism underlying the pain-soothing effect of zinc and suggests that zinc could be developed to therapeutics for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Brainstem Pain-Control Circuitry Connectivity in Chronic Neuropathic Pain</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/2/465?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Preclinical investigations have suggested that altered functioning of brainstem pain-modulation circuits may be crucial for the maintenance of some chronic pain conditions. While some human psychophysical studies show that patients with chronic pain display altered pain-modulation efficacy, it remains unknown whether brainstem pain-modulation circuits are altered in individuals with chronic pain. The aim of the present investigation was to determine whether, in humans, chronic pain following nerve injury is associated with altered ongoing functioning of the brainstem descending modulation systems. Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found that male and female patients with chronic neuropathic orofacial pain show increased functional connectivity between the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) and other brainstem pain-modulatory regions, including the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) and locus ceruleus (LC). We also identified an increase in RVM functional connectivity with the region that receives orofacial nociceptor afferents, the spinal trigeminal nucleus. In addition, the vlPAG and LC displayed increased functional connectivity strengths with higher brain regions, including the hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, and anterior cingulate cortex, in individuals with chronic pain. These data reveal that chronic pain is associated with altered ongoing functioning within the endogenous pain-modulation network. These changes may underlie enhanced descending facilitation of processing at the primary synapse, resulting in increased nociceptive transmission to higher brain centers. Further, our findings show that higher brain regions interact with the brainstem modulation system differently in chronic pain, possibly reflecting top–down engagement of the circuitry alongside altered reward processing in pain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Experimental animal models and human psychophysical studies suggest that altered functioning of brainstem pain-modulation systems contributes to the maintenance of chronic pain. However, the function of this circuitry has not yet been explored in humans with chronic pain. In this study, we report that individuals with orofacial neuropathic pain show altered functional connectivity between regions within the brainstem pain-modulation network. We suggest that these changes reflect largely central mechanisms that feed back onto the primary nociceptive synapse and enhance the transfer of noxious information to higher brain regions, thus contributing to the constant perception of pain. Identifying the mechanisms responsible for the maintenance of neuropathic pain is imperative for the development of more efficacious therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Disrupted Neuroglial Metabolic Coupling after Peripheral Surgery</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/2/452?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Immune-related events in the periphery can remotely affect brain function, contributing to neurodegenerative processes and cognitive decline. In mice, peripheral surgery induces a systemic inflammatory response associated with changes in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and transient cognitive decline, however, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here we investigated the effect of peripheral surgery on neuronal-glial function within hippocampal neuronal circuits of relevance to cognitive processing in male mice at 6, 24, and 72 h postsurgery. At 6 h we detect the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 in the hippocampus, followed up by alterations in the mRNA and protein expression of astrocytic and neuronal proteins necessary for optimal energy supply to the brain and for the reuptake and recycling of glutamate in the synapse. Similarly, at 24 h postsurgery the mRNA expression of structural proteins (GFAP and AQP4) was compromised. At this time point, functional analysis in astrocytes revealed a decrease in resting calcium signaling. Examination of neuronal activity by whole-cell patch-clamp shows elevated levels of glutamatergic transmission and changes in AMPA receptor subunit composition at 72 h postsurgery. Finally, lactate, an essential energy substrate produced by astrocytes and critical for memory formation, decreases at 6 and 72 h after surgery. Based on temporal parallels with our previous studies, we propose that the previously reported cognitive decline observed at 72 h postsurgery in mice might be the consequence of temporal hippocampal metabolic, structural, and functional changes in astrocytes that lead to a disruption of the neuroglial metabolic coupling and consequently to a neuronal dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; A growing body of evidence suggests that surgical trauma launches a systemic inflammatory response that reaches the brain and associates with immune activation and cognitive decline. Understanding the mechanisms by which immune-related events in the periphery can influence brain processes is essential for the development of therapies to prevent or treat postoperative cognitive dysfunction and other forms of cognitive decline related to immune-to-brain communication, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Here we describe the temporal orchestration of a series of metabolic, structural, and functional changes after aseptic trauma in mice related to astrocytes and later in neurons that emphasize the role of astrocytes as key intermediaries between peripheral immune events, neuronal processing, and potentially cognition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Restoring Serotonergic Homeostasis in the Lateral Hypothalamus Rescues Sleep Disturbances Induced by Early-Life Obesity</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/2/441?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Early-life obesity predisposes to obesity in adulthood, a condition with broad medical implications including sleep disorders, which can exacerbate metabolic disturbances and disrupt cognitive and affective behaviors. In this study, we examined the long-term impact of transient peripubertal diet-induced obesity (ppDIO, induced between 4 and 10 weeks of age) on sleep–wake behavior in male mice. EEG and EMG recordings revealed that ppDIO increases sleep during the active phase but reduces resting-phase sleep quality. This impaired sleep phenotype persisted for up to 1 year, although animals were returned to a non-obesiogenic diet from postnatal week 11 onwards. To better understand the mechanisms responsible for the ppDIO-induced alterations in sleep, we focused on the lateral hypothalamus (LH). Mice exposed to ppDIO did not show altered mRNA expression levels of orexin and melanin-concentrating hormone, two peptides that are important for sleep–wake behavior and food intake. Conversely, the LH of ppDIO-exposed mice had reduced contents of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), a neurotransmitter involved in both sleep–wake and satiety regulation. Interestingly, an acute peripheral injection of the satiety-signaling peptide YY 3–36 increased 5-HT turnover in the LH and ameliorated the ppDIO-induced sleep disturbances, suggesting the therapeutic potential of this peptide. These findings provide new insights into how sleep–wake behavior is programmed during early life and how peripheral and central signals are integrated to coordinate sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Adult physiology and behavior are strongly influenced by dynamic reorganization of the brain during puberty. The present work shows that obesity during puberty leads to persistently dysregulated patterns of sleep and wakefulness by blunting serotonergic signaling in the lateral hypothalamus. It also shows that pharmacological mimicry of satiety with peptide YY&lt;sub&gt;3–36&lt;/sub&gt; can reverse this neurochemical imbalance and acutely restore sleep composition. These findings add insight into how innate behaviors such as feeding and sleep are integrated and suggest a novel mechanism through which diet-induced obesity during puberty imposes its long-lasting effects on sleep–wake behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Modulation of Ether-a-Go-Go Related Gene (ERG) Current Governs Intrinsic Persistent Activity in Rodent Neocortical Pyramidal Cells</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/2/423?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;While cholinergic receptor activation has long been known to dramatically enhance the excitability of cortical neurons, the cellular mechanisms responsible for this effect are not well understood. We used intracellular recordings in rat (both sexes) neocortical brain slices to assess the ionic mechanisms supporting persistent firing modes triggered by depolarizing stimuli following cholinergic receptor activation. We found multiple lines of evidence suggesting that a component of the underlying hyperexcitability associated with persistent firing reflects a reduction in the standing (leak) K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; current mediated by Ether-a-go-go-Related Gene (ERG) channels. Three chemically diverse ERG channel blockers (terfenadine, ErgToxin-1, and E-4031) abolished persistent firing and the underlying increase in input resistance in deep pyramidal cells in temporal and prefrontal association neocortex. Calcium accumulation during triggering stimuli appears to attenuate ERG currents, leading to membrane potential depolarization and increased input resistance, two critical elements generating persistent firing. Our results also suggest that ERG current normally governs cortical neuron responses to depolarizing stimuli by opposing prolonged discharges and by enhancing the poststimulus repolarization. The broad expression of ERG channels and the ability of ERG blocks to abolish persistent firing evoked by both synaptic and intracellular step stimuli suggest that modulation of ERG channels may underlie many forms of persistent activity observed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Persistent activity, where spiking continues beyond the triggering stimulus, is a common phenomenon observed in many types of neurons. Identifying the mechanism underlying this elementary process of memory is a step forward in understanding higher cognitive function including short-term memory. Our results suggest that a reduction in the currents normally mediated by Ether-a-go-go-Related Gene (ERG) K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels contributes to persistent firing in neocortical pyramidal cells. ERG currents have been previously studied primarily in the heart; relatively little is known about ERG function in the brain, although mutations in ERG channels have recently been linked to schizophrenia. The present study is among the first to describe its role in neocortex in relation to biophysical correlates of memory function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dissociable Decoding of Spatial Attention and Working Memory from EEG Oscillations and Sustained Potentials</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/2/409?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In human scalp EEG recordings, both sustained potentials and alpha-band oscillations are present during the delay period of working memory tasks and may therefore reflect the representation of information in working memory. However, these signals may instead reflect support mechanisms rather than the actual contents of memory. In particular, alpha-band oscillations have been tightly tied to spatial attention and may not reflect location-independent memory representations per se. To determine how sustained and oscillating EEG signals are related to attention and working memory, we attempted to decode which of 16 orientations was being held in working memory by human observers (both women and men). We found that sustained EEG activity could be used to decode the remembered orientation of a stimulus, even when the orientation of the stimulus varied independently of its location. Alpha-band oscillations also carried clear information about the location of the stimulus, but they provided little or no information about orientation independently of location. Thus, sustained potentials contain information about the object properties being maintained in working memory, consistent with previous evidence of a tight link between these potentials and working memory capacity. In contrast, alpha-band oscillations primarily carry location information, consistent with their link to spatial attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Working memory plays a key role in cognition, and working memory is impaired in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. Previous research has suggested that human scalp EEG recordings contain signals that reflect the neural representation of information in working memory. However, to conclude that a neural signal actually represents the object being remembered, it is necessary to show that the signal contains fine-grained information about that object. Here, we show that sustained voltages in human EEG recordings contain fine-grained information about the orientation of an object being held in memory, consistent with a memory storage signal.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Inverted Encoding Models of Human Population Response Conflate Noise and Neural Tuning Width</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/2/398?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Channel-encoding models offer the ability to bridge different scales of neuronal measurement by interpreting population responses, typically measured with BOLD imaging in humans, as linear sums of groups of neurons (channels) tuned for visual stimulus properties. Inverting these models to form predicted channel responses from population measurements in humans seemingly offers the potential to infer neuronal tuning properties. Here, we test the ability to make inferences about neural tuning width from inverted encoding models. We examined contrast invariance of orientation selectivity in human V1 (both sexes) and found that inverting the encoding model resulted in channel response functions that became broader with lower contrast, thus apparently violating contrast invariance. Simulations showed that this broadening could be explained by contrast-invariant single-unit tuning with the measured decrease in response amplitude at lower contrast. The decrease in response lowers the signal-to-noise ratio of population responses that results in poorer population representation of orientation. Simulations further showed that increasing signal to noise makes channel response functions less sensitive to underlying neural tuning width, and in the limit of zero noise will reconstruct the channel function assumed by the model regardless of the bandwidth of single units. We conclude that our data are consistent with contrast-invariant orientation tuning in human V1. More generally, our results demonstrate that population selectivity measures obtained by encoding models can deviate substantially from the behavior of single units because they conflate neural tuning width and noise and are therefore better used to estimate the uncertainty of decoded stimulus properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; It is widely recognized that perceptual experience arises from large populations of neurons, rather than a few single units. Yet, much theory and experiment have examined links between single units and perception. Encoding models offer a way to bridge this gap by explicitly interpreting population activity as the aggregate response of many single neurons with known tuning properties. Here we use this approach to examine contrast-invariant orientation tuning of human V1. We show with experiment and modeling that due to lower signal to noise, contrast-invariant orientation tuning of single units manifests in population response functions that broaden at lower contrast, rather than remain contrast-invariant. These results highlight the need for explicit quantitative modeling when making a reverse inference from population response profiles to single-unit responses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Critical Role for Dopamine D5 Receptors in Pain Chronicity in Male Mice</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/2/379?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dopaminergic modulation of spinal cord plasticity has long been recognized, but circuits affected by this system and the precise receptor subtypes involved in this modulation have not been defined. Dopaminergic modulation from the A11 nucleus of the hypothalamus contributes to plasticity in a model of chronic pain called hyperalgesic priming. Here we tested the hypothesis that the key receptor subtype mediating this effect is the D5 receptor (D5R). We find that a spinally directed lesion of dopaminergic neurons reverses hyperalgesic priming in both sexes and that a D1/D5 antagonist transiently inhibits neuropathic pain. We used mice lacking D5Rs (&lt;i&gt;DRD5KO&lt;/i&gt; mice) to show that carrageenan, interleukin 6, as well as BDNF-induced hyperalgesia and priming are reduced specifically in male mice. These male &lt;i&gt;DRD5KO&lt;/i&gt; mice also show reduced formalin pain responses and decreased heat pain. To characterize the subtypes of dorsal horn neurons engaged by dopamine signaling in the hyperalgesic priming model, we used c-fos labeling. We find that a mixed D1/D5 agonist given spinally to primed mice activates a subset of neurons in lamina III and IV of the dorsal horn that coexpress PAX2, a transcription factor for GABAergic interneurons. In line with this, we show that gabazine, a GABA-A receptor antagonist, is antihyperalgesic in primed mice exposed to spinal administration of a D1/D5 agonist. Therefore, the D5R, in males, and the D1R, in females, exert a powerful influence over spinal cord circuitry in pathological pain likely via modulation of deep dorsal horn GABAergic neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Pain is the most prominent reason why people seek medical attention, and chronic pain incidence worldwide has been estimated to be as high as 33%. This study provides new insight into how descending dopamine controls pathological pain states. Our work demonstrates that dopaminergic spinal projections are necessary for the maintenance of a chronic pain state in both sexes; however, D5 receptors seem to play a critical role in males whereas females rely more heavily on D1 receptors, an effect that could be explained by sexual dimorphisms in receptor expression levels. Collectively, our work provides new insights into how the dopaminergic system interacts with spinal circuits to promote pain plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Autism Protein Ube3A/E6AP Remodels Neuronal Dendritic Arborization via Caspase-Dependent Microtubule Destabilization</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/2/363?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;UBE3A&lt;/i&gt; gene copy number variation and the resulting overexpression of the protein E6AP is directly linked to autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). However, the underlying cellular and molecular neurobiology remains less clear. Here we report the role of ASD-related increased dosage of Ube3A/E6AP in dendritic arborization during brain development. We show that increased E6AP expression in primary cultured neurons leads to a reduction in dendritic branch number and length. The E6AP-dependent remodeling of dendritic arborization results from retraction of dendrites by thinning and fragmentation at the tips of dendrite branches, leading to shortening or removal of dendrites. This remodeling effect is mediated by the ubiquitination and degradation of XIAP (X-linked inhibitors of aptosis protein) by E6AP, which leads to activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of microtubules. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt;, male and female &lt;i&gt;Ube3A&lt;/i&gt; 2X ASD mice show decreased XIAP levels, increased caspase-3 activation, and elevated levels of tubulin cleavage. Consistently, dendritic branching and spine density are reduced in cortical neurons of &lt;i&gt;Ube3A&lt;/i&gt; 2X ASD mice. In revealing an important role for Ube3A/E6AP in ASD-related developmental alteration in dendritic arborization and synapse formation, our findings provide new insights into the pathogenesis of Ube3A/E6AP-dependent ASD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Copy number variation of the &lt;i&gt;UBE3A&lt;/i&gt; gene and aberrant overexpression of the gene product E6AP protein is a common cause of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). During brain development, dendritic growth and remodeling play crucial roles in neuronal connectivity and information integration. We found that in primary neurons and in Ube3A transgenic autism mouse brain, overexpression of E6AP leads to significant loss of dendritic arborization. This effect is mediated by the ubiquitination of XIAP (X-linked inhibitor of aptosis protein) by E6AP, subsequent activation of caspases, and the eventual cleavage of microtubules, leading to local degeneration and retraction at the tips of dendritic branches. These findings demonstrate dysregulation in neuronal structural stability as a major cellular neuropathology in ASD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Mouse Pulvinar Nucleus Links the Lateral Extrastriate Cortex, Striatum, and Amygdala</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/2/347?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The pulvinar nucleus is a large thalamic structure involved in the integration of visual and motor signals. The pulvinar forms extensive connections with striate and extrastriate cortical areas, but the impact of these connections on cortical circuits has not previously been directly tested. Using a variety of anatomical, optogenetic, and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; physiological techniques in male and female mice, we show that pulvinocortical terminals are densely distributed in the extrastriate cortex where they form synaptic connections with spines and small-diameter dendrites. Optogenetic activation of these synapses &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; evoked large excitatory postsynaptic responses in the majority of pyramidal cells, spiny stellate cells, and interneurons within the extrastriate cortex. However, specificity in pulvinar targeting was revealed when recordings were targeted to projection neuron subtypes. The neurons most responsive to pulvinar input were those that project to the striatum and amygdala (76% responsive) or V1 (55%), whereas neurons that project to the superior colliculus were rarely responsive (6%). Because the pulvinar also projects directly to the striatum and amygdala, these results establish the pulvinar nucleus as a hub linking the visual cortex with subcortical regions involved in the initiation and control of movement. We suggest that these circuits may be particularly important for coordinating body movements and visual perception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We found that the pulvinar nucleus can strongly influence extrastriate cortical circuits and exerts a particularly strong impact on the activity of extrastriate neurons that project to the striatum and amygdala. Our results suggest that the conventional hierarchical view of visual cortical processing may not apply to the mouse visual cortex. Instead, our results establish the pulvinar nucleus as a hub linking the visual cortex with subcortical regions involved in the initiation and control of movement, and predict that the execution of visually guided movements relies on this network.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Tonotopic Variation of the T-Type Ca2+ Current in Avian Auditory Coincidence Detector Neurons</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/2/335?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurons in avian nucleus laminaris (NL) are binaural coincidence detectors for sound localization and are characterized by striking structural variations in dendrites and axon initial segment (AIS) according to their acoustic tuning [characteristic frequency (CF)]. T-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (CaT) channels regulate synaptic integration and firing behavior at these neuronal structures. However, whether or how CaT channels contribute to the signal processing in NL neurons is not known. In this study, we addressed this issue with whole-cell recording and two-photon Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging in brain slices of posthatch chicks of both sexes. We found that the CaT current was prominent in low-CF neurons, whereas it was almost absent in higher-CF neurons. In addition, a large Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transient occurred at the dendrites and the AIS of low-CF neurons, indicating a localization of CaT channels at these structures in the neurons. Because low-CF neurons have long dendrites, dendritic CaT channels may compensate for the attenuation of EPSPs at dendrites. Furthermore, the short distance of AIS from the soma may accelerate activation of axonal CaT current in the neurons and help EPSPs reach spike threshold. Indeed, the CaT current was activated by EPSPs and augmented the synaptic response and spike generation of the neurons. Notably, the CaT current was inactivated during repetitive inputs, and these augmenting effects predominated at the initial phase of synaptic activity. These results suggested that dendritic and axonal CaT channels increase the sensitivity to sound at its onset, which may expand the dynamic range for binaural computation in low-CF NL neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neurons in nucleus laminaris are binaural coincidence detectors for sound localization. We report that T-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (CaT) current was prominent at dendrites and the axonal trigger zone in neurons tuned to low-frequency sound. Because these neurons have long dendrites and a closer trigger zone compared with those tuned to higher-frequency sound, the CaT current augmented EPSPs at dendrites and accelerated spike triggers in the neurons, implying a strategic arrangement of the current within the nucleus. This effect was limited to the onset of repetitive inputs due to progressive inactivation of CaT current. The results suggested that the CaT current increases the sensitivity to sound at its onset, which may expand the dynamic range for binaural computation of low-frequency sound.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Acetaminophen Relieves Inflammatory Pain through CB1 Cannabinoid Receptors in the Rostral Ventromedial Medulla</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/2/322?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is a widely used analgesic and antipyretic drug with only incompletely understood mechanisms of action. Previous work, using models of acute nociceptive pain, indicated that analgesia by acetaminophen involves an indirect activation of CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors by the acetaminophen metabolite and endocannabinoid reuptake inhibitor AM 404. However, the contribution of the cannabinoid system to antihyperalgesia against inflammatory pain, the main indication of acetaminophen, and the precise site of the relevant CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors have remained elusive. Here, we analyzed acetaminophen analgesia in mice of either sex with inflammatory pain and found that acetaminophen exerted a dose-dependent antihyperalgesic action, which was mimicked by intrathecally injected AM 404. Both compounds lost their antihyperalgesic activity in &lt;i&gt;CB&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice, confirming the involvement of the cannabinoid system. Consistent with a mechanism downstream of proinflammatory prostaglandin formation, acetaminophen also reversed hyperalgesia induced by intrathecal prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. To distinguish between a peripheral/spinal and a supraspinal action, we administered acetaminophen and AM 404 to &lt;i&gt;hoxB8-CB&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice, which lack CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors from the peripheral nervous system and the spinal cord. These mice exhibited unchanged antihyperalgesia indicating a supraspinal site of action. Accordingly, local injection of the CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonist rimonabant into the rostral ventromedial medulla blocked acetaminophen-induced antihyperalgesia, while local rostral ventromedial medulla injection of AM 404 reduced hyperalgesia in wild-type mice but not in &lt;i&gt;CB&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Our results indicate that the cannabinoid system contributes not only to acetaminophen analgesia against acute pain but also against inflammatory pain, and suggest that the relevant CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors reside in the rostral ventromedial medulla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Acetaminophen is a widely used analgesic drug with multiple but only incompletely understood mechanisms of action, including a facilitation of endogenous cannabinoid signaling via one of its metabolites. Our present data indicate that enhanced cannabinoid signaling is also responsible for the analgesic effects of acetaminophen against inflammatory pain. Local injections of the acetaminophen metabolite AM 404 and of cannabinoid receptor antagonists as well as data from tissue-specific CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-deficient mice suggest the rostral ventromedial medulla as an important site of the cannabinoid-mediated analgesia by acetaminophen.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: CD44 Signaling Mediates High Molecular Weight Hyaluronan-Induced Antihyperalgesia</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/2/308?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We studied, in male Sprague Dawley rats, the role of the cognate hyaluronan receptor, CD44 signaling in the antihyperalgesia induced by high molecular weight hyaluronan (HMWH). Low molecular weight hyaluronan (LMWH) acts at both peptidergic and nonpeptidergic nociceptors to induce mechanical hyperalgesia that is prevented by intrathecal oligodeoxynucleotide antisense to CD44 mRNA, which also prevents hyperalgesia induced by a CD44 receptor agonist, A6. Ongoing LMWH and A6 hyperalgesia are reversed by HMWH. HMWH also reverses the hyperalgesia induced by diverse pronociceptive mediators, prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, epinephrine, TNFα, and interleukin-6, and the neuropathic pain induced by the cancer chemotherapy paclitaxel. Although CD44 antisense has no effect on the hyperalgesia induced by inflammatory mediators or paclitaxel, it eliminates the antihyperalgesic effect of HMWH. HMWH also reverses the hyperalgesia induced by activation of intracellular second messengers, PKA and PKC&lt;sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, indicating that HMWH-induced antihyperalgesia, although dependent on CD44, is mediated by an intracellular signaling pathway rather than as a competitive receptor antagonist. Sensitization of cultured small-diameter DRG neurons by prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is also prevented and reversed by HMWH. These results demonstrate the central role of CD44 signaling in HMWH-induced antihyperalgesia, and establish it as a therapeutic target against inflammatory and neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We demonstrate that hyaluronan (HA) with different molecular weights produces opposing nociceptive effects. While low molecular weight HA increases sensitivity to mechanical stimulation, high molecular weight HA reduces sensitization, attenuating inflammatory and neuropathic hyperalgesia. Both pronociceptive and antinociceptive effects of HA are mediated by activation of signaling pathways downstream CD44, the cognate HA receptor, in nociceptors. These results contribute to our understanding of the role of the extracellular matrix in pain, and indicate CD44 as a potential therapeutic target to alleviate inflammatory and neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Microtubule-Associated Protein Tau Mediates the Organization of Microtubules and Their Dynamic Exploration of Actin-Rich Lamellipodia and Filopodia of Cortical Growth Cones</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/2/291?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Proper organization and dynamics of the actin and microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton are essential for growth cone behaviors during axon growth and guidance. The MT-associated protein tau is known to mediate actin/MT interactions in cell-free systems but the role of tau in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics in living neurons is unknown. We used cultures of cortical neurons from postnatal day (P)0–P2 golden Syrian hamsters (&lt;i&gt;Mesocricetus auratus&lt;/i&gt;) of either sex to study the role of tau in the organization and dynamics of the axonal growth cone cytoskeleton. Here, using super resolution microscopy of fixed growth cones, we found that tau colocalizes with MTs and actin filaments and is also located at the interface between actin filament bundles and dynamic MTs in filopodia, suggesting that tau links these two cytoskeletons. Live cell imaging in concert with shRNA tau knockdown revealed that reducing tau expression disrupts MT bundling in the growth cone central domain, misdirects trajectories of MTs in the transition region and prevents single dynamic MTs from extending into growth cone filopodia along actin filament bundles. Rescue experiments with human tau expression restored MT bundling, MT penetration into the growth cone periphery and close MT apposition to actin filaments in filopodia. Importantly, we found that tau knockdown reduced axon outgrowth and growth cone turning in Wnt5a gradients, likely due to disorganized MTs that failed to extend into the peripheral domain and enter filopodia. These results suggest an important role for tau in regulating cytoskeletal organization and dynamics during growth cone behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Growth cones are the motile tips of growing axons whose guidance behaviors require interaction of the dynamic actin and microtubule cytoskeleton. Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that stabilizes microtubules in neurons and in cell-free systems regulates actin–microtubule interaction. Here, using super resolution microscopy, live-cell imaging, and tau knockdown, we show for the first time in living axonal growth cones that tau is important for microtubule bundling and microtubule exploration of the actin-rich growth cone periphery. Importantly tau knockdown reduced axon outgrowth and growth cone turning, due to disorganized microtubules that fail to enter filopodia and co-align with actin filaments. Understanding normal tau functions will be important for identifying mechanisms of tau in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

However, the PKC substrates responsible for the survival of dopaminergic neurons &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; have not yet been elucidated. Previously, we found 10 potent substrates in the striatum of PKC-KO mice. Here, we focused on cysteine string protein α (CSPα), a protein from the heat shock protein (HSP) 40 cochaperone families localized on synaptic vesicles. We found that in cultured cells, PKC phosphorylates CSPα at serine (Ser) 10 and Ser34. Additionally, apoptosis was found to have been enhanced by the overexpression of a phosphorylation-null mutant of CSPα, CSPα(S10A/S34A). Compared with wild-type (WT) CSPα, the CSPα(S10A/S34A) mutant had a weaker interaction with HSP70. However, in sharp contrast, a phosphomimetic CSPα(S10D/S34D) mutant, compared with WT CSPα, had a stronger interaction with HSP70. In addition, total levels of synaptosomal-associated protein (SNAP) 25, a main downstream target of the HSC70/HSP70 chaperone complex, were found to have decreased by the CSPα(S10A/S34A) mutant through increased ubiquitination of SNAP25 in PC12 cells. In the striatum of 2-year-old male PKC-KO mice, decreased phosphorylation levels of CSPα and decreased SNAP25 protein levels were observed. These findings indicate the phosphorylation of CSPα by PKC may protect the presynaptic terminal from neurodegeneration. The PKC–CSPα–HSC70/HSP70–SNAP25 axis, because of its role in protecting the presynaptic terminal, may provide a new therapeutic target for the treatment of PD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Cysteine string protein α (CSPα) is a protein belonging to the heat shock protein (HSP) 40 cochaperone families localized on synaptic vesicles, which maintain the presynaptic terminal. However, the function of CSPα phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC) for neuronal cell survival remains unclear. The experiments presented here demonstrate that PKC phosphorylates CSPα at serine (Ser) 10 and Ser34. CSPα phosphorylation at Ser10 and Ser34 by PKC protects the presynaptic terminal by promoting HSP70 chaperone activity. This report suggests that CSPα phosphorylation, because of its role in modulating HSP70 chaperone activity, may be a target for the treatment of neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Behavioral, Modeling, and Electrophysiological Evidence for Supramodality in Human Metacognition</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/2/263?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human metacognition, or the capacity to introspect on one's own mental states, has been mostly characterized through confidence reports in visual tasks. A pressing question is to what extent results from visual studies generalize to other domains. Answering this question allows determining whether metacognition operates through shared, supramodal mechanisms or through idiosyncratic, modality-specific mechanisms. Here, we report three new lines of evidence for decisional and postdecisional mechanisms arguing for the supramodality of metacognition. First, metacognitive efficiency correlated among auditory, tactile, visual, and audiovisual tasks. Second, confidence in an audiovisual task was best modeled using supramodal formats based on integrated representations of auditory and visual signals. Third, confidence in correct responses involved similar electrophysiological markers for visual and audiovisual tasks that are associated with motor preparation preceding the perceptual judgment. We conclude that the supramodality of metacognition relies on supramodal confidence estimates and decisional signals that are shared across sensory modalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Metacognitive monitoring is the capacity to access, report, and regulate one's own mental states. In perception, this allows rating our confidence in what we have seen, heard, or touched. Although metacognitive monitoring can operate on different cognitive domains, we ignore whether it involves a single supramodal mechanism common to multiple cognitive domains or modality-specific mechanisms idiosyncratic to each domain. Here, we bring evidence in favor of the supramodality hypothesis by showing that participants with high metacognitive performance in one modality are likely to perform well in other modalities. Based on computational modeling and electrophysiology, we propose that supramodality can be explained by the existence of supramodal confidence estimates and by the influence of decisional cues on confidence estimates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A solid phase binding assay quantified the binding of Caspr2 to contactin-2 in the presence of Caspr2 autoantibodies. Living cultures of primary rat hippocampal neurons were incubated with Caspr2-positive or control sera, and the distribution of Caspr2-positive immunofluorescent puncta and total surface Caspr2 was quantified. HEK cells transfected to express Caspr2 were incubated with Caspr2-positive or control samples, and cell-surface biotinylation and Western blot were used to assess total, internalized, and surface levels of Caspr2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

IgG4 Caspr2 antibodies were present in all 6 cases. Caspr2 interacted with another cell adhesion molecule, contactin-2, with nanomolar affinity in the solid phase assay, and Caspr2 autoantibodies inhibited this interaction. Caspr2 autoantibodies did not affect the surface expression of Caspr2 in rat primary hippocampal neurons or transfected HEK cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Motor sequence awareness is impaired in dystonia despite normal performance</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25121</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25121-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dystonia is a movement disorder that has been associated with impaired motor learning and sequence recognition. However, despite evidence that patients with dystonia have a reduced sense of agency, it is unclear whether dystonia is specifically associated with impaired recognition of a movement sequence. We have shown previously that performance consistency in the temporal and kinematic domains predicts awareness of underlying motor patterns in a finger-tapping task. Since movements in dystonia are characterized by high variability, we predicted that subjects with dystonia would have decreased motor sequence awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25121-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subjects with dystonia (n = 20) and healthy control adults (n = 30) performed finger-tapping sequences with a common motor pattern and changing stimulus-to-response mappings. Subjects were said to be “aware” of the motor pattern if they recognized that their fingers moved in the same order during each stimulus-to-response remapping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25121-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subjects with dystonia had decreased motor pattern awareness, but those differences were not due to greater performance variability. Subjects with dystonia tapped sequences as series of discrete movements, rather than as a combined series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25121-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dystonia is associated with impaired recognition of a repeating movement pattern. This difference may result from a strategy of separating sequential elements and attending to them individually. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

Extensive works during the past decade yield ample insights into the molecular and cellular functions of MeCP2 in neural development. Furthermore, genetic manipulations in Mecp2 mouse models strongly suggested that deficiency in synaptic plasticity and various behaviors of Mecp2 null or transgenic mice could be rescued in adulthood. Further studies elucidating neural circuits responsible for symptoms in MECP2-associated disorders in rodent and non-human primate models will shed light on the development of potential therapeutic interventions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Clinical and animal model studies have shown that changes in PFC excitation and inhibition are important for cognitive functions as well as related disorders. Here, we discuss recent findings revealing the roles of the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic proteins neuroligin 1 (NLGN1) and NLGN2 in the PFC in memory formation and modulation of memory strength. We propose that shifts in NLGN1 and NLGN2 expression in specific excitatory and inhibitory neuronal subpopulations in response to experience regulate the dynamic processes of memory consolidation and strengthening. Because excitatory/inhibitory imbalances accompany neuropsychiatric disorders in which strength and flexibility of representations play important roles, understanding these mechanisms may suggest novel therapies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

These limitations reflect what has been dichotomy between the structure and mechanical properties of living brain tissue and non-living neural probes. To bridge the gap between neural and electronic networks, we have introduced the new concept of mesh electronics probes designed with structural and mechanical properties such that the implant begins to ‘look and behave’ like neural tissue. Syringe-implanted mesh electronics have led to the realization of probes that are neuro-attractive and free of the chronic immune response, as well as capable of stable long-term mapping and modulation of brain activity at the single-neuron level. This review provides a historical overview of a 10-year development of mesh electronics by highlighting the tissue-like design, syringe-assisted delivery, seamless neural tissue integration, and single-neuron level chronic recording stability of mesh electronics. We also offer insights on unique near-term opportunities and future directions for neuroscience and neurology that now are available or expected for mesh electronics neurotechnologies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Human neuroimaging studies consistently show a hunger-dependent, selective enhancement of responses to images of food in association cortex and amygdala. More recently, cellular-resolution imaging combined with circuit mapping experiments in behaving mice have revealed underlying neuronal population dynamics and enabled tracing of pathways by which hunger circuits influence the assignment of value to visual objects in visual association cortex, insular cortex, and amygdala. These experiments begin to provide a mechanistic understanding of motivation-specific neural processing of need-relevant cues in healthy humans and in disease states such as obesity and other eating disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Since the earliest days of embryology, lineage questions have been addressed with methods of increasing specificity, capacity, and resolution. Yet, a full realization of individual cell lineages remains challenging for complex systems. A recent explosion of technical advances in genome-editing and single-cell sequencing has enabled lineage analysis in an unprecedented scale, speed, and depth across different species. In this review, we discuss the application of available as well as future genetic labeling techniques for tracking neural lineages in vivo in the mammalian nervous system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

During development, individual gene activity can dynamically engage different signaling networks; thus genetic mutations can lead to different functional changes at different times. Interpretation of phenotypes can be further complicated if initial functional changes trigger compensatory mechanisms. Examining genetic mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders reveals cellular phenotypes that change over the course of development and exist long before behavioral deficits are assessed. Correspondingly, earlier genetic interventions in these disorder models have often been more effective at improving behavioral deficits than late interventions. The restricted period of effective intervention demonstrates that identifying a target window is an essential component of treatment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Here, we review recent studies that reveal the highly dynamic, localized morphological changes of mammalian neuron–glia contacts. We then explore the power of Drosophila and C. elegans models to study coordinated changes at defined neuron–glia contacts, highlighting the use of innovative genetic and imaging tools to uncover the molecular mechanisms responsible for coordinated morphogenesis of neurons and glia. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

During the first three weeks of postnatal development, immature astrocytes express mGlu5 and expands several fold while undergoing a transition towards their mature phase. Although mGlu5-mediated signalling in astrocyte functions has been extensively studied in the last decades, whether this signalling is implicated in the mechanisms governing their development, as well as the effects of dysregulated astrocytic development on neurodevelopmental disorders, are still unclear. The aim of this review is to examine what is known about the mGlu5-mediated signalling in the developing astrocytes and its possible contribution to the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

This neural activity reflects internal processes by which the brain plans and executes volitional movements. The study of motor planning offers an opportunity to understand how the structure and dynamics of neural circuits support persistent internal states and how these states influence behavior. Recent advances in large-scale neural recordings are beginning to decipher the relationship of the dynamics of populations of neurons during motor planning and movements. New behavioral tasks in rodents, together with quantified perturbations, link dynamics in specific nodes of neural circuits to behavior. These studies reveal a neural network distributed across multiple brain regions that collectively supports motor planning. We review recent advances and highlight areas where further work is needed to achieve a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying motor planning and related cognitive processes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

These functions rely on the computation of the local cerebellar microcircuits and long-range connectivity that relays cerebellar output to various brain areas. In this review, we discuss recent work on two of the circuit elements, which are thought to be fundamental for a wide range of non-sensorimotor behaviors: The role for cerebellar granule cells in multimodal integration in the cerebellar cortex and the long-range connectivity between the deep cerebellar nuclei and the basal ganglia. Lastly, we discuss how studies on synapses and circuits of the cerebellum in rodent models of autism-spectrum disorders might contribute to our understanding of the pathophysiology of this class of neurodevelopmental disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Studies have found that sensory, prefrontal, hippocampal, cerebellar, and striatal regions, as well as the circuits that connect them, are perturbed in mouse models of ASD and ID. Dissecting the disruptions in morphology and activity in these neural circuits might help us to understand the shared risk between the two disorders as well as their clinical heterogeneity. Treatments that target the balance between excitation and inhibition in these regions are able to reverse pathological phenotypes, elucidating this deficit as a commonality across models and opening new avenues for intervention. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Designing behavioral paradigms that provide a solid foundation to ask questions about decision-making computations and mechanisms is a difficult and often underestimated challenge. Here, we propose three dimensions on which we can consider rodent decision-making tasks: ethological validity, task complexity, and stimulus-response compatibility. We review recent research through this lens, and provide practical guidance for researchers in the decision-making field. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

These platforms leverage basic advances in biocompatible materials, semiconductor device designs and systems engineering concepts to afford modes of operation that are qualitatively distinct from those of conventional approaches that tether animals to external hardware by means of optical fibers, electrical cables and/or fluidic tubing. Neuroscience studies that exploit the unique features of these technologies enable insights into neural function through targeted stimulation, inhibition and recording, with spatially and genetically precise manipulation of neural circuit activity. Experimental possibilities include studies in naturalistic, three dimensional environments, investigations of pair-wise or group related social interactions and many other scenarios of interest that cannot be addressed using traditional hardware. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Individual network components in the mushroom bodies of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster represent cues, learning signals and behavioral outcomes of learned experience. Recent findings have highlighted the importance of dopamine-driven plasticity and activity in feedback and feedforward connections, between various elements of the mushroom body neural network. These computational motifs have been shown to be crucial for long term olfactory memory consolidation, integration of internal states, re-evaluation and updating of learned information. The often recurrent circuit anatomy and a prolonged requirement for activity in parts of these underlying networks, suggest that self-sustained and precisely timed activity is a fundamental feature of network computations in the insect brain. Together these processes allow flies to continuously adjust the content of their learned knowledge and direct their behavior in a way that best represents learned expectations and serves their most pressing current needs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Numerous genes in the endo-lysosomal pathways have been found to associate with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mutations of these genes lead to dysfunction in multiple steps of the endo-lysosomal network: autophagy, endocytic trafficking and lysosomal degradation, resulting in accumulation of pathogenic proteins. Although the exact pathogenic mechanism varies for different disease-associated genes, dysfunction of the endo-lysosomal pathways represents a converging mechanism shared by these diseases. Therefore, strategies that correct or compensate for endo-lysosomal dysfunction may be promising therapeutic approaches to treat neurodegenerative diseases. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

These devices, usually sensing cell activity via microelectrodes, should be characterized by safe working conditions in the biological milieu together with a well-controlled operation-life. The stable device/neuronal electrical coupling at the interface requires tight interactions between the electrode surface and the cell membrane. This neuro-electrode hybrid represents the hyphen between the soft nature of neural tissue, generating electrical signals via ion motions, and the rigid realm of microelectronics and medical devices, dealing with electrons in motion. Efficient integration of these entities is essential for monitoring, analyzing and controlling neuronal signaling but poses significant technological challenges. Improving the cell/electrode interaction and thus the interface performance requires novel engineering of (nano)materials: tuning at the nanoscale electrode's properties may lead to engineer interfacing probes that better camouflaged with their biological target. In this brief review, we highlight the most recent concepts in nanotechnologies and nanomaterials that might help reducing the mismatch between tissue and electrode, focusing on the device's mechanical properties and its biological integration with the tissue. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

different approaches to generate augmented data using temporal and

feasible and can significantly increase the performance of signal processing
chains for brain-computer interfaces by 1% to 6%.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Personalizing deep learning models for automatic sleep staging. (arXiv:1801.02645v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02645</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Despite continued advancement in machine learning algorithms and increasing
availability of large data sets, there is still no universally acceptable
solution for automatic sleep staging of human sleep recordings. One reason is
that a skilled neurophysiologist scoring brain recordings of a sleeping person
implicitly adapts his/her staging to the individual characteristics present in
the brain recordings. Trying to incorporate this adaptation step in an
automatic scoring algorithm, we introduce in this paper a method for
personalizing a general sleep scoring model. Starting from a general
convolutional neural network architecture, we allow the model to learn
individual characteristics of the first night of sleep in order to quantify
sleep stages of the second night. While the original neural network allows to
sleep stage on a public database with a state of the art accuracy,
personalizing the model further increases performance (on the order of two
percentage points on average, but more for difficult subjects). This
improvement is particularly present in subjects where the original algorithm
did not perform well (typically subjects with accuracy less than $80\%$).
Looking deeper, we find that optimal classification can be achieved when broad
knowledge of sleep staging in general (at least 20 separate nights) is combined
with subject-specific knowledge. We hypothesize that this method will be very
valuable for improving scoring of lower quality sleep recordings, such as those
from wearable devices.

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;GABAergic interneurons are notorious for their heterogeneity, despite constituting a small fraction of the neuronal population in the neocortex. Classification of interneurons is crucial for understanding their widespread cortical functions as they provide a complex and dynamic network, balancing excitation and inhibition. Here, we investigated different types of non-fast-spiking (nFS) interneurons in Layer 4 (L4) of rat barrel cortex using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings with biocytin-filling. Based on a quantitative analysis on a combination of morphological and electrophysiological parameters, we identified 5 distinct types of L4 nFS interneurons: 1) &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;trans-columnar projecting interneurons,&lt;/span&gt;2) &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;locally projecting non-Martinotti-like interneurons,&lt;/span&gt; 3) &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;supra-granular projecting Martinotti-like interneurons,&lt;/span&gt;4) &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;intra-columnar projecting VIP-like interneurons&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;5) &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;locally projecting neurogliaform-like interneurons.&lt;/span&gt; Trans-columnar projecting interneurons are one of the most striking interneuron types, which have not been described so far in Layer 4. They feature extensive axonal collateralization not only in their home barrel but also in adjacent barrels. Furthermore, we identified that most of the L4 nFS interneurons express somatostatin, while few are positive for the transcription factor Prox1. The morphological and electrophysiological characterization of different L4 nFS interneuron types presented here provides insights into their synaptic connectivity and functional role in cortical information processing.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;In 2004, two landmark studies described the discovery of brain imaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography) signals that increase with the number of items held in visual working memory (WM). These studies claimed that the signals leveled off (plateaued) once the number of memoranda reached the capacity of WM, as estimated by the prevailing model of the time. However, alternative models were not considered, and changing concepts of WM in the more than a decade since these studies were published necessitate a re-evaluation of their findings; newer models that provide the most accurate account of behavioral data do not incorporate a fixed limit on the number of items stored. Furthermore, an important claim made about the original studies, that signals plateau at each individual’s estimated capacity, has never been tested. Here, we pit the plateau model of signal strength against an alternative, saturation model, a biophysically plausible account in which signals increase continuously without plateau. We show that the saturation model provides a better description of the original data, challenging the assumption that imaging results provide evidence for a fixed item limit in WM.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Neurons sensitive to binocular disparity are found in almost all major visual areas in nonhuman primates. In area V4, disparity processes are suggested for the purposes of 3D-shape representation and fine disparity perception. However, whether neurons in V4 are sensitive to disparity-defined edges used in shape representation is not clear. Additionally, a functional organization for disparity edges has not been demonstrated so far. With intrinsic signal optical imaging, we studied functional organization for disparity edges in the monkey visual areas V1, V2, and V4. We found that there is an orientation map in V4 activated by edges purely defined by binocular disparity. This map is consistent with the orientation map obtained with regular luminance-defined edges, indicating a cue-invariant edge representation in this area. In contrast, such a map is much weaker in V2 and totally absent in V1. These findings reveal a hierarchical processing of 3D shape along the ventral pathway and the important role that V4 plays in shape-from-disparity detection.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;In the past decade, several studies have investigated the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on episodic memory abilities. However, the specific conditions under which tDCS affects memory remain largely unclear. Here, we report data from 4 experiments aimed at investigating the effects of anodal tDCS over the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) on verbal episodic memory. We evaluated tDCS-induced effects as a function of time of administration, nature of the memory encoding task, and age of the participants. A robust enhancement of memory performance was only found when anodal tDCS was delivered during intentional memorization. This enhancement was evident in young and older adults. tDCS applied during incidental memorization or during retrieval did not induce any modulation of memory performance, and memory was unaffected by offline administration before encoding or retrieval. These results show that the modulation of episodic memory functions by anodal tDCS over the left VLPFC is dependent upon the time of administration and the nature of the memory task. The findings may help profile the optimal stimulation protocols for neurorehabilitation interventions on individuals with memory decline.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The inferior temporal cortex (ITC) contains neurons selective to multiple levels of visual categories. However, the mechanisms by which these neurons collectively construct hierarchical category percepts remain unclear. By comparing decoding accuracy with simultaneously acquired electrocorticogram (ECoG), local field potentials (LFPs), and multi-unit activity in the macaque ITC, we show that low-frequency LFPs/ECoG in the early evoked visual response phase contain sufficient coarse category (e.g., face) information, which is homogeneous and enhanced by spatial summation of up to several millimeters. Late-induced high-frequency LFPs additionally carry spike-coupled finer category (e.g., species, view, and identity of the face) information, which is heterogeneous and reduced by spatial summation. Face-encoding neural activity forms a cluster in similar cortical locations regardless of whether it is defined by early evoked low-frequency signals or late-induced high-gamma signals. By contrast, facial subcategory-encoding activity is distributed, not confined to the face cluster, and dynamically increases its heterogeneity from the early evoked to late-induced phases. These findings support a view that, in contrast to the homogeneous and static coarse category-encoding neural cluster, finer category-encoding clusters are heterogeneously distributed even outside their parent category cluster and dynamically increase heterogeneity along with the local cortical processing in the ITC.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30250-3?rss=yes</link>
	<content:encoded>Depressed individuals typically show poor memory for positive events, potentiated memory for negative events, and impaired recollection. These phenomena are clinically important but poorly understood. Compelling links between stress and depression suggest promising candidate mechanisms. Stress can suppress hippocampal neurogenesis, inhibit dopamine neurons, and sensitize the amygdala. We argue that these phenomena may impair pattern separation, disrupt the encoding of positive experiences, and bias retrieval toward negative events, respectively, thus recapitulating core aspects of memory disruption in depression.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Thalamostriatal Interactions in Human Reversal Learning</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/246371v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Cognitive flexibility, the ability to flexibly update thought and behaviour, is a crucial component of adaptation and survival, and it is disrupted in neuropsychiatric disorders and psychopathology. Reversal learning tasks are often used to investigate cognitive flexibility. Human studies of reversal learning typically focus on neural mechanisms required to identify changes in response contingencies, rather than on mechanisms required to learn and express a new response. However, animal studies of reversal learning have shown a key and specific role in this process for the dorsal striatum and its interactions with the centromedian parafascicular (CM-Pf) thalamus, but this system is not as well understood in humans. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the human dorsal striatum and its interactions with the thalamus during probabilistic reversal learning, specifically with respect to learning a new response strategy. We used psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, to measure task-dependent changes in connectivity between striatal and thalamic functional subdivisions. We show that connectivity between the dorsal striatum and the centromedian parafascicular (CM-Pf) thalamic complex was increased during reversal, but not initial, learning. The strength of this connectivity was associated with the ability to flexibly alter behaviour. This study helps to bridge the gap between animal studies of this system, and human studies of reversal learning and cognitive flexibility more generally.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: ErbB4 deletion in noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus induces mania-like behavior via elevated catecholamines</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/246215v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Dysfunction of the noradrenergic (NE) neurons is implicated in the pathogenesis of manic-depressive psychosis (MDP). ErbB4 is highly expressed in NE neurons, and its genetic variation has been linked to MDP; however, how ErbB4 regulates NE neuronal function and contributes to MDP pathogenesis is unclear. Here we find that conditional deletion of ErbB4 in locus coeruleus (LC) NE neurons increases neuronal spontaneous firing through NMDA receptor hyperfunction, and elevates catecholamines in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Furthermore, ErbB4-deficient mice present mania-like behaviors, including hyperactivity, reduced anxiety and depression, and increased sucrose preference. These behaviors are completely rescued by the anti-manic drug lithium or antagonists of catecholaminergic receptors. Our study demonstrates the critical role of ErbB4 signaling in regulating LC-NE neuronal function, reinforcing the view that dysfunction of the NE system may contribute to the pathogenesis of mania-associated disorder.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Firing-Rate Based Network Modeling of the dLGN Circuit: Effects of Cortical Feedback on Spatiotemporal Response Properties of Relay Cells</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/246140v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Visual signals originating in the retina pass through the dorsal geniculate nucleus (dLGN), the visual part of thalamus, on the way to the visual cortex. This is however not a simple feedforward flow of information: there is a significant feedback from cortical cells back to both relay cells and interneurons in the dLGN. Despite four decades of experimental and theoretical studies, the functional role of this feedback is still debated. Here we use a firing-rate model, the extended difference-of-gaussians (eDOG) model, to explore cortical feedback effects on visual responses of dLGN relay cells. For this model the responses are found by direct evaluation of two- or three-dimensional integrals allowing for fast and comprehensive studies of putative effects of different candidate organizations of the cortical feedback. Our analysis identifies a special mixed configuration of excitatory and inhibitory cortical feedback which seems to best account for available experimental data. This configuration consists of (i) a slow (long-delay) and spatially widespread inhibitory feedback, combined with (ii) a fast (short-delayed) and spatially narrow excitatory feedback, where (iii) the excitatory/inhibitory ON-ON connections are accompanied respectively by inhibitory/excitatory OFF-ON connections, i.e. following a phase-reversed arrangement. The recent development of optogenetic and pharmacogenetic methods has provided new tools for more precise manipulation and investigation of the thalamocortical circuit, in particular for mice. Such data will expectedly allow the eDOG model to be better constrained by data from specific animal model systems than has been possible until now for cat. We have therefore made the Python tool pyLGN which allows for easy adaptation of the eDOG model to new situations.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Flexible information coding in frontoparietal cortex across the functional stages of cognitive processing.</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/246132v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Neural activity in frontoparietal cortex shows overlap across cognitive domains and has been proposed to reflect flexible information processing according to current task demands (Dosenbach et al., 2007; Duncan, 2001). However, a strong assertion of flexibility requires investigating activity across stages of cognitive processing. The current study assessed neural activity in Multiple Demand (MD) regions across the stages of processing that form the core of long-standing cognitive models (Welford, 1952). Specifically, many complex tasks share a comparable structure of subsequent operations: target selection, stimulus-response (SR) mapping, and response execution. We independently manipulated the difficulty of target selection and SR mapping in identical stimulus displays and assessed changes in frontoparietal activity with increased demands in either stage. The results confirmed flexibility in MD regions, with enhanced information representation during difficult target selection as well as SR mapping. Additionally, anterior insula (AI) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) showed preferential representation of SR stage information, whereas the medial frontal gyrus (MFG) and inferior parietal sulcus (IPS) showed preferential representation of target selection-stage information. Together these results suggest that MD regions dynamically alter the information they represent with changing task demands. This is the first study to demonstrate that MD regions support flexible goal- directed cognition across multiple processing stages. At the same time we show a preference for the representation of information from a specific processing stage in a subset of MD regions.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/246009v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Dyslexia is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by reading and spelling difficulties. Beyond the behavioral and functional correlates of this condition, a growing number of studies have explored structural differences between individuals with dyslexia and typically developing individuals. To date, findings remain disparate - some studies suggest differences in fractional anisotropy (FA), an indirect measure of white matter integrity, whereas others do not identify significant disparities. Here, we synthesized the existing literature on this topic by conducting a meta-analysis of Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) studies investigating white matter correlates of dyslexia via voxel-based analyses (VBA) of FA. Our results showed no reliable clusters underlying differences between dyslexics and typical individuals, after correcting for multiple comparisons (false discovery rate correction). Because group comparisons might be too coarse to yield subtle differences, we further explored differences in FA as a function of reading ability, measured on a continuous scale. Consistent with our initial findings, reading ability was not associated with reliable differences in white matter integrity. These findings nuance the current view of profound, structural differences underlying reading ability and its associated disorders, and suggest that their neural correlates might be more subtle than previously thought.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Goal-directed and habitual systems orchestrate action control. In disorders of compulsivity, their interplay seems disrupted and actions persist despite being inappropriate and without relationship to the overall goal. We manipulated action-outcome contingency to test whether actions are goal-directed or habitual in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), the prototypical disorder of compulsivity, in which prominent theories have suggested that dysfunctional beliefs underlie the necessity for compulsive actions. OCD patients responded more than controls when an action was causally less related to obtaining an outcome, indicating excessive habitual responding. Patients showed intact explicit action-outcome knowledge but this was not translated normally into behavior; the relationship between causality judgment and responding was blunted. OCD patients' actions were dissociated from explicit action-outcome knowledge, providing experimental support for the ego-dystonic nature of OCD and suggesting that habitual action is not sustained by dysfunctional belief.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>We test the adequacies of several proposed and two new statistical methods for recovering the causal structure of systems with feedback that generate noisy time series closely matching real BOLD time series. We compare: an adaptation for time series of the first correct method for recovering the structure of cyclic linear systems; multivariate Granger causal regression; the GIMME algorithm; the Ramsey et al. non-Gaussian methods; two non-Gaussian methods proposed by Hyvarinen and Smith; a method due to Patel, et al.; and the GlobalMIT algorithm. We introduce and also compare two new methods, the Fast Adjacency Skewness (FASK) and Two-Step, which exploit non-Gaussian features of the BOLD signal in different ways. We give theoretical justifications for the latter two algorithms. Our test models include feedback structures with and without direct feedback (2-cycles), excitatory and inhibitory feedback, models using experimentally determined structural connectivities of macaques, and empirical resting state and task data. We find that averaged over all of our simulations, including those with 2-cycles, several of these methods have a better than 80% orientation precision (i.e., the probability a directed edge is in the true generating structure given that a procedure estimates it to be so) and the two new methods also have better than 80% recall (probability of recovering an orientation in the data generating model). Recovering inhibitory direct feedback loops between two regions is especially challenging.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A master regulatory network restoring brain glutamate homeostasis is coordinately activated in stroke</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/245928v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Altered miRNA expression in various disease states have been identified, but their global targets contributing to the collective regulatory power to promote or attenuate pathology remains poorly defined. Here we applied a combination of hi-throughput RNA profiling techniques, including AGO CLIP, miRNAseq, RNAseq and ribosomal profiling, to develop an unbiased and comprehensive view of miRNA:mRNA functional interactions following ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury in the mouse brain. Upon acute I/R insult miR-29 family members were most prominently lost, with corresponding de-regulation of their global target sites. This leads to a dynamic, cascading mode of miR-29 target transcript activation, orchestrated by an initial translational activation and subsequent increase in target mRNA levels. Unexpectedly, activated genes include factors essential for glutamate signaling and re-uptake, indicating a fundamental role for this regulatory network in modulating critical endogenous neuroprotective programs to restore brain homeostasis. We integrated this data with human brain AGO CLIP profiles to infer target site variants that determine miRNA binding and to explore the role of non-coding site polymorphisms in stroke. Together these results establish a new strategy for understanding RNA regulatory networks in complex neurological disease.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/245886v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Alternative polyadenylation (APA) regulates mRNA translation, stability, and protein localization. However, it is unclear to what extent APA regulates these processes uniquely in specific cell types. Using a new technique, cTag-PAPERCLIP, we discovered significant differences in APA between the principal types of mouse cerebellar neurons, the Purkinje and granule cells, as well as between proliferating and differentiated granule cells. Transcripts that differed in APA in these comparisons were enriched in key neuronal functions and many differed in coding sequence in addition to 3'UTR length. We characterize Memo1, a transcript that shifted from expressing a short 3'UTR isoform to a longer one during granule cell differentiation. We show that Memo1 regulates granule cell precursor proliferation and that its long 3'UTR isoform is targeted by miR-124, contributing to its downregulation during development. Our findings provide insight into roles for APA in specific cell types and establish a platform for further functional studies.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/245845v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Sleep loss is associated with increased obesity risk, as demonstrated by correlations between sleep duration and change in body mass index or body fat percentage. Whereas previous studies linked this weight gain to disturbed endocrine parameters after sleep deprivation (SD) or restriction, neuroimaging studies revealed up-regulated neural processing of food rewards after sleep loss in reward-processing areas such as the anterior cingulate cortex, ventral striatum and insula. To tackle this ongoing debate between homeostatic versus hedonic factors underlying sleep loss-associated weight gain, we rigorously tested the association between SD and food cue processing using high-resolution fMRI and assessment of hormones. After taking blood samples from thirty-two lean, healthy men, they underwent fMRI while performing a neuroeconomic, value-based decision making task with snack food and trinket rewards following a full night of habitual sleep (HS) and a night of SD in a repeated-measures cross-over design. We found that des-acyl ghrelin concentrations were increased after SD compared with HS. Despite similar hunger ratings due to fasting in both conditions, participants were willing to spend more money on food items only after SD. Furthermore, fMRI data paralleled this behavioral finding, revealing a food reward-specific up-regulation of hypothalamic valuation signals and amygdala-hypothalamic coupling after a single night of SD. Behavioral and fMRI results were not significantly correlated with changes in acyl, des-acyl or total ghrelin concentrations. Our results indicate that increased food valuation after sleep loss is due to hedonic rather than hormonal mechanisms.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/245829v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>A longstanding view of the organization of human and animal behavior holds that behavior is hierarchically organized, meaning that it can be understood as directed towards achieving superordinate goals through subordinate goals, or subgoals. For example, the superordinate goal of making coffee can be broken down as accomplishing a series of subgoals, namely boiling water, grinding coffee, pouring cream, etc. Learning and behavioral adaptation depend on prediction-error signals, which have been observed in ventral striatum (VS) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). In past work, we have shown that prediction error signals (PEs) can be linked not only to superordinate goals, but also to subgoals. Here we present two functional magnetic resonance imagining experiments that replicate and extend these findings. In the first experiment, we replicated the finding that mPFC signals subgoal-related PEs, independently of goal PEs. Together with our past work, this experiment reveals that BOLD responses to PEs in mPFC are unsigned. In the second experiment, we showed that when a task involves both goal and subgoal PEs, mPFC shows only goal-related PEs, suggesting that context or attention can strongly impact hierarchical PE coding. Furthermore, we observed a dissociation between the coding of PEs in mPFC and VS. These experiments suggest that the mPFC selectively attends to information at different levels of hierarchy depending on the task context.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/245738v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>High-resolution (functional) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at ultra high magnetic fields (7 Tesla and above) enables researchers to study how anatomical and functional properties change within the cortical ribbon, along surfaces and across cortical depths. These studies require an accurate delineation of the gray matter ribbon, which often suffers from inclusion of blood vessels, dura mater and other non-brain tissue. Residual segmentation errors are commonly corrected by browsing the data slice-by-slice and manually changing labels. This task becomes increasingly laborious and prone to error at higher resolutions since both work and error scale with the number of voxels. Here we show that mislabeled, non-brain voxels can be corrected more efficiently and semi-automatically by representing three-dimensional anatomical images using two-dimensional histograms. We propose both a uni-modal (based on first spatial derivative) and multi-modal (based on compositional data analysis) approach to this representation and quantify the benefits in 7 Tesla MRI data of nine volunteers. We present an openly accessible Python implementation of these approaches and demonstrate that editing cortical segmentations using two-dimensional histogram representations aids existing algorithms and yields improved gray matter borders. By making our data and corresponding expert (ground truth) segmentations available, we facilitate future efforts to develop and test segmentation algorithms on this challenging type of data.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/245720v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>As humans and animals experience the world, they learn to associate states and actions with the expected values of the reward that is likely to follow. Neural correlates of expected value are found in many brain regions, including the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). While OFC value representations have been identified across many tasks and species, their computational role remains controversial. One influential hypothesis holds that they drive value-based choosing: The OFC represents the expected values of available options, and choices are made by comparing these values to one another. A contrasting hypothesis holds that they drive learning: The OFC represents the expected values of immediately impending outcomes, which are compared to rewards actually received, so as to learn and adapt expectations to match the world. In common laboratory tasks the items to be decided between are also the items to be learned about, making the two hypothesized roles difficult to distinguish. Here, we use a recently-developed multi-step task for rats that separates choosing from learning. In a first step, rats choose one of two ports ('choice ports') whose expected values are computed using planning, and are not learned. In the second step, rats are led to one of two other ports ('outcome ports') which are not chosen between, but whose expected values are learned based on reward history. We found relatively weak OFC encoding of choice port values, needed for choosing but not learning, but far stronger encoding of outcome port values, needed for learning but not choosing. Moreover, temporally-specific silencing of OFC during outcome port entry was sufficient to disrupt behavior, and the nature of this disruption was consistent with impairment of a value learning process, but was not consistent with impairment of a choice process. We therefore suggest that value representations in the OFC directly drive learning, but do not directly drive choice.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>We investigated how native language experience shapes prediction mechanisms. Two groups of bilinguals (either Spanish or Basque natives) performed a word matching task (WMT) and a picture matching task (PMT). They indicated whether the stimuli they perceived matched with the noun they heard. Spanish noun endings were either diagnostic of the gender (transparent), or ambiguous (opaque). ERPs were time-locked to the gender-marked determiner preceding the predicted noun. In the WMT both groups showed a negative (~340 ms) effect. Basque natives displayed an earlier effect (~150 ms) for determiners preceding transparent nouns. In the PMT both groups showed an early effect (~160 ms) for determiners preceding opaque nouns. Transparent nouns' determiners elicited prediction at ~330 ms in Spanish natives, but at ~460 ms in Basque natives. It is concluded that bilinguals rely on the features of the L1 for predicting in the L2: native experience moulds prediction. Linguistic prediction is hierarchical, with different operation levels communicating at an interface stage.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>A broad range of decision-making processes involve gradual accumulation of evidence over time, but the neural circuits responsible for this computation are not yet established. Recent data indicates that cortical regions prominently associated with accumulating evidence, such as posterior parietal cortex and the frontal orienting fields, are not necessary for computing it. Which, then, are the regions responsible? Regions directly involved in evidence accumulation should satisfy the criteria of being necessary for accumulation-based decision-making behavior, having a graded neural encoding of accumulated evidence and causal contributing throughout the accumulation process. Here, we investigated the role of the anterior dorsal striatum (ADS) in a rodent auditory evidence accumulation task using a combination of behavioral, pharmacological, optogenetic, electrophysiological and computational approaches. We find that the ADS is the first brain region known to satisfy these criteria. Thus, the ADS may be the first identified node in the network responsible for evidence accumulation.</content:encoded>

The approach uses white matter blueprints of the whole cortex based on a set of white matter tracts that can be anatomically matched across species. The blueprints provide a common reference space that allows us to navigate between brains of different species, identify homologue cortical areas, or to transform whole cortical maps from one species to the other. Specializations are cast within this framework as deviations between the species' blueprints. We illustrate how this approach can be used to compare human and macaque brains.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/244434v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Invertebrate nervous systems are valuable models for fundamental principles of the control of behavior. Ventral nerve cord (VNC) motor neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans represent one of the best studied locomotor circuits, with known connectivity and functional information about most of the involved neuron classes. However, for one of those, the AS motor neurons (AS MNs), no physiological data is available. Combining specific expression and selective illumination, we precisely targeted AS MNs by optogenetics and addressed their role in the locomotion circuit. After photostimulation, AS MNs induce currents in post-synaptic body wall muscles (BWMs), exhibiting an initial asymmetry of excitatory output. This may facilitate complex regulatory motifs for adjusting direction during navigation. By behavioral and photo-inhibition experiments, we show that AS MNs contribute to propagation of the antero-posterior body wave during locomotion. By Ca2+-imaging in AS MNs and in their synaptic partners, we also reveal that AS MNs play a role in mediating forward and backward locomotion by integrating activity of premotor interneurons (PINs), as well as in coordination of the dorso-ventral body wave. AS MNs do not exhibit pacemaker properties, but potentially gate VNC central pattern generators (CPGs), as indicated by ceasing of locomotion when AS MNs are hyperpolarized. AS MNs provide positive feedback to the PIN AVA via gap junctions, a feature found also in other locomotion circuits. In sum, AS MNs have essential roles in coordinating locomotion, combining several functions, and emphasizing the compressed nature of the C. elegans nervous system in comparison to higher animals.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/189811v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Invariant object recognition, which refers to the ability of precisely and rapidly recognizing objects in the presence of variations, has been a central question in human vision research. The general consensus is that the ventral and dorsal visual streams are the major processing pathways which undertake category and variation encoding in entangled layers. This overlooks the mounting evidence which support the role of peri-frontal areas in category encoding. These recent studies, however, have left open several aspects of visual processing in peri-frontal areas including whether these areas contributed only in active tasks, whether they interacted with peri-occipital areas or processed information independently and differently. To address these concerns, a passive EEG paradigm was designed in which subjects viewed a set of variation-controlled object images. Using multivariate pattern analysis, noticeable category and variation information were observed in occipital, parietal, temporal and prefrontal areas, supporting their contribution to visual processing. Using task specificity indices, phase and Granger causality analyses, three distinct stages of processing were identified which revealed transfer of information between peri-frontal and peri-occipital areas suggesting their parallel and interactive processing of visual information. A brain-plausible computational model supported the possibility of parallel processing mechanisms in peri-occipital and peri-frontal areas. These findings, while advocating previous results on the role of prefrontal areas in object recognition, extend their contribution from active recognition, in which peri-frontal to peri-occipital feedback mechanisms are activated, to the general case of object and variation processing, which is an integral part of visual processing and play role even during passive viewing.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Modeling the genetic relatedness of &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; parasites following meiotic recombination and cotransmission</title>

Unlike in most pathogens, multiple-strain (polygenomic) infections of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;falciparum&lt;/i&gt; are frequently composed of genetic siblings. These genetic siblings are the result of sexual reproduction and can coinfect the same host when cotransmitted by the same mosquito. The degree with which coinfecting strains are related varies among infections and populations. Because sexual recombination occurs within the mosquito, the relatedness of cotransmitted strains could depend on transmission dynamics, but little is actually known of the factors that influence the relatedness of cotransmitted strains. Part of the uncertainty stems from an incomplete understanding of how within-host and within-vector dynamics affect cotransmission. Cotransmission is difficult to examine experimentally but can be explored using a computational model. We developed a malaria transmission model that simulates sexual reproduction in order to understand what determines the relatedness of cotransmitted strains. This study highlights how the relatedness of cotransmitted strains depends on both within-host and within-vector dynamics including the complexity of infection. We also used our transmission model to analyze the genetic relatedness of polygenomic infections following a series of multiple transmission events and examined the effects of superinfection. Understanding the factors that influence the relatedness of cotransmitted strains could lead to a better understanding of the population-genetic correlates of transmission and therefore be important for public health.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DIdV_Uzv1uY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Physiological regulation of PARKIN abundance, however, and the impact on...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/2KaUrF5tUis&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02549</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The human brain is a large-scale network which function depends on dynamic
interactions between spatially-distributed regions. In the rapidly-evolving
field of network neuroscience, two yet unresolved challenges are potential
breakthroughs. First, functional brain networks should be estimated from
noninvasive and easy to use neuroimaging techniques. Second, the time/space
resolution of these techniques should be high enough to assess the dynamics of
identified networks. Emerging evidence suggests that Electroencephalography
(EEG) source connectivity method may offer solutions to both issues provided
that scalp EEG signals are appropriately processed. Therefore, the performance
of EEG source connectivity method strongly depends on signal processing (SP)
that involves various methods such as preprocessing techniques, inverse
solutions, statistical couplings between signals and network science. The main
objective of this tutorial-like review is to provide an overview on EEG source
connectivity. We describe the major contributions that the SP community brought
to this research field. We emphasize the methodological issues that need to be
carefully addressed to obtain relevant results and we stress the current
limitations that need further investigation. We also report results obtained in
concrete applications, in both normal and pathological brain states. Future
directions in term of signal processing methods and applications are eventually
provided

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Optimizing Channel Selection for Seizure Detection. (arXiv:1801.02472v1 [eess.SP])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02472</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Interpretation of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can be complicated by
obfuscating artifacts. Artifact detection plays an important role in the
observation and analysis of EEG signals. Spatial information contained in the
placement of the electrodes can be exploited to accurately detect artifacts.
However, when fewer electrodes are used, less spatial information is available,
making it harder to detect artifacts. In this study, we investigate the
performance of a deep learning algorithm, CNN-LSTM, on several channel
configurations. Each configuration was designed to minimize the amount of
spatial information lost compared to a standard 22-channel EEG. Systems using a
reduced number of channels ranging from 8 to 20 achieved sensitivities between
33% and 37% with false alarms in the range of [38, 50] per 24 hours. False
alarms increased dramatically (e.g., over 300 per 24 hours) when the number of
channels was further reduced. Baseline performance of a system that used all 22
channels was 39% sensitivity with 23 false alarms. Since the 22-channel system
was the only system that included referential channels, the rapid increase in
the false alarm rate as the number of channels was reduced underscores the
importance of retaining referential channels for artifact reduction. This
cautionary result is important because one of the biggest differences between
various types of EEGs administered is the type of referential channel used.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hyperplane codes are a class of convex codes that arise as the output of a
one layer feed-forward neural network. Here we establish several natural
properties of non-degenerate hyperplane codes, in terms of the polar complex of
the code, a simplicial complex associated to any combinatorial code. We prove
that the polar complex of a non-degenerate hyperplane code is shellable and
show that all currently known properties of the hyperplane codes follow from
the shellability of the appropriate polar complex.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Rapid de novo shape encoding: a challenge to connectionist modeling. (arXiv:1801.02256v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02256</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural network (connectionist) models are designed to encode image features
and provide the building blocks for object and shape recognition. These models
generally call for: a) initial diffuse connections from one neuron population
to another, and b) training to bring about a functional change in those
connections so that one or more high-tier neurons will selectively respond to a
specific shape stimulus. Advanced models provide for translation, size, and
rotation invariance. The present discourse notes that recent work on human
perceptual skills has demonstrated immediate encoding of unknown shapes that
were seen only once. Further, the perceptual mechanism provided for
translation, size, and rotation invariance. This finding represents a challenge
to connectionist models that require many training trials to achieve
recognition and invariance.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Multiplex core-periphery organization of the human connectome. (arXiv:1801.01913v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01913</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The behavior of many complex systems is determined by a core of densely
interconnected units. While many methods are available to identify the core of
a network when connections between nodes are all of the same type, a principled
approach to define the core when multiple types of connectivity are allowed is
still lacking. Here we introduce a general framework to define and extract the
core-periphery structure of multi-layer networks by explicitly taking into
account the connectivity of the nodes at each layer. We show how our method
works on synthetic networks with different size, density, and overlap between
the cores at the different layers. We then apply the method to multiplex brain
networks whose layers encode information both on the anatomical and the
functional connectivity among regions of the human cortex. Results confirm the
presence of the main known hubs, but also suggest the existence of novel brain
core regions that have been discarded by previous analysis which focused
exclusively on the structural layer. Our work is a step forward in the
identification of the core of the human connectome, and contributes to shed
light to a fundamental question in modern neuroscience.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Representability of algebraic topology for biomolecules in machine learning based scoring and virtual screening</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/hyJPg5SR-GY/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Zixuan Cang, Lin Mu, Guo-Wei Wei&lt;/p&gt;

This work introduces a number of algebraic topology approaches, including multi-component persistent homology, multi-level persistent homology, and electrostatic persistence for the representation, characterization, and description of small molecules and biomolecular complexes. In contrast to the conventional persistent homology, multi-component persistent homology retains critical chemical and biological information during the topological simplification of biomolecular geometric complexity. Multi-level persistent homology enables a tailored topological description of inter- and/or intra-molecular interactions of interest. Electrostatic persistence incorporates partial charge information into topological invariants. These topological methods are paired with Wasserstein distance to characterize similarities between molecules and are further integrated with a variety of machine learning algorithms, including k-nearest neighbors, ensemble of trees, and deep convolutional neural networks, to manifest their descriptive and predictive powers for protein-ligand binding analysis and virtual screening of small molecules. Extensive numerical experiments involving more than 4,414 protein-ligand complexes from the PDBBind database (a non-redundant collection of PDBBind refined sets 2007, 2013, 2015, and 2016) and 128,374 ligand-target and decoy-target pairs in the DUD database are performed to test respectively the scoring power and the discriminatory power of the proposed topological learning strategies. It is demonstrated that the present topological learning outperforms other existing methods in protein-ligand binding affinity prediction and ligand-decoy discrimination.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hyJPg5SR-GY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Robust and efficient coding with grid cells</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Lajos Vágó, Balázs B. Ujfalussy&lt;/p&gt;

The neuronal code arising from the coordinated activity of grid cells in the rodent entorhinal cortex can uniquely represent space across a large range of distances, but the precise conditions for optimal coding capacity are known only for environments with finite size. Here we consider a coding scheme that is suitable for unbounded environments, and present a novel, number theoretic approach to derive the grid parameters that maximise the coding range in the presence of noise. We derive an analytic upper bound on the coding range and provide examples for grid scales that achieve this bound and hence are optimal for encoding in unbounded environments. We show that in the absence of neuronal noise, the capacity of the system is extremely sensitive to the choice of the grid periods. However, when the accuracy of the representation is limited by neuronal noise, the capacity quickly becomes more robust against the choice of grid scales as the number of modules increases. Importantly, we found that the capacity of the system is near optimal even for random scale choices already for a realistic number of grid modules. Our study demonstrates that robust and efficient coding can be achieved without parameter tuning in the case of grid cell representation and provides a solid theoretical explanation for the large diversity of the grid scales observed in experimental studies. Moreover, we suggest that having multiple grid modules in the entorhinal cortex is not only required for the exponentially large coding capacity, but is also a prerequisite for the robustness of the system.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IHOSyQSZuSI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Cell migration is a central biological process that requires fine coordination of molecular events in time and space. A deregulation of the migratory phenotype is also associated with pathological conditions including cancer where cell motility has a causal role in tumor spreading and metastasis formation. Thus cell migration is of critical and strategic importance across the complex disease spectrum as well as for the basic understanding of cell phenotype. Experimental studies of the migration of cells in monolayers are often conducted with ‘wound healing’ assays. Analysis of these assays has traditionally relied on how the wound area changes over time. However this method does not take into account the shape of the wound. Given the many options for creating a wound healing assay and the fact that wound shape invariably changes as cells migrate this is a significant flaw. Here we present a novel software package for analyzing concerted cell velocity in wound healing assays. Our method encompasses a wound detection algorithm based on cell confluency thresholding and employs a Bayesian approach in order to estimate concerted cell velocity with an associated likelihood. We have applied this method to study the effect of siRNA knockdown on the migration of a breast cancer cell line and demonstrate that cell velocity can track wound healing independently of wound shape and provides a more robust quantification with significantly higher signal to noise ratios than conventional analyses of wound area. The software presented here will enable other researchers in any field of cell biology to quantitatively analyze and track live cell migratory processes and is therefore expected to have a significant impact on the study of cell migration, including cancer relevant processes.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Cardinal features of involuntary force variability can arise from the closed-loop control of viscoelastic afferented muscles</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/3BwWexls06A/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Akira Nagamori, Christopher M. Laine, Francisco J. Valero-Cuevas&lt;/p&gt;

Involuntary force variability below 15 Hz arises from, and is influenced by, many factors including descending neural drive, proprioceptive feedback, and mechanical properties of muscles and tendons. However, their potential interactions that give rise to the well-structured spectrum of involuntary force variability are not well understood due to a lack of experimental techniques. Here, we investigated the generation, modulation, and interactions among different sources of force variability using a physiologically-grounded closed-loop simulation of an afferented muscle model. The closed-loop simulation included a musculotendon model, muscle spindle, Golgi tendon organ (GTO), and a tracking controller which enabled target-guided force tracking. We demonstrate that closed-loop control of an afferented musculotendon suffices to replicate and explain surprisingly many cardinal features of involuntary force variability. Specifically, we present 1) a potential origin of low-frequency force variability associated with co-modulation of motor unit firing rates (i.e.,‘common drive’), 2) an in-depth characterization of how proprioceptive feedback pathways suffice to generate 5-12 Hz physiological tremor, and 3) evidence that modulation of those feedback pathways (i.e., presynaptic inhibition of Ia and Ib afferents, and spindle sensitivity via fusimotor drive) influence the full spectrum of force variability. These results highlight the previously underestimated importance of closed-loop neuromechanical interactions in explaining involuntary force variability during voluntary ‘isometric’ force control. Furthermore, these results provide the basis for a unifying theory that relates spinal circuitry to various manifestations of altered involuntary force variability in fatigue, aging and neurological disease.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3BwWexls06A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Maximum entropy models reveal the correlation structure in cortical neural activity during wakefulness and sleep. (arXiv:1801.01853v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01853</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Maximum Entropy models can be inferred from large data-sets to uncover how
local interactions can generate collective dynamics. Here, we employ such
methods to investigate the characteristics of neurons recorded by
multielectrode arrays in the cortex of human and monkey throughout states of
wakefulness and sleep. Taking advantage of the separation of cells into
excitatory and inhibitory types, we construct a model including this biological
feature. By comparing the performances of Maximum Entropy models at predicting
neural activity in wakefulness and deep sleep, we identify the dominant
interactions between neurons in each brain state. We find that during
wakefulness, dominant functional interactions are pairwise while during sleep,
interactions are population-wide. In particular, inhibitory cells are shown to

models can be useful to analyze data-sets with excitatory and inhibitory cells,

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A major challenge in sensory neuroscience is to understand how complex
stimuli are collectively encoded by neural circuits. In particular, the role of
correlations between output neurons is still unclear. Here we introduce a
general strategy to equip an arbitrary model of stimulus encoding by single
neurons with a network of couplings between output neurons. We develop a method
for inferring both the parameters of the encoding model and the couplings
between neurons from simultaneously recorded retinal ganglion cells. The
inference method fits the couplings to accurately account for noise
correlations, without affecting the performance in predicting the mean
response. We demonstrate that the inferred couplings are independent of the
stimulus used for learning, and can be used to predict the correlated activity
in response to more complex stimuli. The model offers a powerful and precise
tool for assessing the impact of noise correlations on the encoding of sensory
information.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Mean-field modeling of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical system. I. Firing rates in healthy and parkinsonian states. (arXiv:1801.01822v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01822</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Parkinsonism leads to various electrophysiological changes in the basal
ganglia-thalamocortical system (BGTCS), often including elevated discharge
rates of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the output nuclei, and reduced
activity of the globus pallidus external segment (GPe). These rate changes have
been explained qualitatively in terms of the direct/indirect pathway model,
involving projections of distinct striatal populations to the output nuclei and
GPe. Although these populations partly overlap, evidence suggests dopamine
depletion differentially affects cortico-striato-pallidal connection strengths
to the two pallidal segments. Dopamine loss may also decrease the striatal
signal-to-noise ratio, reducing both corticostriatal coupling and striatal
firing thresholds. Here we present a mean-field model of the BGTCS with
structure and parameter estimates closely based on physiology and anatomy.
Changes in firing rates due to modeled dopamine loss are compared with
experiment. Our results suggest that a stronger indirect pathway, possibly
combined with a weakened direct pathway, is compatible with empirical evidence.
However, altered corticostriatal connection strengths are probably not solely
responsible for substantially increased STN activity often found. A lower STN
firing threshold, weaker intracortical inhibition, and stronger striato-GPe
inhibition help explain the relatively large increase in STN rate. Changes in
cortex, GPe, and STN help normalize the cortical rate, also in accord with
experiments. The model integrates the basal ganglia into a unified framework
along with an existing thalamocortical model that accounts for a wide range of
electrophysiological phenomena. A companion paper discusses the dynamics and
oscillations of this combined system.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01821</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal correlates of Parkinson's disease (PD) include a slowing of the
electroencephalogram (EEG) and enhanced synchrony at 3-7 and 7-30 Hz in the
basal ganglia, thalamus, and cortex. This study describes the dynamics of a
physiologically based mean-field model of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical
system, and shows how it accounts for key electrophysiological correlates of
PD. Its connectivity comprises partially segregated direct and indirect
pathways through the striatum, a hyperdirect pathway involving a
corticosubthalamic projection, thalamostriatal feedback, and local inhibition
in striatum and external pallidum (GPe). In a companion paper, realistic
steady-state firing rates were obtained for the healthy state, and after
dopamine loss modeled by weaker direct and stronger indirect pathways, reduced
intrapallidal inhibition, lower firing thresholds of the GPe and subthalamic
nucleus (STN), a stronger striato-GPe projection, and weaker cortical
interactions. Here we show that oscillations around 5 and 20 Hz can arise with
a strong indirect pathway, which also increases synchrony throughout the basal
ganglia. Further, increased theta power with nigrostriatal degeneration
correlates with reduced alpha power and peak frequency, matching experiments.
Unlike the hyperdirect pathway, the indirect pathway sustains oscillations with
realistic phase relationships. Changes in basal ganglia responses to transient
stimuli accord with experimental data. Reduced cortical gains due to both
nigrostriatal and mesocortical dopamine loss lead to slower cortical activity
changes and may be related to bradykinesia. Finally, increased EEG power found
in some studies may be partly explained by a lower effective GPe firing
threshold, reduced GPe-GPe inhibition, and/or weaker intracortical connections
in PD. Strict separation of the direct and indirect pathways is not necessary
for these results.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01748</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many variables in the social, physical, and biosciences, including
neuroscience, are non-normally distributed. To improve the statistical
properties of such data, or to allow parametric testing, logarithmic or logit
transformations are often used. Box-Cox transformations or ad hoc methods are
sometimes used for parameters for which no transformation is known to
approximate normality. However, these methods do not always give good agreement
with the Gaussian. A transformation is discussed that maps probability
distributions as closely as possible to the normal distribution, with exact
agreement for continuous distributions. To illustrate, the transformation is
applied to a theoretical distribution, and to quantitative
electroencephalographic (qEEG) measures from repeat recordings of 32 subjects
which are highly non-normal. Agreement with the Gaussian was better than using
logarithmic, logit, or Box-Cox transformations. Since normal data have
previously been shown to have better test-retest reliability than non-normal
data under fairly general circumstances, the implications of our transformation
for the test-retest reliability of parameters were investigated. Reliability
was shown to improve with the transformation, where the improvement was
comparable to that using Box-Cox. An advantage of the general transformation is
that it does not require laborious optimization over a range of parameters or a
case-specific choice of form.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01711</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The extent of intra-individual and inter-individual variability is an
important factor in determining the statistical, and hence possibly clinical,
significance of observed differences in the EEG. This study investigates the
changes in classical quantitative EEG (qEEG) measures, as well as of parameters
obtained by fitting frequency spectra to a continuum model of brain electrical
activity. These parameters may have extra variability due to model selection
and fitting. Besides estimating levels of intra-individual and inter-individual
variability, we determine approximate time scales for change in qEEG measures
and model parameters. This provides an estimate of the recording length needed
to capture a given percentage of the total intra-individual variability. Also,
if more precise time scales can be obtained in future, these may aid the
characterization of physiological processes underlying various EEG measures.
Heterogeneity of the subject group was constrained by testing only healthy
males in a narrow age range (mean = 22.3 years, sd = 2.7). Resting eyes-closed
EEGs of 32 subjects were recorded at weekly intervals over an approximately
six-week period. Of these, 13 subjects had follow-up recordings spanning up to
a year. QEEG measures, computed from Cz spectra, were powers in five frequency
bands, alpha peak frequency, and spectral entropy. Of these, theta, alpha, and
beta band powers were most reproducible. Of nine model parameters obtained by
fitting model predictions to experiment, the most reproducible ones quantified
the total power and the time delay between cortex and thalamus. About 95% of
the maximum change in spectral parameters was reached within minutes of
recording time, implying that repeat recordings are not necessary to capture
the bulk of the variability in EEG spectra likely to occur in the resting
eyes-closed state on the scale of a year.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01651</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Directionality is a fundamental feature of network connections. Most
structural brain networks are intrinsically directed because of the nature of
chemical synapses, which comprise most neuronal connections. Due to limitations
of non-invasive imaging techniques, the directionality of connections between
structurally connected regions of the human brain cannot be confirmed. Hence,
connections are represented as undirected, and it is still unknown how this
lack of directionality affects brain network topology. Using six directed brain
networks from different species and parcellations (cat, mouse, C. elegans, and
three macaque networks), we estimate the inaccuracies in network measures
(degree, betweenness, clustering coefficient, path length, global efficiency,
participation index, and small worldness) associated with the removal of the
directionality of connections. We employ three different methods to render
directed brain networks undirected: (i) remove uni-directional connections,
(ii) add reciprocal connections, and (iii) combine equal numbers of removed and
added uni-directional connections. We quantify the extent of inaccuracy in
network measures introduced through neglecting connection directionality for
individual nodes and across the network. We find that the coarse division
between core and peripheral nodes remains accurate for undirected networks.
However, hub nodes differ considerably when directionality is neglected.
Comparing the different methods to generate undirected networks from directed
ones, we generally find that the addition of reciprocal connections (false
positives) causes larger errors in graph-theoretic measures than the removal of
the same number of directed connections (false negatives). These findings
suggest that directionality plays an essential role in shaping brain networks
and highlight some limitations of undirected connectomes.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01577</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recently we developed a novel method for assessing the hierarchical
modularity of functional brain networks - the probability associated community
estimation(PACE). The PACE algorithm is unique in that it permits a dual
formulation, thus yielding equivalent connectome modular structure regardless
of whether considering positive or negative edges. This method was rigorously
validated using F1000 and HCP data. We detected novel sex differences in
resting-state connectivity that were not previously reported. This current
study more thoroughly examined sex differences as a function of age and their
clinical correlates, with findings supporting a basal configuration framework.
To this end, we found that men and women do not significantly differ in the
22-25 age range. However, these same non-significant differences attained
statistical significance in the 26-30 age group, while becoming highly
statistically significant in the 31-35 age group. At the most global level,
areas of diverging sex difference include parts of the prefrontal cortex and
the temporal lobe, amygdala, hippocampus, inferior parietal lobule, posterior
cingulate, and precuneus. Further, we identified statistically different
self-reported summary scores of inattention, hyperactivity, and anxiety
problems between men and women. These self-reports additionally divergently
interact with age and the basal configuration between sexes. In sum, our study
supports a paradigm change in how we conceptualize the functional connectome,
shifting away from simple concepts, and towards thinking globally and
probabilistically how the brain exhibits dynamic sex-specific connectivity
configuration as a function of age, and the role this sex-by-age configuration
at rest might play in mental health frequency and presentation, including
symptom patterns in depression.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01441</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Healthy ageing is associated with decline in cognitive abilities such as
language. Aerobic fitness has been shown to ameliorate decline in some
cognitive domains, but the potential benefits for language have not been
examined. We investigated the relationship between aerobic fitness and
tip-of-the-tongue states.These are among the most frequent cognitive failures
in healthy older adults and occur when a speaker knows a word but is unable to
produce it. We found that healthy older adults indeed experience more
tip-of-the-tongue states, and that when they do they have access to less
information about the word's sound structure, compared to young controls.
Importantly, higher aerobic fitness levels decrease the probability of
experiencing tip-of-the-tongue states in healthy older adults, over and above
the effect of age. This is the first demonstration of a link between aerobic
fitness and language functioning in healthy older adults.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Treatment With the Neutralizing Antibody Against Repulsive Guidance Molecule-a Promotes Recovery From Impaired Manual Dexterity in a Primate Model of Spinal Cord Injury</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx338/4774695?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Axons in the mature mammalian central nervous system have only a limited capacity to grow/regenerate after injury, and spontaneous recovery of motor functions is therefore not greatly expected in spinal cord injury (SCI). To promote functional recovery after SCI, it is critical that corticospinal tract (CST) fibers reconnect properly with target spinal neurons through enhanced axonal growth/regeneration. Here, we applied antibody treatment against repulsive guidance molecule-a (RGMa) to a monkey model of SCI. We found that inhibition of upregulated RGMa around the lesioned site in the cervical cord resulted in recovery from impaired manual dexterity by accentuated penetration of CST fibers into laminae VII and IX, where spinal interneurons and motoneurons are located, respectively. Furthermore, pharmacological inactivation following intracortical microstimulation revealed that the contralesional, but not the ipsilesional, primary motor cortex was crucially involved in functional recovery at a late stage in our SCI model. The present data indicate that treatment with the neutralizing antibody against RGMa after SCI is a potential target for achieving restored manual dexterity in primates.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A neural network model for the orbitofrontal cortex and task space acquisition during reinforcement learning</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/AUMovToj5Zo/article</link>

Reinforcement learning has been widely used in explaining animal behavior. In reinforcement learning, the agent learns the value of the states in the task, collectively constituting the task state space, and uses the knowledge to choose actions and acquire desired outcomes. It has been proposed that the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) encodes the task state space during reinforcement learning. However, it is not well understood how the OFC acquires and stores task state information. Here, we propose a neural network model based on reservoir computing. Reservoir networks exhibit heterogeneous and dynamic activity patterns that are suitable to encode task states. The information can be extracted by a linear readout trained with reinforcement learning. We demonstrate how the network acquires and stores task structures. The network exhibits reinforcement learning behavior and its aspects resemble experimental findings of the OFC. Our study provides a theoretical explanation of how the OFC may contribute to reinforcement learning and a new approach to understanding the neural mechanism underlying reinforcement learning.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AUMovToj5Zo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Functional interrogation of &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; genus metabolism identifies species- and stage-specific differences in nutrient essentiality and drug targeting</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/WBx_sY5m_rA/article</link>

Several antimalarial drugs exist, but differences between life cycle stages among malaria species pose challenges for developing more effective therapies. To understand the diversity among stages and species, we reconstructed genome-scale models (GEMs) of metabolism for five life cycle stages and five species of &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; spanning the blood, transmission, and mosquito stages. The stage-specific models of &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; uncovered stage-dependent changes in central carbon metabolism and predicted potential targets that could affect several life cycle stages. The species-specific models further highlight differences between experimental animal models and the human-infecting species. Comparisons between human- and rodent-infecting species revealed differences in thiamine (vitamin B1), choline, and pantothenate (vitamin B5) metabolism. Thus, we show that genome-scale analysis of multiple stages and species of &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; can prioritize potential drug targets that could be both anti-malarials and transmission blocking agents, in addition to guiding translation from non-human experimental disease models.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WBx_sY5m_rA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Pretreatment Lesional Volume Impacts Clinical Outcome and Thrombectomy Efficacy</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25133</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: We aimed to characterize the association between pretreatment lesional volume measured on diffusion-weighted images and functional outcome, and estimate the impact on thrombectomy efficacy for ischemic stroke with anterior proximal intracranial arterial occlusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Anterior circulation ischemic stroke patients who had pretreatment diffusion-weighted imaging in the THRACE study were included. Lesional volume was semi-automatically segmented. Logistic regression was applied to model clinical outcome as a function of lesional volume. Outcomes included functional independence (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] 0-2), degree of disability (ordinal mRS 0-6), and mortality at 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Of 298 included patients, with median lesional volume 17.2 mL (interquartile range [IQR] 9.2-51.8) and median mRS 2 (IQR 1-4), 51.0% achieved functional independence. Increased lesional volume was an independent predictor for a lower probability of functional independence (odds ratio [OR] 0.90 [95% CI 0.81-0.99] per 10 mL, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.001), a less favorable degree of disability (common OR [cOR] 0.86 [95% CI 0.81-0.90] per 10 mL, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.001), and a higher mortality rate (OR 1.21 [95% CI 1.08-1.37] per 10 mL, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). For additional thrombectomy, the number of patients needed to treat to achieve functional independence in 1 patient increased with lesional volume (10 for a volume of 80 mL; 15 for 135 mL). No significant treatment-by-dichotomized volume interaction for functional independence and mortality was observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: Pretreatment lesional volume is an independent predictor for functional outcome in acute ischemic stroke with proximal intracranial occlusion. The clinical benefit of adding mechanical thrombectomy to thrombolysis decreased with the increase of lesional volume. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Association of prothrombin complex concentrates administration and hematoma enlargement in NOAC-related intracerebral hemorrhage</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25134</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: To investigate parameters associated with hematoma enlargement in non-vitamin-K-antagonist-anticoagulant(NOAC)-related intracerebral hemorrhage(ICH).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Retrospective cohort study including individual patient data of 190 patients with NOAC-associated ICH over a 5-year-period(2011-2015) at 19 Departments of Neurology across Germany. Primary outcome was the association of PCC-administration with hematoma enlargement. Subanalyses were calculated for blood-pressure management and its association with the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include associations with in-hospital mortality and functional outcome at 3 months assessed using the modified Rankin scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The study population for analysis of primary and secondary outcomes consisted of 146 NOAC-ICH-patients with available follow-up imaging. Hematoma enlargement occurred in 49/146(33.6%) patients with NOAC-related ICH. Parameters associated with hematoma enlargement were blood pressure above 160mmHg within 4hours and – in case of factor-Xa-inhibitor-ICH – anti-Xa-levels on admission. PCC-administration prior to follow-up imaging was not significantly associated with a reduced rate of hematoma enlargement neither in overall NOAC-related ICH nor in patients with factor-Xa-inhibitor intake (RR(95%CI):NOAC 1.150(0.632-2.090);factor-Xa-inhibitor: 1.057(0.565-1.977)), regardless of PCC-dosage given or time interval until imaging or treatment. Systolic blood pressure levels&amp;lt;160mmHg within 4 hours after admission were significantly associated with a reduction in the proportion of patients with hematoma enlargement (RR(95%CI):1.057(0.565-1.977)). PCC-administration had no effect on mortality and functional outcome neither at discharge nor at 3months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: In contrast to blood-pressure control, PCC-administration was not associated with a reduced rate of hematoma enlargement in NOAC-related ICH. Our findings support the need of further investigations exploring new hemostatic reversal strategies for patients with factor-Xa-inhibitor-related ICH. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Mathematical modeling identifies optimum lapatinib dosing schedules for the treatment of glioblastoma patients</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/9ffKwWuBqlk/article</link>

Human primary glioblastomas (GBM) often harbor mutations within the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Treatment of EGFR-mutant GBM cell lines with the EGFR/HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib can effectively induce cell death in these models. However, EGFR inhibitors have shown little efficacy in the clinic, partly because of inappropriate dosing. Here, we developed a computational approach to model the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; cellular dynamics of the EGFR-mutant cell line SF268 in response to different lapatinib concentrations and dosing schedules. We then used this approach to identify an effective treatment strategy within the clinical toxicity limits of lapatinib, and developed a partial differential equation modeling approach to study the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; GBM treatment response by taking into account the heterogeneous and diffusive nature of the disease. Despite the inability of lapatinib to induce tumor regressions with a continuous daily schedule, our modeling approach consistently predicts that continuous dosing remains the best clinically feasible strategy for slowing down tumor growth and lowering overall tumor burden, compared to pulsatile schedules currently known to be tolerated, even when considering drug resistance, reduced lapatinib tumor concentrations due to the blood brain barrier, and the phenotypic switch from proliferative to migratory cell phenotypes that occurs in hypoxic microenvironments. Our mathematical modeling and statistical analysis platform provides a rational method for comparing treatment schedules in search for optimal dosing strategies for glioblastoma and other cancer types.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9ffKwWuBqlk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Gene expression is orchestrated by distinct regulatory regions to ensure a wide variety of cell types and functions. A challenge is to identify which regulatory regions are active, what are their associated features and how they work together in each cell type. Several approaches have tackled this problem by modeling gene expression based on epigenetic marks, with the ultimate goal of identifying driving regions and associated genomic variations that are clinically relevant in particular in precision medicine. However, these models rely on experimental data, which are limited to specific samples (even often to cell lines) and cannot be generated for all regulators and all patients. In addition, we show here that, although these approaches are accurate in predicting gene expression, inference of TF combinations from this type of models is not straightforward. Furthermore these methods are not designed to capture regulation instructions present at the sequence level, before the binding of regulators or the opening of the chromatin. Here, we probe sequence-level instructions for gene expression and develop a method to explain mRNA levels based solely on nucleotide features. Our method positions nucleotide composition as a critical component of gene expression. Moreover, our approach, able to rank regulatory regions according to their contribution, unveils a strong influence of the gene body sequence, in particular introns. We further provide evidence that the contribution of nucleotide content can be linked to co-regulations associated with genome 3D architecture and to associations of genes within topologically associated domains.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/isBV1L_-p0A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Epithelial-mesenchymal-transition promotes intra-tumoral heterogeneity, by enhancing tumor cell invasiveness and promoting drug resistance. We integrated transcriptomic data for two clonal subpopulations from a prostate cancer cell line (PC-3) into a genome-scale metabolic network model to explore their metabolic differences and potential vulnerabilities. In this dual cell model, PC-3/S cells express Epithelial-mesenchymal-transition markers and display high invasiveness and low metastatic potential, while PC-3/M cells present the opposite phenotype and higher proliferative rate. Model-driven analysis and experimental validations unveiled a marked metabolic reprogramming in long-chain fatty acids metabolism. While PC-3/M cells showed an enhanced entry of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria, PC-3/S cells used long-chain fatty acids as precursors of eicosanoid metabolism. We suggest that this metabolic reprogramming endows PC-3/M cells with augmented energy metabolism for fast proliferation and PC-3/S cells with increased eicosanoid production impacting angiogenesis, cell adhesion and invasion. PC-3/S metabolism also promotes the accumulation of docosahexaenoic acid, a long-chain fatty acid with antiproliferative effects. The potential therapeutic significance of our model was supported by a differential sensitivity of PC-3/M cells to etomoxir, an inhibitor of long-chain fatty acid transport to the mitochondria.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1miMpMwymts&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Integrating data from multiple regulatory layers across cancer types could elucidate additional mechanisms of oncogenesis. Using antibody-based protein profiling of 736 cancer cell lines, along with matching transcriptomic data, we show that pan-cancer bimodality in the amounts of mRNA, protein, and protein phosphorylation reveals mechanisms related to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Based on the bimodal expression of E-cadherin, we define an EMT signature consisting of 239 genes, many of which were not previously associated with EMT. By querying gene expression signatures collected from cancer cell lines after small-molecule perturbations, we identify enrichment for histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors as inducers of EMT, and kinase inhibitors as mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) promoters. Causal modeling of protein-based signaling identifies putative drivers of EMT. In conclusion, integrative analysis of pan-cancer proteomic and transcriptomic data reveals key regulatory mechanisms of oncogenic transformation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8JHO-bLweh0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A systematic atlas of chaperome deregulation topologies across the human cancer landscape</title>

Proteome balance is safeguarded by the proteostasis network (PN), an intricately regulated network of conserved processes that evolved to maintain native function of the diverse ensemble of protein species, ensuring cellular and organismal health. Proteostasis imbalances and collapse are implicated in a spectrum of human diseases, from neurodegeneration to cancer. The characteristics of PN disease alterations however have not been assessed in a systematic way. Since chaperome is among the central components of PN, we focused on chaperome in our study by utilizing a curated functional ontology of the human chaperome that we connect in a high-confidence physical protein-protein interaction network. Challenged by the lack of a systems-level understanding of proteostasis alterations in the heterogeneous spectrum of human cancers, we assessed gene expression across more than 10,000 patient biopsies covering 22 solid cancers. We derived a novel customized Meta-PCA dimension reduction approach yielding M-scores as quantitative indicators of disease expression changes to condense the complexity of cancer transcriptomics datasets into quantitative functional network topographies. We confirm upregulation of the HSP90 family and also highlight HSP60s, Prefoldins, HSP100s, ER- and mitochondria-specific chaperones as pan-cancer enriched. Our analysis also reveals a surprisingly consistent strong downregulation of small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) and we stratify two cancer groups based on the preferential upregulation of ATP-dependent chaperones. Strikingly, our analysis highlight similarities between stem cell and cancer proteostasis, and diametrically opposed chaperome deregulation between cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. We developed a web-based Proteostasis Profiler tool (Pro&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) enabling intuitive analysis and visual exploration of proteostasis disease alterations using gene expression data. Our study showcases a comprehensive profiling of chaperome shifts in human cancers and sets the stage for a systematic global analysis of PN alterations across the human diseasome towards novel hypotheses for therapeutic network re-adjustment in proteostasis disorders.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Fr0tWafT6PQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Improving pairwise comparison of protein sequences with domain co-occurrence</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/7Yzat0vdZqA/article</link>

Comparing and aligning protein sequences is an essential task in bioinformatics. More specifically, local alignment tools like BLAST are widely used for identifying conserved protein sub-sequences, which likely correspond to protein domains or functional motifs. However, to limit the number of false positives, these tools are used with stringent sequence-similarity thresholds and hence can miss several hits, especially for species that are phylogenetically distant from reference organisms. A solution to this problem is then to integrate additional contextual information to the procedure. Here, we propose to use domain co-occurrence to increase the sensitivity of pairwise sequence comparisons. Domain co-occurrence is a strong feature of proteins, since most protein domains tend to appear with a limited number of other domains on the same protein. We propose a method to take this information into account in a typical BLAST analysis and to construct new domain families on the basis of these results. We used &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; as a case study to evaluate our method. The experimental findings showed an increase of 14% of the number of significant BLAST hits and an increase of 25% of the proteome area that can be covered with a domain. Our method identified 2240 new domains for which, in most cases, no model of the Pfam database could be linked. Moreover, our study of the quality of the new domains in terms of alignment and physicochemical properties show that they are close to that of standard Pfam domains.

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objectives&lt;/b&gt; We evaluate incidence and prevalence of autoimmune encephalitis and compare the epidemiology of autoimmune and infectious encephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt; We performed a population-based comparative study of the incidence and prevalence of autoimmune and infectious encephalitis in Olmsted County, USA. Autoimmune encephalitis diagnosis and subgroups were defined by 2016 diagnostic criteria and infectious encephalitis diagnosis required a confirmed infectious pathogen. Age- and sex-adjusted prevalence and incidence rates were calculated. Patients with encephalitis of uncertain etiology were excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt; The prevalence of autoimmune encephalitis on January 1, 2014 of 13.7/100,000 was not significantly different from that of all infectious encephalitides (11.6/100,000; p=0.63) or the viral subcategory (8.3/100,000; p=0.17). The incidence rates (1995-2015) of autoimmune and infectious encephalitis were 0.8/100,000 and 1.0/100,000 person-years respectively (p=0.58). The number of relapses or recurrent hospitalizations was higher for autoimmune than infectious encephalitis (p=0.03). The incidence of autoimmune encephalitis increased over time from 0.4/100,000 person-years (1995-2005) to 1.2/100,000 person-years (2006-2015) (p=0.02), attributable to increased recognition of autoantibody-positive cases. The incidence (2.8 vs 0.7/100,000 person-years; p=0.01) and prevalence (38.3 vs 13.7/100,000; p=0.04) of autoimmune encephalitis was higher among African-Americans than Caucasians. The prevalence of specific neural autoantibodies was: myelin-oligodendrocyte-glycoprotein (MOG) (1.9/100,000); glutamic acid decarboxylase-65 (GAD65) (1.9/100,000); unclassified neural autoantibody (1.4/100,000); leucine-rich glioma-inactivated-protein-1 (LGI1) (0.7/100,000); collapsin response-mediator protein-5 (CRMP5) (0.7/100,000); N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor (NMDAR) (0.6/100,000); anti-neuronal nuclear antibody-2 (ANNA-2/anti-Ri) (0.6/100,000) and glial fibrillary acidic protein-α (GFAPα) (0.6/100,000).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt; This study shows that the prevalence and incidence of autoimmune encephalitis is comparable to infectious encephalitis and its detection is increasing over time.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Firing rate equations require a spike synchrony mechanism to correctly describe fast oscillations in inhibitory networks</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/oZ1Gs-satsc/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Federico Devalle, Alex Roxin, Ernest Montbrió&lt;/p&gt;

Recurrently coupled networks of inhibitory neurons robustly generate oscillations in the gamma band. Nonetheless, the corresponding Wilson-Cowan type firing rate equation for such an inhibitory population does not generate such oscillations without an explicit time delay. We show that this discrepancy is due to a voltage-dependent spike-synchronization mechanism inherent in networks of spiking neurons which is not captured by standard firing rate equations. Here we investigate an exact low-dimensional description for a network of heterogeneous canonical Class 1 inhibitory neurons which includes the sub-threshold dynamics crucial for generating synchronous states. In the limit of slow synaptic kinetics the spike-synchrony mechanism is suppressed and the standard Wilson-Cowan equations are formally recovered as long as external inputs are also slow. However, even in this limit synchronous spiking can be elicited by inputs which fluctuate on a time-scale of the membrane time-constant of the neurons. Our meanfield equations therefore represent an extension of the standard Wilson-Cowan equations in which spike synchrony is also correctly described.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oZ1Gs-satsc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Homozygous Boricua TBCK Mutation Causes Neurodegeneration and Aberrant Autophagy</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25130</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: Autosomal recessive mutations in &lt;em&gt;TBCK&lt;/em&gt; cause intellectual disability of variable severity. Although the physiologic function of TBCK remains unclear, loss-of-function mutations are associated with inhibition of mTORC1 signaling. As mTORC1 signaling is known to regulate autophagy, we hypothesized that TBCK-encephalopathy patients with a neurodegenerative course have defects in autophagic-lysosomal dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Children (n=8) of Puerto Rican (Boricua) descent affected with homozygous &lt;em&gt;TBCK&lt;/em&gt; p.R126X mutations underwent extensive neurological phenotyping and neurophysiological studies. We quantified autophagosome content in TBCK&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; patient-derived fibroblasts by immunostaining and assayed autophagic markers by Western assay. Free sialylated oligosaccharide profiles were assayed in patient's urine and fibroblasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The neurologic phenotype of children with &lt;em&gt;TBCK&lt;/em&gt; p.R126X mutations, which we call TBCK-encephaloneuronopathy (TBCKE), include congenital hypotonia, progressive motor neuronopathy, leukoencephalopathy and epilepsy. Systemic features include coarse facies, dyslipidemia, and osteoporosis. TBCK&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; fibroblasts &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; exhibit increased numbers of LC3+ autophagosomes, and increased autophagic flux by immunoblots. Free oligosaccharide profiles in fibroblasts and urine of TBCKE patients differ from control fibroblasts and are ameliorated by treatment with the mTORC1 activator leucine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: TBCKE is a clinically distinguishable syndrome with progressive central and peripheral nervous system dysfunction, consistently seen in patients with the p.R126X mutation. We provide evidence that inappropriate autophagy in the absence of cellular stressors may play a role in this disorder, and that mTORC1 activation may ameliorate the autophagic-lysosomal system dysfunction. Free oligosaccharide profiles could serve as a novel biomarker for this disorder as well as a tool to evaluate potential therapeutic interventions. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Vasodilator Dysfunction and Oligodendrocyte Dysmaturation in Aging White Matter</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25129</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: Microvascular brain injury (mVBI) is a common pathologic correlate of vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) that leads to white matter injury (WMI). VCID appears to arise from chronic recurrent white matter ischemia that triggers oxidative stress and an increase in total oligodendrocyte lineage cells. We hypothesized that mVBI involves vasodilator dysfunction of white matter penetrating arterioles and aberrant oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) responses to WMI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We analyzed cases of mVBI with low Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change in prefrontal cortex WM from rapid autopsies in a population-based cohort where VCID frequently occurs. Arteriolar vasodilator function was quantified by videomicroscopy. OPC maturation was quantified using lineage specific markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: ACh-mediated arteriolar dilation in mVBI was significantly reduced in WM penetrators relative to pial arterioles. Astrogliosis-defined WMI was positively associated with increased OPCs and was negatively associated with decreased mature oligodendrocytes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: Selectively impaired vasodilator function of WM penetrating arterioles in mVBI occurs in association with aberrant differentiation of OPCs in WMI, which supports that myelination disturbances in VCID are related to disrupted maturation of myelinating oligodendrocytes.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Pathological mechanisms underlying single large-scale mitochondrial DNA deletions</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25127</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective. Single, large-scale deletions in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are a common cause of mitochondrial disease. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the genetic defect and molecular phenotype to improve understanding of pathogenic mechanisms associated with single, large-scale mtDNA deletions in skeletal muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods. We investigated 23 muscle biopsies taken from adult patients (6 males/17 females with a mean age of 43y) with characterised single, large-scale mtDNA deletions. Mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency in skeletal muscle biopsies was quantified by immunoreactivity levels for complex I and complex IV proteins. Single muscle fibres with varying degrees of deficiency were selected from six patient biopsies for determination of mtDNA deletion level and copy number by quantitative qPCR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results. We have defined three ‘classes' of single, large-scale deletion with distinct patterns of mitochondrial deficiency, determined by the size and location of the deletion. Single fibre analyses showed that fibres with greater respiratory chain deficiency harboured higher levels of mtDNA deletion with an increase in total mtDNA copy number. For the first time, we have demonstrated that threshold levels for complex I and complex IV deficiency differ based on deletion class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation. Combining genetic and immunofluorescent assays, we conclude that thresholds for complex I and complex IV deficiency are modulated by the deletion of complex-specific protein-encoding genes. Furthermore, removal of mt-tRNA genes impacts specific complexes only at high deletion levels, when complex-specific protein-encoding genes remain. These novel findings provide valuable insight into the pathogenic mechanisms associated with these mutations. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Myeloid cell plasticity in the evolution of central nervous system autoimmunity</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25128</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: Myeloid cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells, are a prominent component of central nervous system (CNS) infiltrates during multiple sclerosis (MS) and the animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Although myeloid cells are generally thought to be pro-inflammatory, alternatively-polarized subsets can serve non-inflammatory and/or reparative functions. Here we investigate the heterogeneity and biological properties of myeloid cells during central nervous system autoimmunity. Methods: Myeloid cell phenotypes in chronic active MS lesions were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. In addition, immune cells were isolated from the CNS during exacerbations and remissions of EAE and characterized by flow cytometric, genetic and functional assays. Results: Myeloid cells expressing iNOS, indicative of a pro-inflammatory phenotype, were detected in the actively demyelinating rim of chronic active MS lesions, whereas macrophages expressing mannose receptor (CD206), a marker of alternatively-polarized human myeloid cells, were enriched in the quiescent lesion core. During EAE, CNS-infiltrating myeloid cells, as well as microglia, shifted from expression of pro- to non-inflammatory markers immediately prior to clinical remissions. Murine CNS myeloid cells expressing the alternative lineage marker arginase-1 (Arg1) were partially derived from iNOS&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; precursors and were deficient in activating encephalitogenic T cells compared with their Arg1&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; counterparts. Interpretation: These observations demonstrate the heterogeneity of CNS myeloid cells, their evolution during the course of autoimmune demyelinating disease, and their plasticity on the single cell level. Future therapeutic strategies for disease modification in individuals with MS may be focused on accelerating the transition of CNS myeloid cells from a pro- to a non-inflammatory phenotype.

	<content:encoded>Zunke et al. found that glycosphingolipids that accumulate in Gaucher disease cause a reversible structural change in Parkinson’s protein α-synuclein, promoting its aggregation and toxicity. In patient-derived midbrain dopamine neurons, glycosphingolipid reduction restored physiological α-synuclein conformers and diminished pathology.</content:encoded>

Blomeley et al. show that this pathway, via specific orexin excitation of dopamine D2 receptor–expressing neurons, can inhibit reward seeking and exploratory drive when danger is perceived.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/KP5WcQmudso&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30237-0?rss=yes</link>
	<content:encoded>Synaptic plasticity – the directed modulation of synaptic connections by specific activity histories or physiological signals – is believed to be a major mechanism for the modification of neuronal network function. This belief, however, has a ‘flip side’: the supposition that synapses do not change spontaneously in manners unrelated to such signals. Contrary to this supposition, recent studies reveal that synapses do change spontaneously, and to a fairly large extent. Here we review experimental results on spontaneous synaptic remodeling, its relative contributions to total synaptic remodeling, its statistical characteristics, and its physiological importance.</content:encoded>

A total of 41 different &lt;em&gt;SERAC1&lt;/em&gt; variants were identified, including 20 that have not been reported before. With the exception of 2 families with a milder phenotype, all affected individuals showed a strikingly homogeneous phenotype and time course. Severe, reversible neonatal liver dysfunction and hypoglycemia were seen in &amp;gt;40% of all cases. Starting at a median age of 6 months, muscular hypotonia (91%) was seen, followed by progressive spasticity (82%, median onset = 15 months) and dystonia (82%, 18 months). The majority of affected individuals never learned to walk (68%). Seventy-nine percent suffered hearing loss, 58% never learned to speak, and nearly all had significant intellectual disability (88%). Magnetic resonance imaging features were accordingly homogenous, with bilateral basal ganglia involvement (98%); the characteristic “putaminal eye” was seen in 53%. The urinary marker 3-methylglutaconic aciduria was present in virtually all patients (98%). Supportive treatment focused on spasticity and drooling, and was effective in the individuals treated; hearing aids or cochlear implants did not improve communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

A few large dendrites covered with spines are seen in the upper part of the field, due to leakage of virus to transfect some medium spiny neurons in the striatum as well.

	<content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25109-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We aimed to identify whether acute ischemic stroke patients with known complete reperfusion after thrombectomy had the same baseline computed tomography perfusion (CTP) ischemic core threshold to predict infarction as thrombolysis patients with complete reperfusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25109-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients who underwent thrombectomy were matched by age, clinical severity, occlusion location, and baseline perfusion lesion volume to patients who were treated with intravenous alteplase alone from the International Stroke Perfusion Imaging Registry. A pixel-based analysis of coregistered pretreatment CTP and 24-hour diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was then undertaken to define the optimum CTP thresholds for the ischemic core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25109-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were 132 eligible thrombectomy patients and 132 matched controls treated with alteplase alone. Baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (median, 15; interquartile range [IQR], 11–19), age (median, 65; IQR, 59–80), and time to intravenous treatment (median, 153 minutes; IQR, 82–315) were well matched (all &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;gt; 0.05). Despite similar baseline CTP ischemic core volumes using the previously validated measure (relative cerebral blood flow [rCBF], &amp;lt;30%), thrombectomy patients had a smaller median 24-hour infarct core of 17.3ml (IQR, 11.3–32.8) versus 24.3ml (IQR, 16.7–42.2; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.011) in alteplase-treated controls. As a result, the optimal threshold to define the ischemic core in thrombectomy patients was rCBF &amp;lt;20% (area under the curve [AUC], 0.89; 95% CI, 0.84, 0.94), whereas in alteplase controls the optimal ischemic core threshold remained rCBF &amp;lt;30% (AUC, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.77, 0.85).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Translational Control Mechanisms in Persistent Pain</title>
	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30233-3?rss=yes</link>
	<content:encoded>Persistent pain, which is poorly treated and estimated to afflict one third of the world’s population, is largely mediated by the sensitization of nociceptive neurons. This sensitization involves de novo gene expression to support biochemical and structural changes required to maintain amplified pain signaling that frequently persists even after injury to tissue resolves. While transcription-dependent changes in gene expression are important, recent work demonstrates that activity-dependent regulation of mRNA translation is key to controlling the cellular proteome and the development and maintenance of persistent pain.</content:encoded>
