	<title>eNeuro current issue: RGS14 Restricts Plasticity in Hippocampal CA2 by Limiting Postsynaptic Calcium Signaling</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/3/ENEURO.0353-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Pyramidal neurons in hippocampal area CA2 are distinct from neighboring CA1 in that they resist synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) at CA3 Schaffer collateral synapses. Regulator of G protein signaling 14 (RGS14) is a complex scaffolding protein enriched in CA2 dendritic spines that naturally blocks CA2 synaptic plasticity and hippocampus-dependent learning, but the cellular mechanisms by which RGS14 gates LTP are largely unexplored. A previous study has attributed the lack of plasticity to higher rates of calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) buffering and extrusion in CA2 spines. Additionally, a recent proteomics study revealed that RGS14 interacts with two key Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-activated proteins in CA2 neurons: calcium/calmodulin and CaMKII. Here, we investigated whether RGS14 regulates Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling in its host CA2 neurons. We found that the nascent LTP of CA2 synapses caused by genetic knockout (KO) of RGS14 in mice requires Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent postsynaptic signaling through NMDA receptors, CaMK, and PKA, revealing similar mechanisms to those in CA1. We report that RGS14 negatively regulates the long-term structural plasticity of dendritic spines of CA2 neurons. We further show that wild-type (WT) CA2 neurons display significantly attenuated spine Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients during structural plasticity induction compared with the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients from CA2 spines of RGS14 KO mice and CA1 controls. Finally, we demonstrate that acute overexpression of RGS14 is sufficient to block spine plasticity, and elevating extracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels restores plasticity to RGS14-expressing neurons. Together, these results demonstrate for the first time that RGS14 regulates plasticity in hippocampal area CA2 by restricting Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; elevations in CA2 spines and downstream signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Aging and an Immune Challenge Interact to Produce Prolonged, but Not Permanent, Reductions in Hippocampal L-LTP and mBDNF in a Rodent Model with Features of Delirium</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/3/ENEURO.0009-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Aging increases the risk of abrupt declines in cognitive function after an event that triggers immune system activation (e.g. surgery, infection, or injury). This phenomenon is poorly understood, but rodent models may provide clues. We have previously shown that aging (24-mo-old) F344xBN rats generally do not show significant physical or cognitive impairments. However, their brains mount an exaggerated inflammatory response to signals triggered by a peripheral immune challenge (an intraperitoneal injection of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; or laparotomy). Their hippocampal levels of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β are significantly elevated for at least 8 d, but generally less than 14 d, after infection or surgery. This IL-1β elevation is mirrored by prolonged deficits in a hippocampus-dependent long-term memory task. In contrast, young (3-mo-old) counterparts exhibit only transient elevations in IL-1β that drop to near baseline levels within 24 h. We previously demonstrated that theta burst–evoked late-phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP)—a BDNF-dependent form of synaptic plasticity—is impaired in hippocampal area CA1 of aged animals 4 d after infection. Also, levels of mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor (mBDNF)—the protein isoform required for stabilization of L-LTP—are reduced in hippocampal synaptoneurosomes of aged animals at the same time point. In this study, we investigated whether the deficits in L-LTP and mBDNF persist in parallel with the elevation in IL-1β and impairment in memory. This was the case, consistent with the idea that an exaggerated brain inflammatory response may compromise memory consolidation in part by altering availability of mBDNF to stabilize memory-related synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Neurodynamic Evidence Supports a Forced-Excursion Model of Decision-Making under Speed/Accuracy Instructions</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0159-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Evolutionary pressures suggest that choices should be optimised to maximise rewards, by appropriately trading speed for accuracy. This speed-accuracy tradeoff (SAT) is commonly explained by variation in just the baseline-to-boundary distance, i.e. excursion, of accumulation-to-bound models of perceptual decision making. However, neural evidence is not consistent with this explanation. A compelling account of speeded choice should explain both overt behaviour and the full range of associated brain signatures. Here, we reconcile seemingly contradictory behavioural and neural findings. In two variants of the same experiment, we triangulated upon the neural underpinnings of the SAT in the human brain using both EEG and TMS. We found that distinct neural signals, namely the ERP centroparietal positivity (CPP) and a smoothed motor-evoked potential (MEP) signal, which have both previously been shown to relate to decision-related accumulation, revealed qualitatively similar average neurodynamic profiles with only subtle differences between SAT conditions. These signals were then modelled from behaviour by either incorporating traditional boundary variation or utilising a forced excursion. These model variants are mathematically equivalent, in terms of their behavioural predictions, hence providing identical fits to correct and erroneous reaction time distributions. However, the forced-excursion version instantiates SAT via a more global change in parameters and implied neural activity, a process conceptually akin to, but mathematically distinct from, urgency. This variant better captured both ERP and MEP neural profiles, suggesting that the SAT may be implemented via neural gain modulation, and reconciling standard modelling approaches with human neural data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Successful organisms need to make the right choice fast. To make such decisions, we are regularly forced to trade speed for accuracy. This trade-off has been explained in behavioural models using a single free parameter reflecting response caution. However, neural evidence suggests that more widespread changes are associated with quick versus accurate decisions. Here, we suggest a model which reconciles these seemingly contradictory findings. This ‘forced-excursion’ model is mathematically equivalent to standard models of response caution but implies a global modulation in activity akin to a change in neural gain or urgency. Re-expressed in this way, the model is able to account for both behavioural and neural data from two separate neural recording techniques.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Ethanol Regulates Presynaptic Activity and Sedation through Presynaptic Unc13 Proteins in Drosophila</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0125-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Ethanol has robust effects on presynaptic activity in many neurons, however, it isn't yet clear how this drug acts within this compartment to change neural activity, nor the significance of this change on behavior and physiology &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. One possible presynaptic effector for ethanol is the Munc13-1 protein. Herein, we show that ethanol binding to the rat Munc13-1 C1 domain, at concentrations consistent with binge exposure, reduces diacylglycerol binding. The inhibition of diacylglycerol binding is predicted to reduce the activity of Munc13-1 and presynaptic release. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, we show that sedating concentrations of ethanol significantly reduce synaptic vesicle release in olfactory sensory neurons, while having no significant impact on membrane depolarization and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx into the presynaptic compartment. These data indicate that ethanol targets the active zone in reducing synaptic vesicle exocytosis. &lt;i&gt;Drosophila,&lt;/i&gt; haploinsufficent for the Munc13-1 ortholog &lt;i&gt;Dunc13&lt;/i&gt;, are more resistant to the effect of ethanol on presynaptic inhibition. Genetically reducing the activity of &lt;i&gt;Dunc13&lt;/i&gt; through mutation or expression of RNAi transgenes also leads to a significant resistance to the sedative effects of ethanol. The neuronal expression of &lt;i&gt;Munc13-1&lt;/i&gt; in heterozygotes for a &lt;i&gt;Dunc13&lt;/i&gt; loss-of-function mutation can largely rescue the ethanol sedation resistance phenotype, indicating a conservation of function between &lt;i&gt;Munc13-1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Dunc13&lt;/i&gt; in ethanol sedation. Hence, reducing &lt;i&gt;Dunc13&lt;/i&gt; activity leads to naïve physiological and behavioral resistance to sedating concentrations of ethanol. We propose that reducing &lt;i&gt;Dunc13&lt;/i&gt; activity, genetically or pharmacologically by ethanol binding to the C1 domain of Munc13-1/Dunc13, promotes a homeostatic response that leads to ethanol tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; At relatively low concentrations, ethanol inhibits the activity of many presynaptic termini (Liu and Hunt, 1999). Homeostatic changes in presynaptic activity are proposed to underlie the formation of functional tolerance (Koob and Bloom, 1988; Ghezzi and Atkinson, 2011). We do not currently know where ethanol binds to bring about changes in presynaptic activity and homeostasis. We now show that ethanol will bind to the C1 domain of the Munc13-1 protein at intoxicating concentrations and inhibit the binding of diacylglycerol. Reducing the activity of the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; Dunc13 ortholog leads to a homeostatic change that promotes behavioral and physiologic resistance to intoxicating levels of ethanol. Hence, Unc13 proteins are likely sites for ethanol’s action within the presynaptic compartment that bring about tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Cytoskeletal components, such as tubulins and actins, have the remarkable ability to organize themselves into filaments and networks to support specialized and compartmentalized functions. Alterations in cytoskeletal proteins have long been associated with a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders. This review focuses on recent findings, primarily from forward genetic screens in Caenorhabditis elegans that illustrate how different tubulin protein isotypes can play distinct roles in neuronal development and function. Additionally, we discuss studies revealing new regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, and highlight recent technological advances in in vivo imaging and functional dissection of the neuronal cytoskeleton. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

The entorhinal–hippocampal system is central to such representations, which are severely compromised in some neurological diseases. In spite of much progress, a comprehensive, integrated view of spatial, temporal and other aspects of episodic representation remains elusive. Here, we review recent data on the role of cell-type specific entorhinal inputs which excite deep and superficial CA1 pyramidal cells by direct and indirect pathways. We discuss how an entorhinal dialogue with deep-superficial CA1 cells can multiplex neuronal activity along theta phases and how their reactivation may be segregated during sharp-wave ripples. Thus, deep and superficial CA1 sublayers provide substrate for general hippocampal function. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;h3&quot;&gt;Graphical abstract&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; height=&quot;159&quot; src=&quot;http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438817302994-fx1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;301&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

However, recent studies have revealed that some non-primate animal species have higher levels of dexterity than previously supposed, and in higher primates, various indirect non-CM descending pathways have been shown to participate in the control of dexterous movements. More recently, the CM pathway was shown to exist in rodents during early development, suggesting that rodents and primates diverged in their reliance on the CM pathway at some point in evolution, thus challenging the traditional view of the sequential development of hand control from rodents to primates. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

How an animal efficiently switches between distinct behaviors is a fundamental question whose inquiry will provide insights into the mechanisms that are necessary for an organism's survival. Previous work aimed at identifying the neural systems responsible for defensive behaviors, such as freezing, has demonstrated critical interactions between the prefrontal cortex and amygdala. Indeed, this foundational research has provided an indispensable anatomical framework that investigators are now using to understand the physiological mechanisms of defined neural circuits within the prefrontal cortex that code for the rapid and flexible expression of defensive behaviors. Here we review recent findings demonstrating temporal and rate coding mechanisms of freezing behavior in the prefrontal cortex. We hypothesize that anatomical features, such as target structure and cortical layer, as well as the nature of the information to be coded, may be critical factors determining the coding scheme. Furthermore, detailed behavioral analyses may reveal subtypes of defensive behaviors that represent the principle factor governing coding selection. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Tau, while primarily localized in the axons of healthy neurons, accumulates in the soma and dendrites of neurons under pathogenic conditions. Tau is found in both presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments of neurons in Alzheimer's disease. New research supports that soluble forms of tau trigger pathophysiology in the brain by altering properties of synaptic and neuronal function at the early stages of disease progression, before neurons die. Here we review the current understanding of how tau-mediated synaptic and neuronal dysfunction contributes to cognitive decline. Delineating the mechanisms by which pathogenic tau alters synapses, dendrites and axons will help lay the foundation for new strategies that can restore neuronal function in tauopathy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

This locomotor network generates the rhythmic output, coordinate left/right alternation, and permit communication across segments. Through evolution, more complex movement patterns have emerged, made possible by sub-specialization of neural populations within the spinal cord. Walking tetrapods use a similar basic circuitry, but have added layers of complexity for the coordination of intralimbic flexor and extensor muscles as well as interlimbic coordination between the body halves and fore/hindlimbs. Although the basics of these circuits are known there is a gap in our knowledge regarding how different speeds and gaits are coordinated. Analysing subpopulations among described neuronal populations may bring insight into how changes in locomotor output are orchestrated by a hard-wired network. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Although clinically different, they share similar molecular features: the accumulation of one or two proteins in abnormal conformations inside or outside neurons. Enhancing protein quality control systems could be a useful strategy to neutralize the abnormal proteins causing neurodegenerative diseases. This review emphasizes the subcellular location of protein deposits in neurodegenerative diseases and the need to tailor strategies aimed at boosting protein quality control systems to the affected subcellular compartment. Inhibition of a protein phosphatase terminating the unfolded protein response will be discussed as a strategy to protect from diseases associated with misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Here, we review the recent increase in our understanding of how synapse type-specific molecules differentially regulate the development of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Moreover, several synapse subtype-specific molecules have been shown to control the targeting, formation or maturation of particular subtypes of excitatory synapses. Because inhibitory neurons are extremely diverse, a similar molecular diversity is likely to underlie the development of different inhibitory synapses making it a promising topic for future investigation in the field of the synapse development. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Throughout this progression, the differential expression of transcription factors has served as our road map for the eventual cell fate of nascent motor neurons. Recent findings from in vivo and in vitro models of motor neuron development have expanded our understanding of how transcription factors govern motor neuron identity and their individual regulatory mechanisms. With the advent of next generation sequencing approaches, researchers now have unprecedented access to the gene regulatory dynamics involved in motor neuron development and are uncovering new connections linking neurodevelopment and neurodegenerative disease. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Safe propagation of action potentials relies on specific ion channel expression at strategic points of the axon such as nodes of Ranvier or axonal branch points. However, while action potentials are generally considered as the quantum of neuronal information, their signaling is not entirely digital. In fact, both their shape and their conduction speed have been shown to be modulated by activity, leading to regulations of synaptic latency and synaptic strength. We report here newly identified mechanisms of (1) safe spike propagation along the axon, (2) compartmentalization of action potential shape in the axon, (3) analog modulation of spike-evoked synaptic transmission and (4) alteration in conduction time after persistent regulation of axon morphology in central neurons. We discuss the contribution of these regulations in information processing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Recent discoveries have revealed surprising and complex roles of the small area CA2 in hippocampal function. Lesion studies have revealed that this region is required for social memory formation. Area CA2 is targeted by extra-hippocampal paraventricular inputs that release vasopressin and can act to enhance social memory performance. In vivo recordings have revealed nonconventional activity by neurons in this region that act to both initiate hippocampal sharp-wave ripple events as well as encode spatial information during immobility. Silencing of CA2 pyramidal neurons has revealed that this area also acts to control hippocampal network excitability during encoding, and this balance of excitation and inhibition is disrupted in disease. This review summarizes recent findings and attempts to integrate these results into pre-existing models. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Autocrine signals have been discovered in many neuronal contexts, providing insights into their regulation and function. The growing realization of the importance of cell-autonomous signaling stems from advances in both conditional genetic approaches and in sophisticated analyses of growth factor dynamics, which combine to enable rigorous in vivo dissection of signaling pathways. Here we review recent studies defining autocrine roles for growth factors such as BDNF, and classical morphogens, including Wnts and BMPs, in regulating neuronal development and plasticity. Collectively, these studies highlight an intimate relationship between activity-dependent autocrine signaling and synaptic plasticity, and further suggest a common principle for coordinating paracrine and autocrine signaling in the nervous system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

When synaptic vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, these membranes and the attached proteins are endocytosed and either recycled or degraded. This turnover needs to be tightly regulated in a timely and spatially confined manner. Increasing evidence suggests that these mechanisms do not only serve for the removal of defective synaptic vesicles or structural proteins of the active zone but also contribute to pathways regulating synaptic strength. The corresponding presynaptic autophagy system thus appears also important for synaptic maintenance and plasticity. Exciting new studies provide evidence how the autophagy machinery recognizes and degrades synaptic components and lay the ground to understand how autophagy in the presynaptic compartment contributes to modulation and maintenance of synaptic function. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Here, classical and recent anatomical and physiological studies are reviewed to show that, in mammals, the striatum can detect discrete task-relevant sensory stimuli and continuously track somatosensory information associated with the generation of simple movements and more complex actions. Rather than contributing to the immediate selection of actions, the striatum may monitor the sensorimotor state of animals by integrating somatosensory information and motor-related signals on a moment-by-moment basis. Such function could be critical for the progressive acquisition or updating of adaptive actions and the emergence of an embodied sense of time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00128</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The study of brain networks, including derived from functional neuroimaging
data, attracts broad interest and represents a rapidly growing
interdisciplinary field. Comparing networks of healthy volunteers with those of
patients can potentially offer new, quantitative diagnostic methods, and a
framework for better understanding brain and mind disorders. We explore resting
state fMRI data through network measures, and demonstrate that not only is
there a distinctive network architecture in the healthy brain that is disrupted
in schizophrenia, but also that both networks respond to medication. We
construct networks representing 15 healthy individuals and 12 schizophrenia
patients (males and females), all of whom are administered three drug
treatments: (i) a placebo; and two antipsychotic medications (ii) aripiprazole
and; (iii) sulpiride. We first reproduce the established finding that brain
networks of schizophrenia patients exhibit increased efficiency and reduced
clustering compared to controls. Our data then reveals that the antipsychotic
medications mitigate this effect, shifting the metrics towards those observed
in healthy volunteers, with a marked difference in efficacy between the two
drugs. Additionally, we find that aripiprazole considerably alters the network
statistics of healthy controls. Using a test of cognitive ability, we establish
that aripiprazole also adversely affects their performance. This provides
evidence that changes to macroscopic brain network architecture result in
measurable behavioural differences. This is the first time different
medications have been assessed in this way. Our results lay the groundwork for
an objective methodology with which to calculate and compare the efficacy of
different treatments of mind and brain disorders.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: An Ideal Observer Model to Probe Human Visual Segmentation of Natural Images. (arXiv:1806.00111v1 [cs.CV])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00111</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Visual segmentation is a key perceptual function that partitions visual space
and allows for detection, recognition and discrimination of objects in complex
environments. The processes underlying human segmentation of natural images are
still poorly understood. Existing datasets rely on manual labeling that
conflate perceptual, motor, and cognitive factors. In part, this is because we
lack an ideal observer model of segmentation to guide constrained experiments.
On the other hand, despite recent progress in machine learning, modern
algorithms still fall short of human segmentation performance. Our goal here is
two-fold (i) propose a model to probe human visual segmentation mechanisms and
(ii) develop an efficient algorithm for image segmentation. To this aim, we
propose a novel probabilistic generative model of visual segmentation that for
the first time combines 1) knowledge about the sensitivity of neurons in the
visual cortex to statistical regularities in natural images; and 2)
non-parametric Bayesian priors over segmentation maps (ie partitions of the
visual space). We provide an algorithm for learning and inference, validate it
on synthetic data, and illustrate how the two components of our model improve
segmentation of natural images. We then show that the posterior distribution
over segmentations captures well the variability across human subjects,
indicating that our model provides a viable approach to probe human visual
segmentation.

has been associated with structural abnormalities in the architecture of
functional brain networks. Using various methods from network analysis, we
examine the effect of two classical therapeutic antipsychotics --- Aripiprazole
and Sulpiride --- on the structure of functional brain networks of healthy
controls and patients who have been diagnosed with schizophrenia. We compare
the community structures of functional brain networks of different individuals
using mesoscopic response functions, which measure how community structure
changes across different scales of a network. We are able to do a reasonably
good job of distinguishing patients from controls, and we are most successful
at this task on people who have been treated with Aripiprazole. We demonstrate
that this increased separation between patients and controls is related only to
a change in the control group, as the functional brain networks of the patient
group appear to be predominantly unaffected by this drug. This suggests that
Aripiprazole has a significant and measurable effect on community structure in
healthy individuals but not in individuals who are diagnosed with
schizophrenia. In contrast, we find for individuals are given the drug
Sulpiride that it is more difficult to separate the networks of patients from
those of controls. Overall, we observe differences in the effects of the drugs
(and a placebo) on community structure in patients and controls and also that
this effect differs across groups. We thereby demonstrate that different types
of antipsychotic drugs selectively affect mesoscale structures of brain
networks, providing support that mesoscale structures such as communities are
meaningful functional units in the brain.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A critical assessment of data quality and venous effects in ultra-high-resolution fMRI</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/337667v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Advances in hardware, pulse sequences, and reconstruction techniques have made it possible to perform functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at sub-millimeter resolution while maintaining high spatial coverage and acceptable signal-to-noise ratio. Here, we examine whether ultra-high-resolution fMRI can be exploited for routine use in neuroscience research. We conducted fMRI in human visual cortex during a simple event-related visual experiment (7T, gradient-echo EPI, 0.8-mm isotropic voxels, 2.2-s sampling rate, 84 slices), and developed analysis and visualization tools to assess the quality of the data. We make three main observations. First, we find that the acquired fMRI images, combined with appropriate surface-based processing, provide reliable and accurate measurements of fine-scale blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) activity patterns. Second, we show that the highly folded structure of cortex causes substantial biases on spatial resolution and data visualization. Third, we examine the well-recognized issue of venous contributions to fMRI signals. In a systematic assessment of large sections of cortex measured at a fine scale, we show that time-averaged T2*-weighted EPI intensity is a simple, robust marker of venous effects. These venous effects are unevenly distributed across cortex, are more pronounced in gyri and outer cortical depths, and are, to a certain degree, in consistent locations across subjects relative to cortical folding. Furthermore, we show that these venous effects are strongly correlated with BOLD responses evoked by the experiment. We conclude that ultra-high-resolution fMRI can provide robust information about fine-scale BOLD activity patterns, but special care must be exercised in visualizing and interpreting these patterns, especially with regards to the confounding influence of the brain's vasculature. To help translate these methodological findings to neuroscience research, we provide practical suggestions for both high-resolution and standard-resolution fMRI studies.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Combining Multi-Site/Multi-Study MRI Data: Linked-ICA Denoising for Removing Scanner and Site Variability from Multimodal MRI Data</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/337576v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Large multi-site studies that pool magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data across research sites or studies, or that utilize shared data from imaging repositories, present exceptional opportunities to advance neuroscience and enhance reproducibility of neuroimaging research. However, both scanner and site variability are confounds that hinder pooling data collected across different sites or across different operating systems on the same scanner, even when all acquisition protocols are harmonized. These confounds degrade statistical analyses and can lead to spurious findings. Unfortunately, methods to address this problem are scant. In this study, we propose a novel denoising approach for multi-site multimodal MRI data that implements a data-driven linked independent component analysis (LICA) to efficiently identify scanner/site-related effects for removal. Removing these effects results in denoised data that can then be combined across sites/studies to improve modality-specific statistical processing. We use data from six different studies collected on the same scanner across major hardware (gradient and head coil) and software upgrades to demonstrate our LICA-based denoising approach. The proposed method is superior compared to the existing methods we tested and has great potential for large-scale multi-site studies to produce combined data free from study/site confounds.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Chronic intermittent ethanol exposure selectively increases synaptic excitability in the ventral domain of the rat hippocampus</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/337097v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Many studies have implicated hippocampal dysregulation in the pathophysiology of alcohol use disorder (AUD). However, over the past twenty years, a growing body of evidence has revealed distinct functional roles of the dorsal (dHC) and ventral (vHC) hippocampal subregions, with the dHC being primarily involved in spatial learning and memory and the vHC regulating anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors. Notably, to our knowledge, no rodent studies have examined the effects of chronic ethanol exposure on synaptic transmission along the dorsal/ventral axis. To that end, we examined the effects of the chronic intermittent ethanol vapor exposure (CIE) model of AUD on dHC and vHC synaptic excitability. Adult male Long-Evans rats were exposed to CIE or air for 10 days (12 hrs/day; targeting blood ethanol levels of 175-225 mg%) and recordings were made 24 hours into withdrawal. As expected, this protocol increased anxiety-like behaviors on the elevated plus-maze. Extracellular recordings revealed marked CIE-associated increases in synaptic excitation in the CA1 region that were exclusively restricted to the ventral domain of the hippocampus. Western blot analysis of synaptoneurosomal fractions revealed that the expression of two proteins that regulate synaptic strength, GluA2 and SK2, was dysregulated in the vHC, but not the dHC, following CIE. Together, these findings suggest that the ventral CA1 region may be particularly sensitive to the maladaptive effects of chronic ethanol exposure and provide new insight into some of the neural substrates that may contribute to the negative affective state that develops during withdrawal.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Smaller Hippocampal CA-1 Subfield Volume in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/337030v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Smaller hippocampal volume in patients with PTSD represents the most consistently reported structural alteration in the brain. Subfields of the hippocampus play distinct roles in encoding and processing of memories, which are disrupted in PTSD. We examined PTSD-associated alterations in 12 hippocampal subfields in relation to global hippocampal shape, and clinical features. Methods: Case-control cross-sectional study of US military veterans (n=282) from the Iraq and Afghanistan era were grouped into PTSD (n=142) and trauma-exposed controls (n=140). Participants underwent clinical evaluation for PTSD and associated clinical parameters followed by MRI at 3-Tesla. Segmentation with FreeSurfer v6.0 produced hippocampal subfield volumes for the left and right CA1, CA3, CA4, DG, fimbria, fissure, hippocampus-amygdala transition area, molecular layer, parasubiculum, presubiculum, subiculum, and tail, as well as hippocampal meshes. Covariates included age, gender, trauma exposure, alcohol use, depressive symptoms, antidepressant medication use, total hippocampal volume, and MRI scanner model. Results: Significantly lower subfield volumes were associated with PTSD in left CA1 (p=.01; d=.21; uncorrected), CA3 (p=.04; d=.08; uncorrected), and right CA3 (p=.02; d=.07; uncorrected) only if ipsilateral whole hippocampal volume was included as a covariate. A trend level association of L-CA1 with PTSD [F4, 221=3.32, p = 0.07] is present and the other subfield findings are non-significant if ipsilateral whole hippocampal volume is not included as a covariate. PTSD associated differences in global hippocampal shape were non-significant. Conclusions: The present finding of smaller hippocampal CA1 in PTSD is consistent with model systems in rodents that exhibit increased anxiety-like behavior from repeated exposure to acute stress. Behavioral correlations with hippocampal subfield volume differences in PTSD will elucidate their relevance to PTSD, particularly behaviors of associative fear learning, extinction training, and formation of false memories.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/337014v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting motor control. Dysfunction of motor cortices has been suggested to contribute to the motor symptoms of PD. However, little is known on the link between cortical dopaminergic loss, abnormalities in neural activity and motor deficits. We address this issue by focusing on the anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) of mice performing a cued-licking task. We first demonstrate licking deficits and concurrent alterations of spiking activity in ALM of hemi-parkinsonian mice. Hemi-parkinsonian mice displayed delayed licking initiation, shorter duration of licking bouts, and lateral deviation of tongue protrusions. In addition, we observed a reduction in cue responsive neurons and altered preparatory activity. Acute and local blockade of D1 receptors in ALM recapitulated some of the behavioral and neural deficits observed in hemi-parkinsonian mice. Our data show a direct relationship between cortical D1 receptor modulation, cue-evoked and preparatory activity in ALM, and licking initiation.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Stimulus-driven brain rhythms within the alpha band: The attentional-modulation conundrum</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/336941v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Two largely independent research lines use rhythmic sensory stimulation to study visual processing. Despite the use of strikingly similar experimental paradigms, they differ crucially in their notion of the stimulus-driven periodic brain responses: One regards them mostly as synchronised (entrained) intrinsic brain rhythms; the other assumes they are predominantly evoked responses (classically termed steady-state responses, or SSRs) that add to the ongoing brain activity. This conceptual difference can produce contradictory predictions about, and interpretations of, experimental outcomes. The effect of spatial attention on brain rhythms in the alpha-band (8 - 13 Hz) constitutes one such instance: alpha-range SSRs have typically been found to increase in power when participants focus their spatial attention on laterally presented stimuli, in line with a gain control of the visual evoked response. In nearly identical experiments, retinotopic decreases in entrained alpha-band power have been reported, in line with the inhibitory function of intrinsic alpha. Here, we demonstrate that this apparent discrepancy results from a small but far-reaching difference in data analysis. By re-analysing EEG data recorded during bilateral rhythmic visual stimulation, we show that averaging across trials before versus after computing power spectra results in the typical patterns reported by SSR and entrainment studies, respectively, therefore reconciling the seemingly contradictory findings. The opposite sign of attention effects suggests that two separate neural processes might be at play simultaneously.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/336859v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>How are the myriad stimuli arriving at our senses transformed into conscious thought? To address this question, in a series of studies, we asked whether a common mechanism underlies loss of information processing in unconscious states across different conditions, which could shed light on the brain mechanisms of conscious cognition. With a novel approach, we brought together for the first time, data from the same paradigm-a highly engaging auditory-only narrative-in three independent domains: anesthesia-induced unconsciousness, unconsciousness after brain injury, and individual differences in intellectual abilities during conscious cognition. During external stimulation in the unconscious state, the functional differentiation between the auditory and fronto-parietal systems decreased significantly relatively to the conscious state. Conversely, we found that stronger functional differentiation between these systems in response to external stimulation predicted higher intellectual abilities during conscious cognition, in particular higher verbal acuity scores in independent cognitive testing battery. These convergent findings suggest that the responsivity of sensory and higher-order brain systems to external stimulation, especially through the diversification of their functional responses is an essential feature of conscious cognition and verbal intelligence.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/336800v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Automatic emotion regulation (AER) has received increasing attention. However, the effortless hypothesis of AER has yet to be directly tested and the neural mechanisms supporting AER remain unclear. Here, we addressed these two issues, by simultaneous recording behavioral assessments and functional MRI (fMRI) signals when thirty-one participants were required to watch neutral and disgust pictures in three experimental conditions: Watching, Goal Intention (GI) and Reappraisal by Implementation Intention (RII). RII decreased negative feelings and bilateral amygdala activity without engendering cognitive efforts, evidenced by the reduced self-reported efforts and less prefrontal engagement during RII compared to Watching and GI. These regulation effects should not be explained by emotional habituation, as further experiment did not show significant emotional habituation for the repetition of the same stimuli. Moreover, RII and GI produced similar functional connectivity (FC) of vACC (ventral anterior cingulate cortex) to left insula and right precuneus, corresponding to the common goal pursuit component of both strategies. Furthermore, RII relative to GI exhibited weaker FC in distributed brain networks subserving effortful control (e.g. inferior-superior parietal lobe FC), memory retrieval (e.g. inferior-middle temporal lobes and lingual-putamen FCs), aversive anticipation and emotion-related motor planning (e.g. putamen-operculum and vACC-supramarginal gyrus FCs). These findings suggest that RII downregulates disgust effortlessly, most likely mediated by the reduced online mobilization of neural systems subserving emotion-related coping.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/336735v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug in the world, and its usage is increasing with its widespread legalization. Use of the drug by mothers during lactation may transfer active cannabinoids to the developing offspring, altering postnatal neurodevelopment during this critical period. During early life, GABA undergoes a functional switch from an excitatory to an inhibitory neurotransmitter due to reciprocal changes in expression of the K+/Cl- co-transporters KCC2 and NKCC1. Here, we characterize the functional GABA switch in the prefrontal cortex of both male and female rats. We show that treating rat dams with {Delta}-THC or a synthetic cannabinoid during early lactation (PND01-10) retards KCC2 expression and delays the GABA switch in pups of both sexes via a CB1R-dependent mechanism. Our results indicate that the developmental trajectory of GABA in PFC neurons is significantly altered by perinatal exposure to cannabinoids through lactation during the early perinatal period.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/336479v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The brain builds up expectations to future events based on the patterns of past events. This function has been studied extensively in the auditory and visual domains using various oddball paradigms, but only little exploration of this phenomenon has been done in the somatosensory domain. In this study, we explore how expectations of somatosensory stimulations are established and expressed in neural activity as measured with magnetoencephalography. Using tactile stimulations to the index finger, we compared conditions with actual stimulation to conditions with omitted stimulations, both of which were either expected or unexpected. Our results show that when a stimulation is expected but omitted, a time-locked response occurs ~135 ms subsequent to the expected stimulation. This somatosensory response to &quot;nothing&quot; was source localized to the secondary somatosensory cortex and to the insula. This provides novel evidence of the capability of the brain of millisecond time-keeping of somatosensory patterns across intervals of 3000 ms. Our results also show that when stimuli are repeated and expectations are established, there is associated activity in the theta and beta bands. These theta and beta band expressions of expectation were localized to the primary somatosensory area, inferior parietal cortex and cerebellum. Furthermore, there was gamma band activity in the right insula for the first stimulation after an omission, which indicates the detection of a new stimulation event after an expected pattern has been broken. Finally, our results show that cerebellum play a crucial role in predicting upcoming stimulation and in predicting when stimulation may begin again.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/335489v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The ability to adapt while exploring the world is critical for survival, yet how it comes about is unclear. Here we show that a whisker protraction reflex can be elicited following rostro-caudal pad stimulation, and that short-term kinematics of this reflex are enhanced when coherent complex spike activity of cerebellar Purkinje cells occurs in crus 1. Instead, the long-term kinematics can be adapted by tetanic stimulation and this adaptation is largely controlled by changes in the simple spike activity of Purkinje cells in crus 2. Increases in whisker protraction correlate with preceding increases in simple spikes in trial-by-trial variation analysis, and both behavioral and spike adaptation are absent in independent mouse models in which postsynaptic long-term potentiation of Purkinje cells is blocked. These differentially distributed short-term and long-term cerebellum-dependent modulations of whisker movements may come into play during coordination and adaptation of natural behaviors like gap crossing and prey capture.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/272963v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Reward-paired cues acquire powerful incentive motivational properties that allow them to elicit reward-seeking behavior. This motivational influence is adaptive under normal conditions but can lead to compulsive behavior in addiction and related disorders. Here, we used pathway-specific chemogenetic inhibition of dopamine neurons to determine their role in mediating cue-triggered reward seeking vs. reward taking, which were parsed using a novel analytic approach based on microstructural analysis of the individual behaviors required for earning (lever pressing) and collecting rewards (food-cup approach), respectively. We found that inhibiting ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons effectively abolished cue-motivated reward seeking, without impacting that cue's ability to increase reward-taking behavior, suggesting that this pathway supports the response-invigorating effects of reward-paired cues, but not their ability to signal reward availability. Inhibiting these dopamine neurons also spared rat's ability to select actions based on reward value, further defining the scope of this system's involvement in the regulation of reward-seeking behavior. We also found that locally inhibiting dopamine projections to nucleus accumbens (NAc), but not to medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), disrupted cue-triggered reward seeking. Interestingly, response suppression induced by inhibiting NAc dopamine inputs was more marked in rats that tended to respond to reward-paired cues by engaging in exploratory reward seeking, without trying to collect reward, than in rats that engaged in complete bouts of seeking and taking, suggesting such responses vary in their dependence on mesolimbic dopamine. These findings provide important new insights into the behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying adaptive and compulsive forms of cue-motivated behavior.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/337451v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>CMT is the most common hereditary neuromuscular disorder of the peripheral nervous system with a prevalence of 1/2500 individuals and it is caused by mutations in more than 80 genes. LRSAM1, a RING finger ubiquitin ligase also known as TSG101-associated ligase (TAL), has been associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2P (CMT2P) and to date eight causative mutations have been identified. Little is currently known on the pathogenetic mechanisms that lead to the disease. We investigated the effect of LRSAM1 deregulation on possible LRSAM1 interacting molecules in cell based models. Possible LRSAM1 interacting molecules were identified using protein-protein interaction databases and literature data. Expression analysis of these molecules was performed in both CMT2P patient and control lymphoblastoid cell lines as well as in LRSAM1 and TSG101 downregulated SH-SY5Y cells.TSG101, UBE2N, VPS28, EGFR and MDM2 levels were significantly decreased in the CMT2P patient lymphoblastoid cell line as well as in LRSAM1 downregulated cells. TSG101 downregulation had a significant effect only on the expression of VPS28 and MDM2 and it did not affect the levels of LRSAM1. This study confirms that LRSAM1 is a regulator of TSG101 expression. Furthermore, deregulation of LRSAM1 significantly affects the levels of UBE2N, VPS28, EGFR and MDM2.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/336974v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Electrically non-excitable astroglia take up neurotransmitters, buffer extracellular K+ and generate Ca2+ signals that release molecular regulators of neural circuitry. The underlying machinery remains enigmatic, mainly because the nanoscopic, sponge-like astrocyte morphology has been difficult to access experimentally or explore theoretically. Here, we have systematically evaluated the multi-scale morphology of protoplasmic astroglia to construct a realistic multi-compartmental cell model that can be biophysically interrogated in NEURON computational environment. This approach has been implemented as an astrocyte-model builder ASTRO. As a proof of concept, we explored a hippocampal astrocyte reconstructed in silico against a battery of physiological and imaging experiments. This exploration has unveiled some basic features of astroglial physiology inaccessible empirically, such as the characteristic length of membrane voltage propagation, membrane effects of local glutamate transport, spatiotemporal dynamics of intracellular K+ redistribution, key Ca2+ buffering properties, and some basic relationships between free Ca2+ dynamics and experimental readout of fluorescent Ca2+ indicators.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/336891v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Information processing by brain circuits depends on Ca2+-dependent, stochastic release of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. Recently developed optical sensors have enabled detection of evoked and spontaneous release at common glutamatergic synapses. However, monitoring synaptic release probability, its use-dependent changes, and its underpinning presynaptic machinery in situ requires concurrent, intensity-independent readout of presynaptic Ca2+ and glutamate release. Here, we find that the red-shifted Ca2+ indicator Cal-590 shows Ca2+-sensitive fluorescence lifetime, and employ it in combination with the novel green glutamate sensor SF-iGluSnFR variant to document quantal release of glutamate together with presynaptic Ca2+ concentration, in multiple synapses in an identified neural circuit. At the level of individual presynaptic boutons, we use multi-exposure and stochastic reconstruction procedures to reveal nanoscopic co-localisation of presynaptic Ca2+ entry and glutamate release, a fundamental unknown in modern neurobiology. This approach opens a new horizon in the quest to understand release machinery of central synapses.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Ataxia Telangiectasia triggers deficits in Reelin pathway</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/336842v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Autosomal recessive Ataxia Telangiectasia (A-T) is characterized by radiosensitivity, immunodeficiency and cerebellar neurodegeneration. A-T is caused by inactivating mutations in the Ataxia-Telangiectasia-Mutated (ATM) gene, a serine-threonine protein kinase involved in DNA-damage response and excitatory neurotransmission. The selective vulnerability of cerebellar Purkinje neurons (PN) to A-T is not well understood. Employing global proteomic profiling of cerebrospinal fluid from patients at ages around 15 years we detected reduced Calbindin, Reelin, Cerebellin-1, Cerebellin-3, Protocadherin Fat 2, Sempahorin 7A and increased Apolipoprotein B, H, J peptides. Bioinformatic enrichment was observed for pathways of chemical response, locomotion, calcium binding and complement immunity. This seemed important, since secretion of Reelin from glutamatergic afferent axons is crucial for PN radial migration and spine homeostasis. Reelin expression is downregulated by irradiation and its deficiency is a known cause of ataxia. Validation efforts in 2-month-old Atm-/- mice before onset of motor deficits confirmed transcript reductions for Reelin receptors Apoer2/Vldlr with increases for their ligands Apoe/Apoh and cholesterol 24-hydroxylase Cyp46a1. Concomitant dysregulations were found for Vglut2/Sema7a as climbing fiber markers, glutamate receptors like Grin2b and calcium homeostasis factors (Atp2b2, Calb1, Itpr1), while factors involved in DNA damage, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and cell adhesion were normal at this stage. These findings show that deficient levels of Reelin signaling factors reflect the neurodegeneration in A-T in a sensitive and specific way. As an extracellular factor, Reelin may be accessible for neuroprotective interventions.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/336784v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Pain sensing neurons, nociceptors, are key drivers of neuropathic pain. We used translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) to comprehensively characterize up- and down-regulated mRNA translation in Scn10a-positive nociceptors in chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain. We provide evidence that an underlying mechanism driving these changes in gene expression is a sustained mTORC1 activation driven by MNK1-eIF4E signaling. RagA, a GTPase controlling mTORC1 activity, is identified as a novel target of MNK1-eIF4E signaling, demonstrating a new link between these distinct signaling pathways. Neuropathic pain and RagA translation are strongly attenuated by genetic ablation of eIF4E phosphorylation, MNK1 elimination or treatment with the MNK inhibitor eFT508. We reveal a novel translational circuit for the genesis of neuropathic pain with important implications for next generation neuropathic pain therapeutics.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Discriminating similar memories and events depends on the dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus. This region is also distinctive because neurogenesis continues in adulthood. Whether both mature and immature granule cells play a role in memory discrimination, and whether the roles are distinct is actively investigated. Here we demonstrate that manipulating either mature or immature granule cells can impair discrimination of similar active place avoidance memories, but the manipulations have different effects. We also observe that prior experience modulates which memories are compromised by inactivation of immature neurons. These data demonstrate the importance of the dentate gyrus network of cells for memory discrimination.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/335828v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The cortical networks that underlie behavior exhibit an orderly functional organization at local and global scales, which is readily evident in the visual cortex of carnivores and primates. Here, neighboring columns of neurons represent the full range of stimulus orientations and contribute to distributed networks spanning several millimeters. However, the principles governing functional interactions that bridge this fine-scale functional architecture and distant network elements are unclear, and the emergence of these network interactions during development remains unexplored. Here, by using in vivo wide-field and 2-photon calcium imaging of spontaneous activity patterns in mature ferret visual cortex, we find widespread and specific modular correlation patterns that accurately predict the local structure of visually-evoked orientation columns from the spontaneous activity of neurons that lie several millimeters away. The large-scale networks revealed by correlated spontaneous activity show abrupt 'fractures' in continuity that are in tight register with evoked orientation pinwheels. Chronic in vivo imaging demonstrates that these large-scale modular correlation patterns and fractures are already present at early stages of cortical development and predictive of the mature network structure. Silencing feed-forward drive through either retinal or thalamic blockade does not affect network structure suggesting a cortical origin for this large-scale correlated activity, despite the immaturity of long-range horizontal network connections in the early cortex. Using a circuit model containing only local connections, we demonstrate that such a circuit is sufficient to generate large-scale correlated activity, while also producing correlated networks showing strong fractures, a reduced dimensionality, and an elongated local correlation structure, all in close agreement with our empirical data. These results demonstrate the precise local and global organization of cortical networks revealed through correlated spontaneous activity and suggest that local connections in early cortical circuits may generate structured long-range network correlations that underlie the subsequent formation of visually-evoked distributed functional networks.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12491</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Humans are adept at uncovering complex associations in the world around them,
yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Intuitively, learning
the higher-order structure of statistical relationships should involve
sophisticated mental processes, expending valuable computational resources.
Here we propose a competing perspective: that higher-order associations
actually arise from natural errors in learning. Combining ideas from
information theory and reinforcement learning, we derive a novel maximum
entropy model of people's internal expectations about the transition structures
underlying sequences of ordered events. Importantly, our model analytically
accounts for previously unexplained network effects on human expectations and
quantitatively describes human reaction times in probabilistic sequential motor
tasks. Additionally, our model asserts that human expectations should depend
critically on the different topological scales in a transition network, a
prediction that we subsequently test and validate in a novel experiment.
Generally, our results highlight the important role of mental errors in shaping
abstract representations, and directly inspire new physically-motivated models
of human behavior.

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/337246v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Recent interest in reversal of the hypnotic effects of anesthesia has mainly focused on overcoming a surge in GABA-mediated inhibitory signaling through activation of subcortical arousal circuits or antagonizing GABA receptors. Here we examine the reversal of anesthesia produced from non-GABA agents ketamine/xylazine and the effects of antagonists of adrenoreceptors. These antagonists vary in selectivity and produce temporally unique waking behavior post-anesthesia. We compared two antagonists with differential selectivity for 1- vs. 2-receptors, yohimbine (YOH, 1:40 selectivity) and atipamezole (ATI, 1:8500). Adult mice received intraperitoneal injections of either YOH (4.3 mg/kg), ATI (0.4 mg/kg), or saline after achieving sustained loss of righting following injection of ketamine/xylazine (ketamine: 65.0 mg/kg; xylazine: 9.9 mg/kg). Behaviors indicative of the post-anesthesia, re-animation sequence were carefully monitored and the timing of each behavior relative to anesthesia induction was compared. Both YOH and ATI hastened behaviors indicative of emergence, but ATI was faster than YOH to produce certain behaviors, including whisker movement (YOH: 21.9{+/-}1.5 min, ATI: 17.5{+/-}0.5 min, p=0.004) and return of righting reflex (RORR) (YOH: 40.6{+/-}8.8 min, ATI: 26.0{+/-}1.2 min, p&amp;lt;0.001). Interestingly, although YOH administration hastened early behavioral markers of emergence relative to saline (whisking), the completion of the emergence sequence (time from first marker to appearance of RORR) was delayed with YOH. We attribute this effect to antagonism of 1 receptors by yohimbine. Also notable was the failure of either antagonist to hasten the re-establishment of coordinated motor behavior (e.g., attempts to remove adhesive tape on the forepaw placed during anesthesia) relative to the end of emergence (RORR). In total, our work suggests that in addition to pharmacokinetic effects, re-establishment of normal waking behaviors after anesthesia involves neuronal circuits dependent on time and/or activity.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Minimal model of interictal and ictal discharges “Epileptor-2”</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/XazCEKR1hck/article</link>

Seizures occur in a recurrent manner with intermittent states of interictal and ictal discharges (IIDs and IDs). The transitions to and from IDs are determined by a set of processes, including synaptic interaction and ionic dynamics. Although mathematical models of separate types of epileptic discharges have been developed, modeling the transitions between states remains a challenge. A simple generic mathematical model of seizure dynamics (Epileptor) has recently been proposed by Jirsa et al. (2014); however, it is formulated in terms of abstract variables. In this paper, a minimal population-type model of IIDs and IDs is proposed that is as simple to use as the Epileptor, but the suggested model attributes physical meaning to the variables. The model is expressed in ordinary differential equations for extracellular potassium and intracellular sodium concentrations, membrane potential, and short-term synaptic depression variables. A quadratic integrate-and-fire model driven by the population input current is used to reproduce spike trains in a representative neuron. In simulations, potassium accumulation governs the transition from the silent state to the state of an ID. Each ID is composed of clustered IID-like events. The sodium accumulates during discharge and activates the sodium-potassium pump, which terminates the ID by restoring the potassium gradient and thus polarizing the neuronal membranes. The whole-cell and cell-attached recordings of a 4-AP-based in vitro model of epilepsy confirmed the primary model assumptions and predictions. The mathematical analysis revealed that the IID-like events are large-amplitude stochastic oscillations, which in the case of ID generation are controlled by slow oscillations of ionic concentrations. The IDs originate in the conditions of elevated potassium concentrations in a bath solution via a saddle-node-on-invariant-circle-like bifurcation for a non-smooth dynamical system. By providing a minimal biophysical description of ionic dynamics and network interactions, the model may serve as a hierarchical base from a simple to more complex modeling of seizures.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XazCEKR1hck&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Locomotor- and Reward-Enhancing Effects of Cocaine Are Differentially Regulated by Chemogenetic Stimulation of Gi-Signaling in Dopaminergic Neurons</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0345-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Dopamine plays a key role in the cellular and behavioral responses to drugs of abuse, but the implication of metabotropic regulatory input to dopaminergic neurons on acute drug effects and subsequent drug-related behavior remains unclear. Here, we used chemogenetics (DREADD; Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs) to modulate dopamine signaling and activity prior to cocaine administration in mice. We show that chemogenetic inhibition of dopaminergic ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons differentially affects locomotor and reward-related behavioral responses to cocaine. Stimulation of Gi-coupled DREADD (hM4Di) expressed in dopaminergic VTA neurons persistently reduced the locomotor response to repeated cocaine injections. An attenuated locomotor response was even seen when a dual-viral vector approach was used to restrict hM4Di-expression to dopaminergic VTA neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens. Surprisingly, despite the attenuated locomotor response, hM4Di-mediated inhibition of dopaminergic VTA neurons did not prevent cocaine sensitization, and the inhibitory effect of hM4Di-mediated inhibition was eliminated after withdrawal. In the conditioned place preference paradigm, hM4Di-mediated inhibition did not affect cocaine-induced place preference; however, the extinction period was extended. Also, hM4Di-mediated inhibition had no effect on preference for a sugar-based reward over water but impaired motivation to work for the same reward in a touchscreen-based motivational assay. In addition to support that VTA dopaminergic neurons operate as regulators of reward motivation towards both sugar and cocaine, our data suggest that repeated cocaine exposure leads to adaptations in the VTA that surmount the ability of Gi-signaling to suppress and regulate VTA dopaminergic neuronal activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The addictive properties of cocaine and other drugs of abuse are tightly coupled to altered dopamine (DA) neurotransmission mediated by dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Here, we used DREADD (Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs) to investigate how modulation of these neurons via G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) affects the behavioral effects of cocaine. The data substantiate dopaminergic VTA neurons as a prime regulator of explorative locomotion and reward motivation as well as they reveal a delicate role of metabotropic Gi-coupled input with differential effects during acute, repeated and sensitized responses to cocaine. The results may provide an important framework for exploring new principles for addiction treatment via modulation of GPCR signaling within the dopaminergic system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Combined MEG and fMRI Exponential Random Graph Modeling for inferring functional Brain Connectivity. (arXiv:1805.12005v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12005</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Estimated connectomes by the means of neuroimaging techniques have enriched
our knowledge of the organizational properties of the brain leading to the
development of network-based clinical diagnostics. Unfortunately, to date, many
of those network-based clinical diagnostics tools, based on the mere
description of isolated instances of observed connectomes are noisy estimates
of the true connectivity network. Modeling brain connectivity networks is
therefore important to better explain the functional organization of the brain
and allow inference of specific brain properties. In this report, we present
pilot results on the modeling of combined MEG and fMRI neuroimaging data
acquired during an n-back memory task experiment. We adopted a pooled
Exponential Random Graph Model (ERGM) as a network statistical model to capture
the underlying process in functional brain networks of 9 subjects MEG and fMRI
data out of 32 during a 0-back vs 2-back memory task experiment. Our results
suggested strong evidence that all the functional connectomes of the 9 subjects
have small world properties. A group level comparison using comparing the
conditions pairwise showed no significant difference in the functional
connectomes across the subjects. Our pooled ERGMs successfully reproduced
important brain properties such as functional segregation and functional
integration. However, the ERGMs reproducing the functional segregation of the
brain networks discriminated between the 0-back and 2-back conditions while the
models reproducing both properties failed to successfully discriminate between
both conditions. Our results are promising and would improve in robustness with
a larger sample size. Nevertheless, our pilot results tend to support previous
findings that functional segregation and integration are sufficient to
statistically reproduce the main properties of brain network.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11851</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The idea that the brain functions in a way that minimizes certain costs
pervades theoretical neuro- science. Since a cost function by itself does not
predict how the brain finds its minima, additional assumptions about the
optimization method are usually made in order to obtain predictions about
physiological quantities. In this context, steepest ascent or descent is often
suggested as a biolog- ically implemented optimization algorithm. However, the
notion of a steepest direction depends on the choice of a Riemannian metric.
Since this choice involves infinite degrees of freedom, the predictive power of
models that are based on this principle can be called into question. Despite
its great success in machine learning, especially in training deep neural
networks, arguments about brain function that rely on gradient-based
optimization have to be closely examined.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cerebral autoregulation refers to the brain's ability to maintain cerebral
blood flow at an approximately constant level, despite changes in arterial

ten-scale index called the ARI (autoregulation index). Here, $0$ denotes the
absence of, while $9$ denotes the strongest, autoregulation. Current methods to
calculate the ARI do not typically provide error estimates. Here, we show how
this can be done using a bayesian approach. We use Markov-chain Monte Carlo
methods to produce a probability distribution for the ARI, which gives a
natural way to estimate error.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Deep Semantic Architecture with discriminative feature visualization for neuroimage analysis. (arXiv:1805.11704v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11704</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuroimaging data analysis often involves \emph{a-priori} selection of data
features to study the underlying neural activity. Since this could lead to
sub-optimal feature selection and thereby prevent the detection of subtle
patterns in neural activity, data-driven methods have recently gained
popularity for optimizing neuroimaging data analysis pipelines and thereby,
improving our understanding of neural mechanisms. In this context, we developed
a deep convolutional architecture that can identify discriminating patterns in
neuroimaging data and applied it to electroencephalography (EEG) recordings
collected from 25 subjects performing a hand motor task before and after a rest
period or a bout of exercise. The deep network was trained to classify subjects
into exercise and control groups based on differences in their EEG signals.
Subsequently, we developed a novel method termed the cue-combination for Class
Activation Map (ccCAM), which enabled us to identify discriminating
spatio-temporal features within definite frequency bands (23--33 Hz) and assess
the effects of exercise on the brain. Additionally, the proposed architecture
allowed the visualization of the differences in the propagation of underlying
neural activity across the cortex between the two groups, for the first time in
our knowledge. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using deep network
architectures for neuroimaging analysis in different contexts such as, for the
identification of robust brain biomarkers to better characterize and
potentially treat neurological disorders.

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein-aa Regulates Photoreceptor Synaptic Development to Mediate Visually Guided Behavior</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/22/5220?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;To guide behavior, sensory systems detect the onset and offset of stimuli and process these distinct inputs via parallel pathways. In the retina, this strategy is implemented by splitting neural signals for light onset and offset via synapses connecting photoreceptors to ON and OFF bipolar cells, respectively. It remains poorly understood which molecular cues establish the architecture of this synaptic configuration to split light-onset and light-offset signals. A mutant with reduced synapses between photoreceptors and one bipolar cell type, but not the other, could reveal a critical cue. From this approach, we report a novel synaptic role for &lt;i&gt;pregnancy-associated plasma protein aa&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;pappaa&lt;/i&gt;) in promoting the structure and function of cone synapses that transmit light-offset information. Electrophysiological and behavioral analyses indicated &lt;i&gt;pappaa&lt;/i&gt; mutant zebrafish have dysfunctional cone-to-OFF bipolar cell synapses and impaired responses to light offset, but intact cone-to-ON bipolar cell synapses and light-onset responses. Ultrastructural analyses of &lt;i&gt;pappaa&lt;/i&gt; mutant cones showed a lack of presynaptic domains at synapses with OFF bipolar cells. &lt;i&gt;pappaa&lt;/i&gt; is expressed postsynaptically to the cones during retinal synaptogenesis and encodes a secreted metalloprotease known to stimulate insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signaling. Induction of dominant-negative IGF1 receptor expression during synaptogenesis reduced light-offset responses. Conversely, stimulating IGF1 signaling at this time improved &lt;i&gt;pappaa&lt;/i&gt; mutants' light-offset responses and cone presynaptic structures. Together, our results indicate Pappaa-regulated IGF1 signaling as a novel pathway that establishes how cone synapses convey light-offset signals to guide behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Distinct sensory inputs, like stimulus onset and offset, are often split at distinct synapses into parallel circuits for processing. In the retina, photoreceptors and ON and OFF bipolar cells form discrete synapses to split neural signals coding light onset and offset, respectively. The molecular cues that establish this synaptic configuration to specifically convey light onset or offset remain unclear. Our work reveals a novel cue: &lt;i&gt;pregnancy-associated plasma protein aa&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;pappaa&lt;/i&gt;), which regulates photoreceptor synaptic structure and function to specifically transmit light-offset information. Pappaa is a metalloprotease that stimulates local insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signaling. IGF1 promotes various aspects of synaptic development and function and is broadly expressed, thus requiring local regulators, like Pappaa, to govern its specificity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Conditional Bistability, a Generic Cellular Mnemonic Mechanism for Robust and Flexible Working Memory Computations</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/22/5209?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Persistent neural activity, the substrate of working memory, is thought to emerge from synaptic reverberation within recurrent networks. However, reverberation models do not robustly explain the fundamental dynamics of persistent activity, including high-spiking irregularity, large intertrial variability, and state transitions. While cellular bistability may contribute to persistent activity, its rigidity appears incompatible with persistent activity labile characteristics. Here, we unravel in a cellular model a form of spike-mediated conditional bistability that is robust and generic. and provides a rich repertoire of mnemonic computations. Under asynchronous synaptic inputs of the awakened state, conditional bistability generates spiking/bursting episodes, accounting for the irregularity, variability, and state transitions characterizing persistent activity. This mechanism has likely been overlooked because of the subthreshold input it requires, and we predict how to assess it experimentally. Our results suggest a reexamination of the role of intrinsic properties in the collective network dynamics responsible for flexible working memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This study unravels a novel form of intrinsic neuronal property: conditional bistability. We show that, thanks to its conditional character, conditional bistability favors the emergence of flexible and robust forms of persistent activity in PFC neural networks, in opposition to previously studied classical forms of absolute bistability. Specifically, we demonstrate for the first time that conditional bistability (1) is a generic biophysical spike-dependent mechanism of layer V pyramidal neurons in the PFC and that (2) it accounts for essential neurodynamical features for the organization and flexibility of PFC persistent activity (the large irregularity and intertrial variability of the discharge and its organization under discrete stable states), which remain unexplained in a robust fashion by current models.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neural Mechanisms Underlying Individual Differences in Control-Averse Behavior</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/22/5196?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When another person tries to control one's decisions, some people might comply, but many will feel the urge to act against that control. This control aversion can lead to suboptimal decisions and it affects social interactions in many societal domains. To date, however, it has been unclear what drives individual differences in control-averse behavior. Here, we address this issue by measuring brain activity with fMRI while healthy female and male human participants made choices that were either free or controlled by another person, with real consequences to both interaction partners. In addition, we assessed the participants' affects, social cognitions, and motivations via self-reports. Our results indicate that the social cognitions perceived distrust and lack of understanding for the other person play a key role in explaining control aversion at the behavioral level. At the neural level, we find that control-averse behavior can be explained by functional connectivity between the inferior parietal lobule and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, brain regions commonly associated with attention reorientation and cognitive control. Further analyses reveal that the individual strength of functional connectivity complements and partially mediates the self-reported social cognitions in explaining individual differences in control-averse behavior. These findings therefore provide valuable contributions to a more comprehensive model of control aversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Control aversion is a prevalent phenomenon in our society. When someone tries to control their decisions, many people tend to act against the control. This can lead to suboptimal decisions such as noncompliance to medical treatments or disobeying the law. The degree to which individuals engage in control-averse behavior, however, varies significantly. Understanding the proximal mechanisms that underlie individual differences in control-averse behavior has potential policy implications, for example, when designing policies aimed at increasing compliance with vaccination recommendations, and is therefore a highly relevant research goal. Here, we identify a neural mechanism between parietal and prefrontal brain regions that can explain individual differences in control-averse behavior. This mechanism provides novel insights into control aversion beyond what is accessible through self-reports.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Affective and Neural Correlates of Heroin versus Cocaine Use in Addiction Are Influenced by Environmental Setting But in Opposite Directions</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/22/5182?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have shown that individuals with heroin and cocaine addiction prefer to use these drugs in distinct settings: mostly at home in the case of heroin and mostly outside the home in the case of cocaine. Here we investigated whether the context would modulate the affective and neural responses to these drugs in a similar way. First, we used a novel emotional task to assess the affective state produced by heroin or cocaine in different settings, based on the recollections of male and female drug users. Then we used fMRI to monitor neural activity during drug imagery (re-creating the setting of drug use) in male drug users. Consistent with our working hypothesis, the majority of participants reported a shift in the affective valence of heroin from mostly pleasant at home to mostly unpleasant outside the home (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). The opposite shift was observed for cocaine; that is, most participants who found cocaine pleasant outside the home found it unpleasant when taken at home (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0014). Furthermore, we found a double dissociation, as a function of drug and setting imagery, in BOLD signal changes in the left PFC and caudate, and bilaterally in the cerebellum (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; values &amp;lt;0.01), suggesting that the fronto-striatal-cerebellar network is implicated in the contextualization of drug-induced affect. In summary, we report that the same setting can influence in opposite directions the affective and neural response to psychostimulants versus opiates in humans, adding to growing evidence of distinct substrates for the rewarding effects of these two drug classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The rewarding effects of addictive drugs are often thought to depend on shared substrates. Yet, environmental influences can unmask striking differences between psychostimulants and opiates. Here we used emotional tasks and fMRI to explore the influence of setting on the response to heroin versus cocaine in individuals with addiction. Simply moving from one setting to another significantly decreased heroin pleasure but increased cocaine pleasure, and vice versa. Similar double dissociation was observed in the activity of the fronto-striatal-cerebellar network. These findings suggest that the effects of opiates and psychostimulants depend on dissociable psychological and neural substrates and that therapeutic approaches to addiction should take into account the peculiarities of different drug classes and the settings of drug use.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Genetic Activation, Inactivation, and Deletion Reveal a Limited And Nuanced Role for Somatostatin-Containing Basal Forebrain Neurons in Behavioral State Control</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/22/5168?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent studies have identified an especially important role for basal forebrain GABAergic (BF&lt;sup&gt;VGAT&lt;/sup&gt;) neurons in the regulation of behavioral waking and fast cortical rhythms associated with cognition. However, BF&lt;sup&gt;VGAT&lt;/sup&gt; neurons comprise several neurochemically and anatomically distinct subpopulations, including parvalbumin-containing BF&lt;sup&gt;VGAT&lt;/sup&gt; neurons and somatostatin-containing BF&lt;sup&gt;VGAT&lt;/sup&gt; neurons (BF&lt;sup&gt;SOM&lt;/sup&gt; neurons), and it was recently reported that optogenetic activation of BF&lt;sup&gt;SOM&lt;/sup&gt; neurons increases the probability of a wakefulness to non-rapid-eye movement (NREM) sleep transition when stimulated during the rest period of the animal. This finding was unexpected given that most BF&lt;sup&gt;SOM&lt;/sup&gt; neurons are not NREM sleep active and that central administration of the synthetic somatostatin analog, octreotide, suppresses NREM sleep or increases REM sleep. Here we used a combination of genetically driven chemogenetic and optogenetic activation, chemogenetic inhibition, and ablation approaches to further explore the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; role of BF&lt;sup&gt;SOM&lt;/sup&gt; neurons in arousal control. Our findings indicate that acute activation or inhibition of BF&lt;sup&gt;SOM&lt;/sup&gt; neurons is neither wakefulness nor NREM sleep promoting and is without significant effect on the EEG, and that chronic loss of these neurons is without effect on total 24 h sleep amounts, although a small but significant increase in waking was observed in the lesioned mice during the early active period. Our &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; cell recordings further reveal electrophysiological heterogeneity in BF&lt;sup&gt;SOM&lt;/sup&gt; neurons, specifically suggesting at least two distinct subpopulations. Together, our data support the more nuanced view that BF&lt;sup&gt;SOM&lt;/sup&gt; neurons are electrically heterogeneous and are not NREM sleep or wake promoting per se, but may exert, in particular during the early active period, a modest inhibitory influence on arousal circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The cellular basal forebrain (BF) is a highly complex area of the brain that is implicated in a wide range of higher-level neurobiological processes, including regulating and maintaining normal levels of electrocortical and behavioral arousal. The respective &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; roles of BF cell populations and their neurotransmitter systems in the regulation of electrocortical and behavioral arousal remains incompletely understood. Here we seek to define the neurobiological contribution of GABAergic somatostatin-containing BF neurons to arousal control. Understanding the respective contribution of BF cell populations to arousal control may provide critical insight into the pathogenesis of a host of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and the cognitive impairments of normal aging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Short-Term Plasticity Combines with Excitation-Inhibition Balance to Expand Cerebellar Purkinje Cell Dynamic Range</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/22/5153?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The balance between excitation (E) and inhibition (I) in neuronal networks controls the firing rate of principal cells through simple network organization, such as feedforward inhibitory circuits. Here, we demonstrate in male mice, that at the granule cell (GrC)-molecular layer interneuron (MLI)-Purkinje cell (PC) pathway of the cerebellar cortex, E/I balance is dynamically controlled by short-term dynamics during bursts of stimuli, shaping cerebellar output. Using a combination of electrophysiological recordings, optogenetic stimulation, and modeling, we describe the wide range of bidirectional changes in PC discharge triggered by GrC bursts, from robust excitation to complete inhibition. At high frequency (200 Hz), increasing the number of pulses in a burst (from 3 to 7) can switch a net inhibition of PC to a net excitation. Measurements of EPSCs and IPSCs during bursts and modeling showed that this feature can be explained by the interplay between short-term dynamics of the GrC-MLI-PC pathway and E/I balance impinging on PC. Our findings demonstrate that PC firing rate is highly sensitive to the duration of GrC bursts, which may define a temporal-to-rate code transformation in the cerebellar cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Sensorimotor information processing in the cerebellar cortex leads to the occurrence of a sequence of synaptic excitation and inhibition in Purkinje cells. Granule cells convey direct excitatory inputs and indirect inhibitory inputs to the Purkinje cells, through molecular layer interneurons, forming a feedforward inhibitory pathway. Using electrophysiological recordings, optogenetic stimulation, and mathematical modeling, we found that presynaptic short-term dynamics affect the balance between synaptic excitation and inhibition on Purkinje cells during high-frequency bursts and can reverse the sign of granule cell influence on Purkinje cell discharge when burst duration increases. We conclude that short-term dynamics may play an important role in transforming the duration of sensory inputs arriving on cerebellar granule cells into cerebellar cortical output firing rate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Schaffer Collateral Inputs to CA1 Excitatory and Inhibitory Neurons Follow Different Connectivity Rules</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/22/5140?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural circuits, governed by a complex interplay between excitatory and inhibitory neurons, are the substrate for information processing, and the organization of synaptic connectivity in neural network is an important determinant of circuit function. Here, we analyzed the fine structure of connectivity in hippocampal CA1 excitatory and inhibitory neurons innervated by Schaffer collaterals (SCs) using mGRASP in male mice. Our previous study revealed spatially structured synaptic connectivity between CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cells (PCs). Surprisingly, parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PVs) showed a significantly more random pattern spatial structure. Notably, application of Peters' rule for synapse prediction by random overlap between axons and dendrites enhanced structured connectivity in PCs, but, by contrast, made the connectivity pattern in PVs more random. In addition, PCs in a deep sublayer of striatum pyramidale appeared more highly structured than PCs in superficial layers, and little or no sublayer specificity was found in PVs. Our results show that CA1 excitatory PCs and inhibitory PVs innervated by the same SC inputs follow different connectivity rules. The different organizations of fine scale structured connectivity in hippocampal excitatory and inhibitory neurons provide important insights into the development and functions of neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Understanding how neural circuits generate behavior is one of the central goals of neuroscience. An important component of this endeavor is the mapping of fine-scale connection patterns that underlie, and help us infer, signal processing in the brain. Here, using our recently developed synapse detection technology (mGRASP and neuTube), we provide detailed profiles of synaptic connectivity in excitatory (CA1 pyramidal) and inhibitory (CA1 parvalbumin-positive) neurons innervated by the same presynaptic inputs (CA3 Schaffer collaterals). Our results reveal that these two types of CA1 neurons follow different connectivity patterns. Our new evidence for differently structured connectivity at a fine scale in hippocampal excitatory and inhibitory neurons provides a better understanding of hippocampal networks and will guide theoretical and experimental studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Structural and Functional Rescue of Chronic Metabolically Stressed Optic Nerves through Respiration</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/22/5122?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Axon degeneration can arise from metabolic stress, potentially a result of mitochondrial dysfunction or lack of appropriate substrate input. In this study, we investigated whether the metabolic vulnerability observed during optic neuropathy in the DBA/2J (D2) model of glaucoma is due to dysfunctional mitochondria or impaired substrate delivery to axons, the latter based on our observation of significantly decreased glucose and monocarboxylate transporters in D2 optic nerve (ON), human ON, and mice subjected to acute glaucoma injury. We placed both sexes of D2 mice destined to develop glaucoma and mice of a control strain, the DBA/2J-&lt;i&gt;Gpnmb&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, on a ketogenic diet to encourage mitochondrial function. Eight weeks of the diet generated mitochondria, improved energy availability by reversing monocarboxylate transporter decline, reduced glial hypertrophy, protected retinal ganglion cells and their axons from degeneration, and maintained physiological signaling to the brain. A robust antioxidant response also accompanied the response to the diet. These results suggest that energy compromise and subsequent axon degeneration in the D2 is due to low substrate availability secondary to transporter downregulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We show axons in glaucomatous optic nerve are energy depleted and exhibit chronic metabolic stress. Underlying the metabolic stress are low levels of glucose and monocarboxylate transporters that compromise axon metabolism by limiting substrate availability. Axonal metabolic decline was reversed by upregulating monocarboxylate transporters as a result of placing the animals on a ketogenic diet. Optic nerve mitochondria responded capably to the oxidative phosphorylation necessitated by the diet and showed increased number. These findings indicate that the source of metabolic challenge can occur upstream of mitochondrial dysfunction. Importantly, the intervention was successful despite the animals being on the cusp of significant glaucoma progression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/22/5111?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Gait disturbances in Parkinson's disease are commonly refractory to current treatment options and majorly impair patient's quality of life. Auditory cues facilitate gait and prevent motor blocks. We investigated how neural dynamics in the human subthalamic nucleus of Parkinsons's disease patients (14 male, 2 female) vary during stepping and whether rhythmic auditory cues enhance the observed modulation. Oscillations in the beta band were suppressed after ipsilateral heel strikes, when the contralateral foot had to be raised, and reappeared after contralateral heel strikes, when the contralateral foot rested on the floor. The timing of this 20–30 Hz beta modulation was clearly distinct between the left and right subthalamic nucleus, and was alternating within each stepping cycle. This modulation was similar, whether stepping movements were made while sitting, standing, or during gait, confirming the utility of the stepping in place paradigm. During stepping in place, beta modulation increased with auditory cues that assisted patients in timing their steps more regularly. Our results suggest a link between the degree of power modulation within high beta frequency bands and stepping performance. These findings raise the possibility that alternating deep brain stimulation patterns may be superior to constant stimulation for improving parkinsonian gait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Gait disturbances in Parkinson's disease majorly reduce patients' quality of life and are often refractory to current treatment options. We investigated how neural activity in the subthalamic nucleus of patients who received deep brain stimulation surgery covaries with the stepping cycle. 20–30 Hz beta activity was modulated relative to each step, alternating between the left and right STN. The stepping performance of patients improved when auditory cues were provided, which went along with enhanced beta modulation. This raises the possibility that alternating stimulation patterns may also enhance beta modulation and may be more beneficial for gait control than continuous stimulation, which needs to be tested in future studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: R-Ras1 and R-Ras2 Are Essential for Oligodendrocyte Differentiation and Survival for Correct Myelination in the Central Nervous System</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/22/5096?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Rapid and effective neural transmission of information requires correct axonal myelination. Modifications in myelination alter axonal capacity to transmit electric impulses and enable pathological conditions. In the CNS, oligodendrocytes (OLs) myelinate axons, a complex process involving various cellular interactions. However, we know little about the mechanisms that orchestrate correct myelination. Here, we demonstrate that OLs express R-Ras1 and R-Ras2. Using female and male mutant mice to delete these proteins, we found that activation of the PI3K/Akt and Erk1/2-MAPK pathways was weaker in mice lacking one or both of these GTPases, suggesting that both proteins coordinate the activity of these two pathways. Loss of R-Ras1 and/or R-Ras2 diminishes the number of OLs in major myelinated CNS tracts and increases the proportion of immature OLs. In &lt;i&gt;R-Ras1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;R-Ras2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;-null mice, OLs show aberrant morphologies and fail to differentiate correctly into myelin-forming phenotypes. The smaller OL population and abnormal OL maturation induce severe hypomyelination, with shorter nodes of Ranvier in &lt;i&gt;R-Ras1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; and/or &lt;i&gt;R-Ras2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. These defects explain the slower conduction velocity of myelinated axons that we observed in the absence of R-Ras1 and R-Ras2. Together, these results suggest that R-Ras1 and R-Ras2 are upstream elements that regulate the survival and differentiation of progenitors into OLs through the PI3K/Akt and Erk1/2-MAPK pathways for proper myelination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In this study, we show that R-Ras1 and R-Ras2 play essential roles in regulating myelination &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and control fundamental aspects of oligodendrocyte (OL) survival and differentiation through synergistic activation of PI3K/Akt and Erk1/2-MAPK signaling. Mice lacking R-Ras1 and/or R-Ras2 show a diminished OL population with a higher proportion of immature OLs, explaining the observed hypomyelination in main CNS tracts. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiology recordings demonstrate a slower conduction velocity of nerve impulses in the absence of R-Ras1 and R-Ras2. Therefore, R-Ras1 and R-Ras2 are essential for proper axonal myelination and accurate neural transmission.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Time-Restricted Feeding Prevents Ablation of Diurnal Rhythms in Gastric Vagal Afferent Mechanosensitivity Observed in High-Fat Diet-Induced Obese Mice</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/22/5088?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mechanosensitive gastric vagal afferents (GVAs) are involved in the regulation of food intake. GVAs exhibit diurnal rhythmicity in their response to food-related stimuli, allowing time of day-specific satiety signaling. This diurnal rhythmicity is ablated in high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced obesity. Time-restricted feeding (TRF) has a strong influence on peripheral clocks. This study aimed to determine whether diurnal patterns in GVA mechanosensitivity are entrained by TRF. Eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 256) were fed a standard laboratory diet (SLD) or HFD for 12 weeks. After 4 weeks of diet acclimatization, the mice were fed either &lt;i&gt;ad libitum&lt;/i&gt; or only during the light phase [Zeitgeber time (ZT) 0–12] or dark phase (ZT12–24) for 8 weeks. A subgroup of mice from all conditions (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 8/condition) were placed in metabolic cages. After 12 weeks, &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; GVA recordings were taken at 3 h intervals starting at ZT0. HFD mice gained more weight than SLD mice. TRF did not affect weight gain in the SLD mice, but decreased weight gain in the HFD mice regardless of the TRF period. In SLD mice, diurnal rhythms in food intake were inversely associated with diurnal rhythmicity of GVA mechanosensitivity. These diurnal rhythms were entrained by the timing of food intake. In HFD mice, diurnal rhythms in food intake and diurnal rhythmicity of GVA mechanosensitivity were dampened. Loss of diurnal rhythmicity in HFD mice was abrogated by TRF. In conclusion, diurnal rhythmicity in GVA responses to food-related stimuli can be entrained by food intake. TRF prevents the loss of diurnal rhythmicity that occurs in HFD-induced obesity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Diurnal control of food intake is vital for maintaining metabolic health. Diet-induced obesity is associated with strong diurnal changes in food intake. Vagal afferents are involved in regulation of feeding behavior, particularly meal size, and exhibit diurnal fluctuations in mechanosensitivity. These diurnal fluctuations in vagal afferent mechanosensitivity are lost in diet-induced obesity. This study provides evidence that time-restricted feeding entrains diurnal rhythmicity in vagal afferent mechanosensitivity in lean and high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced obese mice and, more importantly, prevents the loss of rhythmicity in HFD-induced obesity. These data have important implications for the development of strategies to treat obesity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Distinguishing the Roles of Dorsolateral and Anterior PFC in Visual Metacognition</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/22/5078?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Visual metacognition depends on regions within the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Two areas in particular have been implicated repeatedly: the dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) and the anterior PFC (aPFC). However, it is still unclear what the function of each of these areas is and how they differ from each other. To establish the specific roles of DLPFC and aPFC in metacognition, we used online transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to interfere causally with their functioning during confidence generation. Human subjects from both sexes performed a perceptual decision making and provided confidence ratings. We found a clear dissociation between the two areas: DLPFC TMS lowered confidence ratings, whereas aPFC TMS increased metacognitive ability, but only for the second half of the experimental blocks. These results support a functional architecture in which DLPFC reads out the strength of the sensory evidence and relays it to aPFC, which makes the confidence judgment by potentially incorporating additional, nonperceptual information. Indeed, simulations from a model that incorporates these putative DLPFC and aPFC functions reproduced our behavioral results. These findings establish DLPFC and aPFC as distinct nodes in a metacognitive network and suggest specific contributions from each of these regions to confidence generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is known to be critical for metacognition. Two of its subregions, the dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) and the anterior PFC (aPFC), have been specifically implicated in confidence generation. However, it is unclear whether these regions have distinct functions related to the underlying metacognitive computation. Using a causal intervention with transcranial magnetic stimulation, we demonstrate that DLPFC and aPFC have dissociable contributions: targeting DLPFC decreased average confidence ratings, whereas targeting aPFC affected metacognitive scores specifically. Based on these results, we postulated specific functions for DLPFC and aPFC in metacognitive computation and corroborated them using a computational model that reproduced our results. Our causal results reveal the existence of a specialized modular organization in PFC for confidence generation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: GAD65 Promoter Polymorphism rs2236418 Modulates Harm Avoidance in Women via Inhibition/Excitation Balance in the Rostral ACC</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/22/5067?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Anxiety disorders are common and debilitating conditions with higher prevalence in women. However, factors that predispose women to anxiety phenotypes are not clarified. Here we investigated potential contribution of the single nucleotide polymorphism rs2236418 in &lt;i&gt;GAD2&lt;/i&gt; gene to changes in regional inhibition/excitation balance, anxiety-like traits, and related neural activity in both sexes. One hundred and five healthy individuals were examined with high-field (7T) multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); including resting-state functional MRI in combination with assessment of GABA and glutamate (Glu) levels via MR spectroscopy. Regional GABA/Glu levels in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) subregions were assessed as mediators of gene–personality interaction for the trait harm avoidance and moderation by sex was tested. In AA homozygotes, with putatively lower &lt;i&gt;GAD2&lt;/i&gt; promoter activity, we observed increased intrinsic neuronal activity and higher inhibition/excitation balance in pregenual ACC (pgACC) compared with G carriers. The pgACC drove a significant interaction of genotype, region, and sex, where inhibition/excitation balance was significantly reduced only in female AA carriers. This finding was specific for rs2236418 as other investigated single nucleotide polymorphisms of the GABA synthesis related enzymes (&lt;i&gt;GAD1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;GAD2&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;GLS&lt;/i&gt;) were not significant. Furthermore, only in women there was a negative association of pgACC GABA/Glu ratios with harm avoidance. A moderated-mediation model revealed that pgACC GABA/Glu also mediated the association between the genotype variant and level of harm avoidance, dependent on sex. Our data thus provide new insights into the neurochemical mechanisms that control emotional endophenotypes in humans and constitute predisposing factors for the development of anxiety disorders in women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Anxiety disorders are among the most common and burdensome psychiatric disorders, with higher prevalence rates in women. The causal mechanisms are, however, poorly understood. In this study we propose a neurobiological basis that could help to explain female bias of anxiety endophenotypes. Using magnetic resonance brain imaging and personality questionnaires we show an interaction of the genetic variation rs2236418 in the &lt;i&gt;GAD2&lt;/i&gt; gene and sex on GABA/glutamate (Glu) balance in the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC), a region previously connected to affect regulation and anxiety disorders. The &lt;i&gt;GAD2&lt;/i&gt; gene polymorphism further influenced baseline neuronal activity in the pgACC. Importantly, GABA/Glu was shown to mediate the relationship between the genetic variant and harm avoidance, however, only in women.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dissociation between CSD-Evoked Metabolic Perturbations and Meningeal Afferent Activation and Sensitization: Implications for Mechanisms of Migraine Headache Onset</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/22/5053?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The onset of the headache phase during attacks of migraine with aura, which occur in ~30% of migraineurs, is believed to involve cortical spreading depression (CSD) and the ensuing activation and sensitization of primary afferent neurons that innervate the intracranial meninges, and their related large vessels. The mechanism by which CSD enhances the activity and mechanosensitivity of meningeal afferents remains poorly understood, but may involve cortical metabolic perturbations. We used extracellular single-unit recording of meningeal afferent activity and monitored changes in cortical blood flow and tissue partial pressure of oxygen (tpO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in anesthetized male rats to test whether the prolonged cortical hypoperfusion and reduction in tissue oxygenation that occur in the wake of CSD contribute to meningeal nociception. Suppression of CSD-evoked cortical hypoperfusion with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor naproxen blocked the reduction in cortical tpO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but had no effect on the activation of meningeal afferents. Naproxen, however, distinctly prevented CSD-induced afferent mechanical sensitization. Counteracting the CSD-evoked persistent hypoperfusion and reduced tpO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by preemptively increasing cortical blood flow using the ATP-sensitive potassium [K(ATP)] channel opener levcromakalim did not inhibit the sensitization of meningeal afferents, but prevented their activation. Our data show that the cortical hypoperfusion and reduction in tpO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that occur in the wake of CSD can be dissociated from the activation and mechanical sensitization of meningeal afferent responses, suggesting that the metabolic changes do not contribute directly to these neuronal nociceptive responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Cortical spreading depression (CSD)-evoked activation and mechanical sensitization of meningeal afferents is thought to mediate the headache phase in migraine with aura. We report that blocking the CSD-evoked cortical hypoperfusion and reduced tissue partial pressure of oxygen by cyclooxygenase inhibition is associated with the inhibition of the afferent sensitization, but not their activation. Normalization of these CSD-evoked metabolic perturbations by activating K(ATP) channels is, however, associated with the inhibition of afferent activation but not sensitization. These results question the contribution of cortical metabolic perturbations to the triggering mechanism underlying meningeal nociception and the ensuing headache in migraine with aura, further point to distinct mechanisms underlying the activation and sensitization of meningeal afferents in migraine, and highlight the need to target both processes for an effective migraine therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Remote Memory and Cortical Synaptic Plasticity Require Neuronal CCCTC-Binding Factor (CTCF)</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/22/5042?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The molecular mechanism of long-term memory has been extensively studied in the context of the hippocampus-dependent recent memory examined within several days. However, months-old remote memory maintained in the cortex for long-term has not been investigated much at the molecular level yet. Various epigenetic mechanisms are known to be important for long-term memory, but how the 3D chromatin architecture and its regulator molecules contribute to neuronal plasticity and systems consolidation is still largely unknown. CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is an 11-zinc finger protein well known for its role as a genome architecture molecule. Male conditional knock-out mice in which CTCF is lost in excitatory neurons during adulthood showed normal recent memory in the contextual fear conditioning and spatial water maze tasks. However, they showed remarkable impairments in remote memory in both tasks. Underlying the remote memory-specific phenotypes, we observed that female CTCF conditional knock-out mice exhibit disrupted cortical LTP, but not hippocampal LTP. Similarly, we observed that CTCF deletion in inhibitory neurons caused partial impairment of remote memory. Through RNA sequencing, we observed that CTCF knockdown in cortical neuron culture caused altered expression of genes that are highly involved in cell adhesion, synaptic plasticity, and memory. These results suggest that remote memory storage in the cortex requires CTCF-mediated gene regulation in neurons, whereas recent memory formation in the hippocampus does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a well-known 3D genome architectural protein that regulates gene expression. Here, we use two different CTCF conditional knock-out mouse lines and reveal, for the first time, that CTCF is critically involved in the regulation of remote memory. We also show that CTCF is necessary for appropriate expression of genes, many of which we found to be involved in the learning- and memory-related processes. Our study provides behavioral and physiological evidence for the involvement of CTCF-mediated gene regulation in the remote long-term memory and elucidates our understanding of systems consolidation mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Blood-Brain Barrier Leakage during Early Epileptogenesis Is Associated with Rapid Remodeling of the Neurovascular Unit</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/3/ENEURO.0123-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Increased permeability of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) following cerebral injury results in regional extravasation of plasma proteins and can critically contribute to the pathogenesis of epilepsy. Here, we comprehensively explore the spatiotemporal evolution of a main extravasation component, albumin, and illuminate associated responses of the neurovascular unit (NVU) contributing to early epileptogenic neuropathology. We applied translational &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; MR imaging and complementary immunohistochemical analyses in the widely used rat pilocarpine post–status epilepticus (SE) model. The observed rapid BBB leakage affected major epileptogenesis-associated brain regions, peaked between 1 and 2 d post-SE, and rapidly declined thereafter, accompanied by cerebral edema generally following the same time course. At peak of BBB leakage, serum albumin colocalized with NVU constituents, such as vascular components, neurons, and brain immune cells. Surprisingly, astroglial markers did not colocalize with albumin, and aquaporin-4 (AQP4) was clearly reduced in areas of leaky BBB, indicating a severe disturbance of astrocyte-mediated endothelial-neuronal coupling. In addition, a distinct adaptive reorganization process of the NVU vasculature apparently takes place at sites of albumin presence, substantiated by reduced immunoreactivity of endothelial and changes in vascular basement membrane markers. Taken together, degenerative events at the level of the NVU, affecting vessels, astrocytes, and neurons, seem to outweigh reconstructive processes. Considering the rapidly occurring BBB leakage and subsequent impairment of the NVU, our data support the necessity of a prompt BBB-restoring treatment as one component of rational therapeutic intervention to prevent epileptogenesis and the development of other detrimental sequelae of SE.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: TRPV1 Agonist, Capsaicin, Induces Axon Outgrowth after Injury via Ca2+/PKA Signaling</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/3/ENEURO.0095-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Preconditioning nerve injuries activate a pro-regenerative program that enhances axon regeneration for most classes of sensory neurons. However, nociceptive sensory neurons and central nervous system neurons regenerate poorly. In hopes of identifying novel mechanisms that promote regeneration, we screened for drugs that mimicked the preconditioning response and identified a nociceptive ligand that activates a preconditioning-like response to promote axon outgrowth. We show that activating the ion channel TRPV1 with capsaicin induces axon outgrowth of cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons, and that this effect is blocked in TRPV1 knockout neurons. Regeneration occurs only in NF200-negative nociceptive neurons, consistent with a cell-autonomous mechanism. Moreover, we identify a signaling pathway in which TRPV1 activation leads to calcium influx and protein kinase A (PKA) activation to induce a preconditioning-like response. Finally, capsaicin administration to the mouse sciatic nerve activates a similar preconditioning-like response and induces enhanced axonal outgrowth, indicating that this pathway can be induced &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. These findings highlight the use of local ligands to induce regeneration and suggest that it may be possible to target selective neuronal populations for repair, including cell types that often fail to regenerate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The anterior insula (AI) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) are engaged in various cognitive and affective processes. An influential account posits that the AI and dACC’s ubiquitous engagements reflect their role in the transient capture of attention by salient stimuli. Using fMRI here we tested this claim and functionally dissociated these regions. In the first experiment, we compared these regions’ responses to emotion-laden and emotion-neutral salient “oddball” movie events. We found that while the AI only responded transiently to the onset and offset of neutral events, its response to affective events was sustained, challenging the transient attention capture account. By contrast, dACC remained transient regardless of event type. A second experiment distinguished the information encoded by these brain regions with the presentation of behaviorally salient events that require either maintaining the current task set or updating to a different one; the AI was found to signal the presence of the behaviorally relevant events, while the dACC was associated with switching of attention settings in response to the events. We conclude that AI and dACC are involved in signaling the presence of potentially or de facto behaviorally significant events and updating internal attention settings in response to these events, respectively.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Cell-Specific Loss of SNAP25 from Cortical Projection Neurons Allows Normal Development but Causes Subsequent Neurodegeneration</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Synaptosomal associated protein 25 kDa (SNAP25) is an essential component of the SNARE complex regulating synaptic vesicle fusion. SNAP25 deficiency has been implicated in a variety of cognitive disorders. We ablated SNAP25 from selected neuronal populations by generating a transgenic mouse (B6-Snap25tm3mcw (Snap25-flox)) with LoxP sites flanking exon5a/5b. In the presence of Cre-recombinase, Snap25-flox is recombined to a truncated transcript. Evoked synaptic vesicle release is severely reduced in Snap25 conditional knockout (cKO) neurons as shown by live cell imaging of synaptic vesicle fusion and whole cell patch clamp recordings in cultured hippocampal neurons. We studied Snap25 cKO in subsets of cortical projection neurons in vivo (L5—Rbp4-Cre; L6—Ntsr1-Cre; L6b—Drd1a-Cre). cKO neurons develop normal axonal projections, but axons are not maintained appropriately, showing signs of swelling, fragmentation and eventually complete absence. Onset and progression of degeneration are dependent on the neuron type, with L5 cells showing the earliest and most severe axonal loss. Ultrastructural examination revealed that cKO neurites contain autophagosome/lysosome-like structures. Markers of inflammation such as Iba1 and lipofuscin are increased only in adult cKO cortex. Snap25 cKO can provide a model to study genetic interactions with environmental influences in several disorders.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

At 3 years-of-age, boys with ASD had reduced gyrification in the fusiform gyrus compared with TD boys. A longitudinal evaluation from 3 to 5 years revealed that while TD boys had stable/decreasing LGI, boys with ASD had increasing LGI in right inferior temporal gyrus, right inferior frontal gyrus, right inferior parietal lobule, and stable LGI in left lingual gyrus. LGI was also examined in a previously defined neurophenotype of boys with ASD and disproportionate megalencephaly. At 3 years-of-age, this subgroup exhibited increased LGI in right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, and paracentral cortex, and left cingulate cortex and superior frontal gyrus relative to TD boys and increased LGI in right paracentral lobule and parahippocampal gyrus, and left precentral gyrus compared with boys with ASD and normal brain size. In summary, this study identified alterations in the pattern and development of LGI during early childhood in ASD. Distinct patterns of alterations in subgroups of boys with ASD suggests that multiple neurophenotypes exist and boys with ASD and disproportionate megalencephaly should be evaluated separately.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;There is little understanding of the structural underpinnings of the functional reorganization of the cortex in the congenitally blind human. Taking advantage of the extensive characterization of the macaque visual system, we examine in macaque the influence of congenital blindness resulting from the removal of the retina during in utero development. This effectively removes the normal influence of the thalamus on cortical development leading to an induced hybrid cortex (HC) combining features of primary visual and extrastriate cortex. Retrograde tracers injected in HC reveal a local, intrinsic connectivity characteristic of higher order areas and show that the HC receives a uniquely strong, purely feedforward projection from striate cortex but no ectopic inputs, except from subiculum, and entorhinal cortex. Statistical modeling of quantitative connectivity data shows that HC is relatively high in the cortical hierarchy and receives a reinforced input from ventral stream areas while the overall organization of the functional streams are conserved. The directed and weighted anophthalmic cortical graph from the present study can be used to construct dynamic and structural models. These findings show how the sensory periphery governs cortical phenotype and reveal the importance of developmental arealization for understanding the functional reorganization in congenital blindness.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

We lack a detailed understanding of the functions in which they are involved, and stereotaxic maps are not available. We present an integrated structural/functional map of pACC based on probabilistic cytoarchitectonic mapping and meta-analytic connectivity modeling and quantitative functional decoding. Due to the restricted spatial resolution of functional imaging data relative to the microstructural parcellation, areas p24a of the callosal sulcus and p24b on the surface of the cingulate gyrus were merged into a “gyral component” (p24ab) of area p24, and areas pv24c, pd24cv, and pd24cd, located within the cingulate sulcus were merged into a “sulcal component” (p24c) for meta-analytic analysis. Area p24ab was specifically associated with interoception, p24c with the inhibition of action, and p32, which was also activated by emotion induction tasks pertaining negatively valenced stimuli, with the ability to experience empathy. Thus, area p32 could be classified as cingulate association cortex playing a crucial role in the cognitive regulation of emotion. By this spectrum of functions, pACC is a structurally and functionally heterogeneous region, clearly differing from other parts of the anterior and middle cingulate cortex.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

However, the mechanism of the effect of &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps;&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-Asp has not been fully understood. In this study, we hypothesized that ingested &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps;&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-Asp directly reaches the hippocampal tissues via the blood circulation and modifies the functional connectivity between hippocampus and other regions through spinogenesis in hippocampal CA1 neurons. The spinogenesis induced by the application of &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps;&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-Asp was investigated using rat acute hippocampal slices. The density of CA1 spines was increased following 21 and 100 μM &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps;&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-Asp application. The nongenomic spine increase pathway involved LIM kinase. In parallel to the acute slice study, brain activation was investigated in awake rats using functional MRI following the intragastric administration of 5 mM &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps;&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-Asp. Furthermore, the concentration of &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps;&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-Asp in the blood serum and hippocampus was significantly increased 15 min after intragastric administration of &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps;&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-Asp. A functional connectivity by awake rat fMRI demonstrated increased slow-frequency synchronization in the hippocampus and other regions, including the somatosensory cortex, striatum, and the nucleus accumbens, 10–20 min after the start of &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps;&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-Asp administration.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Evaluating the Prediction of Brain Maturity From Functional Connectivity After Motion Artifact Denoising</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy117/5025421?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The ability to make individual-level predictions from neuroanatomy has the potential to be particularly useful in child development. Previously, resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) MRI has been used to successfully predict maturity and diagnosis of typically and atypically developing individuals. Unfortunately, submillimeter head motion in the scanner produces systematic, distance-dependent differences in RSFC and may contaminate, and potentially facilitate, these predictions. Here, we evaluated individual age prediction with RSFC after stringent motion denoising. Using multivariate machine learning, we found that 57% of the variance in individual RSFC after motion artifact denoising was explained by age, while 4% was explained by residual effects of head motion. When RSFC data were not adequately denoised, 50% of the variance was explained by motion. Reducing motion-related artifact also revealed that prediction did not depend upon characteristics of functional connections previously hypothesized to mediate development (e.g., connection distance). Instead, successful age prediction relied upon sampling functional connections across multiple functional systems with strong, reliable RSFC within an individual. Our results demonstrate that RSFC across the brain is sufficiently robust to make individual-level predictions of maturity in typical development, and hence, may have clinical utility for the diagnosis and prognosis of individuals with atypical developmental trajectories.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is modeled to explore the mechanisms of this effective, but poorly understood, treatment for motor symptoms of drug-refractory Parkinson’s disease and dystonia. First, a neural field model of the corticothalamic-basal ganglia (CTBG) system is developed that reproduces key clinical features of Parkinson’s disease, including its characteristic 4–8 Hz and 13–30 Hz electrophysiological signatures. Deep brain stimulation of the STN is then modeled and shown to suppress the pathological 13–30 Hz (beta) activity for physiologically realistic and optimized stimulus parameters. This supports the idea that suppression of abnormally coherent activity in the CTBG system is a major factor in DBS therapy for Parkinson’s disease, by permitting normal dynamics to resume. At high stimulus intensities, nonlinear effects in the target population mediate wave-wave interactions between resonant beta activity and the stimulus pulse train, leading to complex spectral structure that shows remarkable similarity to that seen in steady-state evoked potential experiments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Nyh-p6NdIb8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

There is a current interest in quantifying time-varying connectivity (TVC) based on neuroimaging data such as fMRI. Many methods have been proposed, and are being applied, revealing new insight into the brain’s dynamics. However, given that the ground truth for TVC in the brain is unknown, many concerns remain regarding the accuracy of proposed estimates. Since there exist many TVC methods it is difficult to assess differences in time-varying connectivity between studies. In this paper, we present &lt;i&gt;tvc_benchmarker&lt;/i&gt;, which is a Python package containing four simulations to test TVC methods. Here, we evaluate five different methods that together represent a wide spectrum of current approaches to estimating TVC (sliding window, tapered sliding window, multiplication of temporal derivatives, spatial distance and jackknife correlation). These simulations were designed to test each method’s ability to track changes in covariance over time, which is a key property in TVC analysis. We found that all tested methods correlated positively with each other, but there were large differences in the strength of the correlations between methods. To facilitate comparisons with future TVC methods, we propose that the described simulations can act as benchmark tests for evaluation of methods. Using &lt;i&gt;tvc_benchmarker&lt;/i&gt; researchers can easily add, compare and submit their own TVC methods to evaluate its performance.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PcnqFhi9tsk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

A common challenge in systems biology is quantifying the effects of unknown parameters and estimating parameter values from data. For many systems, this task is computationally intractable due to expensive model evaluations and large numbers of parameters. In this work, we investigate a new method for performing sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation of complex biological models using techniques from uncertainty quantification. The primary advance is a significant improvement in computational efficiency from the replacement of model simulation by evaluation of a polynomial surrogate model. We demonstrate the method on two models of mating in budding yeast: a smaller ODE model of the heterotrimeric G-protein cycle, and a larger spatial model of pheromone-induced cell polarization. A small number of model simulations are used to fit the polynomial surrogates, which are then used to calculate global parameter sensitivities. The surrogate models also allow rapid Bayesian inference of the parameters via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) by eliminating model simulations at each step. Application to the ODE model shows results consistent with published single-point estimates for the model and data, with the added benefit of calculating the correlations between pairs of parameters. On the larger PDE model, the surrogate models allowed convergence for the distribution of 15 parameters, which otherwise would have been computationally prohibitive using simulations at each MCMC step. We inferred parameter distributions that in certain cases peaked at values different from published values, and showed that a wide range of parameters would permit polarization in the model. Strikingly our results suggested different diffusion constants for active versus inactive Cdc42 to achieve good polarization, which is consistent with experimental observations in another yeast species &lt;i&gt;S. pombe&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sRhq-0CxzAI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Optimizing the learning rate for adaptive estimation of neural encoding models</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/AXBHSencE5U/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Han-Lin Hsieh, Maryam M. Shanechi&lt;/p&gt;

Closed-loop neurotechnologies often need to adaptively learn an encoding model that relates the neural activity to the brain state, and is used for brain state decoding. The speed and accuracy of adaptive learning algorithms are critically affected by the learning rate, which dictates how fast model parameters are updated based on new observations. Despite the importance of the learning rate, currently an analytical approach for its selection is largely lacking and existing signal processing methods vastly tune it empirically or heuristically. Here, we develop a novel analytical calibration algorithm for optimal selection of the learning rate in adaptive Bayesian filters. We formulate the problem through a fundamental trade-off that learning rate introduces between the steady-state error and the convergence time of the estimated model parameters. We derive explicit functions that predict the effect of learning rate on error and convergence time. Using these functions, our calibration algorithm can keep the steady-state parameter error covariance smaller than a desired upper-bound while minimizing the convergence time, or keep the convergence time faster than a desired value while minimizing the error. We derive the algorithm both for discrete-valued spikes modeled as point processes nonlinearly dependent on the brain state, and for continuous-valued neural recordings modeled as Gaussian processes linearly dependent on the brain state. Using extensive closed-loop simulations, we show that the analytical solution of the calibration algorithm accurately predicts the effect of learning rate on parameter error and convergence time. Moreover, the calibration algorithm allows for fast and accurate learning of the encoding model and for fast convergence of decoding to accurate performance. Finally, larger learning rates result in inaccurate encoding models and decoders, and smaller learning rates delay their convergence. The calibration algorithm provides a novel analytical approach to predictably achieve a desired level of error and convergence time in adaptive learning, with application to closed-loop neurotechnologies and other signal processing domains.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AXBHSencE5U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Benjamin Skerritt-Davis, Mounya Elhilali&lt;/p&gt;

Our ability to parse our acoustic environment relies on the brain’s capacity to extract statistical regularities from surrounding sounds. Previous work in regularity extraction has predominantly focused on the brain’s sensitivity to predictable patterns in sound sequences. However, natural sound environments are rarely completely predictable, often containing some level of randomness, yet the brain is able to effectively interpret its surroundings by extracting useful information from stochastic sounds. It has been previously shown that the brain is sensitive to the marginal lower-order statistics of sound sequences (i.e., mean and variance). In this work, we investigate the brain’s sensitivity to higher-order statistics describing temporal dependencies between sound events through a series of change detection experiments, where listeners are asked to detect changes in randomness in the pitch of tone sequences. Behavioral data indicate listeners collect statistical estimates to process incoming sounds, and a perceptual model based on Bayesian inference shows a capacity in the brain to track higher-order statistics. Further analysis of individual subjects’ behavior indicates an important role of perceptual constraints in listeners’ ability to track these sensory statistics with high fidelity. In addition, the inference model facilitates analysis of neural electroencephalography (EEG) responses, anchoring the analysis relative to the statistics of each stochastic stimulus. This reveals both a deviance response and a change-related disruption in phase of the stimulus-locked response that follow the higher-order statistics. These results shed light on the brain’s ability to process stochastic sound sequences.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ROlsYNEAxXQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The 3D organization of chromosomes is crucial for regulating gene expression and cell function. Many experimental and polymer modeling efforts are dedicated to deciphering the mechanistic principles behind chromosome folding. Chromosomes are long and densely packed—topologically constrained—polymers. The main challenges are therefore to develop adequate models and simulation methods to investigate properly the multi spatio-temporal scales of such macromolecules. Here, we develop a generic strategy to develop efficient coarse-grained models for self-avoiding polymers on a lattice. Accounting accurately for the polymer entanglement length and the volumic density, we show that our simulation scheme not only captures the steady-state structural and dynamical properties of the system but also tracks the same dynamics at different coarse-graining. This strategy allows a strong power-law gain in numerical efficiency and offers a systematic way to define reliable coarse-grained null models for chromosomes and to go beyond the current limitations by studying long chromosomes during an extended time period with good statistics. We use our formalism to investigate in details the time evolution of the 3D organization of chromosome 3R (20 Mbp) in drosophila during one cell cycle (20 hours). We show that a combination of our coarse-graining strategy with a one-parameter block copolymer model integrating epigenomic-driven interactions quantitatively reproduce experimental data at the chromosome-scale and predict that chromatin motion is very dynamic during the cell cycle.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YYb8ENLLah4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Structural organization and energy storage in crosslinked actin assemblies</title>

During clathrin-mediated endocytosis in yeast cells, short actin filaments (&amp;lt; 200nm) and crosslinking protein fimbrin assemble to drive the internalization of the plasma membrane. However, the organization of the actin meshwork during endocytosis remains largely unknown. In addition, only a small fraction of the force necessary to elongate and pinch off vesicles can be accounted for by actin polymerization alone. In this paper, we used mathematical modeling to study the self-organization of rigid actin filaments in the presence of elastic crosslinkers in conditions relevant to endocytosis. We found that actin filaments condense into either a disordered meshwork or an ordered bundle depending on filament length and the mechanical and kinetic properties of the crosslinkers. Our simulations also demonstrated that these nanometer-scale actin structures can store a large amount of elastic energy within the crosslinkers (up to 10&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; per crosslinker). This conversion of binding energy into elastic energy is the consequence of geometric constraints created by the helical pitch of the actin filaments, which results in frustrated configurations of crosslinkers attached to filaments. We propose that this stored elastic energy can be used at a later time in the endocytic process. As a proof of principle, we presented a simple mechanism for sustained torque production by ordered detachment of crosslinkers from a pair of parallel filaments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HugZ5m7-OgU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

In long-term potentiation (LTP), one of the most studied types of neural plasticity, synaptic strength is persistently increased in response to stimulation. Although a number of different proteins have been implicated in the sub-cellular molecular processes underlying induction and maintenance of LTP, the precise mechanisms remain unknown. A particular challenge is to demonstrate that a proposed molecular mechanism can provide the level of stability needed to maintain memories for months or longer, in spite of the fact that many of the participating molecules have much shorter life spans. Here we present a computational model that combines simulations of several biochemical reactions that have been suggested in the LTP literature and show that the resulting system does exhibit the required stability. At the core of the model are two interlinked feedback loops of molecular reactions, one involving the atypical protein kinase PKMζ and its messenger RNA, the other involving PKMζ and GluA2-containing AMPA receptors. We demonstrate that robust bistability–stable equilibria both in the synapse’s potentiated and unpotentiated states–can arise from a set of simple molecular reactions. The model is able to account for a wide range of empirical results, including induction and maintenance of late-phase LTP, cellular memory reconsolidation and the effects of different pharmaceutical interventions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0_PVuKNJRBs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Can a time varying external drive give rise to apparent criticality in neural systems?</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Viola Priesemann, Oren Shriki&lt;/p&gt;

The finding of power law scaling in neural recordings lends support to the hypothesis of critical brain dynamics. However, power laws are not unique to critical systems and can arise from alternative mechanisms. Here, we investigate whether a common time-varying external drive to a set of Poisson units can give rise to neuronal avalanches and exhibit apparent criticality. To this end, we analytically derive the avalanche size and duration distributions, as well as additional measures, first for homogeneous Poisson activity, and then for slowly varying inhomogeneous Poisson activity. We show that homogeneous Poisson activity cannot give rise to power law distributions. Inhomogeneous activity can also not generate perfect power laws, but it can exhibit approximate power laws with cutoffs that are comparable to those typically observed in experiments. The mechanism of generating apparent criticality by time-varying external fields, forces or input may generalize to many other systems like dynamics of swarms, diseases or extinction cascades. Here, we illustrate the analytically derived effects for spike recordings &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and discuss approaches to distinguish true from apparent criticality. Ultimately, this requires causal interventions, which allow separating internal system properties from externally imposed ones.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lb6BJ4HT6MU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/3/ENEURO.0130-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The brainstem pre-Bötzinger complex (preBötC) generates inspiratory breathing rhythms, but which neurons comprise its rhythmogenic core? Dbx1-derived neurons may play the preeminent role in rhythm generation, an idea well founded at perinatal stages of development but incompletely evaluated in adulthood. We expressed archaerhodopsin or channelrhodopsin in Dbx1 preBötC neurons in intact adult mice to interrogate their function. Prolonged photoinhibition slowed down or stopped breathing, whereas prolonged photostimulation sped up breathing. Brief inspiratory-phase photoinhibition evoked the next breath earlier than expected, whereas brief expiratory-phase photoinhibition delayed the subsequent breath. Conversely, brief inspiratory-phase photostimulation increased inspiratory duration and delayed the subsequent breath, whereas brief expiratory-phase photostimulation evoked the next breath earlier than expected. Because they govern the frequency and precise timing of breaths in awake adult mice with sensorimotor feedback intact, Dbx1 preBötC neurons constitute an essential core component of the inspiratory oscillator, knowledge directly relevant to human health and physiology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0398-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are neurodevelopmental disorders with a strong genetic aetiology. Since mutations in human &lt;i&gt;SHANK&lt;/i&gt; genes have been found in patients with autism, genetic mouse models are employed for a mechanistic understanding of ASDs and the development of therapeutic strategies. SHANKs are scaffold proteins in the postsynaptic density of mammalian excitatory synapses with proposed functions in synaptogenesis, regulation of dendritic spine morphology, and instruction of structural synaptic plasticity. In contrast to all studies so far on the function of SHANK proteins, we have previously observed enhanced synaptic plasticity in Shank2 ex7&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. In a series of experiments we now reproduce these results, further explore the synaptic phenotype, and directly compare our model to the independently generated Shank2 ex6-7&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Minimal stimulation experiments reveal that Shank2 ex7&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice possess an excessive fraction of silent (i.e. α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid, short, AMPA receptor lacking) synapses. The synaptic maturation deficit emerges during the third postnatal week and constitutes a plausible mechanistic explanation for the mutants' increased capacity for long-term potentiation (LTP), both &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. A direct comparison with Shank2 ex6-7&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice adds weight to the hypothesis that both models show a different set of synaptic phenotypes, possibly due to differences in their genetic background. These findings add to the diversity of synaptic phenotypes in neurodevelopmental disorders and further support the supposed existence of &quot;modifier genes&quot; in the expression and inheritance of ASDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have a global prevalence of 0.1–2%, a fraction of which is caused by mutations in human &lt;i&gt;SHANK&lt;/i&gt; genes. A number of Shank mouse models that reproduce behavioral symptoms also show reduced synaptic plasticity - which is why boosting plasticity has become one line of therapeutic rescue efforts. In contrast to all studies so far on the function of SHANK proteins, we observe enhanced plasticity in Shank2 ex7&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice and uncover a previously unrecognized synapse maturation deficit. This neurodevelopmental phenotype is shared among a number of mouse models for neurodevelopmental disorders, suggesting synapse maturation as a field of future studies and for the exploration of therapeutic intervention. The observation of distinct and non-congruent phenotypes in genetically similar yet non-identical mouse models adds weight to the hypothesis that genetic interactions of putative &quot;modifier genes&quot; might influence the phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Mammalian TRIM67 Functions in Brain Development and Behavior</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0186-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Class I members of the TRIM family of E3 ubiquitin ligases evolutionarily appeared just prior to the advent of neuronal like cells and have been implicated in neuronal development from invertebrates to mammals. The single class I TRIM in &lt;i&gt;D. melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; and the mammalian class I TRIM9 regulate axon branching and guidance in response to the guidance cue netrin, whereas mammalian TRIM46 establishes the axon initial segment. In humans, mutations in TRIM1 and TRIM18 are implicated in Opitz Syndrome, characterized by midline defects and often intellectual disability. We find that although TRIM67 is the least studied vertebrate class I TRIM, it is the most evolutionarily conserved. Here we show that mammalian TRIM67 interacts with both its closest paralog TRIM9 and the netrin receptor DCC and is differentially enriched in specific brain regions during development and adulthood. We describe the anatomical and behavioral consequences of deletion of murine &lt;i&gt;Trim67&lt;/i&gt;. While viable, mice lacking &lt;i&gt;Trim67&lt;/i&gt; exhibit abnormal anatomy of specific brain regions, including hypotrophy of the hippocampus, striatum, amygdala, and thalamus, and thinning of forebrain commissures. Additionally, &lt;i&gt;Trim67&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice display impairments in spatial memory, cognitive flexibility, social novelty preference, muscle function, and sensorimotor gating, whereas several other behaviors remain intact. This study demonstrates the necessity for TRIM67 in appropriate brain development and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Class I TRIM E3 ubiquitin ligases play important roles in neuronal development and function, some of which occur downstream of netrin. TRIM67 is the most evolutionarily conserved of this class and is developmentally regulated and brain-enriched. Deletion of murine &lt;i&gt;Trim67&lt;/i&gt; results in malformations of a subset of subcortical brain regions and of cortical and subcortical myelinated fiber tracts, as well as deficits in spatial memory, motor function, sociability and sensorimotor gating. Interactions between TRIM67 and both the netrin receptor DCC and TRIM9, and abnormalities in netrin-sensitive brain regions are noted. We conclude that TRIM67 is critical for appropriate brain development and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11081</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Control is essential to the functioning of any neural system. Indeed, under
healthy conditions the brain must be able to continuously maintain a tight
functional control between the system's inputs and outputs. One may therefore
hypothesise that the brain's wiring is predetermined by the need to maintain
control across multiple scales, maintaining the stability of key internal
variables, and producing behaviour in response to environmental cues. Recent
advances in network control have offered a powerful mathematical framework to
explore the structure-function relationship in complex biological, social, and
technological networks, and are beginning to yield important and precise
insights for neuronal systems. The network control paradigm promises a
predictive, quantitative framework to unite the distinct datasets necessary to
fully describe a nervous system, and provide mechanistic explanations for the
observed structure and function relationships. Here, we provide a thorough
review of the network control framework as applied to C. elegans, in the style
of a FAQ. We present the theoretical, computational, and experimental aspects
of network control, and discuss its current capabilities and limitations,
together with the next likely advances and improvements. We further present the
Python code to enable exploration of control principles in a manner specific to
this prototypical organism.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10981</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep Neural Networks have been applied very successfully in image recognition
and natural language processing. Recently these powerful methods have received
attention also in the brain-computer interface (BCI) community. Here, we
introduce a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture optimized for
classification of brain states from non-invasive magnetoencephalographic (MEG)
measurements. The model structure is motivated by a state-of-the-art generative
model of the MEG signal and is thus readily interpretable in neurophysiological
terms. We demonstrate that the proposed model is highly accurate in decoding
event-related responses as well as modulations of oscillatory brain activity,
and is robust with respect to inter-individual differences. Importantly, the
model generalizes well across users: when trained on data pooled from previous
users, it can successfully perform on new users. Thus, the time-consuming BCI
calibration can be omitted. Moreover, the model can be incrementally updated,
resulting in +8.9% average accuracy improvement in offline experiments and
+17.0% in a real-time BCI. We argue that this model can be used in practical
BCIs and basic neuroscience research.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10958</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Each training step for a variational autoencoder (VAE) requires us to sample
from the approximate posterior, so we usually choose simple (e.g. factorised)
approximate posteriors in which sampling is an efficient computation that fully
exploits GPU parallelism. However, such simple approximate posteriors are often
insufficient, as they eliminate statistical dependencies in the posterior.
While it is possible to use normalizing flow approximate posteriors for
continuous latents, some problems have discrete latents and strong statistical
dependencies. The most natural approach to model these dependencies is an
autoregressive distribution, but sampling from such distributions is inherently
sequential and thus slow. We develop a fast, parallel sampling procedure for
autoregressive distributions based on fixed-point iterations which enables
efficient and accurate variational inference in discrete state-space latent
variable dynamical systems. To optimize the variational bound, we considered
two ways to evaluate probabilities: inserting the relaxed samples directly into
the pmf for the discrete distribution, or converting to continuous logistic
latent variables and interpreting the K-step fixed-point iterations as a
normalizing flow. We found that converting to continuous latent variables gave
considerable additional scope for mismatch between the true and approximate
posteriors, which resulted in biased inferences, we thus used the former
approach. Using our fast sampling procedure, we were able to realize the
benefits of correlated posteriors, including accurate uncertainty estimates for
one cell, and accurate connectivity estimates for multiple cells, in an order
of magnitude less time.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Using spike train distances to identify the most discriminative neuronal subpopulation. (arXiv:1805.10892v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10892</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Spike trains of multiple neurons can be analyzed following the
summed population (SP) or the labeled line (LL) hypothesis. Responses to
external stimuli are generated by a neuronal population as a whole or the
individual neurons have encoding capacities of their own. The SPIKE-distance
estimated either for a single, pooled spike train over a population or for each
neuron separately can serve to quantify these responses.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Method: For the SP case we compare three algorithms that search for the
most discriminative subpopulation over all stimulus pairs. For the LL case we
introduce a new algorithm that combines neurons that individually separate
different pairs of stimuli best.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results: The best approach for SP is a brute force search over all possible
subpopulations. However, it is only feasible for small populations. For more
realistic settings, simulated annealing clearly outperforms gradient algorithms
with only a limited increase in computational load. Our novel LL approach can
handle very involved coding scenarios despite its computational ease.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparison with Existing Methods: Spike train distances have been extended to
the analysis of neural populations interpolating between SP and LL coding. This
includes parametrizing the importance of distinguishing spikes being fired in
different neurons. Yet, these approaches only consider the population as a
whole. The explicit focus on subpopulations render our algorithms
complimentary.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The spectrum of encoding possibilities in neural populations is
broad. The SP and LL cases are two extremes for which our algorithms provide
correct identification results.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A cornerstone of human statistical learning is the ability to extract
temporal regularities / patterns from random sequences. Here we present a
method of computing pattern time statistics with generating functions for
first-order Markov trials and independent Bernoulli trials. We show that the

existing studies of both human and machine learning of stochastic processes,
including probability of alternation, temporal correlation between pattern
events, and related variance / risk measures. Moreover, we show that recurrent

explanation for the sensitivity of the human brain to the rich statistics and
the latent structures in the learning environment.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10734</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;While deep neural networks take loose inspiration from neuroscience, it is an
open question how seriously to take the analogies between artificial deep
networks and biological neuronal systems. Interestingly, recent work has shown
that deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on large-scale image
recognition tasks can serve as strikingly good models for predicting the
responses of neurons in visual cortex to visual stimuli, suggesting that
analogies between artificial and biological neural networks may be more than
superficial. However, while CNNs capture key properties of the average
responses of cortical neurons, they fail to explain other properties of these
neurons. For one, CNNs typically require large quantities of labeled input data
for training. Our own brains, in contrast, rarely have access to this kind of
supervision, so to the extent that representations are similar between CNNs and
brains, this similarity must arise via different training paths. In addition,
neurons in visual cortex produce complex time-varying responses even to static
inputs, and they dynamically tune themselves to temporal regularities in the
visual environment. We argue that these differences are clues to fundamental
differences between the computations performed in the brain and in deep
networks. To begin to close the gap, here we study the emergent properties of a
previously-described recurrent generative network that is trained to predict
future video frames in a self-supervised manner. Remarkably, the model is able
to capture a wide variety of seemingly disparate phenomena observed in visual
cortex, ranging from single unit response dynamics to complex perceptual motion
illusions. These results suggest potentially deep connections between recurrent
predictive neural network models and the brain, providing new leads that can
enrich both fields.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Stochastic neural networks are a prototypical computational device able to
build a probabilistic representation of an ensemble of external stimuli.
Building on the relation between inference and learning, we derive a synaptic
plasticity rule that relies only on delayed activity correlations, and that
shows a number of remarkable features. Our &quot;delayed-correlations matching&quot;
(DCM) rule satisfies some basic requirements for biological feasibility: finite
and noisy afferent signals, Dale's principle and asymmetry of synaptic
connections, locality of the weight update computations. Nevertheless, the DCM
rule is capable of storing a large, extensive number of patterns as attractors
in a stochastic recurrent neural network, under general scenarios without
requiring any modification: it can deal with correlated patterns, a broad range
of architectures (with or without hidden neuronal states), one-shot learning
with the palimpsest property, all the while avoiding the proliferation of
spurious attractors. When hidden units are present, our learning rule can be
employed to construct Boltzman-Machine-like generative models, exploiting the
addition of hidden neurons in feature extraction and classification tasks.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02869</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Accurate statistical models of neural spike responses can characterize the
information carried by neural populations. Yet, challenges in recording at the
level of individual neurons commonly results in relatively limited samples of
spike counts, which can lead to model overfitting. Moreover, current models
assume spike counts to be Poisson-distributed, which ignores the fact that many
neurons demonstrate over-dispersed spiking behavior. The Negative Binomial
Generalized Linear Model (NB-GLM) provides a powerful tool for modeling
over-dispersed spike counts. However, maximum likelihood based standard NB-GLM
leads to unstable and inaccurate parameter estimations. Thus, we propose a
hierarchical parametric empirical Bayes method for estimating the parameters of
the NB-GLM. Our method integrates Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) and
empirical Bayes theory to: (1) effectively capture over-dispersion nature of
spike counts from retinal ganglion neural responses; (2) significantly reduce
mean square error of parameter estimations when compared to maximum likelihood
based method for NB-GLMs; (3) provide an efficient alternative to fully
Bayesian inference with low computational cost for hierarchical models; and (4)
give insightful findings on both neural interactions and spiking behaviors of
real retina cells. We apply our approach to study both simulated data and
experimental neural data from the retina. The simulation results indicate the
new framework can efficiently and accurately retrieve the weights of functional
connections among neural populations and predict mean spike counts. The results
from the retinal datasets demonstrate the proposed method outperforms both
standard Poisson and Negative Binomial GLMs in terms of the predictive
log-likelihood of held-out data.

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Across cultures and throughout history, human beings have reported a variety of spiritual experiences and the concomitant perceived sense of union that transcends one’s ordinary sense of self. Nevertheless, little is known about the underlying neural mechanisms of spiritual experiences, particularly when examined across different traditions and practices. By adapting an individualized guided-imagery task, we investigated neural correlates of personally meaningful spiritual experiences as compared with stressful and neutral-relaxing experiences. We observed in the spiritual condition, as compared with the neutral-relaxing condition, reduced activity in the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL), a result that suggests the IPL may contribute importantly to perceptual processing and self-other representations during spiritual experiences. Compared with stress cues, responses to spiritual cues showed reduced activity in the medial thalamus and caudate, regions associated with sensory and emotional processing. Overall, the study introduces a novel method for investigating brain correlates of personally meaningful spiritual experiences and suggests neural mechanisms associated with broadly defined and personally experienced spirituality.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0083-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Presurgical planning for brain tumor resection aims at delineating eloquent tissue in the vicinity of the lesion to spare during surgery. To this end, non-invasive neuroimaging techniques such as functional MRI and diffusion weighted imaging fiber tracking are currently employed. However, taking into account this information is often still insufficient, as the complex non-linear dynamics of the brain impede straightforward prediction of functional outcome after surgical intervention. Large-scale brain network modeling carries the potential to bridge this gap by integrating neuroimaging data with biophysically based models to predict collective brain dynamics. As a first step in this direction, an appropriate computational model has to be selected, after which suitable model parameter values have to be determined. To this end, we simulated large-scale brain dynamics in 25 human brain tumor patients and 11 human control participants using The Virtual Brain, an open-source neuroinformatics platform. Local and global model parameters of the Reduced Wong-Wang model were individually optimized and compared between brain tumor patients and control subjects. In addition, the relationship between model parameters and structural network topology and cognitive performance was assessed. Results showed (1) significantly improved prediction accuracy of individual functional connectivity when using individually optimized model parameters; (2) local model parameters can differentiate between regions directly affected by a tumor, regions distant from a tumor, and regions in a healthy brain; and (3) interesting associations between individually optimized model parameters and structural network topology and cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Individualized medicine is increasingly put forward as an important means to advance medical care. In this regard, the neuroinformatics platform &quot;The Virtual Brain&quot; holds great promise, given its direct focus on simulation of subject-specific brain activity. Reliable prediction of patient-specific large-scale brain dynamics would open up the possibility to virtually lesion structural connectomes, making computational models unique predictive tools to investigate the impact of diverse structural connectivity alterations on brain functioning, including those purposefully induced by surgery. Results of this study establish the basis for this purpose, by demonstrating individual specificity of biophysical model parameters, differences in local model parameters dependent on distance from a tumor, and associations between model parameters and structural network topology and cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Aging and an Immune Challenge Interact to Produce Prolonged, but Not Permanent Reductions in Hippocampal L-LTP and mBDNF in a Rodent Model with Features of Delirium</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0009-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Aging increases the risk of abrupt declines in cognitive function after an event that triggers immune system activation (e.g. surgery, infection, or injury). This phenomenon is poorly understood, but rodent models may provide clues. We have previously shown that aging (24-month-old) F344xBN rats generally don’t show significant physical or cognitive impairments. However, their brains mount an exaggerated inflammatory response to signals triggered by a peripheral immune challenge (an intraperitoneal injection of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; or laparotomy). Their hippocampal levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β are significantly elevated for at least 8, but generally less than 14 days after infection or surgery. This IL-1β elevation is mirrored by prolonged deficits in a hippocampus-dependent long-term memory task. In contrast, young (3-month-old) counterparts exhibit only transient elevations in IL-1β that drop to near baseline levels within 24 hours. We previously demonstrated that theta burst-evoked late-phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP) – a BDNF-dependent form of synaptic plasticity – is impaired in hippocampal area CA1 of aged animals 4 days after infection. Also, levels of mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor (mBDNF) – the protein isoform required for stabilization of L-LTP – are reduced in hippocampal synaptoneurosomes of aged animals at the same time point. In this study, we investigated whether the deficits in L-LTP and mBDNF persist in parallel with the elevation in IL-1β and impairment in memory. This was the case, consistent with the idea that an exaggerated brain inflammatory response may compromise memory consolidation in part by altering availability of mBDNF to stabilize memory-related synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Not all cognitive decline is gradual. Older individuals – even those previously healthy and high functioning – are more likely to experience an abrupt decline in mental function (termed delirium) after immune challenge. Even if this is temporary, it is associated with increased risk of ultimately developing dementia. Although clinically important, this phenomenon is much less studied than gradual senescence and aging-associated neurodegenerative disorders. Here we use a naturalistic rodent model to further test the hypothesis that the combination of age and an immune challenge may trigger an exaggerated inflammatory state in the brain, which in turn, disrupts molecular systems critical for memory. These studies may provide mechanistic insights into the earliest stages of inflammation-driven failures of memory-related synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10235</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chronic and acute implants of multi-electrode arrays that cover several
mm$^2$ of neural tissue provide simultaneous access to population signals like
extracellular potentials and the spiking activity of 100 or more individual
neurons. While the recorded data may uncover principles of brain function, its
interpretation calls for multiscale computational models with corresponding
spatial dimensions and signal predictions. Such models can facilitate the
search of mechanisms underlying observed spatiotemporal activity patterns in
cortex. Multi-layer spiking neuron network models of local cortical circuits
covering ~1 mm$^2$ have been developed, integrating experimentally obtained
neuron-type specific connectivity data and reproducing features of in-vivo
spiking statistics. With forward models, local field potentials (LFPs) can be
computed from the simulated spiking activity. To account for the spatial scale
of common neural recordings, we extend a local network and LFP model to 4x4
mm$^2$. The upscaling preserves the neuron densities, and introduces
distance-dependent connection probabilities and delays. As detailed
experimental connectivity data is partially lacking, we address this
uncertainty in model parameters by testing parameter combinations within
biologically plausible bounds. Based on model predictions of spiking activity
and LFPs, we find that the upscaling procedure preserves the overall spiking
statistics of the original model and reproduces asynchronous irregular spiking
across populations and weak pairwise spike-train correlations observed in
sensory cortex. In contrast with the weak spike-train correlations, the
correlation of LFP signals is strong and distance-dependent, compatible with
experimental observations. Enhanced spatial coherence in the low-gamma band may
explain the recent experimental report of an apparent band-pass filter effect
in the spatial reach of the LFP.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10116</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Consolidation of synaptic changes in response to neural activity is thought
to be fundamental for memory maintenance over a timescale of hours. In
experiments, synaptic consolidation can be induced by repeatedly stimulating
presynaptic neurons. However, the effectiveness of such protocols depends
crucially on the repetition frequency of the stimulations and the mechanisms
that cause this complex dependence are unknown. Here we propose a simple
mathematical model that allows us to systematically study the interaction
between the stimulation protocol and synaptic consolidation. We show the
existence of optimal stimulation protocols for our model and, similarly to LTP
experiments, the repetition frequency of the stimulation plays a crucial role
in achieving consolidation. Our results show that the complex dependence of LTP
on the stimulation frequency emerges naturally from a model which satisfies
only minimal bistability requirements.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09999</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests that disruptions of the posteromedial cortex (PMC) and
posteromedial corticothalamic connectivity contribute to disorders of
consciousness (DOCs). While most previous studies treated the PMC as a whole,
this structure is functionally heterogeneous. The present study investigated
whether particular subdivisions of the PMC are specifically associated with
DOCs. Participants were DOC patients, 21 vegetative state/unresponsive
wakefulness syndrome (VS/UWS), 12 minimally conscious state (MCS), and 29
healthy controls. Individual PMC and thalamus were divided into distinct
subdivisions by their fiber tractograpy to each other and default mode regions,
and white matter integrity and brain activity between/within subdivisions were
assessed. The thalamus was represented mainly in the dorsal and posterior
portions of the PMC, and the white matter tracts connecting these subdivisions
to the thalamus had less integrity in VS/UWS patients than in MCS patients and
healthy controls, as well as in patients who did not recover after 12 months
than in patients who did. The structural substrates were validated by finding
impaired functional fluctuations within this PMC subdivision. This study is the
first to show that tracts from dorsal and posterior subdivisions of the PMC to
the thalamus contribute to DOCs.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09874</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many real-world data sets, especially in biology, are produced by highly
multivariate and nonlinear complex dynamical systems. In this paper, we focus
on brain imaging data, including both calcium imaging and functional MRI data.
Standard vector-autoregressive models are limited by their linearity
assumptions, while nonlinear general-purpose, large-scale temporal models, such
as LSTM networks, typically require large amounts of training data, not always
readily available in biological applications; furthermore, such models have
limited interpretability. We introduce here a novel approach for learning a
nonlinear differential equation model aimed at capturing brain dynamics.
Specifically, we propose a variable-projection optimization approach to
estimate the parameters of the multivariate (coupled) van der Pol oscillator,
and demonstrate that such a model can accurately represent nonlinear dynamics
of the brain data. Furthermore, in order to improve the predictive accuracy
when forecasting future brain-activity time series, we use this analytical
model as an unlimited source of simulated data for pretraining LSTM; such
model-specific data augmentation approach consistently improves LSTM
performance on both calcium and fMRI imaging data.

	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Action and perception are tightly coupled systems requiring coordination and synchronization over time. How the brain achieves synchronization is still a matter of debate, but recent experiments suggest that brain oscillations may play an important role in this process. Brain oscillations have been also proposed to be fundamental in determining time perception. Here, we had subjects perform an audiovisual temporal order judgment task to investigate the fine dynamics of temporal bias and sensitivity before and after the execution of voluntary hand movement (button-press). The reported order of the audiovisual sequence was rhythmically biased as a function of delay from hand action execution. Importantly, we found that it oscillated at a theta range frequency, starting ~500 ms before and persisting ~250 ms after the button-press, with consistent phase-locking across participants. Our results show that the perception of cross-sensory simultaneity oscillates rhythmically in synchrony with the programming phase of a voluntary action, demonstrating a link between action preparation and bias in temporal perceptual judgments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Serotonin Selectively Increases Detectability of Motion Stimuli in the Electrosensory System</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/3/ENEURO.0013-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Serotonergic innervation of sensory areas is found ubiquitously across the central nervous system of vertebrates. Here, we used a system’s level approach to investigate the role of serotonin on processing motion stimuli in the electrosensory system of the weakly electric fish &lt;i&gt;Apteronotus albifrons&lt;/i&gt;. We found that exogenous serotonin application increased the firing activity of pyramidal neural responses to both looming and receding motion. Separating spikes belonging to bursts from those that were isolated revealed that this effect was primarily due to increased burst firing. Moreover, when investigating whether firing activity during stimulation could be discriminated from baseline (i.e., in the absence of stimulation), we found that serotonin increased stimulus discriminability only for some stimuli. This is because increased burst firing was most prominent for these. Further, the effects of serotonin were highly heterogeneous, with some neurons displaying large while others instead displaying minimal changes in responsiveness following serotonin application. Further analysis revealed that serotonin application had the greatest effect on neurons with low baseline firing rates and little to no effect on neurons with high baseline firing rates. Finally, the effects of serotonin on sensory neuron responses were largely independent of object velocity. Our results therefore reveal a novel function for the serotonergic system in selectively enhancing discriminability for motion stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

To explore the neuroanatomical correlates of advanced PA/MA, the current study conducted brain morphometric analyses in 39 high-functioning adult males with ASD and 39 age-, intellectual level-, and parental socioeconomic background-matched, typically developed (TD) males. Whole-brain analysis revealed that the regional gray matter volume (GMV) in bilateral posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and precuneus (PCU) were significantly smaller in the individuals with ASD than in TD subjects (false discovery rate-corrected &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; = 0.014). Additional analyses of the constituents of GMV reduction in these brain regions revealed that the cortical thickness of the right ventral PCC was significantly thinner (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; = 0.014) and the surface area of bilateral PCU was significantly smaller (left: &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; = 0.001; right: &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; = 0.049) in the adults with ASD, compared with TD subjects. Although the analyses were exploratory, the thinner cortical thickness of right ventral PCC was significantly correlated with older PA in the ASD individuals (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; = 0.028). The current findings shed new light on the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the link between advanced PA and ASD.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Recent years have seen a flourishing literature on detection of circulating autoantibodies against neurotransmitter receptors in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. These studies have generated hope for a better understanding of the underlying molecular dysfunctions and for appropriate therapeutic strategies. However, the detection of these autoantibodies in healthy subjects, and the lack of mechanistic insights have fostered debate about the pathogenic role of such autoantibodies. Here, we specifically discuss the biological evidence linking autoantibodies directed against the glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR-Abs) and psychosis, emphasising recent single-molecule imaging investigations that unveiled the impaired surface trafficking of NMDAR in the presence of NMDAR-Abs from psychotic patients.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Variability in pulmonary vein electrophysiology and fibrosis determines arrhythmia susceptibility and dynamics</title>

Success rates for catheter ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation patients are currently low; however, there is a subset of patients for whom electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins alone is a successful treatment strategy. It is difficult to identify these patients because there are a multitude of factors affecting arrhythmia susceptibility and maintenance, and the individual contributions of these factors are difficult to determine clinically. We hypothesised that the combination of pulmonary vein (PV) electrophysiology and atrial body fibrosis determine driver location and effectiveness of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). We used bilayer biatrial computer models based on patient geometries to investigate the effects of PV properties and atrial fibrosis on arrhythmia inducibility, maintenance mechanisms, and the outcome of PVI. Short PV action potential duration (APD) increased arrhythmia susceptibility, while longer PV APD was found to be protective. Arrhythmia inducibility increased with slower conduction velocity (CV) at the LA/PV junction, but not for cases with homogeneous CV changes or slower CV at the distal PV. Phase singularity (PS) density in the PV region for cases with PV fibrosis was increased. Arrhythmia dynamics depend on both PV properties and fibrosis distribution, varying from meandering rotors to PV reentry (in cases with baseline or long APD), to stable rotors at regions of high fibrosis density. Measurement of fibrosis and PV properties may indicate patient specific susceptibility to AF initiation and maintenance. PV PS density before PVI was higher for cases in which AF terminated or converted to a macroreentry; thus, high PV PS density may indicate likelihood of PVI success.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rn0Tfj7bu6A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Brain stimulation can modulate the activity of neural circuits impaired by Alzheimer’s disease (AD), having promising clinical benefit. However, all individuals with the same condition currently receive identical brain stimulation, with limited theoretical basis for this generic approach. In this study, we introduce a control theory framework for obtaining exogenous signals that revert pathological electroencephalographic activity in AD at a minimal energetic cost, while reflecting patients’ biological variability. We used anatomical networks obtained from diffusion magnetic resonance images acquired by the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) as mediators for the interaction between Duffing oscillators. The nonlinear nature of the brain dynamics is preserved, given that we extend the so-called state-dependent Riccati equation control to reflect the stimulation objective in the high-dimensional neural system. By considering nonlinearities in our model, we identified regions for which control inputs fail to correct abnormal activity. There are changes to the way stimulated regions are ranked in terms of the energetic cost of controlling the entire network, from a linear to a nonlinear approach. We also found that limbic system and basal ganglia structures constitute the top target locations for stimulation in AD. Patients with highly integrated anatomical networks–namely, networks having low average shortest path length, high global efficiency–are the most suitable candidates for the propagation of stimuli and consequent success on the control task. Other diseases associated with alterations in brain dynamics and the self-control mechanisms of the brain can be addressed through our framework.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/O4eVK9xR6I0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Many tumors are characterized by genetic instability, producing an assortment of genetic variants of tumor cells called subclones. These tumors and their surrounding environments form complex multi-cellular ecosystems, where subclones compete for resources and cooperate to perform multiple tasks, including cancer invasion. Our recent empirical studies revealed existence of such distinct phenotypes of cancer cells, leaders and followers, in lung cancer. These two cellular subclones exchange a complex array of extracellular signals demonstrating a symbiotic relationship at the cellular level. Here, we develop a computational model of the microenvironment of the lung cancer ecosystem to explore how the interactions between subclones can advance or inhibit invasion. We found that, due to the complexity of the ecosystem, invasion may have very different dynamics characterized by the different levels of aggressiveness. By altering the signaling environment, we could alter the ecological relationship between the cell types and the overall ecosystem development. Competition between leader and follower cell populations (defined by the limited amount of resources), positive feedback within the leader cell population (controlled by the focal adhesion kinase and fibronectin signaling), and impact of the follower cells to the leaders (represented by yet undetermined proliferation signal) all had major effects on the outcome of the collective dynamics. Specifically, our analysis revealed a class of tumors (defined by the strengths of fibronectin signaling and competition) that are particularly sensitive to manipulations of the signaling environment. This class can undergo irreversible changes to the tumor ecosystem that outlast these manipulations of feedbacks and have a profound impact on invasive potential. Our study predicts a complex division of labor between cancer cell subclones and suggests new treatment strategies targeting signaling within the tumor ecosystem.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cZu0gxkmVxM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

In mice, comprehensive tracing studies that reveal the long-range connectivity of the nonlemniscal auditory thalamus are lacking. To this end, we used Cre-inducible anterograde and monosynaptic retrograde viruses in Calbindin-2A-dgCre-D and Calretinin-IRES-Cre mice, focusing on the differences across subdivisions of the nonlemniscal auditory thalamus. We found that, 1) the dorsal and medial parts of the auditory thalamus were predominantly connected to sensory processing centers, whereas the posterior intralaminar (PIN) and peripeduncular nucleus (PP) were additionally connected to emotion and motivation modulation centers; 2) ventral auditory cortical areas were the major source of cortical inputs for all subdivisions, and the PIN/PP received more inputs from cortical layer 5 than other subdivisions did; 3) deep layers of the superior colliculus and rostral part of the nonlemniscal inferior colliculus preferentially projected to the PIN/PP; and 4) compared with the dorsal auditory thalamus, the PIN/PP mainly innervated association cortices. In addition, new brain areas connected to the nonlemniscal auditory thalamus, mostly the PIN/PP, were identified. Our results suggested subdivision-specific function of the nonlemniscal auditory thalamus in sound processing.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Logistical constraints lead to an intermediate optimum in outbreak response vaccination</title>

Dynamic models in disease ecology have historically evaluated vaccination strategies under the assumption that they are implemented homogeneously in space and time. However, this approach fails to formally account for operational and logistical constraints inherent in the distribution of vaccination to the population at risk. Thus, feedback between the dynamic processes of vaccine distribution and transmission might be overlooked. Here, we present a spatially explicit, stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Vaccinated model that highlights the density-dependence and spatial constraints of various diffusive strategies of vaccination during an outbreak. The model integrates an agent-based process of disease spread with a partial differential process of vaccination deployment. We characterize the vaccination response in terms of a diffusion rate that describes the distribution of vaccination to the population at risk from a central location. This generates an explicit trade-off between slow diffusion, which concentrates effort near the central location, and fast diffusion, which spreads a fixed vaccination effort thinly over a large area. We use stochastic simulation to identify the optimum vaccination diffusion rate as a function of population density, interaction scale, transmissibility, and vaccine intensity. Our results show that, conditional on a timely response, the optimal strategy for minimizing outbreak size is to distribute vaccination resource at an intermediate rate: fast enough to outpace the epidemic, but slow enough to achieve local herd immunity. If the response is delayed, however, the optimal strategy for minimizing outbreak size changes to a rapidly diffusive distribution of vaccination effort. The latter may also result in significantly larger outbreaks, thus suggesting a benefit of allocating resources to timely outbreak detection and response.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0yJKQdlBIFk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/oV3GF0mvv-g/article</link>

Genome-scale metabolic models have become the tool of choice for the global analysis of microorganism metabolism, and their reconstruction has attained high standards of quality and reliability. Improvements in this area have been accompanied by the development of some major platforms and databases, and an explosion of individual bioinformatics methods. Consequently, many recent models result from “à la carte” pipelines, combining the use of platforms, individual tools and biological expertise to enhance the quality of the reconstruction. Although very useful, introducing heterogeneous tools, that hardly interact with each other, causes loss of traceability and reproducibility in the reconstruction process. This represents a real obstacle, especially when considering less studied species whose metabolic reconstruction can greatly benefit from the comparison to good quality models of related organisms. This work proposes an adaptable workspace, AuReMe, for sustainable reconstructions or improvements of genome-scale metabolic models involving personalized pipelines. At each step, relevant information related to the modifications brought to the model by a method is stored. This ensures that the process is reproducible and documented regardless of the combination of tools used. Additionally, the workspace establishes a way to browse metabolic models and their metadata through the automatic generation of ad-hoc local wikis dedicated to monitoring and facilitating the process of reconstruction. AuReMe supports exploration and semantic query based on RDF databases. We illustrate how this workspace allowed handling, in an integrated way, the metabolic reconstructions of non-model organisms such as an extremophile bacterium or eukaryote algae. Among relevant applications, the latter reconstruction led to putative evolutionary insights of a metabolic pathway.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oV3GF0mvv-g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Canonical Notch Signaling Directs the Fate of Differentiating Neurocompetent Progenitors in the Mammalian Olfactory Epithelium</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/21/5022?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The adult olfactory epithelium (OE) has the remarkable capacity to regenerate fully both neurosensory and non-neuronal cell types after severe epithelial injury. Lifelong persistence of two stem cell populations supports OE regeneration when damaged: the horizontal basal cells (HBCs), dormant and held in reserve; and globose basal cells, a heterogeneous population most of which are actively dividing. Both populations regenerate all cell types of the OE after injury, but the mechanisms underlying neuronal versus non-neuronal lineage commitment after recruitment of the stem cell pools remains unknown. We used both retroviral transduction and mouse lines that permit conditional cell-specific genetic manipulation as well as the tracing of progeny to study the role of canonical &lt;i&gt;Notch&lt;/i&gt; signaling in the determination of neuronal versus non-neuronal lineages in the regenerating adult OE. Excision of either &lt;i&gt;Notch1&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Notch2&lt;/i&gt; genes alone in HBCs did not alter progenitor fate during recovery from epithelial injury, whereas conditional knock-out of both &lt;i&gt;Notch1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Notch2&lt;/i&gt; together, retroviral transduction of progenitors with a dominant-negative form of &lt;i&gt;MAML&lt;/i&gt; (mastermind-like), or excision of the downstream cofactor &lt;i&gt;RBPJ&lt;/i&gt; caused progeny to adopt a neuronal fate exclusively. Conversely, we show that overexpressing the Notch1-intracellular domain (N1ICD) either genetically or by transduction blocks neuronal differentiation completely. However, N1ICD overexpression requires both alleles of the canonical cofactor RBPJ to specify downstream lineage. Together, our results suggest that canonical RBPJ-dependent &lt;i&gt;Notch&lt;/i&gt; signaling through redundant Notch1 and Notch2 receptors is both necessary and sufficient for determining neuronal versus non-neuronal differentiation in the regenerating adult OE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Despite the substantial reconstitution of the olfactory epithelium and its population of sensory neurons after injury, disruption and exhaustion of neurogenesis is a consequence of aging and a cause of olfactory dysfunction. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the generation of replacement neurons and non-neuronal cells is critical to any therapeutic strategy aimed at rebuilding a functional neuroepithelium. The results shown here demonstrate that canonical &lt;i&gt;Notch&lt;/i&gt; signaling determines the balance between neurons and non-neuronal cells during restoration of the epithelium after injury. Moreover, the complexities of the multiple Notch pathways impinging on that decision are dissected in detail. Finally, RBPJ, the canonical Notch transcriptional cofactor, exhibits a heretofore unreported haploinsufficiency in setting the balance among the regenerating populations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Neural Correlates of Hierarchical Predictions for Perceptual Decisions</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/21/5008?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sensory information is inherently noisy, sparse, and ambiguous. In contrast, visual experience is usually clear, detailed, and stable. Bayesian theories of perception resolve this discrepancy by assuming that prior knowledge about the causes underlying sensory stimulation actively shapes perceptual decisions. The CNS is believed to entertain a generative model aligned to dynamic changes in the hierarchical states of our volatile sensory environment. Here, we used model-based fMRI to study the neural correlates of the dynamic updating of hierarchically structured predictions in male and female human observers. We devised a crossmodal associative learning task with covertly interspersed ambiguous trials in which participants engaged in hierarchical learning based on changing contingencies between auditory cues and visual targets. By inverting a Bayesian model of perceptual inference, we estimated individual hierarchical predictions, which significantly biased perceptual decisions under ambiguity. Although &quot;high-level&quot; predictions about the cue–target contingency correlated with activity in supramodal regions such as orbitofrontal cortex and hippocampus, dynamic &quot;low-level&quot; predictions about the conditional target probabilities were associated with activity in retinotopic visual cortex. Our results suggest that our CNS updates distinct representations of hierarchical predictions that continuously affect perceptual decisions in a dynamically changing environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Bayesian theories posit that our brain entertains a generative model to provide hierarchical predictions regarding the causes of sensory information. Here, we use behavioral modeling and fMRI to study the neural underpinnings of such hierarchical predictions. We show that &quot;high-level&quot; predictions about the strength of dynamic cue–target contingencies during crossmodal associative learning correlate with activity in orbitofrontal cortex and the hippocampus, whereas &quot;low-level&quot; conditional target probabilities were reflected in retinotopic visual cortex. Our findings empirically corroborate theorizations on the role of hierarchical predictions in visual perception and contribute substantially to a longstanding debate on the link between sensory predictions and orbitofrontal or hippocampal activity. Our work fundamentally advances the mechanistic understanding of perceptual inference in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The effect of prematurity on early cortical network function has, however, remained poorly understood. Here, we developed a novel methodology that allows reliable assessment of functional connectivity in neonatal brain activity at millisecond and multisecond scales in terms of cortical phase and amplitude correlations, respectively. We measured scalp electroencephalography at term-equivalent age in infants exposed to very early prematurity as well as in healthy controls. We found that newborn cortical activity organizes into multiplex networks that differ significantly between vigilance states. As compared with healthy control infants, prematurity was found to cause frequency-specific patterns of dysconnectivity in cortical network, changes that were distinct for networks of phase and amplitude correlations. Neuroanatomically, the most prominent markers of prematurity were found in connections involving the frontal regions. Phase synchrony in frontally connected networks was correlated with newborn neurological performance, suggesting the first measure of cortical functional coupling that correlates with neurological performance in human infant.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Uncovering Neuronal Networks Defined by Consistent Between-Neuron Spike Timing from Neuronal Spike Recordings</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/3/ENEURO.0379-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;It is widely assumed that distributed neuronal networks are fundamental to the functioning of the brain. Consistent spike timing between neurons is thought to be one of the key principles for the formation of these networks. This can involve synchronous spiking or spiking with time delays, forming spike sequences when the order of spiking is consistent. Finding networks defined by their sequence of time-shifted spikes, denoted here as spike timing networks, is a tremendous challenge. As neurons can participate in multiple spike sequences at multiple between-spike time delays, the possible complexity of networks is prohibitively large. We present a novel approach that is capable of (1) extracting spike timing networks regardless of their sequence complexity, and (2) that describes their spiking sequences with high temporal precision. We achieve this by decomposing frequency-transformed neuronal spiking into separate networks, characterizing each network’s spike sequence by a time delay per neuron, forming a spike sequence timeline. These networks provide a detailed template for an investigation of the experimental relevance of their spike sequences. Using simulated spike timing networks, we show network extraction is robust to spiking noise, spike timing jitter, and partial occurrences of the involved spike sequences. Using rat multineuron recordings, we demonstrate the approach is capable of revealing real spike timing networks with sub-millisecond temporal precision. By uncovering spike timing networks, the prevalence, structure, and function of complex spike sequences can be investigated in greater detail, allowing us to gain a better understanding of their role in neuronal functioning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: RNA from Trained Aplysia Can Induce an Epigenetic Engram for Long-Term Sensitization in Untrained Aplysia</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/3/ENEURO.0038-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The precise nature of the engram, the physical substrate of memory, remains uncertain. Here, it is reported that RNA extracted from the central nervous system of &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt; given long-term sensitization (LTS) training induced sensitization when injected into untrained animals; furthermore, the RNA-induced sensitization, like training-induced sensitization, required DNA methylation. In cellular experiments, treatment with RNA extracted from trained animals was found to increase excitability in sensory neurons, but not in motor neurons, dissociated from naïve animals. Thus, the behavioral, and a subset of the cellular, modifications characteristic of a form of nonassociative long-term memory (LTM) in &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt; can be transferred by RNA. These results indicate that RNA is sufficient to generate an engram for LTS in &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt; and are consistent with the hypothesis that RNA-induced epigenetic changes underlie memory storage in &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: dSTIM and Ral/Exocyst Mediated Synaptic Release from Pupal Dopaminergic Neurons Sustains Drosophila Flight</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0455-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Manifestation of appropriate behaviour in adult animals requires developmental mechanisms that help in the formation of correctly wired neural circuits. Flight circuit development in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; requires Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) through the STIM/Orai pathway. SOCE-associated flight deficits in adult &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; derive extensively from regulation of gene expression in pupal neurons, and one such SOCE-regulated gene encodes the small GTPase &lt;i&gt;Ral&lt;/i&gt;. The cellular mechanism by which Ral helps in maturation of the flight circuit was not understood. Here, we show that knockdown of components of a Ral effector, the exocyst complex, in pupal neurons also leads to reduced flight bout durations, and this phenotype derives primarily from dopaminergic neurons. Importantly, synaptic release from pupal dopaminergic neurons is abrogated upon knockdown of either dSTIM, Ral or exocyst components. &lt;i&gt;Ral&lt;/i&gt; overexpression restores the diminished synaptic release of &lt;i&gt;dStim&lt;/i&gt; knockdown neurons as well as flight deficits associated with &lt;i&gt;dSTIM&lt;/i&gt; knockdown in dopaminergic neurons. These results identify Ral mediated vesicular release as an effector mechanism of neuronal SOCE in pupal dopaminergic neurons with functional consequences on flight behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Appropriate wiring of neuronal circuits during development is essential for adult behavior and cellular mechanisms such as calcium signaling orchestrate the pattern and strength of such neuronal connections to a significant extent. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, flight behavior impacts multiple aspects of life. Calcium, especially through the Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) pathway, regulates gene expression during flight circuit maturation. &lt;i&gt;Ral,&lt;/i&gt; encodes a small GTPase, and is one such SOCE-regulated gene required for &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; flight. In this paper, we show that SOCE-related loss of flight is determined to a significant extent by Ral and the exocyst complex driven synaptic vesicle release in pupal dopaminergic neurons. Thus, SOCE regulated release of dopamine ensures correct wiring of the flight circuit in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Dynamic Interactions between Emotion Perception, Action Perception, and Action Preparation Areas for Reacting to Social Threat: A Combined cTBS-fMRI Study</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0408-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Expressions of emotion are powerful triggers for situation-appropriate responses by the observer. Of particular interest regarding the preparation of such adaptive actions are parietal and premotor cortices, given their connectivity with the amygdala (AMG), known to play a crucial role in processing of affective information and in motor response. We set out to disentangle the respective roles of the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and ventral premotor cortex (PMv) in humans in the processing of emotional body expressions by assessing remote effects of continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) in the action network and in AMG. Participants were presented with blocks of short videos showing either angry or neutral whole body actions. The experiment consisted of three fMRI sessions; two preceded by stimulation of either right IPL or PMv, and a third session assessed baseline activity. Interestingly, whereas at baseline the lAMG did not differentiate between neutral and angry body postures, a significant difference between these conditions emerged after stimulation of either rIPL or rPMv, with much larger responses to angry than neutral stimuli. In addition, effects of cTBS stimulation and emotion were also observed in two other action relevant areas, the supplementary motor area and the superior parietal cortex. Together, these results show how areas involved in action and emotion perception and in action preparation interact dynamically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; When confronted with social threat, the brain must prepare situation-adaptive responses. Previous studies have shown that IPL and PMv are critically involved in social threat perception and that amygdala is triggered by emotional valence of the stimuli. So far, the causal relation between IPL, PMv and amygdala is not clear. By combining cTBS with fMRI, we show that stimulation of IPL and PMv induces significant differences between perception of angry versus neutral bodies in amygdala. Furthermore, stimulation of these areas led to significant interaction effects between the emotion presented and site stimulated in a number of remote parietal and motor areas. Our findings demonstrate involvement of IPL and PMv in emotion body processing, and interaction between these areas and with the amygdala during this process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Amygdala Corticofugal Input Shapes Mitral Cell Responses in the Accessory Olfactory Bulb</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0175-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Interconnections between the olfactory bulb and the amygdala are a major pathway for triggering strong behavioral responses to a variety of odorants. However, while this broad mapping has been established, the patterns of amygdala feedback connectivity and the influence on olfactory circuitry remain unknown. Here, using a combination of neuronal tracing approaches, we dissect the connectivity of a cortical amygdala (PmCo) feedback circuit innervating the mouse accessory olfactory bulb (AOB). Optogenetic activation of PmCo feedback mainly results in feed-forward mitral cell (MC) inhibition through direct excitation of GABAergic granule cells (GC). In addition, LED-driven activity of corticofugal afferents increases the gain of MC responses to olfactory nerve stimulation. Thus, through corticofugal pathways, the PmCo likely regulates primary olfactory and social odor processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Olfactory inputs are relayed directly through the amygdala to hypothalamic and limbic system nuclei regulating essential responses in the context of social behavior. However, it is not clear whether and how amygdala circuits participate in the earlier steps of olfactory processing at the level of the olfactory bulb. Unraveling the organization of this circuitry is critical to understand the function of amygdala circuits. Combining cre-dependent viral tracing with optogenetic-assisted patch clamp electrophysiology, the present work maps the synaptic connectivity and physiology of a cortical amygdala pathway innervating primary olfactory circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Polymorphic sites preferentially avoid co-evolving residues in MHC class I proteins</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/5R4fGWtz6gQ/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Linda Dib, Nicolas Salamin, David Gfeller&lt;/p&gt;

Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules are critical to adaptive immune defence mechanisms in vertebrate species and are encoded by highly polymorphic genes. Polymorphic sites are located close to the ligand-binding groove and entail MHC-I alleles with distinct binding specificities. Some efforts have been made to investigate the relationship between polymorphism and protein stability. However, less is known about the relationship between polymorphism and MHC-I co-evolutionary constraints. Using Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) we found that co-evolution analysis accurately pinpoints structural contacts, although the protein family is restricted to vertebrates and comprises less than five hundred species, and that the co-evolutionary signal is mainly driven by inter-species changes, and not intra-species polymorphism. Moreover, we show that polymorphic sites in human preferentially avoid co-evolving residues, as well as residues involved in protein stability. These results suggest that sites displaying high polymorphism may have been selected during vertebrates’ evolution to avoid co-evolutionary constraints and thereby maximize their mutability.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5R4fGWtz6gQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Implications for human odor sensing revealed from the statistics of odorant-receptor interactions</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/bABG40KQDFw/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Ji Hyun Bak, Seogjoo J. Jang, Changbong Hyeon&lt;/p&gt;

Binding of odorants to olfactory receptors (ORs) elicits downstream chemical and neural signals, which are further processed to odor perception in the brain. Recently, Mainland and colleagues have measured more than 500 pairs of odorant-OR interaction by a high-throughput screening assay method, opening a new avenue to understanding the principles of human odor coding. Here, using a recently developed minimal model for OR activation kinetics, we characterize the statistics of OR activation by odorants in terms of three empirical parameters: the half-maximum effective concentration EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, the efficacy, and the basal activity. While the data size of odorants is still limited, the statistics offer meaningful information on the breadth and optimality of the tuning of human ORs to odorants, and allow us to relate the three parameters with the microscopic rate constants and binding affinities that define the OR activation kinetics. Despite the stochastic nature of the response expected at individual OR-odorant level, we assess that the confluence of signals in a neuron released from the multitude of ORs is effectively free of noise and deterministic with respect to changes in odorant concentration. Thus, setting a threshold to the fraction of activated OR copy number for neural spiking binarizes the electrophysiological signal of olfactory sensory neuron, thereby making an information theoretic approach a viable tool in studying the principles of odor perception.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bABG40KQDFw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Intrinsic Functional Connectivity Resembles Cortical Architecture at Various Levels of Isoflurane Anesthesia</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy114/4999310?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Cortical single neuron activity and local field potential patterns change at different depths of general anesthesia. Here, we investigate the associated network level changes of functional connectivity. We recorded ongoing electrocorticographic (ECoG) activity from temporo-parieto-occipital cortex of 6 ferrets at various levels of isoflurane/nitrous oxide anesthesia and determined functional connectivity by computing amplitude envelope correlations. Through hierarchical clustering, we derived typical connectivity patterns corresponding to light, intermediate and deep anesthesia. Generally, amplitude correlation strength increased strongly with depth of anesthesia across all cortical areas and frequency bands. This was accompanied, at the deepest level, by the emergence of burst-suppression activity in the ECoG signal and a change of the spectrum of the amplitude envelope. Normalization of functional connectivity to the distribution of correlation coefficients showed that the topographical patterns remained similar across depths of anesthesia, reflecting the functional association of the underlying cortical areas. Thus, while strength and temporal properties of amplitude co-modulation vary depending on the activity of local neural circuits, their network-level interaction pattern is presumably most strongly determined by the underlying structural connectivity.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Correct Laminar Positioning in the Neocortex Influences Proper Dendritic and Synaptic Development</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy113/4999309?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The neocortex is a 6-layered laminated structure with a precise anatomical and functional organization ensuring proper function. Laminar positioning of cortical neurons, as determined by termination of neuronal migration, is a key determinant of their ability to assemble into functional circuits. However, the exact contribution of laminar placement to dendrite morphogenesis and synapse formation remains unclear. Here we manipulated the laminar position of cortical neurons by knocking down doublecortin (Dcx), a crucial effector of migration, and show that misplaced neurons fail to properly form dendrites, spines, and functional glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses. We further show that knocking down Dcx in properly positioned neurons induces similar but milder defects, suggesting that the laminar misplacement is the primary cause of altered neuronal development. Thus, the specific laminar environment of their fated layers is crucial for the maturation of cortical neurons, and influences their functional integration into developing cortical circuits.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Prior Knowledge Guides Speech Segregation in Human Auditory Cortex</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy052/4999308?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Segregating concurrent sound streams is a computationally challenging task that requires integrating bottom-up acoustic cues (e.g. pitch) and top-down prior knowledge about sound streams. In a multi-talker environment, the brain can segregate different speakers in about 100 ms in auditory cortex. Here, we used magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings to investigate the temporal and spatial signature of how the brain utilizes prior knowledge to segregate 2 speech streams from the same speaker, which can hardly be separated based on bottom-up acoustic cues. In a primed condition, the participants know the target speech stream in advance while in an unprimed condition no such prior knowledge is available. Neural encoding of each speech stream is characterized by the MEG responses tracking the speech envelope. We demonstrate that an effect in bilateral superior temporal gyrus and superior temporal sulcus is much stronger in the primed condition than in the unprimed condition. Priming effects are observed at about 100 ms latency and last more than 600 ms. Interestingly, prior knowledge about the target stream facilitates speech segregation by mainly suppressing the neural tracking of the non-target speech stream. In sum, prior knowledge leads to reliable speech segregation in auditory cortex, even in the absence of reliable bottom-up speech segregation cue.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Term or Preterm Cesarean Section Delivery Does Not Lead to Long-term Detrimental Consequences in Mice</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy112/4996561?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Epidemiological studies have provided contradictory data on the deleterious sequels of cesarean section (C-section) delivery and their links with developmental brain disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorders. To gain better insight on these issues, we have now compared physiological, morphological, and behavioral parameters in vaginal, term, and preterm C-section delivered mice. We report that C-section delivery does not lead to long-term behavioral alterations though preterm C-section delivery modifies communicative behaviors in pups. Moreover, C-section delivery neither alters the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) developmental excitatory to inhibitory shift nor the frequency or amplitude of glutamatergic and GABAergic postsynaptic currents in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. However, these neurons present an underdeveloped dendritic arbor at birth in pups born by C-section delivery, but this difference disappears 1 day later suggesting an accelerated growth after birth. Therefore, C-section delivery, with prematurity as an aggravating factor, induces transient developmental delays but neither impacts the GABA developmental sequence nor leads to long-term consequences in mice. The deleterious sequels of C-section delivery described in epidemiological studies might be due to a perinatal insult that could be aggravated by C-section delivery.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Local Cortical Gyrification is Increased in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders, but Decreases Rapidly in Adolescents</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy111/4996560?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Extensive MRI evidence indicates early brain overgrowth in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Local gyrification may reflect the distribution and timing of aberrant cortical expansion in ASDs. We examined MRI data from (Study 1) 64 individuals with ASD and 64 typically developing (TD) controls (7–19 years), and from (Study 2) an independent sample from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 31/group). Local Gyrification Index (lGI), cortical thickness (CT), and surface area (SA) were measured. In Study 1, differences in lGI (ASD &amp;gt; TD) were found in left parietal and temporal and right frontal and temporal regions. lGI decreased bilaterally with age, but more steeply in ASD in left precentral, right lateral occipital, and middle frontal clusters. CT differed between groups in right perisylvian cortex (TD &amp;gt; ASD), but no differences were found for SA. Partial correlations between lGI and CT were generally negative, but associations were weaker in ASD in several clusters. Study 2 results were consistent, though less extensive. Altered gyrification may reflect unique information about the trajectory of cortical development in ASDs. While early overgrowth tends to be undetectable in later childhood in ASDs, findings may indicate that a trace of this developmental abnormality could remain in a disorder-specific pattern of gyrification.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Multiple Regions of a Cortical Network Commonly Encode the Meaning of Words in Multiple Grammatical Positions of Read Sentences</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy110/4996559?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Deciphering how sentence meaning is represented in the brain remains a major challenge to science. Semantically related neural activity has recently been shown to arise concurrently in distributed brain regions as successive words in a sentence are read. However, what semantic content is represented by different regions, what is common across them, and how this relates to words in different grammatical positions of sentences is weakly understood. To address these questions, we apply a semantic model of word meaning to interpret brain activation patterns elicited in sentence reading. The model is based on human ratings of 65 sensory/motor/emotional and cognitive features of experience with words (and their referents). Through a process of mapping functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging activation back into model space we test: which brain regions semantically encode content words in different grammatical positions (e.g., subject/verb/object); and what semantic features are encoded by different regions. In left temporal, inferior parietal, and inferior/superior frontal regions we detect the semantic encoding of words in all grammatical positions tested and reveal multiple common components of semantic representation. This suggests that sentence comprehension involves a common core representation of multiple words’ meaning being encoded in a network of regions distributed across the brain.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Sex Differences in the Adult Human Brain: Evidence from 5216 UK Biobank Participants</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy109/4996558?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Sex differences in the human brain are of interest for many reasons: for example, there are sex differences in the observed prevalence of psychiatric disorders and in some psychological traits that brain differences might help to explain. We report the largest single-sample study of structural and functional sex differences in the human brain (2750 female, 2466 male participants; mean age 61.7 years, range 44–77 years). Males had higher raw volumes, raw surface areas, and white matter fractional anisotropy; females had higher raw cortical thickness and higher white matter tract complexity. There was considerable distributional overlap between the sexes. Subregional differences were not fully attributable to differences in total volume, total surface area, mean cortical thickness, or height. There was generally greater male variance across the raw structural measures. Functional connectome organization showed stronger connectivity for males in unimodal sensorimotor cortices, and stronger connectivity for females in the default mode network. This large-scale study provides a foundation for attempts to understand the causes and consequences of sex differences in adult brain structure and function.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The non-cell autonomous transfer of OTX2 homeoprotein transcription factor into juvenile mouse cerebral cortex regulates parvalbumin interneuron maturation and critical period timing. By analyzing gene expression in primary visual cortex of wild-type and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Otx2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;+/GFP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; mice at plastic and nonplastic ages, we identified several putative genes implicated in Otx2-dependent visual cortex plasticity for ocular dominance. Cortical OTX2 infusion in juvenile mice induced &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Gadd45b/g&lt;/span&gt; expression through direct regulation of transcription. Intriguingly, a reverse effect was found in the adult, where reducing cortical OTX2 resulted in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Gadd45b/g&lt;/span&gt; upregulation. Viral expression of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Gadd45b&lt;/span&gt; in adult visual cortex directly induced ocular dominance plasticity with concomitant changes in MeCP2 foci within parvalbumin interneurons and in methylation states of several plasticity gene promoters, suggesting epigenetic regulation. This interaction provides a molecular mechanism for OTX2 to trigger critical period plasticity yet suppress adult plasticity.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Here, we discuss high-impact research priorities to reduce the number of people transitioning from acute to chronic intractable pain.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nrn/rss/current/~4/4GPIHMIFkLU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Tracing Environmental Exposure from Neurodevelopment to Neurodegeneration</title>
	<link>https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(18)30104-8?rss=yes</link>
	<content:encoded>Interplay between genetic and environmental factors during critical time windows can have effects that span from neurodevelopment to neurodegeneration. We present the concept of the ‘neuroexposome’, emphasizing the brain’s distinctive response to environmental exposure, and how current ‘omics’ sciences can inform on both disease pathogenesis and future public health policies.</content:encoded>

A study demonstrates that different forms of synaptic homeostasis respond to distinct aspects of circuit activity, suggesting that neurons can gauge and adapt to the both the quality and quantity of circuit activity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/FFtaTRZ7d_4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>
