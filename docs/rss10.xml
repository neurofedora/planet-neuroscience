	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Sinonasal surgery alters brain structure and function: Neuroanatomical correlates of olfactory dysfunction</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24897?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>This is the first study to demonstrate functional as well as structural plasticity of the central olfactory networks, following surgical treatment for olfactory dysfunction. Our results help to confirm the neuroanatomical corelates of olfactory function and dysfunction.

Abstract
Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is more common than hearing loss, partial blindness, or blindness and can have a significant impact on the quality of life. Moreover, unexplained OD is an early biomarker in neurodegenerative diseases and increases 5‐year mortality risk. Structural alterations in olfactory eloquent brain regions may represent the neuroanatomical correlates of OD. Previous studies have demonstrated reduced gray matter (GM) volume in areas of presumed olfactory relevance in patients with OD. However, being cross‐sectional in nature, these studies do not provide evidence of causality, for which longitudinal work is required. At present, however, longitudinal studies addressing olfactory structural plasticity are limited, both in number and methodological approach: to our knowledge, such work has not included parallel functional imaging to confirm the relevance of structural change. We therefore performed a longitudinal multimodal neuroimaging study investigating structural and functional plasticity in 24 patients undergoing surgical treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis, compared with 17 healthy controls. We demonstrated functionally significant structural plasticity within the orbitofrontal, anterior cingulate and insular cortices, and temporal poles in patients 3 months after surgery. Of interest, GM volume decreased in these regions, in association with increased psychophysical scores and BOLD signal. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate both structural and functional plasticity of the central olfactory networks, thereby confirming these areas as neuroanatomical correlates of olfactory function/dysfunction.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Functional brain network topology across the menstrual cycle is estradiol dependent and correlates with individual well‐being</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24898?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>The topology of brain networks along the menstrual cycle (MC), estimated in 24 women (N = 24), is influenced by estradiol blood levels. The betweenness centrality (BC) of the right posterior cingulate gyrus (rPCG), in the alpha frequency band, increased in the peri‐ovulatory phase (a). The estradiol levels predicted the BC variance in rPCG (b) and, accordingly, its variations during the luteal phase (expressed as the difference between the mid‐luteal and peri‐ovulatory time points of the MC) correlated positively with the variation of the BC of the rPCG (c).

Abstract
The menstrual cycle (MC) is a sex hormone‐related phenomenon that repeats itself cyclically during the woman's reproductive life. In this explorative study, we hypothesized that coordinated variations of multiple sex hormones may affect the large‐scale organization of the brain functional network and that, in turn, such changes might have psychological correlates, even in the absence of overt clinical signs of anxiety and/or depression. To test our hypothesis, we investigated longitudinally, across the MC, the relationship between the sex hormones and both brain network and psychological changes. We enrolled 24 naturally cycling women and, at the early‐follicular, peri‐ovulatory, and mid‐luteal phases of the MC, we performed: (a) sex hormone dosage, (b) magnetoencephalography recording to study the brain network topology, and (c) psychological questionnaires to quantify anxiety, depression, self‐esteem, and well‐being. We showed that during the peri‐ovulatory phase, in the alpha band, the leaf fraction and the tree hierarchy of the brain network were reduced, while the betweenness centrality (BC) of the right posterior cingulate gyrus (rPCG) was increased. Furthermore, the increase in BC was predicted by estradiol levels. Moreover, during the luteal phase, the variation of estradiol correlated positively with the variations of both the topological change and environmental mastery dimension of the well‐being test, which, in turn, was related to the increase in the BC of rPCG. Our results highlight the effects of sex hormones on the large‐scale brain network organization as well as on their possible relationship with the psychological state across the MC. Moreover, the fact that physiological changes in the brain topology occur throughout the MC has widespread implications for neuroimaging studies.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24861?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Epilepsy is a debilitating disorder of uncontrollable recurrent seizures that occurs as a result of imbalances in the brain excitatory and inhibitory neuronal signals, that could stem from a range of functional and structural neuronal impairments. Globally, nearly 70 million people are negatively impacted by epilepsy and its comorbidities. One such comorbidity is the effect epilepsy has on the autonomic nervous system (ANS), which plays a role in the control of blood circulation, respiration and gastrointestinal function. These epilepsy‐induced impairments in the circulatory and respiratory systems may contribute toward sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Although, various hypotheses have been proposed regarding the role of epilepsy on ANS, the linking pathological mechanism still remains unclear. Channelopathies and seizure‐induced damages in ANS‐control brain structures were some of the causal/pathological candidates of cardiorespiratory comorbidities in epilepsy patients, especially in those who were drug resistant. However, emerging preclinical research suggest that neurotransmitter/receptor dysfunction and synaptic changes in the ANS may also contribute to the epilepsy‐related autonomic disorders. Thus, pathological mechanisms of cardiorespiratory dysfunction should be elucidated by considering the modifications in anatomy and physiology of the autonomic system caused by seizures. In this regard, we present a comprehensive review of the current literature, both clinical and preclinical animal studies, on the cardiorespiratory findings in epilepsy and elucidate the possible pathological mechanisms of these findings, in hopes to prevent SUDEP especially in patients who are drug resistant.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Quantum measurement theory is applied to quantum-like modeling of coherent
generation of perceptions and emotions and generally for emotional coloring of
conscious experiences. In quantum theory, a system should be separated from an
observer. The brain performs self-measurements. To model them, we split the
brain into two subsystems, unconsciousness and consciousness. They correspond
to a system and an observer. The states of perceptions and emotions are
described through the tensor product decomposition of the unconscious state
space; similarly, there are two classes of observables, for conscious
experiencing of perceptions and emotions, respectively. Emotional coloring is
coupled to quantum contextuality: emotional observables determine contexts.
Such contextualization reduces degeneration of unconscious states. The
quantum-like approach should be distinguished from consideration of the genuine
quantum physical processes in the brain (cf. Penrose and Hameroff). In our
approach the brain is a macroscopic system which information processing can be
described by the formalism of quantum theory.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05186</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest research challenges of this century is to understand the
neural basis for how behavior emerges in brain-body-environment systems. To
this end, research has flourished along several directions but have
predominantly focused on the brain. While there is in an increasing acceptance
and focus on including the body and environment in studying the neural basis of
behavior, animal researchers are often limited by technology or tools.
Computational models provide an alternative framework within which one can
study model systems where ground-truth can be measured and interfered with.
These models act as a hypothesis generation framework that would in turn guide
experimentation. Furthermore, the ability to intervene as we please, allows us
to conduct in-depth analysis of these models in a way that cannot be performed
in natural systems. For this purpose, information theory is emerging as a
powerful tool that can provide insights into the operation of these
brain-body-environment models. In this work, I provide an introduction, a
review and discussion to make a case for how information theoretic analysis of
computational models is a potent research methodology to help us better
understand the neural basis of behavior.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05181</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This document introduces a hypothesized framework on the functional nature of
primitive neural network. It discusses such an idea that the activity of
neurons and synapses can symbolically reenact the dynamic changes in the world
and enable an adaptive system of behavior. More specifically, the network
achieves these without participating in an algorithmic structure. When a
neuron's activation represents some symbolic element in the environment, each
of its synapses can indicate a potential change to the element and its future
state. The efficacy of a synaptic connection further specifies the element's
particular probability for, or contribution to, such a change. A neuron's
activation is transformed to its postsynaptic targets as it fires, resulting in
a chronological shift of the represented elements. As the inherent function of
summation in a neuron integrates the various presynaptic contributions, the
neural network mimics the collective causal relationship of events in the
observed environment.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05180</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is a neurological disorder, always coming with abnormal brain
seizures activity of complex randomness and unpredictability, which have
brought obstacles for the improvement of epileptic treatment. However, the
mechanism of the epileptic randomness has not been unfolded. Inspired by the
recent experimental finding that astrocyte G protein coupled receptor involves
in the stochastic epileptic seizures, we proposed a cortical tripartite
synaptic network of neurons and astrocytes with the G protein noise, which is
capable to explain the stochastic process of epileptic seizures in the
involvement of the G protein noise, a Gaussian distributed noise which explains
the heterogeneity of the G protein types and the nonuniform environmental
effect. Based on this model, we have discussed the dynamical stochastic
induction process of the epileptic seizures statistically by performing totally
60 simulation trials. Our simulation results showed that the increase of the
noise intensity could induce the epileptic seizures state coexisting with the
increase of frequency and in vitro epileptic depolarization blocks. Meanwhile,
there has been a bistable state of the noise intensity for the neurons
switching among the regular sparse spiking and the epileptic seizure state.
This random presence of epileptic seizure state would be absent when the noise
intensity continues to increase, then the neurons start to stay in epileptic
seizures steadily, but with an increase of the epileptic depolarization block
duration. The simulation results also shed light on the fact that the calcium
signals in astrocytes have played significant roles in the pattern formation of
both the random and steady epileptic seizure state. Our results on the
stochastic process of the epileptic seizures could provide potential theory for
improvement for the epileptic prediction and treatment.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05113</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the past few years, significant advancements were made in reconstruction
of observed natural images from fMRI brain recordings using deep-learning
tools. Here, for the first time, we show that dense 3D depth maps of observed
2D natural images can also be recovered directly from fMRI brain recordings. We
use an off-the-shelf method to estimate the unknown depth maps of natural
images. This is applied to both: (i) the small number of images presented to
subjects in an fMRI scanner (images for which we have fMRI recordings -
referred to as &quot;paired&quot; data), and (ii) a very large number of natural images
with no fMRI recordings (&quot;unpaired data&quot;). The estimated depth maps are then
used as an auxiliary reconstruction criterion to train for depth reconstruction
directly from fMRI. We propose two main approaches: Depth-only recovery and
joint image-depth RGBD recovery. Because the number of available &quot;paired&quot;
training data (images with fMRI) is small, we enrich the training data via
self-supervised cycle-consistent training on many &quot;unpaired&quot; data (natural
images &amp;amp; depth maps without fMRI). This is achieved using our newly defined and
trained Depth-based Perceptual Similarity metric as a reconstruction criterion.
We show that predicting the depth map directly from fMRI outperforms its
indirect sequential recovery from the reconstructed images. We further show
that activations from early cortical visual areas dominate our depth
reconstruction results, and propose means to characterize fMRI voxels by their
degree of depth-information tuning. This work adds an important layer of
decoded information, extending the current envelope of visual brain decoding
capabilities.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05096</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The representation used for solutions in optimization can have a significant
impact on the performance of the optimization method. Traditional population
based evolutionary methods have homogeneous populations where all solutions use
the same representation. If different representations are to be considered,
different runs are required to investigate the relative performance. In this
paper, we illustrate the use of a population based evolutionary method, Fresa,
inspired by the propagation of Strawberry plants, which allows for multiple
representations to co-exist in the population.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fresa is implemented in the Julia language. Julia provides dynamic typing and
multiple dispatch. In multiple dispatch, the function invoked is determined,
dynamically at run time, by the types of the arguments passed to it. This
enables a generic implementation of key steps in the plant propagation
algorithm which allows for a heterogeneous population. The search procedure
then leads to a competition between representations automatically.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple case study from the design of operating conditions for a batch
reactor system is used to illustrate heterogeneous population based search.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Public charging station occupancy prediction plays key importance in
developing a smart charging strategy to reduce electric vehicle (EV) operator

conventional econometric or time series methodologies with limited accuracy. We
propose a new mixed long short-term memory neural network incorporating both
historical charging state sequences and time-related features for multistep
discrete charging occupancy state prediction. Unlike the existing LSTM
networks, the proposed model separates different types of features and handles
them differently with mixed neural network architecture. The model is compared
to a number of state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning approaches
based on the EV charging data obtained from the open data portal of the city of
Dundee, UK. The results show that the proposed method produces very accurate
predictions (99.99% and 81.87% for 1 step (10 minutes) and 6 step (1 hour)
ahead, respectively, and outperforms the benchmark approaches significantly
(+22.4% for one-step-ahead prediction and +6.2% for 6 steps ahead). A
sensitivity analysis is conducted to evaluate the impact of the model
parameters on prediction accuracy.

complex. Each job in the pipeline might need different requirements including
specific hardware specifications and dependencies. To achieve minimal makespan,
developers always apply as much machines as possible. Consequently, others may
be stalled for waiting resource released. Minimizing the makespan of each job
using a few resource is a challenging problem. In this study, it is aimed to 1)
automatically determine the priority of jobs to reduce the waiting time in the
line, 2) automatically allocate the machine resource to each job. In this work,
the problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. We use GA
algorithm to automatically determine job priorities and resource demand for
minimizing individual makespan and resource usage. Finally, the experimental

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04845</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In neuroscience, synaptic plasticity refers to the set of mechanisms driving
the dynamics of neuronal connections, called synapses and represented by a
scalar value, the synaptic weight. A Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP)
rule is a biologically-based model representing the time evolution of the
synaptic weight as a functional of the past spiking activity of adjacent
neurons. A general mathematical framework has been introduced in [37].
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper we develop and investigate a scaling approach of these models
based on several biological assumptions. Experiments show that long-term
synaptic plasticity evolves on a much slower timescale than the cellular
mechanisms driving the activity of neuronal cells, like their spiking activity
or the concentration of various chemical components created/suppressed by this
spiking activity. For this reason, a scaled version of the stochastic model of
[37] is introduced and a limit theorem, an averaging principle, is stated for a
large class of plasticity kernels. A companion paper [36] is entirely devoted
to the tightness properties used to prove these convergence results.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These averaging principles are used to study two important STDP models:
pair-based rules and calcium-based rules. Our results are compared with the
approximations of neuroscience STDP models. A class of discrete models of STDP
rules is also investigated for the analytical tractability of its limiting
dynamical system.

reversibility and an analysis based on graph theory, which reduces HCA security
to the well-known Hamiltonian cycle problem that belongs to the NP-complete

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep learning techniques are increasingly being adopted for classification
tasks over the past decade, yet explaining how deep learning architectures can
achieve state-of-the-art performance is still an elusive goal. While all the
training information is embedded deeply in a trained model, we still do not
understand much about its performance by only analyzing the model. This paper
examines the neuron activation patterns of deep learning-based classification
models and explores whether the models' performances can be explained through
neurons' activation behavior. We propose two approaches: one that models
neurons' activation behavior as a graph and examines whether the neurons form
meaningful communities, and the other examines the predictability of neurons'
behavior using entropy. Our comprehensive experimental study reveals that both
the community quality (modularity) and entropy are closely related to the deep
learning models' performances, thus paves a novel way of explaining deep
learning models directly from the neurons' activation pattern.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Each year a growing number of wind farms are being added to power grids to
generate electricity. The power curve of a wind turbine, which exhibits the
relationship between generated power and wind speed, plays a major role in
assessing the performance of a wind farm. Neural networks have been used for
power curve estimation. However, they do not produce a confidence measure for
their output, unless computationally prohibitive Bayesian methods are used. In
this paper, a probabilistic neural network with Monte Carlo dropout is
considered to quantify the model (epistemic) uncertainty of the power curve
estimation. This approach offers a minimal increase in computational complexity
over deterministic approaches. Furthermore, by incorporating a probabilistic
loss function, the noise or aleatoric uncertainty in the data is estimated. The
developed network captures both model and noise uncertainty which is found to
be useful tools in assessing performance. Also, the developed network is
compared with existing ones across a public domain dataset showing superior
performance in terms of prediction accuracy.

fundamentally premotor in nature. By this, we mean that the prefrontal cortex
consists of an action abstraction hierarchy whose core function is the
potentiation and depotentiation of possible action plans at different levels of
granularity. We argue that the apex of the hierarchy should revolve around the
process of goal selection, which we posit is inherently a form of abstract
action optimization. Anatomical and functional evidence supports the idea that
this hierarchy originates on the orbital surface of the brain and extends
dorsally to motor cortex. Our view, therefore, positions the orbitofrontal
cortex as the central site for the optimization of goal selection policies, and
suggests that other proposed roles are aspects of this more general function.
We conclude by proposing that the dynamical systems approach, which works well
in motor systems, can be extended to the rest of prefrontal cortex. Our
proposed perspective will reframe outstanding questions, open up new areas of
inquiry, and will align theories of prefrontal function with evolutionary
principles.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: EXPObench: Benchmarking Surrogate-based Optimisation Algorithms on Expensive Black-box Functions. (arXiv:2106.04618v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04618</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Surrogate algorithms such as Bayesian optimisation are especially designed
for black-box optimisation problems with expensive objectives, such as
hyperparameter tuning or simulation-based optimisation. In the literature,
these algorithms are usually evaluated with synthetic benchmarks which are well
established but have no expensive objective, and only on one or two real-life
applications which vary wildly between papers. There is a clear lack of
standardisation when it comes to benchmarking surrogate algorithms on
real-life, expensive, black-box objective functions. This makes it very
difficult to draw conclusions on the effect of algorithmic contributions. A new
benchmark library, EXPObench, provides first steps towards such a
standardisation. The library is used to provide an extensive comparison of six
different surrogate algorithms on four expensive optimisation problems from
different real-life applications. This has led to new insights regarding the
relative importance of exploration, the evaluation time of the objective, and
the used model. A further contribution is that we make the algorithms and
benchmark problem instances publicly available, contributing to more uniform
analysis of surrogate algorithms. Most importantly, we include the performance
of the six algorithms on all evaluated problem instances. This results in a
unique new dataset that lowers the bar for researching new methods as the
number of expensive evaluations required for comparison is significantly
reduced.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: From Understanding Genetic Drift to a Smart-Restart Parameter-less Compact Genetic Algorithm. (arXiv:2004.07141v3 [cs.NE] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07141</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;One of the key difficulties in using estimation-of-distribution algorithms is
choosing the population size(s) appropriately: Too small values lead to genetic
drift, which can cause enormous difficulties. In the regime with no genetic
drift, however, often the runtime is roughly proportional to the population
size, which renders large population sizes inefficient.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on a recent quantitative analysis which population sizes lead to
genetic drift, we propose a parameter-less version of the compact genetic
algorithm that automatically finds a suitable population size without spending
too much time in situations unfavorable due to genetic drift.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We prove a mathematical runtime guarantee for this algorithm and conduct an
extensive experimental analysis on four classic benchmark problems both without
and with additive centered Gaussian posterior noise. The former shows that
under a natural assumption, our algorithm has a performance very similar to the
one obtainable from the best problem-specific population size. The latter
confirms that missing the right population size in the original cGA can be
detrimental and that previous theory-based suggestions for the population size
can be far away from the right values; it also shows that our algorithm as well
as a previously proposed parameter-less variant of the cGA based on parallel
runs avoid such pitfalls. Comparing the two parameter-less approaches, ours
profits from its ability to abort runs which are likely to be stuck in a
genetic drift situation.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) which observed in the brain has
proven to be important in biological learning. On the other hand, artificial
neural networks use a different way to learn, such as Back-Propagation or
Contrastive Hebbian Learning. In this work, we propose a new framework called
mstdp that learn almost the same way biological learning use, it only uses STDP
rules for supervised and unsupervised learning and don' t need a global loss or
other supervise information. The framework works like an auto-encoder by making
each input neuron also an output neuron. It can make predictions or generate
patterns in one model without additional configuration. We also brought a new
iterative inference method using momentum to make the framework more efficient,
which can be used in training and testing phases. Finally, we verified our
framework on MNIST dataset for classification and generation task.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Hangul Fonts Dataset: a Hierarchical and Compositional Dataset for Investigating Learned Representations. (arXiv:1905.13308v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13308</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hierarchy and compositionality are common latent properties in many natural
and scientific datasets. Determining when a deep network's hidden activations
represent hierarchy and compositionality is important both for understanding
deep representation learning and for applying deep networks in domains where
interpretability is crucial. However, current benchmark machine learning
datasets either have little hierarchical or compositional structure, or the
structure is not known. This gap impedes precise analysis of a network's
representations and thus hinders development of new methods that can learn such
properties. To address this gap, we developed a new benchmark dataset with
known hierarchical and compositional structure. The Hangul Fonts Dataset (HFD)
is comprised of 35 fonts from the Korean writing system (Hangul), each with
11,172 blocks (syllables) composed from the product of initial consonant,
medial vowel, and final consonant glyphs. All blocks can be grouped into a few
geometric types which induces a hierarchy across blocks. In addition, each
block is composed of individual glyphs with rotations, translations, scalings,
and naturalistic style variation across fonts. We find that both shallow and
deep unsupervised methods only show modest evidence of hierarchy and
compositionality in their representations of the HFD compared to supervised
deep networks. Supervised deep network representations contain structure
related to the geometrical hierarchy of the characters, but the compositional
structure of the data is not evident. Thus, HFD enables the identification of
shortcomings in existing methods, a critical first step toward developing new
machine learning algorithms to extract hierarchical and compositional structure
in the context of naturalistic variability.

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.655164</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The cerebellum plays a critical regulatory role in motor coordination, cognition, behavior, language, memory, and learning, hence overseeing a multiplicity of functions. Cerebellar development begins during early embryonic development, lasting until the first postnatal years. Particularly, the greatest increase of its volume occurs during the third trimester of pregnancy, which represents a critical period for cerebellar maturation. Preterm birth and all the related prenatal and perinatal contingencies may determine both dysmaturative and lesional events, potentially involving the developing cerebellum, and contributing to the constellation of the neuropsychiatric outcomes with several implications in setting-up clinical follow-up and early intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Cannabinoid Modulation of Dopamine Release During Motivation, Periodic Reinforcement, Exploratory Behavior, Habit Formation, and Attention</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2021.660218</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Motivational and attentional processes energize action sequences to facilitate evolutionary competition and promote behavioral fitness. Decades of neuropharmacology, electrophysiology and electrochemistry research indicate that the mesocorticolimbic DA pathway modulates both motivation and attention. More recently, it was realized that mesocorticolimbic DA function is tightly regulated by the brain’s endocannabinoid system and greatly influenced by exogenous cannabinoids—which have been harnessed by humanity for medicinal, ritualistic, and recreational uses for 12,000 years. Exogenous cannabinoids, like the primary psychoactive component of cannabis, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, produce their effects by acting at binding sites for naturally occurring endocannabinoids. The brain’s endocannabinoid system consists of two G-protein coupled receptors, endogenous lipid ligands for these receptor targets, and several synthetic and metabolic enzymes involved in their production and degradation. Emerging evidence indicates that the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol is necessary to observe concurrent increases in DA release and motivated behavior. And the historical pharmacology literature indicates a role for cannabinoid signaling in both motivational and attentional processes. While both types of behaviors have been scrutinized under manipulation by either DA or cannabinoid agents, there is considerably less insight into prospective interactions between these two important signaling systems. This review attempts to summate the relevance of cannabinoid modulation of DA release during operant tasks designed to investigate either motivational or attentional control of behavior. We first describe how cannabinoids influence DA release and goal-directed action under a variety of reinforcement contingencies. Then we consider the role that endocannabinoids might play in switching an animal’s motivation from a goal-directed action to the search for an alternative outcome, in addition to the formation of long-term habits. Finally, dissociable features of attentional behavior using both the 5-choice serial reaction time task and the attentional set-shifting task are discussed along with their distinct influences by DA and cannabinoids. We end with discussing potential targets for further research regarding DA-cannabinoid interactions within key substrates involved in motivation and attention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: The Effects of rs405509 on APOEε4 Non-carriers in Non-demented Aging</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.677823</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;There is evidence that the T allele of rs405509 located in the apolipoprotein E (APOE) promotor region is a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the effect of the T/T allele on brain function in non-demented aging is still unclear.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We analyzed the effects of the rs405509 T/T allele on cognitive performances using multiple neuropsychological tests and local brain function using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Significant differences were found between T/T carriers and G allele carriers on general cognitive status, memory, and attention (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Rs-fMRI analyses demonstrated decreased amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) in the right middle frontal gyrus, decreased percent amplitude of fluctuation (PerAF) in the right middle frontal gyrus, increased regional homogeneity (ReHo) in the right cerebellar tonsil and decreased ReHo in the right putamen, and decreased degree centrality (DC) in the left middle frontal gyrus (p &amp;lt; 0.05, corrected). Furthermore, significant correlations were found between cognitive performance and these neuroimaging changes (p &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that T/T allele may serve as an independent risk factor that can influence brain function in different regions in non-demented aging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Photoacoustic Neuroimaging - Perspectives on a Maturing Imaging Technique and Its Applications in Neuroscience</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.655247</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A prominent goal of neuroscience is to improve our understanding of how brain structure and activity interact to produce perception, emotion, behavior, and cognition. The brain’s network activity is inherently organized in distinct spatiotemporal patterns that span scales from nanometer-sized synapses to meter-long nerve fibers and millisecond intervals between electrical signals to decades of memory storage. There is currently no single imaging method that alone can provide all the relevant information, but intelligent combinations of complementary techniques can be effective. Here, we thus present the latest advances in biomedical and biological engineering on photoacoustic neuroimaging in the context of complementary imaging techniques. A particular focus is placed on recent advances in whole-brain photoacoustic imaging in rodent models and its influential role in bridging the gap between fluorescence microscopy and more non-invasive techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We consider current strategies to address persistent challenges, particularly in developing molecular contrast agents, and conclude with an overview of potential future directions for photoacoustic neuroimaging to provide deeper insights into healthy and pathological brain processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Large-Area Photoreceptor Degeneration Model in Rabbits by Photocoagulation and Oxidative Stress in the Retina</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.617175</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Photocoagulation is used for the treatment of retinal ischemic disease. However, due to the invasive nature of photocoagulation and variety of melanin concentrations between individuals, it is challenging to avoid damaging the adjacent photoreceptors and inducing several side effects. Previous studies indicate the role of laser power, duration, and spot size on retinal lesions, but the effect of interspot distance of the laser pulses needs to be considered in panretinal photocoagulation. In this study, we examine different parameters of photocoagulation on lesions of the retina in rabbit, finding that the lesion level of the outer nuclear layer of the retina depended on the pulse duration and laser spot size, and decreasing interspot distance could completely abolish the photoreceptor layer. The degeneration of the photoreceptor by photocoagulation occurred in 24 h and was not restored afterward. We then conducted panretinal photocoagulation in rabbit and found that oxidative stress was decreased in the inner nuclear layer of the retina, and pupillary light reflex and ERG signals were impaired. Our study could provide a rabbit model to explore the mechanism of photoreceptor degeneration and therapies for the side effects after photocoagulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Characterizing Network Search Algorithms Developed for Dynamic Causal Modeling</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.656486</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) is a widely used tool to estimate the effective connectivity of specified models of a brain network. Finding the model explaining measured data is one of the most important outstanding problems in Bayesian modeling. Using heuristic model search algorithms enables us to find an optimal model without having to define a model set a priori. However, the development of such methods is cumbersome in the case of large model-spaces. We aimed to utilize commonly used graph theoretical search algorithms for DCM to create a framework for characterizing them, and to investigate relevance of such methods for single-subject and group-level studies. Because of the enormous computational demand of DCM calculations, we separated the model estimation procedure from the search algorithm by providing a database containing the parameters of all models in a full model-space. For test data a publicly available fMRI dataset of 60 subjects was used. First, we reimplemented the deterministic bilinear DCM algorithm in the ReDCM R package, increasing computational speed during model estimation. Then, three network search algorithms have been adapted for DCM, and we demonstrated how modifications to these methods, based on DCM posterior parameter estimates, can enhance search performance. Comparison of the results are based on model evidence, structural similarities and the number of model estimations needed during search. An analytical approach using Bayesian model reduction (BMR) for efficient network discovery is already available for DCM. Comparing model search methods we found that topological algorithms often outperform analytical methods for single-subject analysis and achieve similar results for recovering common network properties of the winning model family, or set of models, obtained by multi-subject family-wise analysis. However, network search methods show their limitations in higher level statistical analysis of parametric empirical Bayes. Optimizing such linear modeling schemes the BMR methods are still considered the recommended approach. We envision the freely available database of estimated model-spaces to help further studies of the DCM model-space, and the ReDCM package to be a useful contribution for Bayesian inference within and beyond the field of neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Event-Based Update of Synapses in Voltage-Based Learning Rules</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.609147</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Due to the point-like nature of neuronal spiking, efficient neural network simulators often employ event-based simulation schemes for synapses. Yet many types of synaptic plasticity rely on the membrane potential of the postsynaptic cell as a third factor in addition to pre- and postsynaptic spike times. In some learning rules membrane potentials not only influence synaptic weight changes at the time points of spike events but in a continuous manner. In these cases, synapses therefore require information on the full time course of membrane potentials to update their strength which a priori suggests a continuous update in a time-driven manner. The latter hinders scaling of simulations to realistic cortical network sizes and relevant time scales for learning. Here, we derive two efficient algorithms for archiving postsynaptic membrane potentials, both compatible with modern simulation engines based on event-based synapse updates. We theoretically contrast the two algorithms with a time-driven synapse update scheme to analyze advantages in terms of memory and computations. We further present a reference implementation in the spiking neural network simulator NEST for two prototypical voltage-based plasticity rules: the Clopath rule and the Urbanczik-Senn rule. For both rules, the two event-based algorithms significantly outperform the time-driven scheme. Depending on the amount of data to be stored for plasticity, which heavily differs between the rules, a strong performance increase can be achieved by compressing or sampling of information on membrane potentials. Our results on computational efficiency related to archiving of information provide guidelines for the design of learning rules in order to make them practically usable in large-scale networks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Globus Pallidus Internus Deep Brain Stimulation for Dystonic Opisthotonus in Adult-Onset Dystonia: A Personalized Approach</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.683545</link>
	<content:encoded>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Dystonic opisthotonus is defined as a backward arching of the neck and trunk, which ranges in severity from mild backward jerks to life-threatening prolonged severe muscular spasms. It can be associated with generalized dystonic syndromes or, rarely, present as a form of axial truncal dystonia. The etiologies vary from idiopathic, genetic, tardive, hereditary-degenerative, or associated with parkinsonism. We report clinical cases of dystonic opisthotonus associated with adult-onset dystonic syndromes, that benefitted from globus pallidus internus (GPi) deep brain stimulation (DBS).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Clinical data from patients with dystonic syndromes who underwent comprehensive medical review, multidisciplinary assessment, and tailored medical and neurosurgical managements were prospectively analyzed. Quantification of dystonia severity pre- and postoperatively was performed using the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale and quantification of overall pain severity was performed using the Visual Analog Scale.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Three male patients, with age of onset of the dystonic symptoms ranging from 32 to 51 years old, were included. Tardive dystonia, adult-onset dystonia-parkinsonism and adult-onset idiopathic axial dystonia were the etiologies identified. Clinical investigation and management were tailored according to the complexity of the individual presentations. Although they shared common clinical features of adult-onset dystonia, disabling dystonic opisthotonus, refractory to medical management, was the main indication for GPi-DBS in all patients presented. The severity of axial dystonia ranged from disturbance of daily function to life-threatening truncal distortion. All three patients underwent bilateral GPi DBS at a mean age of 52 years (range 48–55 years), after mean duration of symptoms prior to DBS of 10.7 years (range 4–16 years). All patients showed a rapid and sustained clinical improvement of their symptoms, notably of the dystonic opisthotonos, at postoperative follow-up ranging from 20 to 175 months. In some, the ability to resume activities of daily living and reintegration into the society was remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Adult-onset dystonic syndromes predominantly presenting with dystonic opisthotonus are relatively rare. The specific nature of dystonic opisthotonus remains a treatment challenge, and thorough investigation of this highly disabling condition with varying etiologies is often necessary. Although patients may be refractory to medical management and botulinum toxin injection, Globus pallidus stimulation timed and tailored provided symptomatic control in this cohort and may be considered in other carefully selected cases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.682011</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;We quantitatively analyzed high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) using scalp electroencephalography (EEG) in patients with infantile spasms (IS).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We enrolled 60 children with IS hospitalized from January 2019 to August 2020. Sixty healthy age-matched children comprised the control group. Time–frequency analysis was used to quantify γ, ripple, and fast ripple (FR) oscillation energy changes.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;γ, ripple, and FR oscillations dominated in the temporal and frontal lobes. The average HFO energy of the sleep stage is lower than that of the wake stage in the same frequency bands in both the normal control (NC) and IS groups (P &amp;lt; 0.05). The average HFO energy of the IS group was significantly higher than that of the NC group in γ band during sleep stage (P &amp;lt; 0.01). The average HFO energy of S and Post-S stage were higher than that of sleep stage in γ band (P &amp;lt; 0.05). In the ripple band, the average HFO energy of Pre-S, S, and Post-S stage was higher than that of sleep stage (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Before treatment, there was no significant difference in BASED score between the effective and ineffective groups. The interaction of curative efficacy × frequency and the interaction of curative efficacy × state are statistically significant. The average HFO energy of the effective group was lower than that of the ineffective group in the sleep stage (P &amp;lt; 0.05). For the 16 children deemed “effective” in the IS group, the average HFO energy of three frequency bands was not significantly different before compared with after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;Significance&lt;p&gt;Scalp EEG can record HFOs. The energy of HFOs can distinguish physiological HFOs from pathological ones more accurately than frequency. On scalp EEG, γ oscillations can better detect susceptibility to epilepsy than ripple and FR oscillations. HFOs can trigger spasms. The analysis of average HFO energy can be used as a predictor of the effectiveness of epilepsy treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Advantage of Handwriting Over Typing on Learning Words: Evidence From an N400 Event-Related Potential Index</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.679191</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The growing implementation of digital education comes with an increased need to understand the impact of digital tools on learning. Previous behavioral studies have shown that handwriting on paper is more effective for learning than typing on a keyboard. However, the impact of writing with a digital pen on a tablet remains to be clarified. In the present study, we compared learning by handwriting with an ink pen on paper, handwriting with a digital pen on a tablet, and typing on a keyboard. Behavioral and electroencephalographic indices were measured immediately after learning with each writing tool. The moods of the subjects during the training were also assessed. The participants were divided according to their use of digital pen in their everyday lives, allowing us to take into account the effect of the familiarity with the digital pen on the learning process (familiar group vs. unfamiliar group). We performed an EEG experiment applying a repetition priming paradigm. In each trial, a learned foreign language word (prime word) and a mother tongue word (target word) were consecutively presented. The target word was either semantically identical to the prime word (repetitive condition) or different (non-repetitive condition). We assumed that a larger priming effect on N400 reflects larger learning progress. The familiar group showed a greater N400 priming effect for words learned with the digital or ink pen than those learned with the keyboard. The unfamiliar group showed the greater N400 priming effect for words learned with the ink pen compared with words learned by typing. In addition, positive mood during learning was significantly higher during handwriting than during typing, regardless of the groups. On the other hand, the behavioral indices were not influenced by the writing tool. These results suggest that the movements involved in handwriting allow a greater memorization of new words. The advantage of handwriting over typing might also be caused by a more positive mood during learning. Finally, our results show that handwriting with a digital pen and tablet can increase the ability to learn compared with keyboard typing once the individuals are accustomed to it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Effect of Prior Knowledge of Color on Behavioral Responses and Event-Related Potentials During Go/No-go Task</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.674964</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In daily life, the meaning of color plays an important role in execution and inhibition of a motor response. For example, the symbolism of traffic light can help pedestrians and drivers to control their behavior, with the color green/blue meaning go and red meaning stop. However, we don’t always stop with a red light and sometimes start a movement with it in such a situation as drivers start pressing the brake pedal when a traffic light turns red. In this regard, we investigated how the prior knowledge of traffic light signals impacts reaction times (RTs) and event-related potentials (ERPs) in a Go/No-go task. We set up Blue Go/Red No-go and Red Go/Blue No-go tasks with three different go signal (Go) probabilities (30, 50, and 70%), resulting in six different conditions. The participants were told which color to respond (Blue or Red) just before each condition session but didn’t know the Go probability. Neural responses to Go and No-go signals were recorded at Fz, Cz, and Oz (international 10–20 system). We computed RTs for Go signal and N2 and P3 amplitudes from the ERP data. We found that RT was faster when responding to blue than red light signal and also was slower with lower Go probability. Overall, N2 amplitude was larger in Red Go than Blue Go trial and in Red No-go than Blue No-go trial. Furthermore, P3 amplitude was larger in Red No-go than Blue No-go trial. Our findings of RT and N2 amplitude for Go ERPs could indicate the presence of Stroop-like interference, that is a conflict between prior knowledge about traffic light signals and the meaning of presented signal. Meanwhile, the larger N2 and P3 amplitudes in Red No-go trial as compared to Blue No-go trial may be due to years of experience in stopping an action in response to a red signal and/or attention. This study provides the better understanding of the effect of prior knowledge of color on behavioral responses and its underlying neural mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Disrupted Structural Brain Connectome Is Related to Cognitive Impairment in Patients With Ischemic Leukoaraiosis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.654750</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ischemic leukoaraiosis (ILA) is related to cognitive impairment and vascular dementia in the elderly. One possible mechanism could be the disruption of white matter (WM) tracts and network function that connect distributed brain regions involved in cognition. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between structural connectome and cognitive functions in ILA patients. A total of 89 patients with ILA (Fazekas score ≥ 3) and 90 healthy controls (HCs) underwent comprehensive neuropsychological examinations and diffusion tensor imaging scans. The tract-based spatial statistics approach was employed to investigate the WM integrity. Graph theoretical analysis was further applied to construct the topological architecture of the structural connectome in ILA patients. Partial correlation analysis was used to investigate the relationships between network measures and cognitive performances in the ILA group. Compared with HCs, the ILA patients showed widespread WM integrity disruptions. The ILA group displayed increased characteristic path length (L&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) and decreased global network efficiency at the level of the whole brain relative to HCs, and reduced nodal efficiencies, predominantly in the frontal–subcortical and limbic system regions. Furthermore, these structural connectomic alterations were associated with cognitive impairment in ILA patients. The association between WM changes (i.e., fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity measures) and cognitive function was mediated by the structural connectivity measures (i.e., local network efficiency and L&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;). In conclusion, cognitive impairment in ILA patients is related to microstructural disruption of multiple WM fibers and topological disorganization of structural networks, which have implications in understanding the relationship between ILA and the possible attendant cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Task Construal Influences Estimations of the Environment</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.625193</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;People’s characteristics can affect their perception of the physical environment, and the judgments and estimates they make about their surroundings. Estimates of the environment change based on observers’ metabolic state, physical properties, and the potential effort they would need to exert for a certain action. The functional role of such scaling is to provide agents with information on possible actions and their energetic costs. Combining actions with costs facilitates both higher-level planning (e.g., choosing an optimal running speed on a marathon) as well as planning on lower levels of an action hierarchy, such as determining the best movement trajectories for energy-efficient action. Recently, some of the findings on reported effects of effort on perception have been challenged as arising from task demands—participants guessing the purpose of the experimental manipulation and adjusting their estimates as a result. Arguably however, the failed replications used overly distracting cover stories which may have introduced task demands of their own, and masked other effects. The current study tested the generality of effects of potential effort on height and distance perception, employing effective yet not distracting cover stories. Four experiments attempted to identify conditions under which anticipated effort may systematically change perceptual estimates. Experiment 1 found that height estimates were not influenced by the effort required to place objects of different weights onto surfaces of varying heights. Experiments 2, 3 used two different effort manipulations (walking vs. hopping; and carrying an empty vs. a heavy backpack, respectively) and found that these did not influence estimates of distance (to be) traveled. Experiment 4 also used backpack weight to manipulate effort but critically, unlike Exp. 1–3 it did not employ a cover story and participants did not traverse distances after giving estimates. In contrast with the first three experiments, distances in the final experiment were estimated as longer when participants were encumbered by a backpack. Combined, these results suggest that the measured effects on the estimation of distance were due to how participants construed the task rather than being of a perceptual nature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a cortical structure based on its cell types, connectivity features, and developmental characteristics. This part of the amygdala is considered to be the main entry site of processed and multisensory information delivered via cortical and thalamic afferents. Although GABAergic inhibitory cells in the BLA comprise only 20% of the entire neuronal population, they provide essential control over proper network operation. Previous studies have uncovered that GABAergic cells in the basolateral amygdala are as diverse as those present in other cortical regions, including the hippocampus and neocortex. To understand the role of inhibitory cells in various amygdala functions, we need to reveal the connectivity and input-output features of the different types of GABAergic cells. Here, I review the recent achievements in uncovering the diversity of GABAergic cells in the basolateral amygdala with a specific focus on the microcircuit organization of these inhibitory cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

We address this issue in the feeding system of Aplysia. Previous experiments identified a projection neuron [cerebral buccal interneuron 2 (CBI-2)] that can trigger ingestive motor programs but only after it is repeatedly stimulated, i.e., initial programs are poorly defined. As CBI-2 stimulation continues, programs become progressively more ingestive (repetition priming occurs). This priming results, at least in part, from persistent actions of peptide cotransmitters released from CBI-2. We now show that in some preparations repetition priming does not occur. There is no clear seasonal effect; priming and non-priming preparations are encountered throughout the year. CBI-2 is electrically coupled to a second projection neuron, cerebral buccal interneuron 3 (CBI-3). In preparations in which priming does not occur, we show that ingestive activity is generated when CBI-2 and CBI-3 are coactivated. Programs are immediately ingestive, i.e., priming is not necessary, and a persistent state is not induced. Our data suggest that dynamic changes in the configuration of activity can vary and be determined by the complement of projection neurons that trigger activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.662882</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Connected networks are a fundamental structure of neurobiology. Understanding these networks will help us elucidate the neural mechanisms of computation. Mathematically speaking these networks are “graphs”—structures containing objects that are connected. In neuroscience, the objects could be regions of the brain, e.g., fMRI data, or be individual neurons, e.g., calcium imaging with fluorescence microscopy. The formal study of graphs, graph theory, can provide neuroscientists with a large bank of algorithms for exploring networks. Graph theory has already been applied in a variety of ways to fMRI data but, more recently, has begun to be applied at the scales of neurons, e.g., from functional calcium imaging. In this primer we explain the basics of graph theory and relate them to features of microscopic functional networks of neurons from calcium imaging—neuronal graphs. We explore recent examples of graph theory applied to calcium imaging and we highlight some areas where researchers new to the field could go awry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Auxiliary Subunits Control Function and Subcellular Distribution of AMPA Receptor Complexes in NG2 Glia of the Developing Hippocampus</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.669717</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Synaptic and axonal glutamatergic signaling to NG2 glia in white matter is critical for the cells’ differentiation and activity dependent myelination. However, in gray matter the impact of neuron-to-NG2 glia signaling is still elusive, because most of these cells keep their non-myelinating phenotype throughout live. Early in postnatal development, hippocampal NG2 glia express AMPA receptors with a significant Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; permeability allowing for plasticity of the neuron-glia synapses, but whether this property changes by adulthood is not known. Moreover, it is unclear whether NG2 glia express auxiliary transmembrane AMPA receptor related proteins (TARPs), which modify AMPA receptor properties, including their Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; permeability. Through combined molecular and functional analyses, here we show that hippocampal NG2 glia abundantly express TARPs γ4, γ7, and γ8 as well as cornichon (CNIH)-2. TARP γ8 undergoes profound downregulation during development. Receptors of adult NG2 glia showed an increased sensitivity to blockers of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; permeable AMPA receptors, but this increase mainly concerned receptors located close to the soma. Evoked synaptic currents of NG2 glia were also sensitive to blockers of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; permeable AMPA receptors. The presence of AMPA receptors with varying Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; permeability during postnatal maturation may be important for the cells’ ability to sense and respond to local glutamatergic activity and for regulating process motility, differentiation, and proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Here, we review the latest advances made about the implication of MCs in pain. Possible cellular and molecular mechanisms regarding the crosstalk between MC and the nervous system in the initiation and maintenance of pain are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;The extent of neurodegeneration underlying essential tremor (ET) remains a matter of debate. Despite various extents of cerebellar atrophy on structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), previous studies have shown substantial heterogeneity and included a limited number of patients.

Lobule-specific volume differences between the ET and HC groups were evaluated using a general linear model corrected for multiple tests.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Total brain tissue volumes did not differ between the ET and HC groups. ET patients demonstrated reduced volumes of lobules I-II, left Crus II, left VIIB, and an increased volume of right X when compared with the HC group.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;A large cohort of ET patients demonstrated subtle signs of decreased cerebellar lobule volumes. These findings oppose the hypothesis of localized atrophy in cerebellar motor areas in ET, but not the possibility of cerebellar pathophysiology in ET. Prospective investigations using alternative neuroimaging modalities may further elucidate the pathophysiology of ET and provide insights into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dementia is a global public health problem and its impact is bound to increase in the next decades, with a rapidly aging world population. Dementia is by no means an obligatory outcome of aging, although its incidence increases exponentially in old age, and its onset may be insidious. In the absence of unequivocal biomarkers, the accuracy of cognitive profiling plays a fundamental role in the diagnosis of this condition. In this Perspective article, we highlight the utility of brief global cognitive tests in the diagnostic process, from the initial detection stage for which they are designed, through the differential diagnosis of dementia. We also argue that neuropsychological training and expertise are critical in order for the information gathered from these omnibus cognitive tests to be used in an efficient and effective way, and thus, ultimately, for them to fulfill their potential.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.639795</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Normative aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) propagation alter anatomical connections among brain parcels. However, the interaction between the trajectories of age- and AD-linked alterations in the topology of the structural brain network is not well understood. In this study, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets of 139 subjects from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database were used to document their structural brain networks. The 139 participants consist of 45 normal controls (NCs), 37 with early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), 27 with late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), and 30 AD patients. All subjects were further divided into three subgroups based on their age (56–65, 66–75, and 71–85 years). After the structural connectivity networks were built using anatomically-constrained deterministic tractography, their global and nodal topological properties were estimated, including network efficiency, characteristic path length, transitivity, modularity coefficient, clustering coefficient, and betweenness. Statistical analyses were then performed on these metrics using linear regression, and one- and two-way ANOVA testing to examine group differences and interactions between aging and AD propagation. No significant interactions were found between aging and AD propagation in the global topological metrics (network efficiency, characteristic path length, transitivity, and modularity coefficient). However, nodal metrics (clustering coefficient and betweenness centrality) of some cortical parcels exhibited significant interactions between aging and AD propagation, with affected parcels including left superior temporal, right pars triangularis, and right precentral. The results collectively confirm the age-related deterioration of structural networks in MCI and AD patients, providing novel insight into the cross effects of aging and AD disorder on brain structural networks. Some early symptoms of AD may also be due to age-associated anatomic vulnerability interacting with early anatomic changes associated with AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/67123</link>
	<content:encoded>The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is the sole and selective gateway for nuclear transport and its dysfunction has been associated with many diseases. The metazoan NPC subcomplex RanBP2, which consists of RanBP2 (Nup358), RanGAP1-SUMO1 and Ubc9, regulates the assembly and function of the NPC. The roles of immune signaling in regulation of NPC remain poorly understood. Here, we show that in human and murine T cells, following TCR stimulation, protein kinase C-θ (PKC-θ) directly phosphorylates RanGAP1 to facilitate RanBP2 subcomplex assembly and nuclear import and, thus, the nuclear translocation of AP-1 transcription factor. Mechanistically, TCR stimulation induces the translocation of activated PKC-θ to the NPC, where it interacts with and phosphorylates RanGAP1 on Ser&lt;sup&gt;504&lt;/sup&gt; and Ser&lt;sup&gt;506&lt;/sup&gt;. RanGAP1 phosphorylation increases its binding affinity for Ubc9, thereby promoting sumoylation of RanGAP1 and, finally, assembly of the RanBP2 subcomplex. Our findings reveal an unexpected role of PKC-θ as a direct regulator of nuclear import and uncover a phosphorylation-dependent sumoylation of RanGAP1, delineating a novel link between TCR signaling and assembly of the RanBP2 NPC subcomplex.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66501</link>
	<content:encoded>Nuclear Factor 90 (NF90) is a novel virus sensor that serves to initiate antiviral innate immunity by triggering the stress granules (SGs) formation. However, the regulation of the NF90-SGs pathway remain largely unclear. We found that Tim-3, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of NF90 and inhibits NF90-SGs mediated antiviral immunity. Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) infection induces the up-regulation and activation of Tim-3 in macrophages which in turn recruited the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM47 to the zinc finger domain of NF90 and initiated a proteasome-dependent degradation via K48-linked ubiquitination at Lys297. Targeted inactivation of the Tim-3 enhances the NF90 downstream SGs formation by selectively increasing the phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2a, the expression of SGs markers G3BP1 and TIA-1, and protected mice from VSV challenge. These findings provide insights into the crosstalk between Tim-3 and other receptors in antiviral innate immunity and its related clinical significance.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Over the past 25 years, neuroimaging has become a ubiquitous tool in basic research and clinical studies of the human brain. However, there are no reference standards against which to anchor measures of individual differences in brain morphology, in contrast to growth charts for traits such as height and weight. Here, we built an interactive online resource (www.brainchart.io) to quantify individual differences in brain structure from any current or future magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study, against models of expected age-related trends. With the goal of basing these on the largest and most inclusive dataset, we aggregated MRI data spanning 115 days post-conception through 100 postnatal years, totaling 122,123 scans from 100,071 individuals in over 100 studies across 6 continents. When quantified as centile scores relative to the reference models, individual differences show high validity with non-MRI brain growth estimates and high stability across longitudinal assessment. Centile scores helped identify previously unreported brain developmental milestones and demonstrated increased genetic heritability compared to non-centiled MRI phenotypes. Crucially for the study of brain disorders, centile scores provide a standardised and interpretable measure of deviation that reveals new patterns of neuroanatomical differences across neurological and psychiatric disorders emerging during development and ageing. In sum, brain charts for the human lifespan are an essential first step towards robust, standardised quantification of individual variation and for characterizing deviation from age-related trends. Our global collaborative study provides such an anchorpoint for basic neuroimaging research and will facilitate implementation of research-based standards in clinical studies.</content:encoded>

Abstract
Egg laying in the pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis is regulated by the photoperiod; long‐day conditions (16L8D) promote egg laying whereas medium‐day conditions (12L12D) suppress it. In this snail, a caudo‐dorsal cell hormone (CDCH) is produced by neurosecretory cells, CDCs in the cerebral ganglion (CG), and its release triggers ovulation and subsequent egg laying. However, the physiological basis for photoperiod‐dependent egg laying remains unraveled. Here, we compared electrophysiological properties of CDCs between 16L8D and 12L12D using intracellular recording, and found that CDC excitability is higher in 16L8D than in 12L12D. Striking differences are as follows: (1) a shallower resting membrane potential in 16L8D than in 12L12D, and (2) a smaller threshold voltage (minimum depolarization from rest to elicit action potentials) in 16L8D than in 12L12D. Switching of the excitability can be a physiological basis of a photoperiod‐dependent CDCH release. Simultaneous intracellular dye injection identified two morphological subtypes of CDCs, validating a previous report. Both types bear short lateral extensions in CG, some of which probably function as integration sites of photoperiodic inputs. In addition, we found two novel CDCH‐immunoreactive cell groups (CDCCOM and SCm) in the CG besides conventional CDCs and small cells expressing CDCH. The CDCCOM with cell bodies and fibers in the neurohemal commissure may be involved in triggering ovulation. Notably, the total number of CDCs is larger than that previously reported, the right CDC cluster with more cells than the left. Our findings are instructive in following the neurophysiology of photoperiodism in L. stagnalis.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
The hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) interact during a myriad of cognitive processes including decision‐making and long‐term memory consolidation. Exactly how the mPFC and hippocampus interact during goal‐directed decision‐making remains to be fully elucidated. During periods of rest, bursts of high‐frequency oscillations, termed sharp‐wave ripple (SWR), appear in the local field potential. Impairing SWRs on the maze or during post‐learning rest can interfere with memory‐guided decision‐making and memory consolidation. We hypothesize that the hippocampus and mPFC bidirectionally interact during SWRs to support memory consolidation and decision‐making. Rats were trained on the neuroeconomic spatial decision‐making task, Restaurant Row, to make serial stay‐skip decisions where the amount of effort (delay to reward) varied upon entry to each restaurant. Hippocampal cells and SWRs were recorded in rats with the mPFC transduced with inhibitory DREADDs. We found that disrupting the mPFC impaired consolidating SWRs in the hippocampus. Hippocampal SWR rates depended on the internalized value of the reward (derived from individual flavor preferences), a parameter important in decision‐making, and disrupting the mPFC changed this relationship. Additionally, we found a dissociation between SWRs that occurred while rats were on the maze dependent upon whether those SWRs occurred while the rat was anticipating food reward or during post‐reward consumption.</content:encoded>

Neurons rely on localized mitochondria to fulfill spatially heterogeneous metabolic demands. Mitochondrial aging occurs on timescales shorter than the neuronal lifespan, necessitating transport of fresh material from the soma. Maintaining an optimal distribution of healthy mitochondria requires an interplay between a stationary pool localized to sites of high metabolic demand and a motile pool capable of delivering new material. Interchange between these pools can occur via transient fusion / fission events or by halting and restarting entire mitochondria. Our quantitative model of neuronal mitostasis identifies key parameters that govern steady-state mitochondrial health at discrete locations. Very infrequent exchange between stationary and motile pools optimizes this system. Exchange via transient fusion allows for robust maintenance, which can be further improved by selective recycling through mitophagy. These results provide a framework for quantifying how perturbations in organelle transport and interactions affect mitochondrial homeostasis in neurons, a key aspect underlying many neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SDw2RNzxDJU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Climate drivers such as humidity and temperature may play a key role in influenza seasonal transmission dynamics. Such a relationship has been well defined for temperate regions. However, to date no models capable of capturing the diverse seasonal pattern in tropical and subtropical climates exist. In addition, multiple influenza viruses could cocirculate and shape epidemic dynamics. Here we construct seven mechanistic epidemic models to test the effect of two major climate drivers (humidity and temperature) and multi-strain co-circulation on influenza transmission in Hong Kong, an influenza epidemic center located in the subtropics. Based on model fit to long-term influenza surveillance data from 1998 to 2018, we found that a simple model incorporating the effect of both humidity and temperature best recreated the influenza epidemic patterns observed in Hong Kong. The model quantifies a bimodal effect of absolute humidity on influenza transmission where both low and very high humidity levels facilitate transmission quadratically; the model also quantifies the monotonic but nonlinear relationship with temperature. In addition, model results suggest that, at the population level, a shorter immunity period can approximate the co-circulation of influenza virus (sub)types. The basic reproductive number &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; estimated by the best-fit model is also consistent with laboratory influenza survival and transmission studies under various combinations of humidity and temperature levels. Overall, our study has developed a simple mechanistic model capable of quantifying the impact of climate drivers on influenza transmission in (sub)tropical regions. This model can be applied to improve influenza forecasting in the (sub)tropics in the future.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hlsPTASAxno&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Treating macaques with an anti-α4β7 antibody under the umbrella of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) during early SIV infection can lead to viral remission, with viral loads maintained at &amp;lt; 50 SIV RNA copies/ml after removal of all treatment in a subset of animals. Depletion of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; lymphocytes in controllers resulted in transient recrudescence of viremia, suggesting that the combination of cART and anti-α4β7 antibody treatment led to a state where ongoing immune responses kept the virus undetectable in the absence of treatment. A previous mathematical model of HIV infection and cART incorporates immune effector cell responses and exhibits the property of two different viral load set-points. While the lower set-point could correspond to the attainment of long-term viral remission, attaining the higher set-point may be the result of viral rebound. Here we expand that model to include possible mechanisms of action of an anti-α4β7 antibody operating in these treated animals. We show that the model can fit the longitudinal viral load data from both IgG control and anti-α4β7 antibody treated macaques, suggesting explanations for the viral control associated with cART and an anti-α4β7 antibody treatment. This effective perturbation to the virus-host interaction can also explain observations in other nonhuman primate experiments in which cART and immunotherapy have led to post-treatment control or resetting of the viral load set-point. Interestingly, because the viral kinetics in the various treated animals differed—some animals exhibited large fluctuations in viral load after cART cessation—the model suggests that anti-α4β7 treatment could act by different primary mechanisms in different animals and still lead to post-treatment viral control. This outcome is nonetheless in accordance with a model with two stable viral load set-points, in which therapy can perturb the system from one set-point to a lower one through different biological mechanisms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xrStXoZPNXw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Jonathan Cannon&lt;/p&gt;

When presented with complex rhythmic auditory stimuli, humans are able to track underlying temporal structure (e.g., a “beat”), both covertly and with their movements. This capacity goes far beyond that of a simple entrained oscillator, drawing on contextual and enculturated timing expectations and adjusting rapidly to perturbations in event timing, phase, and tempo. Previous modeling work has described how entrainment to rhythms may be shaped by event timing expectations, but sheds little light on any underlying computational principles that could unify the phenomenon of expectation-based entrainment with other brain processes. Inspired by the predictive processing framework, we propose that the problem of rhythm tracking is naturally characterized as a problem of continuously estimating an underlying phase and tempo based on precise event times and their correspondence to timing expectations. We present two inference problems formalizing this insight: PIPPET (Phase Inference from Point Process Event Timing) and PATIPPET (Phase and Tempo Inference). Variational solutions to these inference problems resemble previous “Dynamic Attending” models of perceptual entrainment, but introduce new terms representing the dynamics of uncertainty and the influence of expectations in the absence of sensory events. These terms allow us to model multiple characteristics of covert and motor human rhythm tracking not addressed by other models, including sensitivity of error corrections to inter-event interval and perceived tempo changes induced by event omissions. We show that positing these novel influences in human entrainment yields a range of testable behavioral predictions. Guided by recent neurophysiological observations, we attempt to align the phase inference framework with a specific brain implementation. We also explore the potential of this normative framework to guide the interpretation of experimental data and serve as building blocks for even richer predictive processing and active inference models of timing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VrvLG3Bm1C4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25167?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>We analyzed the expression of the perineuronal nets (PNNs) in mouse and marmoset brain. We found that in both species, its expression is present in many subcortical regions and it is strongly associated with the reproductive circuit. We showed that males show higher level of PNNs than females and in the posterior dorsal division of the medial amygdala (MeApd) the PNN is surrounding cells positive for the estrogen receptor alpha (Esr1). These data suggest a new role of PNN in controlling innate behavior circuits and sexual dimorphism.







Abstract
Perineuronal nets are extracellular glycoprotein structures that have been found on some neurons in the central nervous system and that have been shown to regulate their structural plasticity. Until now work on perineuronal nets has been focused on their role in cortical structures where they are selectively expressed on parvalbumin‐positive neurons and are reported to restrict the experience‐dependent plasticity of inhibitory afferents. Here, we examined the expression of perineuronal nets subcortically, showing that they are expressed in several discrete structures, including nuclei that comprise the brain network controlling reproductive behaviors (e.g., mounting, lordosis, aggression, and social defense). In particular, perineuronal nets were found in the posterior dorsal division of the medial amygdala, the medial preoptic nucleus, the posterior medial bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the ventrolateral ventromedial hypothalamus and adjacent tuberal nucleus, and the ventral premammillary nucleus in both the mouse and primate brain. Comparison of perineuronal nets in male and female mice revealed a significant sexually dimorphic expression, with expression found prominently on estrogen receptor expressing neurons in the medial amygdala. These findings suggest that perineuronal nets may be involved in regulating neural plasticity in the mammalian reproductive system.</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Cognitive functions in adult‐onset phenotypes of X‐linked adrenoleukodystrophy</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26141?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
X‐linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X‐ALD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive demyelination ranging from mild myelopathic forms (adrenomyeloneuropathy, AMN) to severe cerebral variants (adult cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy, ACALD). The study's aim was to compare cognitive function in adult‐onset X‐ALD phenotypes.


Methods
Cognitive function in various domains (intelligence, attention, memory, executive function, processing speed) was assessed in N = 172 adults (n = 117 AMN, n = 30 arrested ACALD, n = 25 acute ACALD) using comprehensive neuropsychological batteries. Phenotype differences were examined by analyses of variance.


Results
X‐ALD phenotypes significantly differed in non‐verbal intelligence, sustained attention, verbal encoding, non‐verbal recognition, and processing speed (ps &amp;lt; .050). No group differences emerged regarding verbal intelligence, verbal retrieval and recognition, and executive function (ps &amp;gt; .050). Specifically, patients with acute ACALD showed severe cognitive deficits compared to AMN and norm data, with largest effects on processing speed. Contrary, cognition was overall intact in AMN patients, independent of sex and corticospinal tract involvement, and those with arrested ACALD showed mild cognitive dysfunction, particularly in verbal encoding and processing speed.


Interpretation
Cerebral demyelination in X‐ALD patients causes white matter dementia, mainly characterized by an extreme slowdown in processing speed associated with deficits in attention and learning. Most AMN patients show intact cognitive function. Future prospective, longitudinal studies with more sensitive imaging techniques are required to clarify whether early mild cognitive dysfunction found in some AMN patients may be associated with subtle myelin abnormalities that do not yet appear as white matter lesions on cMRI but have the potential to serve as early predictors of later cerebral progression.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Object-based attention is a key component of the visual system, relevant for
perception, learning, and memory. Neurons tuned to features of attended objects
tend to be more active than those associated with non-attended objects. There
is a rich set of models of this phenomenon in computational neuroscience.
However, there is currently a divide between models that successfully match
physiological data but can only deal with extremely simple problems and models
of attention used in computer vision. For example, attention in the brain is
known to depend on top-down processing, whereas self-attention in deep learning
does not. Here, we propose an artificial neural network model of object-based
attention that captures the way in which attention is both top-down and
recurrent. Our attention model works well both on simple test stimuli, such as
those using images of handwritten digits, and on more complex stimuli, such as
natural images drawn from the COCO dataset. We find that our model replicates a
range of findings from neuroscience, including attention-invariant tuning,
inhibition of return, and attention-mediated scaling of activity. Understanding
object based attention is both computationally interesting and a key problem
for computational neuroscience.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It has been demonstrated many times that the behavior of the human visual
system is connected to the statistics of natural images. Since machine learning
relies on the statistics of training data as well, the above connection has
interesting implications when using perceptual distances (which mimic the
behavior of the human visual system) as a loss function. In this paper, we aim
to unravel the non-trivial relationship between the probability distribution of
the data, perceptual distances, and unsupervised machine learning. To this end,
we show that perceptual sensitivity is correlated with the probability of an
image in its close neighborhood. We also explore the relation between distances
induced by autoencoders and the probability distribution of the data used for
training them, as well as how these induced distances are correlated with human
perception. Finally, we discuss why perceptual distances might not lead to
noticeable gains in performance over standard Euclidean distances in common
image processing tasks except when data is scarce and the perceptual distance
provides regularization.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Theories for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been formulated at different
levels: ranging from physiological observations to perceptual and behavioural
descriptions. Understanding the physiological underpinnings of perceptual
traits in ASD remains a significant challenge in the field. Here we show how a
recurrent neural circuit model which had been optimized to perform
sampling-based inference and displays characteristic features of cortical
dynamics can help bridge this gap. The model was able to establish a
mechanistic link between two descriptive levels for ASD: a physiological level,
in terms of inhibitory dysfunction, neural variability and oscillations, and a
perceptual level, in terms of hypopriors in Bayesian computations. We took two
parallel paths: inducing hypopriors in the probabilistic model, and an
inhibitory dysfunction in the network model, which lead to consistent results
in terms of the represented posteriors, providing support for the view that
both descriptions might constitute two sides of the same coin.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04316</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Biological agents have meaningful interactions with their environment despite
the absence of a reward signal. In such instances, the agent can learn
preferred modes of behaviour that lead to predictable states -- necessary for
survival. In this paper, we pursue the notion that this learnt behaviour can be
a consequence of reward-free preference learning that ensures an appropriate
trade-off between exploration and preference satisfaction. For this, we
introduce a model-based Bayesian agent equipped with a preference learning
mechanism (pepper) using conjugate priors. These conjugate priors are used to
augment the expected free energy planner for learning preferences over states
(or outcomes) across time. Importantly, our approach enables the agent to learn
preferences that encourage adaptive behaviour at test time. We illustrate this
in the OpenAI Gym FrozenLake and the 3D mini-world environments -- with and
without volatility. Given a constant environment, these agents learn confident
(i.e., precise) preferences and act to satisfy them. Conversely, in a volatile
setting, perpetual preference uncertainty maintains exploratory behaviour. Our
experiments suggest that learnable (reward-free) preferences entail a trade-off
between exploration and preference satisfaction. Pepper offers a
straightforward framework suitable for designing adaptive agents when reward
functions cannot be predefined as in real environments.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04225</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain-inspired machine learning is gaining increasing consideration,
particularly in computer vision. Several studies investigated the inclusion of
top-down feedback connections in convolutional networks; however, it remains
unclear how and when these connections are functionally helpful. Here we
address this question in the context of object recognition under noisy
conditions. We consider deep convolutional networks (CNNs) as models of
feed-forward visual processing and implement Predictive Coding (PC) dynamics
through feedback connections (predictive feedback) trained for reconstruction
or classification of clean images. To directly assess the computational role of
predictive feedback in various experimental situations, we optimize and
interpret the hyper-parameters controlling the network's recurrent dynamics.
That is, we let the optimization process determine whether top-down connections
and predictive coding dynamics are functionally beneficial. Across different
model depths and architectures (3-layer CNN, ResNet18, and EfficientNetB0) and
against various types of noise (CIFAR100-C), we find that the network
increasingly relies on top-down predictions as the noise level increases; in
deeper networks, this effect is most prominent at lower layers. In addition,
the accuracy of the network implementing PC dynamics significantly increases
over time-steps, compared to its equivalent forward network. All in all, our
results provide novel insights relevant to Neuroscience by confirming the
computational role of feedback connections in sensory systems, and to Machine
Learning by revealing how these can improve the robustness of current vision

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Over-parameterized models can perfectly learn various types of data
distributions, however, generalization error is usually lower for real data in
comparison to artificial data. This suggests that the properties of data
distributions have an impact on generalization capability. This work focuses on
the search space defined by the input data and assumes that the correlation
between labels of neighboring input values influences generalization. If
correlation is low, the randomness of the input data space is high leading to
high generalization error. We suggest to measure the randomness of an input
data space using Maurer's universal. Results for synthetic classification tasks
and common image classification benchmarks (MNIST, CIFAR10, and Microsoft's
cats vs. dogs data set) find a high correlation between the randomness of input
data spaces and the generalization error of deep neural networks for binary
classification problems.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Neural Hybrid Automata: Learning Dynamics with Multiple Modes and Stochastic Transitions. (arXiv:2106.04165v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04165</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Effective control and prediction of dynamical systems often require
appropriate handling of continuous-time and discrete, event-triggered
processes. Stochastic hybrid systems (SHSs), common across engineering domains,
provide a formalism for dynamical systems subject to discrete, possibly
stochastic, state jumps and multi-modal continuous-time flows. Despite the
versatility and importance of SHSs across applications, a general procedure for
the explicit learning of both discrete events and multi-mode continuous
dynamics remains an open problem. This work introduces Neural Hybrid Automata
(NHAs), a recipe for learning SHS dynamics without a priori knowledge on the
number of modes and inter-modal transition dynamics. NHAs provide a systematic
inference method based on normalizing flows, neural differential equations and
self-supervision. We showcase NHAs on several tasks, including mode recovery
and flow learning in systems with stochastic transitions, and end-to-end
learning of hierarchical robot controllers.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04123</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;According to the embodied cognition perspective, linguistic negation may
block the motor simulations induced by language processing. Transcranial
magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied to the left primary motor cortex (hand
area) of monolingual Italian and German healthy participants during a rapid
serial visual presentation of sentences from their own language. In these
languages, the negative particle is located at the beginning and at the end of
the sentence, respectively. The study investigated whether the interruption of
the motor simulation processes, accounted for by reduced motor evoked
potentials (MEPs), takes place similarly in two languages differing on the
position of the negative marker. Different levels of sentence concreteness were
also manipulated to investigate if negation exerts generalized effects or if it
is affected by the semantic features of the sentence. Our findings indicate
that negation acts as a block on motor representations, but independently from
the language and words concreteness level.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Credit Assignment Through Broadcasting a Global Error Vector. (arXiv:2106.04089v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04089</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Backpropagation (BP) uses detailed, unit-specific feedback to train deep
neural networks (DNNs) with remarkable success. That biological neural circuits
appear to perform credit assignment, but cannot implement BP, implies the
existence of other powerful learning algorithms. Here, we explore the extent to
which a globally broadcast learning signal, coupled with local weight updates,
enables training of DNNs. We present both a learning rule, called global
error-vector broadcasting (GEVB), and a class of DNNs, called vectorized
nonnegative networks (VNNs), in which this learning rule operates. VNNs have
vector-valued units and nonnegative weights past the first layer. The GEVB
learning rule generalizes three-factor Hebbian learning, updating each weight
by an amount proportional to the inner product of the presynaptic activation
and a globally broadcast error vector when the postsynaptic unit is active. We
prove that these weight updates are matched in sign to the gradient, enabling
accurate credit assignment. Moreover, at initialization, these updates are
exactly proportional to the gradient in the limit of infinite network width.
GEVB matches the performance of BP in VNNs, and in some cases outperforms
direct feedback alignment (DFA) applied in conventional networks. Unlike DFA,
GEVB successfully trains convolutional layers. Altogether, our theoretical and
empirical results point to a surprisingly powerful role for a global learning
signal in training DNNs.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Geometric Semantic Genetic Programming (GSGP) is a state-of-the-art machine
learning method based on evolutionary computation. GSGP performs search
operations directly at the level of program semantics, which can be done more
efficiently then operating at the syntax level like most GP systems. Efficient
implementations of GSGP in C++ exploit this fact, but not to its full
potential. This paper presents GSGP-CUDA, the first CUDA implementation of GSGP
and the most efficient, which exploits the intrinsic parallelism of GSGP using
GPUs. Results show speedups greater than 1,000X relative to the
state-of-the-art sequential implementation.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04026</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain-computer interface (BCI) is used for communication between humans and
devices by recognizing status and intention of humans. Communication between
humans and a drone using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is one of the most
challenging issues in the BCI domain. In particular, the control of drone
swarms (the direction and formation) has more advantages compared to the
control of a drone. The visual imagery (VI) paradigm is that subjects visually
imagine specific objects or scenes. Reduction of the variability among EEG
signals of subjects is essential for practical BCI-based systems. In this
study, we proposed the subepoch-wise feature encoder (SEFE) to improve the
performances in the subject-independent tasks by using the VI dataset. This
study is the first attempt to demonstrate the possibility of generalization
among subjects in the VI-based BCI. We used the leave-one-subject-out
cross-validation for evaluating the performances. We obtained higher
performances when including our proposed module than excluding our proposed
module. The DeepConvNet with SEFE showed the highest performance of 0.72 among
six different decoding models. Hence, we demonstrated the feasibility of
decoding the VI dataset in the subject-independent task with robust
performances by using our proposed module.

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome (CCAS) has been consistently described in patients with acute/subacute cerebellar injuries. However, studies with chronic patients have had controversial findings that have not been explored with new cerebellar-target tests, such as the CCAS scale (CCAS-S). The objective of this research is to prove and contrast the usefulness of the CCAS-S and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test to evaluate cognitive/affective impairments in patients with chronic acquired cerebellar lesions, and to map the cerebellar areas whose lesions correlated with dysfunctions in these tests. CCAS-S and MoCA were administrated to 22 patients with isolated chronic cerebellar strokes and a matched comparison group. The neural bases underpinning both tests were explored with multivariate lesion-symptom mapping (LSM) methods. MoCA and CCAS-S had an adequate test performance with efficient discrimination between patients and healthy volunteers. However, only impairments determined by the CCAS-S resulted in significant regional localization within the cerebellum. Specifically, patients with chronic cerebellar lesions in right-lateralized posterolateral regions manifested cognitive impairments inherent to CCAS. These findings concurred with the anterior-sensorimotor/posterior-cognitive dichotomy in the human cerebellum and revealed clinically intra- and cross-lobular significant regions (portions of right lobule VI, VII, Crus I-II) for verbal tasks that overlap with the “language” functional boundaries in the cerebellum. Our findings prove the usefulness of MoCA and CCAS-S to reveal cognitive impairments in patients with chronic acquired cerebellar lesions. This study extends the understanding of long-term CCAS and introduces multivariate LSM methods to identify clinically intra- and cross-lobular significant regions underpinning chronic CCAS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Adult Age Differences in Self-Reported Pain and Anterior CSF Space in Chiari Malformation</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-021-01289-w</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Chiari malformation type I (CMI) is a neural disorder with sensory, cognitive, and motor defects, as well as headaches. Radiologically, the cerebellar tonsils extend below the foramen magnum. To date, the relationships among adult age, brain morphometry, surgical status, and symptom severity in CMI are unknown. The objective of this study was to better understand the relationships among these variables using causal modeling techniques. Adult CMI patients (80% female) who either had (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 150) or had not (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 151) undergone posterior fossa decompression surgery were assessed using morphometric measures derived from magnetic resonance images (MRI). MRI-based morphometry showed that the area of the CSF pocket anterior to the cervico-medullary junction (anterior CSF space) correlated with age at the time of MRI (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; =  − .21). Also, self-reported pain increased with age (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = .11) and decreased with anterior CSF space (r =  − .18). Age differences in self-reported pain were mediated by anterior CSF space in the cervical spine area—and this effect was particularly salient for non-decompressed CMI patients. As CMI patients age, the anterior CSF space decreases, and this is associated with increased pain—especially for non-decompressed CMI patients. It is recommended that further consideration of age-related decreases in anterior CSF space in CMI patients be given in future research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Spinocerebellar ataxias type 1 (SCA1) is an autosomal dominant disease usually manifesting in adulthood. We performed a prospective 1-year longitudinal study in 14 presymptomatic mutation carriers (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;pre&lt;/em&gt;SCA1), 11 ataxic patients, and 21 healthy controls. SCA1 patients had a median disease duration of 6 years (range 2–16) and SARA score of 7 points (range 3.5–20). &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Pre&lt;/em&gt;SCA1 had an estimated time before disease onset of 9.7 years (range 4–30), and no signs of ataxia. At baseline, SCA1 patients significantly differed from controls in SARA score (Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia), cognitive tests, and structural MRI measures. Significant volume loss was found in cerebellum, brainstem, basal ganglia, and cortical thinning in frontal, temporal, and occipital regions. &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Pre&lt;/em&gt;SCA1 did not differ from controls. At 1-year follow-up, SCA1 patients showed significant increase in SARA score, and decreased volume of cerebellum (− 0.6%), pons (− 5.5%), superior cerebellar peduncles (− 10.7%), and midbrain (− 3.0%). Signs of disease progression were also observed in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;pre&lt;/em&gt;SCA1 subjects, with increased SARA score and reduced total cerebellar volume. Our exploratory study suggests that clinical scores and MRI measures provide valuable data to monitor and quantify the earliest changes associated with the preclinical and the symptomatic phases of SCA1 disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Glioma is highly lethal because of its high malignancy. Ubiquitination, a type of ubiquitin-dependent protein modification, has been reported to play an oncogenic or tumor-suppressive role in glioma development, depending on the targets. Ring finger protein 139 (RNF139) is a membrane-bound E3 ubiquitin ligase serving as a tumor suppressor by ubiquitylation-dependently suppressing cell growth. Herein, we firstly confirmed the abnormal downregulation of RNF139 in glioma tissues and cell lines. In glioma cells, ectopic RNF139 overexpression could inhibit, whereas RNF139 knockdown could aggravate the aggressive behaviors of glioma cells, including hyperproliferation, migration, and invasion. Moreover, in two glioma cell lines, RNF139 overexpression inhibited, whereas RNF139 knockdown enhanced the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 (AKT). In a word, we demonstrate the aberration in RNF139 expression in glioma tissue samples and cell lines. RNF139 serves as a tumor-suppressor in glioma by inhibiting glioma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and promoting glioma cell apoptosis through regulating PI3K/AKT signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Desminopathies (MIM*601419) are clinically heterogeneous, manifesting with myopathy and/or cardiomyopathy and with intra-sarcoplasmic desmin-positive deposits. They have either an autosomal dominant (AD) or recessive (AR) pattern of inheritance. Desmin is a crucial intermediate filament protein regulating various cellular functions in muscle cells. Here, we report a 13-year-old girl, born of second-degree consanguineous parents, with normal developmental milestones, who presented with dilated cardiomyopathy, respiratory insufficiency and predominant distal upper limb weakness. A striking feature on muscle biopsy was the presence of a peripheral chain of nuclei in addition to myopathic features. Immunostaining showed complete lack of desmin expression, further confirmed by western blot analysis. Ultrastructurally, subsarcolemmal granular material, expanded Z-band aggregation, distortion of myofilaments, focal Z-band streaming, lobed and clustered myonuclei were observed. Next-generation sequencing revealed a novel homozygous nonsense mutation c.448C&amp;gt;T, p.R150X in the patient, while the parents were heterozygous carriers. Single mitochondrial DNA deletion and isolated complex IV deficiency were noted. Our findings add to the ever-expanding phenotype and molecular spectrum of desminopathies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Octopus cells in the posteroventral cochlear nucleus exhibit characteristic onset responses to broad band transients but are little investigated in response to more complex sound stimuli. In this paper, we propose a phenomenological, but biophysically motivated, modeling approach that allows to simulate responses of large populations of octopus cells to arbitrary sound pressure waves. The model depends on only few parameters and reproduces basic physiological characteristics like onset firing and phase locking to amplitude modulations. Simulated responses to speech stimuli suggest that octopus cells are particularly sensitive to high-frequency transients in natural sounds and their sustained firing to phonemes provides a population code for sound level.

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Vestibular migraine (VM) is one of the most common causes of vertigo in clinical practice but it is not always easy to make the correct diagnosis. Our aims were to find out how VM patients differ from migraine only (MO) patients, to evaluate co-morbid depression in these two groups and to determine if their disease has an effect on their quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We studied 50 definite VM and 35 MO patients. Each patient was asked about: age of onset, duration of headaches, presence of aura, headache characteristics, triggering factors, associated features, motion sickness history and family history of migraine. VM patients were also asked about their vertigo attacks and accompanying symptoms. Each patient also completed the following questionnaires: (1) Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS); (2) headache severity with VAS (Visual Analog Scale); (3) Allodynia Symptom Checklist (ASC-12); (4) Beck Depression Inventory (BDI); (5) World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire Short Form-12 (WHOQL-SF12); (6) Activities Specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC). VM patients also completed the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We found that VM patients were more likely than MO patients to be female, post-menopausal, depressed, motion sick, complaining of imbalance and of food-triggered headaches. In contrast, MO patients were more likely than VM patients to have severe headaches and that these can be triggered by certain odors and by noise.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Our findings showed differences between VM and MO patients and attention to these differences could help clinicians diagnose, characterize and manage their VM patients.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Contributions of implicit and explicit memories to sensorimotor adaptation of movement extent during goal-directed reaching</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We examined how implicit and explicit memories contribute to sensorimotor adaptation of movement extent during goal-directed reaching. Twenty subjects grasped the handle of a horizontal planar robot that rendered spring-like resistance to movement. Subjects made rapid “out-and-back” reaches to capture a remembered visual target at the point of maximal reach extent. The robot’s resistance changed unpredictably between reaches, inducing target capture errors that subjects attempted to correct from one trial to the next. Each subject performed over 400 goal-directed reaching trials. Some trials were performed without concurrent visual cursor feedback of hand motion. Some trials required self-assessment of performance between trials, whereby subjects reported peak reach extent on the most recent trial. This was done by either moving a cursor on a horizontal display (visual self-assessment), or by moving the robot’s handle back to the recalled location (proprioceptive self-assessment). Control condition trials performed either without or with concurrent visual cursor feedback of hand motion did not require self-assessments. We used step-wise linear regression analyses to quantify the extent to which prior reach errors and explicit memories of reach extent contribute to subsequent reach performance. Consistent with prior reports, providing concurrent visual feedback of hand motion increased reach accuracy and reduced the impact of past performance errors on future performance, relative to the corresponding no-vision control condition. By contrast, we found no impact of interposed self-assessment on subsequent reach performance or on how prior target capture errors influence subsequent reach performance. Self-assessments were biased toward the remembered target location and they spanned a compressed range of values relative to actual reach extents, demonstrating that declarative memories of reach performance systematically differed from actual performances. We found that multilinear regression could best account for observed data variability when the regression model included only implicit memories of prior reach performance; including explicit memories (self-assessments) in the model did not improve its predictive accuracy. We conclude therefore that explicit memories of prior reach performance do not contribute to implicit sensorimotor adaptation of movement extent during goal-directed reaching under conditions of environmental uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The hypothyroid rats also showed weight loss, much longer immobility time in tail suspension test and forced swimming test. Besides, 5 weeks of PTU administration was associated with significantly decreased expression levels of 5-HT&lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus inline-equation id-i-eq7&quot;&gt;

In conclusion, our results suggest that hypothyroidism induces depressive behaviors through the influence of the serotonin system, and the decreased expression of the 5-HT&lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus inline-equation id-i-eq9&quot;&gt;

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: How groove in music affects gait</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00221-021-06083-y</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) is a gait intervention in which gait-disordered patients synchronise footsteps to music or metronome cues. Musical ‘groove’, the tendency of music to induce movement, has previously been shown to be associated with faster gait, however, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; groove affects gait remains unclear. One mechanism by which groove may affect gait is that of beat salience: music that is higher in groove has more salient musical beats, and higher beat salience might reduce the cognitive demands of perceiving the beat and synchronizing footsteps to it. If groove’s effects on gait are driven primarily by the impact of beat salience on cognitive demands, then groove’s effects might only be present in contexts in which it is relevant to reduce cognitive demands. Such contexts could include task parameters that increase cognitive demands (such as the requirement to synchronise to the beat), or individual differences that may make synchronisation more cognitively demanding. Here, we examined whether high beat salience can account for the effects of high-groove music on gait. First, we increased the beat salience of low-groove music to be similar to that of high-groove music by embedding metronome beats in low and high-groove music. We examined whether low-groove music with high beat salience elicited similar effects on gait as high-groove music. Second, we examined the effect of removing the requirement to synchronise footsteps to the beat (i.e., allowing participants to walk freely with the music), which is thought to remove the cognitive demand of synchronizing movements to the beat. We tested two populations thought to be sensitive to the cognitive demands of synchronisation, weak beat-perceivers and older adults. We found that increasing the beat salience of low-groove music increased stride velocity, but strides were still slower than with high-groove music. Similarly, removing the requirement to synchronise elicited faster, less variable gait, and reduced bias for stability, but high-groove music still elicited faster strides than low-groove music. These findings suggest that beat salience contributes to groove’s effect on gait, but it does not fully account for it. Despite reducing task difficulty by equalizing beat salience and removing the requirement to synchronise, high-groove music still elicited faster, less variable gait. Therefore, other properties of groove also appear to play a role in groove’s effect on gait.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.678837</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Oxidative stress appears to be a key feature of many neurodegenerative diseases either as a cause or consequence of disease. A range of molecules are subject to oxidation, but in particular, proteins are an important target and measure of oxidative stress. Proteins are subject to a range of oxidative modifications at reactive cysteine residues, and depending on the level of oxidative stress, these modifications may be reversible or irreversible. A range of experimental approaches has been developed to characterize cysteine oxidation of proteins. In particular, mass spectrometry-based proteomic methods have emerged as a powerful means to identify and quantify cysteine oxidation sites on a proteome scale; however, their application to study neurodegenerative diseases is limited to date. Here we provide a guide to these approaches and highlight the under-exploited utility of these methods to measure oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases for biomarker discovery, target engagement and to understand disease mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transcriptional regulation is essential for the correct functioning of cells during development and in postnatal life. The basic Helix-loop-Helix (bHLH) superfamily of transcription factors is well conserved throughout evolution and plays critical roles in tissue development and tissue maintenance. A subgroup of this family, called neural lineage bHLH factors, is critical in the development and function of the central nervous system. In this review, we will focus on the function of one subgroup of neural lineage bHLH factors, the Neurod family. The Neurod family has four members: Neurod1, Neurod2, Neurod4, and Neurod6. Available evidence shows that these four factors are key during the development of the cerebral cortex but also in other regions of the central nervous system, such as the cerebellum, the brainstem, and the spinal cord. We will also discuss recent reports that link the dysfunction of these transcription factors to neurological disorders in humans.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.656856</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Handwriting is a complex activity including motor planning and visuomotor integration and referring to some brain areas identified as “writing centers.” Although temporal features of handwriting are as important as spatial ones, to our knowledge, there is no evidence of the description of specific brain areas associated with handwriting tempo. People with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) show handwriting impairments that are mainly referred to as the temporal features of the task. The aim of this work was to assess differences in the brain activation pattern elicited by handwriting between PwMS and healthy controls (HC), with the final goal of identifying possible areas specific for handwriting tempo. Subjects were asked to write a sentence at their spontaneous speed. PwMS differed only in temporal handwriting features from HC and showed reduced activation with a subset of the clusters observed in HC. Spearman’s correlation analysis was performed between handwriting temporal parameters and the activity in the brain areas resulting from the contrast analysis, HC &amp;gt; PwMS. We found that the right inferior parietal lobule (IPL) negatively correlated with the duration of the sentence, indicating that the higher the right IPL activity, the faster the handwriting performance. We propose that the right IPL might be considered a “writing tempo center.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Disrupted Asymmetry of Inter- and Intra-Hemispheric Functional Connectivity at Rest in Medication-Free Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.634557</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Disrupted functional asymmetry of cerebral hemispheres may be altered in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, little is known about whether anomalous brain asymmetries originate from inter- and/or intra-hemispheric functional connectivity (FC) at rest in OCD. In this study, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was applied to 40 medication-free patients with OCD and 38 gender-, age-, and education-matched healthy controls (HCs). Data were analyzed using the parameter of asymmetry (PAS) and support vector machine methods. Patients with OCD showed significantly increased PAS in the left posterior cingulate cortex, left precentral gyrus/postcentral gyrus, and right inferior occipital gyrus and decreased PAS in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), bilateral middle cingulate cortex (MCC), left inferior parietal lobule, and left cerebellum Crus I. A negative correlation was found between decreased PAS in the left DLPFC and Yale–Brown Obsessive-compulsive Scale compulsive behavior scores in the patients. Furthermore, decreased PAS in the bilateral MCC could be used to distinguish OCD from HCs with a sensitivity of 87.50%, an accuracy of 88.46%, and a specificity of 89.47%. These results highlighted the contribution of disrupted asymmetry of intra-hemispheric FC within and outside the cortico-striato-thalamocortical circuits at rest in the pathophysiology of OCD, and reduced intra-hemispheric FC in the bilateral MCC may serve as a potential biomarker to classify individuals with OCD from HCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Cross-Subject EEG Emotion Recognition With Self-Organized Graph Neural Network</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.611653</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As a physiological process and high-level cognitive behavior, emotion is an important subarea in neuroscience research. Emotion recognition across subjects based on brain signals has attracted much attention. Due to individual differences across subjects and the low signal-to-noise ratio of EEG signals, the performance of conventional emotion recognition methods is relatively poor. In this paper, we propose a self-organized graph neural network (SOGNN) for cross-subject EEG emotion recognition. Unlike the previous studies based on pre-constructed and fixed graph structure, the graph structure of SOGNN are dynamically constructed by self-organized module for each signal. To evaluate the cross-subject EEG emotion recognition performance of our model, leave-one-subject-out experiments are conducted on two public emotion recognition datasets, SEED and SEED-IV. The SOGNN is able to achieve state-of-the-art emotion recognition performance. Moreover, we investigated the performance variances of the models with different graph construction techniques or features in different frequency bands. Furthermore, we visualized the graph structure learned by the proposed model and found that part of the structure coincided with previous neuroscience research. The experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model for cross-subject EEG emotion recognition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: ConvDip: A Convolutional Neural Network for Better EEG Source Imaging</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.569918</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The electroencephalography (EEG) is a well-established non-invasive method in neuroscientific research and clinical diagnostics. It provides a high temporal but low spatial resolution of brain activity. To gain insight about the spatial dynamics of the EEG, one has to solve the inverse problem, i.e., finding the neural sources that give rise to the recorded EEG activity. The inverse problem is ill-posed, which means that more than one configuration of neural sources can evoke one and the same distribution of EEG activity on the scalp. Artificial neural networks have been previously used successfully to find either one or two dipole sources. These approaches, however, have never solved the inverse problem in a distributed dipole model with more than two dipole sources. We present ConvDip, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, that solves the EEG inverse problem in a distributed dipole model based on simulated EEG data. We show that (1) ConvDip learned to produce inverse solutions from a single time point of EEG data and (2) outperforms state-of-the-art methods on all focused performance measures. (3) It is more flexible when dealing with varying number of sources, produces less ghost sources and misses less real sources than the comparison methods. It produces plausible inverse solutions for real EEG recordings from human participants. (4) The trained network needs &amp;lt;40 ms for a single prediction. Our results qualify ConvDip as an efficient and easy-to-apply novel method for source localization in EEG data, with high relevance for clinical applications, e.g., in epileptology and real-time applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Approximate Number Sense in Students With Severe Hearing Loss: A Modality-Neutral Cognitive Ability</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.688144</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Approximate Number System (ANS) allows humans and non-human animals to estimate large quantities without counting. It is most commonly studied in visual contexts (i.e., with displays containing different numbers of dots), although the ANS may operate on all approximate quantities regardless of modality (e.g., estimating the number of a series of auditory tones). Previous research has shown that there is a link between ANS and mathematics abilities, and that this link is resilient to differences in visual experience (Kanjlia et al., 2018). However, little is known about the function of the ANS and its relationship to mathematics abilities in the absence of other types of sensory input. Here, we investigated the acuity of the ANS and its relationship with mathematics abilities in a group of students from the Sichuan Province in China, half of whom were deaf. We found, consistent with previous research, that ANS acuity improves with age. We found that mathematics ability was predicted by Non-verbal IQ and Inhibitory Control, but not visual working memory capacity or Attention Network efficiencies. Even above and beyond these predictors, ANS ability still accounted for unique variance in mathematics ability. Notably, there was no interaction with hearing, which indicates that the role played by the ANS in explaining mathematics competence is not modulated by hearing capacity. Finally, we found that age, Non-verbal IQ and Visual Working Memory capacity were predictive of ANS performance when controlling for other factors. In fact, although students with hearing loss performed slightly worse than students with normal hearing on the ANS task, hearing was no longer significantly predictive of ANS performance once other factors were taken into account. These results indicate that the ANS is able to develop at a consistent pace with other cognitive abilities in the absence of auditory experience, and that its relationship with mathematics ability is not contingent on sensory input from hearing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Genome-Wide Association Study of Motor Coordination</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.669902</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The ability to finely control our movement is key to achieving many of the educational milestones and life-skills we develop throughout our lives. Despite the centrality of coordination to early development, there is a vast gap in our understanding of the underlying biology. Like most complex traits, both genetics and environment influence motor coordination, however, the specific genes, early environmental risk factors and molecular pathways are unknown. Previous studies have shown that about 5% of school-age children experience unexplained difficulties with motor coordination. These children are said to have Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD). For children with DCD, these motor coordination difficulties significantly impact their everyday life and learning. DCD is associated with poorer academic achievement, reduced quality of life, it can constrain career opportunities and increase the risk of mental health issues in adulthood. Despite the high prevalence of coordination difficulties, many children remain undiagnosed by healthcare professionals. Compounding under-diagnosis in the clinic, research into the etiology of DCD is severely underrepresented in the literature. Here we present the first genome-wide association study to examine the genetic basis of early motor coordination in the context of motor difficulties. Using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children we generate a derived measure of motor coordination from four components of the Movement Assessment Battery for Children, providing an overall measure of coordination across the full range of ability. We perform the first genome-wide association analysis focused on motor coordination (N = 4542). No single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) met the threshold for genome-wide significance, however, 59 SNPs showed suggestive associations. Three regions contained multiple suggestively associated SNPs, within five preliminary candidate genes: IQSEC1, LRCC1, SYNJ2B2, ADAM20, and ADAM21. Association to the gene IQSEC1 suggests a potential link to axon guidance and dendritic projection processes as a potential underlying mechanism of motor coordination difficulties. This represents an interesting potential mechanism, and whilst further validation is essential, it generates a direct window into the biology of motor coordination difficulties. This research has identified potential biological drivers of DCD, a first step towards understanding this common, yet neglected neurodevelopmental disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neural Entrainment Meets Behavior: The Stability Index as a Neural Outcome Measure of Auditory-Motor Coupling</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.668918</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Understanding rhythmic behavior in the context of coupled auditory and motor systems has been of interest to neurological rehabilitation, in particular, to facilitate walking. Recent work based on behavioral measures revealed an entrainment effect of auditory rhythms on motor rhythms. In this study, we propose a method to compute the neural component of such a process from an electroencephalographic (EEG) signal. A simple auditory-motor synchronization paradigm was used, where 28 healthy participants were instructed to synchronize their finger-tapping with a metronome. The computation of the neural outcome measure was carried out in two blocks. In the first block, we used Generalized Eigendecomposition (GED) to reduce the data dimensionality to the component which maximally entrained to the metronome frequency. The scalp topography pointed at brain activity over contralateral sensorimotor regions. In the second block, we computed instantaneous frequency from the analytic signal of the extracted component. This returned a time-varying measure of frequency fluctuations, whose standard deviation provided our “stability index” as a neural outcome measure of auditory-motor coupling. Finally, the proposed neural measure was validated by conducting a correlation analysis with a set of behavioral outcomes from the synchronization task: resultant vector length, relative phase angle, mean asynchrony, and tempo matching. Significant moderate negative correlations were found with the first three measures, suggesting that the stability index provided a quantifiable neural outcome measure of entrainment, with selectivity towards phase-correction mechanisms. We address further adoption of the proposed approach, especially with populations where sensorimotor abilities are compromised by an underlying pathological condition. The impact of using stability index can potentially be used as an outcome measure to assess rehabilitation protocols, and possibly provide further insight into neuropathological models of auditory-motor coupling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Bilateral Amygdala Radio-Frequency Ablation for Refractory Aggressive Behavior Alters Local Cortical Thickness to a Pattern Found in Non-refractory Patients</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.653631</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aggressive behaviors comprise verbal and/or physical aggression directed toward oneself, others, or objects and are highly prevalent among psychiatric patients, especially patients diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and severe intellectual disabilities. Some of these patients are considered refractory to treatment, and functional neurosurgery targeting the amygdala can result in widespread plastic brain changes that might reflect ceasing of some abnormal brain function, offering symptom alleviation. This study investigated cortical thickness changes in refractory aggressive behavior patients that were treated with bilateral amygdala ablation and compared to control patients presenting non-refractory aggressive behavior [three refractory and seven non-refractory patients, all males diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disabilities]. The Overt Aggression Scale (OAS) was used to quantify behavior and magnetic resonance imaging was performed to investigate cortical thickness. Before surgery, both groups presented similar total OAS score, however refractory patients presented higher physical aggression against others. After surgery the refractory group showed 88% average reduction of aggressive behavior. Imaging analysis showed that while refractory patients present an overall reduction in cortical thickness compared to non-refractory patients across both timepoints, the local pattern of thickness difference found in areas of the neurocircuitry of aggressive behavior present before surgery is diminished and no longer detected after surgery. These results corroborate the hypotheses on induction of widespread neuronal plasticity following functional neurosurgical procedures resulting in modifications in brain morphology and improvement in behavior. Further studies are necessary to determine the underlying cause of these morphological changes and to better understand and improve treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Oxytocin Regulates Synaptic Transmission in the Sensory Cortices in a Developmentally Dynamic Manner</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.673439</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The development and stabilization of neuronal circuits are critical to proper brain function. Synapses are the building blocks of neural circuits. Here we examine the effects of the neuropeptide oxytocin on synaptic transmission in L2/3 pyramidal neurons of the barrel field of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1BF). We find that perfusion of oxytocin onto acute brain slices significantly increases the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSC) of S1BF L2/3 pyramidal neurons at P10 and P14, but reduces it at the later ages of P22 and P28; the transition occurs at around P18. Since oxytocin expression is itself regulated by sensory experience, we also examine whether the effects of oxytocin on excitatory synaptic transmission correlate with that of sensory experience. We find that, indeed, the effects of sensory experience and oxytocin on excitatory synaptic transmission of L2/3 pyramidal neurons both peak at around P14 and plateau around P18, suggesting that they regulate a specific form of synaptic plasticity in L2/3 pyramidal neurons, with a sensitive/critical period ending around P18. Consistently, oxytocin receptor (Oxtr) expression in glutamatergic neurons of the upper layers of the cerebral cortex peaks around P14. By P28, however, Oxtr expression becomes more prominent in GABAergic neurons, especially somatostatin (SST) neurons. At P28, oxytocin perfusion increases inhibitory synaptic transmission and reduces excitatory synaptic transmission, effects that result in a net reduction of neuronal excitation, in contrast to increased excitation at P14. Using oxytocin knockout mice and Oxtr conditional knockout mice, we show that loss-of-function of oxytocin affects baseline excitatory synaptic transmission, while Oxtr is required for oxytocin-induced changes in excitatory synaptic transmission, at both P14 and P28. Together, these results demonstrate that oxytocin has complex and dynamic functions in regulating synaptic transmission in cortical L2/3 pyramidal neurons. These findings add to existing knowledge of the function of oxytocin in regulating neural circuit development and plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.682683</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dementia describes a set of symptoms that occur in neurodegenerative disorders and that is characterized by gradual loss of cognitive and behavioral functions. Recently, non-invasive neurofeedback training has been explored as a potential complementary treatment for patients suffering from dementia or mild cognitive impairment. Here we systematically reviewed studies that explored neurofeedback training protocols based on electroencephalography or functional magnetic resonance imaging for these groups of patients. From a total of 1,912 screened studies, 10 were included in our final sample (N = 208 independent participants in experimental and N = 81 in the control groups completing the primary endpoint). We compared the clinical efficacy across studies, and evaluated their experimental designs and reporting quality. In most studies, patients showed improved scores in different cognitive tests. However, data from randomized controlled trials remains scarce, and clinical evidence based on standardized metrics is still inconclusive. In light of recent meta-research developments in the neurofeedback field and beyond, quality and reporting practices of individual studies are reviewed. We conclude with recommendations on best practices for future studies that investigate the effects of neurofeedback training in dementia and cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/67681</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/i&gt; is an intracellular parasite that causes a long-term latent infection of neurons. Using a custom MATLAB-based mapping program in combination with a mouse model that allows us to permanently mark neurons injected with parasite proteins, we found that &lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/i&gt;-injected neurons (TINs) are heterogeneously distributed in the brain, primarily localizing to the cortex followed by the striatum. In addition, we determined that cortical TINs are commonly (&amp;gt;50%) excitatory neurons (FoxP2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and that striatal TINs are often (&amp;gt;65%) medium spiny neurons (MSNs) (FoxP2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). By performing single neuron patch-clamping on striatal TINs and neighboring uninfected MSNs, we discovered that TINs have highly aberrant electrophysiology. As approximately 90% of TINs will die by 8 weeks post-infection, this abnormal physiology suggests that injection with &lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/i&gt; protein— either directly or indirectly— affects neuronal health and survival. Collectively, these data offer the first insights into which neurons interact with &lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/i&gt; and how these interactions alter neuron physiology &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/67130</link>
	<content:encoded>The COVID-19 pandemic originating in the Wuhan province of China in late 2019 has impacted global health, causing increased mortality among elderly patients and individuals with comorbid conditions. During the passage of the virus through affected populations, it has undergone mutations, some of which have recently been linked with increased viral load and prognostic complexities. Several of these variants are point mutations that are difficult to diagnose using the gold standard quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) method and necessitates widespread sequencing which is expensive, has long turn-around times, and requires high viral load for calling mutations accurately. Here, we repurpose the high specificity of &lt;i&gt;Francisella&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;novicida&lt;/i&gt; Cas9 (FnCas9) to identify mismatches in the target for developing a lateral flow assay that can be successfully adapted for the simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV2 infection as well as for detecting point mutations in the sequence of the virus obtained from patient samples. We report the detection of the S gene mutation N501Y (present across multiple variant lineages of SARS-CoV2) within an hour using lateral flow paper strip chemistry. The results were corroborated using deep sequencing on multiple wild type (n=37) and mutant (n=22) viral RNA samples with a sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 97%. The design principle can be rapidly adapted for other mutations (as shown also for E484K and T716I) highlighting the advantages of quick optimization and roll-out of CRISPR diagnostics (CRISPRDx) for disease surveillance even beyond COVID-19.

	<title>eLife: Allosteric conformational ensembles have unlimited capacity for integrating information</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65498</link>
	<content:encoded>Integration of binding information by macromolecular entities is fundamental to cellular functionality. Recent work has shown that such integration cannot be explained by pairwise cooperativities, in which binding is modulated by binding at another site. Higher-order cooperativities (HOCs), in which binding is collectively modulated by multiple other binding events, appear to be necessary but an appropriate mechanism has been lacking. We show here that HOCs arise through allostery, in which effective cooperativity emerges indirectly from an ensemble of dynamically interchanging conformations. Conformational ensembles play important roles in many cellular processes but their integrative capabilities remain poorly understood. We show that sufficiently complex ensembles can implement any form of information integration achievable without energy expenditure, including all patterns of HOCs. Our results provide a rigorous biophysical foundation for analysing the integration of binding information through allostery. We discuss the implications for eukaryotic gene regulation, where complex conformational dynamics accompanies widespread information integration.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63972</link>
	<content:encoded>Chromatin, which consists of DNA and associated proteins, contains genetic information and is a mechanical component of the nucleus. Heterochromatic histone methylation controls nucleus and chromosome stiffness, but the contribution of heterochromatin protein HP1α (CBX5) is unknown. We used a novel HP1α auxin-inducible degron human cell line to rapidly degrade HP1α. Degradation did not alter transcription, local chromatin compaction, or histone methylation, but did decrease chromatin stiffness. Single-nucleus micromanipulation reveals that HP1α is essential to chromatin-based mechanics and maintains nuclear morphology, separate from histone methylation. Further experiments with dimerization-deficient HP1α&lt;sup&gt;I165E&lt;/sup&gt; indicate that chromatin crosslinking via HP1α dimerization is critical, while polymer simulations demonstrate the importance of chromatin-chromatin crosslinkers in mechanics. In mitotic chromosomes, HP1α similarly bolsters stiffness while aiding in mitotic alignment and faithful segregation. HP1α is therefore a critical chromatin-crosslinking protein that provides mechanical strength to chromosomes and the nucleus throughout the cell cycle and supports cellular functions.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63698</link>
	<content:encoded>Germ granules are protein-RNA condensates that segregate with the embryonic germline. In &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; embryos, germ (P) granule assembly requires MEG-3, an intrinsically-disordered protein that forms RNA-rich condensates on the surface of PGL condensates at the core of P granules. MEG-3 is related to the GCNA family and contains an N-terminal disordered region (IDR) and a predicted ordered C-terminus featuring an HMG-like motif (HMGL). We find that MEG-3 is modular protein that uses its IDR to bind RNA and its C-terminus to drive condensation. The HMGL motif mediates binding to PGL-3 and is required for co-assembly of MEG-3 and PGL-3 condensates &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Mutations in HMGL cause MEG-3 and PGL-3 to form separate condensates that no longer co-segregate to the germline or recruit RNA. Our findings highlight the importance of protein-based condensation mechanisms and condensate-condensate interactions in the assembly of RNA-rich germ granules.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels participate in calcium ion (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) influx and intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release. TRP channels have not been studied in &lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/i&gt; or any other apicomplexan parasite.

TgTRPPL-2 localizes to the plasma membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of &lt;i&gt;T. gondii&lt;/i&gt;. The &lt;i&gt;ΔTgTRPPL-2&lt;/i&gt; mutant was defective in growth and cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx from both extracellular and intracellular sources. Heterologous expression of TgTRPPL-2 in HEK-3KO cells allowed its functional characterization. Patching of ER-nuclear membranes demonstrates that TgTRPPL-2 is a non-selective cation channel that conducts Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Pharmacological blockers of TgTRPPL-2 inhibit Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx and parasite growth. This is the first report of an apicomplexan ion channel that conducts Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and may initiate a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling cascade that leads to the stimulation of motility, invasion and egress.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58688</link>
	<content:encoded>Only a fraction of cancer patients benefits from immune checkpoint inhibitors. This may be partly due to the dense extracellular matrix (ECM) that forms a barrier for T cells. Comparing 5 preclinical mouse tumor models with heterogeneous tumor microenvironments, we aimed to relate the rate of tumor stiffening with the remodeling of ECM architecture and to determine how these features affect intratumoral T cell migration. An ECM-targeted strategy, based on the inhibition of lysyl oxidase (LOX) was used. In vivo stiffness measurements were found to be strongly correlated with tumor growth and ECM crosslinking but negatively correlated with T cell migration. Interfering with collagen stabilization reduces ECM content and tumor stiffness leading to improved T cell migration and increased efficacy of anti-PD-1 blockade. This study highlights the rationale of mechanical characterizations in solid tumors to understand resistance to immunotherapy and of combining treatment strategies targeting the ECM with anti-PD-1 therapy.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Spatiotemporally flexible subnetworks reveal the quasi-cyclic nature of integration and segregation in the human brain.</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.09.447672v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Though the organization of functional brain networks is modular at its core, modularity does not capture the full range of dynamic interactions between individual brain areas nor at the level of subnetworks. In this paper we present a hierarchical model that represents both flexible and modular aspects of intrinsic brain organization across time by constructing spatiotemporally flexible subnetworks. We also demonstrate that segregation and integration are complementary and simultaneous events. The method is based on combining the instantaneous phase synchrony analysis (IPSA) framework with community detection to identify a small, yet representative set of subnetwork components at the finest level of spatial granularity. At the next level, subnetwork components are combined into spatiotemporally flexibly subnetworks where temporal lag in the recruitment of areas within subnetworks is captured. Since individual brain areas are permitted to be part of multiple interleaved subnetworks, both modularity as well as more flexible tendencies of connectivity are accommodated for in the model. Importantly, we show that assignment of subnetworks to the same community (integration) corresponds to positive phase coherence within and between subnetworks, while assignment to different communities (segregation) corresponds to negative phase coherence or orthogonality. Together with disintegration, i.e. the breakdown of internal coupling within subnetwork components, orthogonality facilitates reorganization between subnetworks. In addition, we show that the duration of periods of integration is a function of the coupling strength within subnetworks and subnetwork components which indicates an underlying metastable dynamical regime. Based on the main tendencies for either integration or segregation, subnetworks are further clustered into larger meta-networks that are shown to correspond to combinations of core resting-state networks. We also demonstrate that subnetworks and meta-networks are coarse graining strategies that captures the quasi-cyclic recurrence of global patterns of integration and segregation in the brain. Finally, the method allows us to estimate in broad terms the spectrum of flexible and/or modular tendencies for individual brain areas.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Across-area synchronization supports feature integration in working memory</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.09.447667v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Working memory function is severely limited. One key limitation that constrains the ability to maintain multiple items in working memory simultaneously is so-called swap errors. These errors occur when an inaccurate response is in fact accurate relative to a non-target stimulus, reflecting the failure to maintain the appropriate association or 'binding' between the features that define one object (e.g., color and location). The mechanisms underlying feature binding in working memory remain unknown. Here, we tested the hypothesis that features are bound in memory through synchrony across feature-specific neural assemblies. We built a biophysical neural network model composed of two one-dimensional attractor networks - one for color and one for location - simulating feature storage in different cortical areas. Within each area, gamma oscillations were induced during bump attractor activity through the interplay of fast recurrent excitation and slower feedback inhibition. As a result, different memorized items were held at different phases of the network's oscillation. These two areas were then reciprocally connected via weak cortico-cortical excitation, accomplishing binding between color and location through the synchronization of pairs of bumps across the two areas. Encoding and decoding of color-location associations was accomplished through rate coding, overcoming a long-standing limitation of binding through synchrony. In some simulations, swap errors arose: 'color bumps' abruptly changed their phase relationship with 'location bumps'. This model, which leverages the explanatory power of similar attractor models, specifies a plausible mechanism for feature binding and makes specific predictions about swap errors that are testable at behavioral and neurophysiological levels.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Parietal and frontal cortex are involved in saccade generation, but their output signals also modify visual signals throughout cortex. These signals produce well-documented behavioral phenomena (saccades, saccadic suppression, various perisaccadic perceptual distortions) but their underlying influence on cortical network dynamics is not known. Here, we combined high resolution electroencephalography (EEG) with frequency dependent source localization and graph theory analysis (GTA) to understand how saccades and presaccadic visual stimuli interactively alter cortical network dynamics in humans. 21 participants viewed series of 1-3 vertical or horizontal grids, followed by grid with the opposite orientation just before a horizontal saccade or continued fixation. EEG signals from the presaccadic interval (cue + 200ms, or equivalent fixation period) were used for source localization. Source localization (saccade minus fixation) identified bilateral dorsomedial frontoparietal activity across frequency bands, whereas stimulus repetition produced band-specific modulations in left prefrontal, posterior parietal, and central-superior frontal and/or parietal cortex, with significant saccade-repetition interactions in frontal and parietal regions. GTA analysis revealed a saccade-specific functional network with major hubs in inferior parietal cortex (alpha) and the frontal eye fields (beta), and major saccade-repetition interactions in left prefrontal (theta) and supramarginal gyrus (gamma). Overall, quantitative measures of whole-brain network topology and dynamics (segregation, integration, synchronization, complexity) were enhanced during the presaccadic interval, but repetition interactions reduced synchronization and complexity. These results show that presaccadic signals have widespread, coherent influence on cortical network dynamics, likely responsible for both saccade production and the perceptual phenomena associated with saccades.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.08.447607v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Nearly 50 different mouse retinal ganglion cell (RGC) types sample the visual scene for distinct features. RGC feature selectivity arises from its synapses with a specific subset of amacrine (AC) and bipolar cell (BC) types, but how RGC dendrites arborize and collect input from these specific subsets remains poorly understood. Here we examine the hypothesis that RGCs employ molecular recognition systems to meet this challenge. By combining calcium imaging and type-specific histological stains we define a family of circuits that express the recognition molecule Sidekick 1 (Sdk1) which include a novel RGC type (S1-RGC) that responds to local edges. Genetic and physiological studies revealed that Sdk1 loss selectively disrupts S1-RGC visual responses which result from a loss of excitatory and inhibitory inputs and selective dendritic deficits on this neuron. We conclude that Sdk1 shapes dendrite growth and wiring to help S1-RGCs become feature selective.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The rapid developmental rise of somatic inhibition disengages hippocampal dynamics from self-motion</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.08.447542v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Early electrophysiological brain oscillations recorded in preterm babies and newborn rodents are initially mostly ignited by bottom-up sensorimotor activity and only later can detach from external inputs. This is a hallmark of most developing brain areas including the hippocampus, which in the adult brain, functions in integrating external inputs onto internal dynamics. Such developmental disengagement from external inputs is likely a fundamental step for the proper development of cognitive internal models. Despite its importance, the exact timing and circuit basis for this disengagement remain unknown. To address this issue, we have investigated the daily evolution of CA1 dynamics and underlying circuits during the first and second postnatal week of mouse development using a combination of two-photon calcium imaging of neuronal somata and axons in non-anesthetized pups, viral tracing and chemogenetics. We show that the first postnatal week ends with an abrupt switch in the representation of self-motion in CA1. Indeed, most CA1 pyramidal cells switch from activated to inhibited by self-generated movements at the end of the first postnatal week whereas GABAergic neurons remain positively modulated throughout this period. This rapid switch occurs within two days and is mediated by the rapid anatomical and functional surge of somatic inhibition. The observed dynamics is consistent with a two-population model undergoing strengthening inhibition. Remarkably, a transient silencing of local somatostatin-expressing interneurons both prevents the emergence of the perisomatic GABAergic coverage and the disengagement of CA1 hippocampal dynamics from self-motion. We propose that such activity-dependent emergence of feedback inhibitory circuits critically inaugurates the development of internal cognitive models.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.08.447539v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Neuropathic pain such as that seen in diabetes mellitus, results in part from central sensitisation in the spinal cord dorsal horn. However, the mechanisms responsible for such sensitisation remain unclear. There is evidence that disturbances in the integrity of the spinal vascular network can be a causative factor in the development of neuropathic pain. Here we show that reduced blood flow and vascularity of the dorsal horn leads to the onset of neuropathic pain. Using rodent models (type 1 diabetes and an inducible endothelial specific vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 knockout mouse) that result in degeneration of the endothelium in the dorsal horn we show that spinal cord vasculopathy results in nociceptive behavioural hypersensitivity. This also results in increased hypoxia in dorsal horn sensory neurons, depicted by increased expression of hypoxia markers hypoxia inducible factor 1, glucose transporter 3 and carbonic anhydrase 7. Furthermore, inducing hypoxia via intrathecal delivery of dimethyloxalylglycine leads to the activation of dorsal horn sensory neurons as well as mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity. This shows that hypoxic signalling induced by reduced vascularity results in increased hypersensitivity and pain. Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase activity, through intraperitoneal injection of acetazolamide, inhibited hypoxia induced pain behaviours. This investigation demonstrates that induction of a hypoxic microenvironment in the dorsal horn, as occurs in diabetes, is an integral process by which sensory neurons are activated to initiate neuropathic pain states. This leads to the conjecture that reversing hypoxia by improving spinal cord microvascular blood flow could reverse or prevent neuropathic pain.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: High-frequency oscillations and replay in a two-population model of hippocampal region CA1</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.08.447523v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Hippocampal sharp wave/ripple oscillations are a prominent pattern of collective activity, which consists of a strong overall increase of activity with onmodulated (140 - 200 Hz) ripple oscillations. Despite its prominence and its experimentally demonstrated importance for memory consolidation, the mechanisms underlying its generation are to date not understood. Several models assume that recurrent networks of inhibitory cells alone can explain the generation and main characteristics of the ripple oscillations. Recent experiments, however, indicate that in addition to inhibitory basket cells, the pattern requires in vivo the activity of the local population of excitatory pyramidal cells. Here we study a model for networks in the hippocampal region CA1 incorporating such a local excitatory population of pyramidal neurons and investigate its ability to generate ripple oscillations using extensive simulations. We find that with biologically plausible values for single neuron, synapse and connectivity parameters, random connectivity and absent strong feedforward drive to the inhibitory population, oscillation patterns similar to in vivo sharp wave/ripples can only be generated if excitatory cell spiking is triggered by short pulses of external excitation. Specifically, whereas temporally broad excitation can lead to high-frequency oscillations in the ripple range, sparse pyramidal cell activity is only obtained with pulse-like external CA3 excitation. Further simulations indicate that such short pulses could originate from dendritic spikes in the apical or basal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells, which are triggered by coincident spike arrivals from hippocampal region CA3. Finally we show that replay of sequences by pyramidal neurons and ripple oscillations can arise intrinsically in CA1 due to structured connectivity that gives rise to alternating excitatory pulse and inhibitory gap coding; the latter implies phases of silence in specific basket cell groups and selective disinhibition of groups of pyramidal neurons. This general mechanism for sequence generation leads to sparse pyramidal cell and dense basket cell spiking, does not rely on synfire chain-like feedforward excitation and may be relevant for other brain regions as well.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Brain structure scaffolds intrinsic function, supporting cognition and ultimately behavioral flexibility. However, it remains unclear how a static, genetically controlled architecture supports flexible cognition and behavior. Here, we synthesize genetic, phylogenetic and cognitive analyses to understand how the macroscale organization of structure-function coupling across the cortex can inform its role in cognition. In humans, structure-function coupling was highest in regions of unimodal cortex and lowest in transmodal cortex, a pattern that was mirrored by a reduced alignment with heritable connectivity profiles. Structure-function uncoupling in non-human primates had a similar spatial distribution, but we observed an increased coupling between structure and function in association regions in macaques relative to humans. Meta-analysis suggested regions with the least genetic control (low heritable correspondence and different across primates) are linked to social cognition and autobiographical memory. Our findings establish the genetic and evolutionary uncoupling of structure and function in different transmodal systems may support the emergence of complex, culturally embedded forms of cognition.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Visual working memory possesses strict capacity constraints which place limits on the availability of resources for encoding and maintaining information. Studies have shown that prospective rewards improve performance on visual working memory tasks, but it remains unclear whether rewards increase total resource availability or rather influence the allocation of resources without affecting availability. Participants performed a continuous report visual working memory task with oriented grating stimuli. On each trial, participants were presented with a priority cue, which signaled the item most likely to be probed, and a reward cue, which signaled the magnitude of a performance-contingent reward. We showed that rewards decreased recall error for cued items and increased recall error for non-cued items. We further demonstrated that rewards produced a tradeoff in the probability of successfully encoding a cued versus a non-cued item rather than a tradeoff in recall precision or the probability of binding errors. Lastly, we showed that rewards only affected resource allocation when participants were given the opportunity to engage proactive control prior to encoding. These findings indicate that rewards influence the flexible allocation of resources during selection and encoding in visual working memory, but do not augment total capacity.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.08.447375v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Large vessel disease and carotid stenosis are key mechanisms contributing to vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) and dementia. Our previous work, and that of others, using rodent models, demonstrated that bilateral common carotid stenosis (BCAS) leads to cognitive impairment via gradual deterioration of the glial-vascular unit and accumulation of amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) protein. Since brain-wide drainage pathways (glymphatic) for waste clearance, including A{beta} removal, have been implicated in the pathophysiology of VCI via glial mechanisms, we hypothesized that glymphatic function would be impaired in a BCAS model and exacerbated in the presence of A{beta}. Male wild-type and Tg-SwDI (model of microvascular amyloid) mice were subjected to BCAS or sham surgery which led to a reduction in cerebral perfusion and impaired spatial learning and memory. After 3 months survival, glymphatic function was evaluated by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fluorescent tracer influx. We demonstrated that BCAS caused a marked regional reduction of CSF tracer influx in the dorsolateral cortex and CA1-DG molecular layer. In parallel to these changes increased reactive astrogliosis was observed post-BCAS. To further investigate the mechanisms that may lead to these changes, we measured the pulsation of cortical vessels using two-photon microscopy. BCAS impaired vascular pulsation in pial arteries in WT and Tg-SwDI mice. Since our findings show that BCAS may influence VCI by impaired glymphatic drainage and reduced vascular pulsation we propose that these additional targets need to be considered when treating VCI.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>We have shown that deficiency of neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2), an enzyme generating the sphingolipid ceramide, improves memory in adult mice. Here, we performed sphingolipid and RNA-seq analyses on the cortex from 10 months-old nSMase2-deficient (fro/fro) and heterozygous (+/fro) mice. fro/fro cortex showed reduced levels of ceramide, particularly in astrocytes. Differentially abundant transcripts included several functionally related groups, with decreases in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and astrocyte activation transcripts, while axon guidance and synaptic transmission transcripts were increased, indicating a role of nSMase2 in oxidative stress, astrocyte activation, and cognition. Experimentally induced oxidative stress decreased the level of glutathione (GSH), an endogenous inhibitor of nSMase2, and increased immunolabeling for ceramide in primary +/fro astrocytes, but not in fro/fro astrocytes. {beta}-galactosidase activity was lower in 5-weeks old fro/fro astrocytes, indicating delayed senescence due to nSMase2 deficiency. In fro/fro cortex, levels of the senescence markers C3b and p27, and the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 1{beta}, interleukin 6, and tumor necrosis factor  were reduced, concurrent with 2-fold decreased phosphorylation of their downstream target, protein kinase Stat3. RNA and protein levels of the ionotropic glutamate receptor subunit 2b (Grin2b or NR2B) were increased by 2-fold, an effect known to enhance cognition. This was consistent with 3.5-fold reduced levels of exosomes carrying miR-223-3p, a micro-RNA downregulating Grin2b. In summary, our data show that nSMase2 deficiency prevents oxidative stress-induced elevation of ceramide and secretion of exosomes by astrocytes that suppress neuronal function, indicating a role of nSMase2 in the regulation of neuroinflammation and cognition during brain aging.</content:encoded>

By using multimodal imaging and neuropsychological assessments in the unique case of Patient 1, we demonstrate that an occipital stroke sparing the PPA but disconnecting the MOLT can lead to chronic deficits in configuration learning. Further, through an advanced, data-driven clustering analysis of diffusion MRI structural connectivity in a large control cohort, we demonstrate that the PPA sits at the confluence of the MOLT and the parieto-medial-temporal branch of the dual-stream model. The MOLT may therefore support multi-stage learning of object configuration by allowing direct reciprocal exchange between the PPA and EVC.</content:encoded>

The amygdala is a brain area involved in emotional regulation and pain. Over the course of the last 20 years, multiple researchers have studied sensory and motor connections within the amygdala in trying to understand the ultimate role of this structure in pain perception and descending control of pain. A number of investigators have been using cell-type specific manipulations to probe the underlying circuitry of the amygdala. As data have accumulated in this research space, we recognized a critical need for a single framework to integrate these data and evaluate emergent system-level responses. In this manuscript, we present an agent-based computational model of two distinct inhibitory neuron populations in the amygdala, those that express protein kinase C delta (PKC&lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt;) and those that express somatostatin (SOM). We utilized a network of neural links to simulate connectivity and the transmission of inhibitory signals between neurons. Type-specific parameters describing the response of these neurons to noxious stimuli were estimated from published physiological and immunological data as well as our own wet-lab experiments. The model outputs an abstract measure of pain, which is calculated in terms of the cumulative pro-nociceptive and anti-nociceptive activity across neurons in both hemispheres of the amygdala. Results demonstrate the ability of the model to produce changes in pain that are consistent with published studies and highlight the importance of several model parameters. In particular, we found that the relative proportion of PKC&lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt; and SOM neurons within each hemisphere is a key parameter in predicting pain and we explored model predictions for three possible values of this parameter. We compared model predictions of pain to data from our earlier behavioral studies and found areas of similarity as well as distinctions between the data sets. These differences, in particular, suggest a number of wet-lab experiments that could be done in the future.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-Gu4XwB9cP4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Collagen forms a characteristic triple helical structure and plays a central role for stabilizing the extra-cellular matrix. After a C-terminal nucleus formation folding proceeds to form long triple-helical fibers. The molecular details of triple helix folding process is of central importance for an understanding of several human diseases associated with misfolded or unstable collagen fibrils. However, the folding propagation is too rapid to be studied by experimental high resolution techniques. We employed multiple Molecular Dynamics simulations starting from unfolded peptides with an already formed nucleus to successfully follow the folding propagation in atomic detail. The triple helix folding was found to propagate involving first two chains forming a short transient template. Secondly, three residues of the third chain fold on this template with an overall mean propagation of ~75 ns per unit. The formation of loops with multiples of the repeating unit was found as a characteristic misfolding event especially when starting from an unstable nucleus. Central Gly→Ala or Gly→Thr substitutions resulted in reduced stability and folding rates due to structural deformations interfering with folding propagation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/BEGFFLCXFNk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Cytometry analysis has seen a considerable expansion in recent years in the maximum number of parameters that can be acquired in a single experiment. In response to this technological advance there has been an increased effort to develop new computational methodologies for handling high-dimensional single cell data acquired by flow or mass cytometry. Despite the success of numerous algorithms and published packages to replicate and outperform traditional manual analysis, widespread adoption of these techniques has yet to be realised in the field of immunology. Here we present CytoPy, a Python framework for automated analysis of cytometry data that integrates a document-based database for a data-centric and iterative analytical environment. In addition, our algorithm agnostic design provides a platform for open-source cytometry bioinformatics in the Python ecosystem. We demonstrate the ability of CytoPy to phenotype T cell subsets in whole blood samples even in the presence of significant batch effects due to technical and user variation. The complete analytical pipeline was then used to immunophenotype the local inflammatory infiltrate in individuals with and without acute bacterial infection. CytoPy is open-source and licensed under the MIT license.

Abstract
Research exploring the underlying neuroanatomical correlates of early motherhood seems to suggest that the period after giving birth is marked by tissue increases in the mother's brain. While some studies point to the amygdala as one of the areas undergoing postpartum changes, existing analyses did not discriminate between the different subregions of this functionally heterogeneous structure. Thus, to further extend this understudied field of research and to better understand the potential role of the amygdala when transitioning to motherhood, we applied an advanced region‐of‐interest technique that enabled us to analyze the amygdala as a whole as well as its different subareas, specifically the left and right centromedian (CM), laterobasal (LB), and superficial (SF) regions. Comparing the brains of 14 healthy women between immediate postpartum (within 1–2 days of childbirth) and late postpartum (at 4–6 weeks after childbirth), we revealed increases of the amygdala. However, effects manifested differentially across subareas, with particularly strong effects for the SF region, moderate effects for the CM region, and no effects for the LB region. These findings might reflect region‐specific adaptations of the mother's brain tuning into the distinct and ever‐changing needs of a newborn, either as a cause for it or as a consequence thereof.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23337?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
The hippocampus is particularly susceptible to neurodegeneration. Physical activity, specifically increasing cardiorespiratory fitness via aerobic exercise, shows promise as a potential method for mitigating hippocampal decline in humans. Numerous studies have now investigated associations between the structure and function of the hippocampus and engagement in physical activity. Still, there remains continued debate and confusion about the relationship between physical activity and the human hippocampus. In this review, we describe the current state of the physical activity and exercise literature as it pertains to the structure and function of the human hippocampus, focusing on four magnetic resonance imaging measures: volume, diffusion tensor imaging, resting‐state functional connectivity, and perfusion. We conclude that, despite significant heterogeneity in study methods, populations of interest, and scope, there are consistent positive findings, suggesting a promising role for physical activity in promoting hippocampal structure and function throughout the lifespan.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Distinct patterns of hippocampal activity associated with color and spatial source memory</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23368?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
The hippocampus is known to be involved in source memory across a wide variety of stimuli and source types. Thus, source memory activity in the hippocampus is thought to be domain‐general such that different types of source information are similarly processed in the hippocampus. However, there is some evidence of domain‐specificity for spatial and temporal source information. The current fMRI study aimed to determine whether patterns of activity in the hippocampus differed for two types of visual source information: spatial location and background color. Participants completed three runs of a spatial memory task and three runs of a color memory task. During the study phase, 32 line drawings of common objects and animals were presented to either the left or right of fixation for the spatial memory task or on either a red or green background for the color memory task. During the test phase of both tasks, 48 object word labels were presented in the center of the screen and participants classified the corresponding item as old and previously on the “left”/on a “green” background, old and previously on the “right”/on a “red” background, or “new.” Two analysis methods were employed to assess whether hippocampal activity differed between the two source types: a general linear model analysis and a classification‐based searchlight multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA). The searchlight MVPA revealed that activity associated with spatial memory and color memory could be classified with above‐chance accuracy in a region of the right anterior hippocampus, and a follow‐up analysis revealed that there was a significant effect of memory accuracy. These results indicate that different types of source memory are represented by distinct patterns of activity in the hippocampus.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Tonic activity in the levator palpebrae superioris muscle, which holds the upper eyelid open, is interrupted during blinks. Here we demonstrate a monosynpatic pathway from cells distributed along the rostral edge of the principal trigeminal nucleus that targets, and presumably inhibits, levator motoneurons for blinks triggered from the face.






Abstract
For normal viewing, the eyes are held open by the tonic actions of the levator palpebrae superioris (levator) muscle raising the upper eyelid. This activity is interrupted during blinks, when the eyelid sweeps down to spread the tear film or protect the cornea. We examined the circuit connecting the principal trigeminal nucleus to the levator motoneurons by use of both anterograde and retrograde tracers in macaque monkeys. Injections of anterograde tracer were made into the principal trigeminal nucleus using either a stereotaxic approach or localization following physiological characterization of trigeminal second order neurons. Anterogradely labeled axonal arbors were located both within the caudal central subdivision, which contains levator motoneurons, and in the adjacent supraoculomotor area. Labeled boutons made synaptic contacts on retrogradely labeled levator motoneurons indicating a monosynaptic connection. As the eye is also retracted through the actions of the rectus muscles during a blink, we examined whether these trigeminal injections labeled boutons contacting rectus motoneurons within the oculomotor nucleus. These were not found when the injection sites were confined to the principal trigeminal nucleus region. To identify the source of the projection to the levator motoneurons, we injected retrograde tracer into the oculomotor complex. Retrogradely labeled cells were confined to a narrow, dorsoventrally oriented cell population that lined the rostral edge of the principal trigeminal nucleus. Presumably these cells inhibit levator motoneurons, while other parts of the trigeminal sensory complex are activating orbicularis oculi motoneurons, when a blink is initiated by sensory stimuli contacting the face.

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Combination of Electroacupuncture and Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy Enhances Functional Recovery After Ischemic Stroke in Rats</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Both electroacupuncture and constraint-induced movement therapy have been reported to produce therapeutic effects on the recovery of ischemic stroke. The combined use of these two therapies is not rare clinically, although its effectiveness is not yet clear. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of electroacupuncture and constraint-induced movement therapy in ischemic stroke rats, and to explore the potential molecular mechanisms. Ischemic stroke rat models were established by middle cerebral artery occlusion. Then, the rats were assigned to receive one of the following interventions: sole electroacupuncture, sole constraint-induced movement therapy, the combination of both therapies, and no treatment. Functional recovery was assessed with the beam balance test and rotarod test. The infarct volume of the brain and the expression of the molecules Nogo-A, P75&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt;, NGF, BDNF, and VEGF in the brain tissue were investigated. The results demonstrated that the combination of the two therapies significantly improved neurological functional recovery in ischemic stroke rats compared to each therapy alone (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). We also observed a significant decrease in infarct volume in rats receiving the combined treatment. Nogo-A and P75&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt; were downregulated and NGF, BDNF, and VEGF were upregulated in the combined treatment rats compared to the control rats. In conclusion, the combination of electroacupuncture and constraint-induced movement therapy enhanced functional recovery after ischemic stroke in rats, and it is a promising treatment strategy in the rehabilitation of stroke. The anti-Nogo-A effect of electroacupuncture may explain its good compatibility with CIMT in ischemic stroke rats.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Neuroinformatics: Multiple Functional Brain Networks Related to Pain Perception Revealed by fMRI</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12021-021-09527-6</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The rise of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has led to a deeper understanding of cortical processing of pain. Central to these advances has been the identification and analysis of “functional networks”, often derived from groups of pre-selected pain regions. In this study our main objective was to identify functional brain networks related to pain perception by examining whole-brain activation, avoiding the need for a priori selection of regions. We applied a data-driven technique—Constrained Principal Component Analysis for fMRI (fMRI-CPCA)—that identifies networks without assuming their anatomical or temporal properties. Open-source fMRI data collected during a thermal pain task (33 healthy participants) were subjected to fMRI-CPCA for network extraction, and networks were associated with pain perception by modelling subjective pain ratings as a function of network activation intensities. Three functional networks emerged: a sensorimotor response network, a salience-mediated attention network, and the default-mode network. Together, these networks constituted a brain state that explained variability in pain perception, both within and between individuals, demonstrating the potential of data-driven, whole-brain functional network techniques for the analysis of pain imaging data.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Patients with LGI1 encephalitis were retrospectively selected from the French Reference Centre database between 2010 and 2019 and enrolled if CSF was available for biomarkers analysis including total tau (T-tau), phosphorylated tau (P-tau), amyloid-beta Aβ1-42, and neurofilaments light chains (Nf L). Samples sent for biomarker determination as part of routine practice, and formally diagnosed as AD, CJD, and PSY, were used as comparators.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Twenty-four patients with LGI1 encephalitis were compared to 39 AD, 20 CJD and 20 PSY. No significant difference was observed in T-tau, P-tau, and Aβ1-42 levels between LGI1 encephalitis and PSY patients. T-Tau and P-Tau levels were significantly lower in LGI1 encephalitis (231 and 43 ng/L) than in AD (621 and 90 ng/L, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and CJD patients (4327 and 55 ng/L, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001 and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). Nf L concentrations of LGI1 encephalitis (2039 ng/L) were similar to AD (2,765 ng/L) and significantly higher compared to PSY (1223 ng/L, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.005), but significantly lower than those of CJD (13,457 ng/L, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Higher levels of Nf L were observed in LGI1 encephalitis presenting with epilepsy (3855 ng/L) compared to LGI1 without epilepsy (1490 ng/L, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.02). No correlation between CSF biomarkers’ levels and clinical outcome could be drawn.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Aphasia is a recognized presenting symptom of thalamic lesions. Little is known regarding its frequency and phenotype. We examined the frequency of thalamic aphasia following Isolated Acute unilateral ischemic Lesions in the Thalamus (IALT) with respect to lesion location. Furthermore, we characterized thalamic aphasia according to affected language domains and severity.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Fifty-two patients with IALT were analyzed [44% female, median age: 73 years (IQR: 60–79)]. Lesion location was determined using 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging and categorized as anterior, posterior, paramedian or inferolateral. Standardized language assessment was performed using the validated Aphasia checklist (ACL) directly after symptom onset. Aphasia was defined as an ACL sum score of &amp;lt; 135 (range: 0–148).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Of 52 patients, 23 (44%) fulfilled the ACL diagnostic criteria for aphasia, including nearly all lesion locations and both sides. The average ACL sum score was 132 ± 11 (range: 98–147). Aphasia was characterized by deficits within domains of complex understanding of speech and verbal fluency. Patients with left anterior IALT were most severely affected, having significantly lower ACL scores than all other patients (117 ± 13 vs. 135 ± 8; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). In particular, aphasia in patients with left anterior IALT was characterized by significantly worse performance in the rating of verbal communication, verbal fluency, and naming (all &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; ≤ 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Aphasia occurs in almost half of patients with focal thalamic lesions. Thalamic aphasia is not confined to one predefined thalamic lesion location, but language deficits are particularly pronounced in patients with left anterior IALT presenting with a distinct pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The etiology of transient global amnesia (TGA) is still a matter of debate. Based, among others, on the observation of a close temporal relation between certain events and subsequent TGA episodes, recent proposals discuss the relevance of stress-associated processes impacting on hippocampal functioning. Circadian, infra- and ultradian rhythmicity has been found to play a relevant role in the multifactorial pathomechanisms of various disorders but has not been thoroughly studied in TGA.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Data of patients with a final diagnosis of TGA were collected in Mannheim, Germany (06/1999–01/2018, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 404), and in the Kansai district, Japan (04/2006–03/2018, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 261). Chronological patterns of TGA occurrence were determined.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Significant circadian rhythmicity of TGA occurrence with bimodal peaks (mid-morning, late afternoon) was found for the entire population (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.002) and for either sub-cohort (Mannheim: &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.003, Kansai: &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.007). This finding was confirmed for either sex (women: &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.004, men: &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.004) and different age groups (&amp;lt; 65 years: &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.0009, ≥ 65 years: &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.003). There was no variation according to day of the week, month or season, but the proportion of patients with a weekday episode was significantly higher in the Mannheim cohort (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.002).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Discussion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We identified a robust circadian rhythm in TGA occurrence which remarkably applied to either of the two study sites located on different continents and which was independent of sex and age. In light of abundant evidence of circadian rhythmicity of both, components of the human stress response system and memory, chronobiological analyses may provide an opportunity to further uncover the mechanisms underlying TGA.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Electrophysiological aftereffects of high-frequency transcranial random noise stimulation (hf-tRNS): an EEG investigation</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00221-021-06142-4</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;There is evidence that high-frequency transcranial random noise stimulation (hf-tRNS) is effective in improving behavioural performance in several visual tasks. However, so far there has been limited research into the spatial and temporal characteristics of hf-tRNS-induced facilitatory effects. In the present study, electroencephalogram (EEG) was used to investigate the spatial and temporal dynamics of cortical activity modulated by &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;offline&lt;/em&gt; hf-tRNS on performance on a motion direction discrimination task. We used EEG to measure the amplitude of motion-related VEPs over the parieto-occipital cortex, as well as oscillatory power spectral density (PSD) at rest. A time–frequency decomposition analysis was also performed to investigate the shift in event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) in response to the motion stimuli between the pre- and post-stimulation period. The results showed that the accuracy of the motion direction discrimination task was not modulated by &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;offline&lt;/em&gt; hf-tRNS. Although the motion task was able to elicit motion-dependent VEP components (P1, N2, and P2), none of them showed any significant change between pre- and post-stimulation. We also found a time-dependent increase of the PSD in alpha and beta bands regardless of the stimulation protocol. Finally, time–frequency analysis showed a modulation of ERSP power in the hf-tRNS condition for gamma activity when compared to pre-stimulation periods and Sham stimulation. Overall, these results show that &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;offline&lt;/em&gt; hf-tRNS may induce moderate aftereffects in brain oscillatory activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Nociception induces a differential presynaptic modulation of the synaptic efficacy of nociceptive and proprioceptive joint afferents</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A previous study has indicated that during the state of central sensitization induced by the intradermic injection of capsaicin, there is a gradual facilitation of the dorsal horn neuronal responses produced by stimulation of the high-threshold articular afferents that is counteracted by a concurrent increase of descending inhibitory actions. Since these changes occurred without significantly affecting the responses produced by stimulation of the low-threshold articular afferents, it was suggested that the capsaicin-induced descending inhibition included a preferential presynaptic modulation of the synaptic efficacy of the slow conducting nociceptive joint afferents (Ramírez-Morales et al., Exp Brain Res 237:1629–1641, 2019). The present study was aimed to investigate more directly the contribution of presynaptic mechanisms in this descending control. We found that in the barbiturate anesthetized cat, stimulation of the high-threshold myelinated afferents in the posterior articular nerve (PAN) produces primary afferent hyperpolarization (PAH) in the slow conducting (25–35 m/s) and primary afferent depolarization (PAD) in the fast conducting (40–50 m/s) articular fibers. During the state of central sensitization induced by capsaicin, there is a supraspinally mediated shift of the autogenic PAH to PAD that takes place in the slow conducting fibers, basically without affecting the autogenic PAD generated in the fast conducting afferents. It is suggested that the change of presynaptic facilitation to presynaptic inhibition induced by capsaicin on the slow articular afferents is part of an homeostatic process aimed to keep the nociceptive-induced neuronal activity within manageable limits while preserving the proprioceptive information required for proper control of movement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.682419</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recording brain activity during speech production using magnetoencephalography (MEG) can help us to understand the dynamics of speech production. However, these measurements are challenging due to the induced artifacts coming from several sources such as facial muscle activity, lower jaw and head movements. Here, we aimed to characterize speech-related artifacts, focusing on head movements, and subsequently present an approach to remove these artifacts from MEG data. We recorded MEG from 11 healthy participants while they pronounced various syllables in different loudness. Head positions/orientations were extracted during speech production to investigate its role in MEG distortions. Finally, we present an artifact rejection approach using the combination of regression analysis and signal space projection (SSP) in order to correct the induced artifact from MEG data. Our results show that louder speech leads to stronger head movements and stronger MEG distortions. Our proposed artifact rejection approach could successfully remove the speech-related artifact and retrieve the underlying neurophysiological signals. As the presented artifact rejection approach was shown to remove artifacts arising from head movements, induced by overt speech in the MEG, it will facilitate research addressing the neural basis of speech production with MEG.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Development and Validation of a Semi-Automated, Preclinical, MRI-Template Based PET Image Data Analysis Tool for Rodents</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.639643</link>
	<content:encoded>Aim&lt;p&gt;In PET imaging, the different types of radiotracers and accumulations, as well as the diversity of disease patterns, make the analysis of molecular imaging data acquired in vivo challenging. Here, we evaluate and validate a semi-automated MRI template-based data analysis tool that allows preclinical PET images to be aligned to a self-created PET template. Based on the user-defined volume-of-interest (VOI), image data can then be evaluated using three different semi-quantitative parameters: normalized activity, standardized uptake value, and uptake ratio.&lt;/p&gt;Materials and Methods&lt;p&gt;The nuclear medicine Data Processing Analysis tool (NU_DPA) was implemented in Matlab. Testing and validation of the tool was performed using two types of radiotracers in different kinds of stroke-related brain diseases in rat models. The radiotracers used are 2-[&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose ([&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG), a metabolic tracer with symmetrical distribution in brain, and [&lt;sup&gt;68&lt;/sup&gt;Ga]Ga-Fucoidan, a target-selective radioligand specifically binding to p-selectin. After manual image import, the NU_DPA tool automatically creates an averaged PET template out of the acquired PET images, to which all PET images are then aligned onto. The added MRI template-based information, resized to the lower PET resolution, defines the VOI and also allows a precise subdivision of the VOI into individual sub-regions. The aligned PET images can then be evaluated semi-quantitatively for all regions defined in the MRI atlas. In addition, a statistical analysis and evaluation of the semi-quantitative parameters can then be performed in the NU_DPA tool.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Using ischemic stroke data in Wistar rats as an example, the statistical analysis of the tool should be demonstrated. In this [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG-PET experiment, three different experimental states were compared: healthy control state, ischemic stroke without electrical stimulation, ischemic stroke with electrical stimulation. Thereby, statistical data evaluation using the NU_DPA tool showed that the glucose metabolism in a photothrombotic lesion can be influenced by electrical stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our NU_DPA tool allows a very flexible data evaluation of small animal PET data in vivo including statistical data evaluation. Using the radiotracers [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG and [&lt;sup&gt;68&lt;/sup&gt;Ga]Ga-Fucoidan, it was shown that the semi-automatic MRI-template based data analysis of the NU_DPA tool is potentially suitable for both metabolic radiotracers as well as target-selective radiotracers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Localization of the Epileptogenic Zone by Multimodal Neuroimaging and High-Frequency Oscillation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.677840</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Accurate localization of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) is a key factor to obtain good surgical outcome for refractory epilepsy patients. However, no technique, so far, can precisely locate the EZ, and there are barely any reports on the combined application of multiple technologies to improve the localization accuracy of the EZ. In this study, we aimed to explore the use of a multimodal method combining PET-MRI, fluid and white matter suppression (FLAWS)—a novel MRI sequence, and high-frequency oscillation (HFO) automated analysis to delineate EZ. We retrospectively collected 15 patients with refractory epilepsy who underwent surgery and used the above three methods to detect abnormal brain areas of all patients. We compared the PET-MRI, FLAWS, and HFO results with traditional methods to evaluate their diagnostic value. The sensitivities, specificities of locating the EZ, and marking extent removed versus not removed [RatioChann(ev)] of each method were compared with surgical outcome. We also tested the possibility of using different combinations to locate the EZ. The marked areas in every patient established using each method were also compared to determine the correlations among the three methods. The results showed that PET-MRI, FLAWS, and HFOs can provide more information about potential epileptic areas than traditional methods. When detecting the EZs, the sensitivities of PET-MRI, FLAWS, and HFOs were 68.75, 53.85, and 87.50%, and the specificities were 80.00, 33.33, and 100.00%. The RatioChann(ev) of HFO-marked contacts was significantly higher in patients with good outcome than those with poor outcome (p&amp;lt; 0.05). When intracranial electrodes covered all the abnormal areas indicated by neuroimaging with the overlapping EZs being completely removed referred to HFO analysis, patients could reach seizure-free (p &amp;lt; 0.01). The periphery of the lesion marked by neuroimaging may be epileptic, but not every lesion contributes to seizures. Therefore, approaches in multimodality can detect EZ more accurately, and HFO analysis may help in defining real epileptic areas that may be missed in the neuroimaging results. The implantation of intracranial electrodes guided by non-invasive PET-MRI and FLAWS findings as well as HFO analysis would be an optimized multimodal approach for locating EZ.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: MR Tractography-Based Targeting and Physiological Identification of the Cuneiform Nucleus for Directional DBS in a Parkinson’s Disease Patient With Levodopa-Resistant Freezing of Gait</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.676755</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Freezing of gait (FOG) is a debilitating motor deficit in a subset of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) patients that is poorly responsive to levodopa or deep brain stimulation (DBS) of established PD targets. The proposal of a DBS target in the midbrain, known as the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), to address FOG was based on its observed neuropathology in PD and its hypothesized involvement in locomotor control as a part of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR). Initial reports of PPN DBS were met with enthusiasm; however, subsequent studies reported mixed results. A closer review of the MLR basic science literature, suggests that the closely related cuneiform nucleus (CnF), dorsal to the PPN, may be a superior site to promote gait. Although suspected to have a conserved role in the control of gait in humans, deliberate stimulation of a homolog to the CnF in humans using directional DBS electrodes has not been attempted.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;As part of an open-label Phase 1 clinical study, one PD patient with predominantly axial symptoms and severe FOG refractory to levodopa therapy was implanted with directional DBS electrodes (Boston Science Vercise Cartesia&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;) targeting the CnF bilaterally. Since the CnF is a poorly defined reticular nucleus, targeting was guided both by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography and anatomical landmarks. Intraoperative stimulation and microelectrode recordings were performed near the targets with leg EMG surface recordings in the subject.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Post-operative imaging revealed accurate targeting of both leads to the designated CnF. Intraoperative stimulation near the target at low thresholds in the awake patient evoked involuntary electromyography (EMG) oscillations in the legs with a peak power at the stimulation frequency, similar to observations with CnF DBS in animals. Oscillopsia was the primary side effect evoked at higher currents, especially when directed posterolaterally. Directional DBS could mitigate oscillopsia.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;DTI-based targeting and intraoperative stimulation to evoke limb EMG activity may be useful methods to help target the CnF accurately and safely in patients. Long term follow-up and detailed gait testing of patients undergoing CnF stimulation will be necessary to confirm the effects on FOG.&lt;/p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration&lt;p&gt;Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT04218526.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Objectives&lt;p&gt;To investigate the improvement effect of occipital repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) combined with escitalopram oxalate tablets on pre-attentive processing in patients with first-episode, medication-naive depression.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Patients who were hospitalized between January and December 2019 were selected. They were randomly allocated to real occipital rTMS stimulation group with 27 cases receiving intermittent theta-burst (iTBS) and sham stimulation group with 24 cases over 20 days. The rTMS treatment target is located at the Oz point of the occipital region. Both groups took escitalopram oxalate tablets, and the average daily drug dose was 15.294 ± 5.041 mg. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) was used to assess the symptoms of depression before and after treatment, and mismatch negativity (MMN) was used to assess the improvement of pre-attentive processing before and after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;After 20 days of treatment, the total score of HAMD (13.495 ± 3.700) in both groups was significantly lower than that before treatment [21.910 ± 3.841, F(1, 49) = 46, 3.690, p &amp;lt; 0.001]. After treatment, the latency of MMN in the real stimulation group (182.204 ± 31.878 ms) was significantly lower than that in the sham stimulation group (219.896 ± 42.634 ms, p &amp;lt; 0.001), and the amplitude of MMN in the real stimulation group (−7.107 ± 3.374 ms) was significantly higher than that in the sham stimulation group (−2.773 ± 3.7 32 ms, p &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Occipital rTMS treatment can enhance the early therapeutic effect and effectively improve the pre-attentive processing of patients with depression and provide a scientific basis for the new target of rTMS therapy in clinical patients with depression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.648573</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Essential tremor (ET) is a highly prevalent neurological disorder characterized by action-induced tremors involving the hand, voice, head, and/or face. Importantly, hand tremor is present in nearly all forms of ET, resulting in impaired fine motor skills and diminished quality of life. To advance early diagnostic approaches for ET, automated handwriting tasks and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offer an opportunity to develop early essential clinical biomarkers. In this study, we present a novel approach for the early clinical diagnosis and monitoring of ET based on integrating handwriting and neuroimaging analysis. We demonstrate how the analysis of fine motor skills, as measured by an automated Archimedes’ spiral task, is correlated with neuroimaging biomarkers for ET. Together, we present a novel modeling approach that can serve as a complementary and promising support tool for the clinical diagnosis of ET and a large range of tremors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Sensitivity of the Spatial Distribution of Fixations to Variations in the Type of Task Demand and Its Relation to Visual Entropy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.642535</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ocular activity is known to be sensitive to variations in mental workload, and recent studies have successfully related the distribution of eye fixations to the mental load. This study aimed to verify the effectiveness of the spatial distribution of fixations as a measure of mental workload and its sensitivity to different types of demands imposed by the task: mental, temporal, and physical. To test the research hypothesis, two experimental studies were run: Experiment 1 evaluated the sensitivity of an index of spatial distribution (Nearest Neighbor Index; NNI) to changes in workload. A sample of 30 participants participated in a within-subject design with different types of task demands (mental, temporal, physical) applied to Tetris game; Experiment 2 investigated the accuracy of the index through the analysis of 1-min epochs during the execution of a visual-spatial task (the “spot the differences” puzzle game). Additionally, NNI was compared to a better-known ocular mental workload index, the entropy rate. The data analysis showed a relation between the NNI and the different workload levels imposed by the tasks. In particular: Experiment 1 demonstrated that increased difficulty, due to higher temporal demand, led to a more dispersed pattern with respect to the baseline, whereas the mental demand led to a more grouped pattern of fixations with respect to the baseline; Experiment 2 indicated that the entropy rate and the NNI show a similar pattern over time, indicating high mental workload after the first minute of activity. That suggests that NNI highlights the greater presence of fixation groups and, accordingly, the entropy indicates a more regular and orderly scanpath. Both indices are sensitive to changes in workload and they seem to anticipate the drop in performance. However, the entropy rate is limited by the use of the areas of interest, making it impossible to apply it in dynamic contexts. Conversely, NNI works with the entire scanpath and it shows sensitivity to different types of task demands. These results confirm the NNI as a measure applicable to different contexts and its potential use as a trigger in adaptive systems implemented in high-risk settings, such as control rooms and transportation systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Ictal Occurrence of High-Frequency Oscillations Correlates With Seizure Severity in a Rat Model of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.624620</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;High-frequency oscillations (HFOs, ripples 80–250 Hz, fast ripples 250–500 Hz) are biomarkers of epileptic tissue. They are most commonly observed over areas generating seizures and increase in occurrence during the ictal compared to the interictal period. It has been hypothesized that their rate correlates with the severity of epilepsy and seizure in affected individuals. In the present study, it was aimed to investigate whether the HFO count mirrors the observed behavioral seizure severity using a kainate rat model for temporal lobe epilepsy. Seizures were selected during the chronic epilepsy phase of this model and classified by behavioral severity according to the Racine scale. Seizures with Racine scale 5&amp;amp;6 were considered generalized and severe. HFOs were marked in 24 seizures during a preictal, ictal, and postictal EEG segment. The duration covered by the HFO during these different segments was analyzed and compared between mild and severe seizures. HFOs were significantly increased during ictal periods (p &amp;lt; 0.001) and significantly decreased during postictal periods (p &amp;lt; 0.03) compared to the ictal segment. Ictal ripples (p = 0.04) as well as fast ripples (p = 0.02) were significantly higher in severe seizures compared to mild seizures. The present study demonstrates that ictal HFO occurrence mirrors seizure severity in a chronic focal epilepsy model in rats. This is similar to recent observations in patients with refractory mesio-temporal lobe epilepsy. Moreover, postictal HFO decrease might reflect postictal inhibition of epileptic activity. Overall results provide additional evidence that HFOs can be used as biomarkers for measuring seizure severity in epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Dynamics of the Auditory Continuity Illusion</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.676637</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Illusions give intriguing insights into perceptual and neural dynamics. In the auditory continuity illusion, two brief tones separated by a silent gap may be heard as one continuous tone if a noise burst with appropriate characteristics fills the gap. This illusion probes the conditions under which listeners link related sounds across time and maintain perceptual continuity in the face of sudden changes in sound mixtures. Conceptual explanations of this illusion have been proposed, but its neural basis is still being investigated. In this work we provide a dynamical systems framework, grounded in principles of neural dynamics, to explain the continuity illusion. We construct an idealized firing rate model of a neural population and analyze the conditions under which firing rate responses persist during the interruption between the two tones. First, we show that sustained inputs and hysteresis dynamics (a mismatch between tone levels needed to activate and inactivate the population) can produce continuous responses. Second, we show that transient inputs and bistable dynamics (coexistence of two stable firing rate levels) can also produce continuous responses. Finally, we combine these input types together to obtain neural dynamics consistent with two requirements for the continuity illusion as articulated in a well-known theory of auditory scene analysis: responses persist through the noise-filled gap if noise provides sufficient evidence that the tone continues and if there is no evidence of discontinuities between the tones and noise. By grounding these notions in a quantitative model that incorporates elements of neural circuits (recurrent excitation, and mutual inhibition, specifically), we identify plausible mechanisms for the continuity illusion. Our findings can help guide future studies of neural correlates of this illusion and inform development of more biophysically-based models of the auditory continuity illusion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: First Encounters: Effects of the Microbiota on Neonatal Brain Development</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.682505</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The microbiota plays important roles in host metabolism and immunity, and its disruption affects adult brain physiology and behavior. Although such findings have been attributed to altered neurodevelopment, few studies have actually examined microbiota effects on the developing brain. This review focuses on developmental effects of the earliest exposure to microbes. At birth, the mammalian fetus enters a world teeming with microbes which colonize all body sites in contact with the environment. Bacteria reach the gut within a few hours of birth and cause a measurable response in the intestinal epithelium. In adults, the gut microbiota signals to the brain via the vagus nerve, bacterial metabolites, hormones, and immune signaling, and work in perinatal rodents is beginning to elucidate which of these signaling pathways herald the very first encounter with gut microbes in the neonate. Neural effects of the microbiota during the first few days of life include changes in neuronal cell death, microglia, and brain cytokine levels. In addition to these effects of direct exposure of the newborn to microbes, accumulating evidence points to a role for the maternal microbiota in affecting brain development via bacterial molecules and metabolites while the offspring is still in utero. Hence, perturbations to microbial exposure perinatally, such as through C-section delivery or antibiotic treatment, alter microbiota colonization and may have long-term neural consequences. The perinatal period is critical for brain development and a close look at microbiota effects during this time promises to reveal the earliest, most primary effects of the microbiota on neurodevelopment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Gap Junctions Between Striatal D1 Neurons and Cholinergic Interneurons</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.674399</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The striatum participates in numerous important behaviors. Its principal projection neurons use GABA and peptides as neurotransmitters and interact extensively with interneurons, including cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) that are tonically active. Dissecting the interactions between projection neurons and ChIs is important for uncovering the role and mechanisms of the striatal microcircuits. Here, by combining several optogenetic tools with cell type-specific electrophysiological recordings, we uncovered direct electrical coupling between D1-type projection neurons and ChIs, in addition to the chemical transmission between these two major cell types. Optogenetic stimulation or inhibition led to bilateral current exchanges between D1 neurons and ChIs, which can be abolished by gap junction blockers. We further confirmed the presence of gap junctions through paired electrophysiological recordings and dye microinjections. Finally, we found that activating D1 neurons promotes basal activity of ChIs via gap junctions. Collectively, these results reveal the coexistence of the chemical synapse and gap junctions between D1 neurons and ChIs, which contributes to maintaining the tonically active firing patterns of ChIs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.605030</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke is one of the most common neurological diseases. However, the impact of ischemic stroke on human cerebral tissue remains largely unknown due to a lack of ischemic human brain samples. In this study, we applied cerebral organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells to evaluate the effect of oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R). Pathway analysis showed the relationships between vitamin digestion and absorption, fat digestion and absorption, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway, and complement and coagulation cascades. Combinational verification with transcriptome and gene expression analysis of different cell types revealed fatty acids-related PPAR signaling pathway and pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2) as key markers of neuronal cells in response to OGD/R. These findings suggest that, although there remain some limitations to be improved, our ischemic stroke model using human cerebral organoids would be a potentially useful tool when combined with other conventional two-dimensional (2D) mono-culture systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Maternal Deprivation in Rats Decreases the Expression of Interneuron Markers in the Neocortex and Hippocampus</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.670766</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Early life stress has profound effects on the development of the central nervous system. We exposed 9-day-old rat pups to a 24 h maternal deprivation (MD) and sacrificed them as young adults (60-day-old), with the aim to study the effects of early stress on forebrain circuitry. We estimated numbers of various immunohistochemically defined interneuron subpopulations in several neocortical regions and in the hippocampus. MD rats showed reduced numbers of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and in the prefrontal cortex, compared with controls. Numbers of reelin-expressing and calretinin-expressing interneurons were also reduced in the CA1 and CA3 hippocampal areas, but unaltered in the neocortex of MD rats. The number of calbinin-expressing interneurons in the neocortex was similar in the MD rats compared with controls. We analyzed cell death in 15-day-old rats after MD and found no difference compared to control rats. Thus, our results more likely reflect the downregulation of markers than the actual loss of interneurons. To investigate synaptic activity in the hippocampus we immunostained for glutamatergic and inhibitory vesicular transporters. The number of inhibitory synapses was decreased in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus in MD rats, with the normal number of excitatory synapses. Our results indicate complex, cell type-specific, and region-specific alterations in the inhibitory circuitry induced by maternal deprivation. Such alterations may underlie symptoms of MD at the behavioral level and possibly contribute to mechanisms by which early life stress causes neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Mitophagy in Cerebral Ischemia and Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.687246</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke is a severe cerebrovascular disease with high mortality and morbidity. In recent years, reperfusion treatments based on thrombolytic and thrombectomy are major managements for ischemic stroke patients, and the recanalization time window has been extended to over 24 h. However, with the extension of the time window, the risk of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury following reperfusion therapy becomes a big challenge for patient outcomes. I/R injury leads to neuronal death due to the imbalance in metabolic supply and demand, which is usually related to mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitophagy is a type of selective autophagy referring to the process of specific autophagic elimination of damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria to prevent the generation of excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the subsequent cell death. Recent advances have implicated the protective role of mitophagy in cerebral ischemia is mainly associated with its neuroprotective effects in I/R injury. This review discusses the involvement of mitochondria dynamics and mitophagy in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke and I/R injury in particular, focusing on the therapeutic potential of mitophagy regulation and the possibility of using mitophagy-related interventions as an adjunctive approach for neuroprotective time window extension after ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.658376</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by the complex interaction of multiple mechanisms. Recent studies examining the effect of high-fat diet (HFD) on the AD phenotype have demonstrated a significant influence on both inflammation and cognition. However, different studies on the effect of high-fat diet on AD pathology have reported conflicting conclusions. To explore the involvement of HFD in AD, we investigated phenotypic and metabolic changes in an AD mouse model in response to HFD. The results indicated there was no significant effect on Aβ levels or contextual memory due to HFD treatment. Of note, HFD did moderate neuroinflammation, despite spurring inflammation and increasing cholesterol levels in the periphery. In addition, diet affected gut microbiota symbiosis, altering the production of bacterial metabolites. HFD created a favorable microenvironment for bile acid alteration and arachidonic acid metabolism in APP/PS1 mice, which may be related to the observed improvement in LXR/PPAR expression. Our previous research demonstrated that Huanglian Jiedu decoction (HLJDD) significantly ameliorated impaired learning and memory. Furthermore, HLJDD may globally suppress inflammation and lipid accumulation to relieve cognitive impairment after HFD intervention. It was difficult to define the effect of HFD on AD progression because the results were influenced by confounding factors and biases. Although there was still obvious damage in AD mice treated with HFD, there was no deterioration and there was even a slight remission of neuroinflammation. Moreover, HLJDD represents a potential AD drug based on its anti-inflammatory and lipid-lowering effects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MAP2K5, a member of the MAPK family, is associated with central nervous system disorders. However, neural functional of Map2k5 from animal models were not well examined so far. Here, we established a Map2k5-targeted knockout mouse model to investigate the behavior phenotypes and its underlying molecular mechanism. Our results showed that female Map2k5 mutant mice manifested decreased circadian-dependent ambulatory locomotion, coordination, and fatigue. Male Map2k5 mutant mice displayed impairment in open field exploration and prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle response (ASR) when compared with wild-type controls. Furthermore, Map2k5 mutant mice showed a decreased dopaminergic cell survival and tyrosine hydroxylase levels in nigrostriatal pathway, indicating a crucial role of MAP2K5 in regulating dopamine system in the central nervous system. In conclusion, this is the first study demonstrating that Map2k5 mutant mice displayed phenotypes by disturbing the dopamine system in the central nervous system, implicating Map2k5 mutant mouse as a promising model for many dopamine related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/67481</link>
	<content:encoded>Chromosome 4q deletion is one of the most frequently detected genomic imbalance events in congenital heart disease (CHD) patients. However, a portion of CHD-associated 4q deletions without known CHD genes suggests unknown CHD genes within these intervals. Here, we have shown that knockdown of &lt;i&gt;SORBS2&lt;/i&gt;, a 4q interval gene, disrupted sarcomeric integrity of cardiomyocytes and caused reduced cardiomyocyte number in human embryonic stem cell differentiation model. Molecular analyses revealed decreased expression of second heart field (SHF) marker genes and impaired NOTCH and SHH signaling in &lt;i&gt;SORBS2-&lt;/i&gt;knockdown cells. Exogenous SHH rescued &lt;i&gt;SORBS2&lt;/i&gt; knockdown-induced cardiomyocyte differentiation defects. &lt;i&gt;Sorbs2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mouse mutants had atrial septal hypoplasia/aplasia or double atrial septum (DAS) derived from impaired posterior SHF with a similar expression alteration. Rare &lt;i&gt;SORBS2&lt;/i&gt; variants were significantly enriched in a cohort of 300 CHD patients. Our findings indicate that &lt;i&gt;SORBS2&lt;/i&gt; is a regulator of SHF development and its variants contribute to CHD pathogenesis. The presence of DAS in &lt;i&gt;Sorbs2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; hearts reveals the first molecular etiology of this rare anomaly linked to paradoxical thromboembolism.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64911</link>
	<content:encoded>Precise and efficient insertion of large DNA fragments into somatic cells using gene editing technologies to label or modify endogenous proteins remains challenging. Non-specific insertions/deletions (INDELs) resulting from the non-homologous end joining pathway make the process error-prone. Further, the insert is not readily removable. Here, we describe a method called &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;CRISP&lt;/span&gt;R-mediated &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;nsertion of &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;xon (CRISPIE) that can precisely and reversibly label endogenous proteins using CRISPR/Cas9-based editing. CRISPIE inserts a designer donor module, which consists of an exon encoding the protein sequence flanked by intron sequences, into an intronic location in the target gene. INDELs at the insertion junction will be spliced out, leaving mRNAs nearly error-free. We used CRISPIE to fluorescently label endogenous proteins in mammalian neurons &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; with previously unachieved efficiency. We demonstrate that this method is broadly applicable, and that the insert can be readily removed later. CRISPIE permits protein sequence insertion with high fidelity, efficiency, and flexibility.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64901</link>
	<content:encoded>Intracellular density impacts the physical nature of the cytoplasm and can globally affect cellular processes, yet density regulation remains poorly understood. Here, using a new quantitative phase imaging method, we determined that dry-mass density in fission yeast is maintained in a narrow distribution and exhibits homeostatic behavior. However, density varied during the cell cycle, decreasing during G2, increasing in mitosis and cytokinesis, and dropping rapidly at cell birth. These density variations were explained by a constant rate of biomass synthesis, coupled to slowdown of volume growth during cell division and rapid expansion post-cytokinesis. Arrest at specific cell-cycle stages exacerbated density changes. Spatially heterogeneous patterns of density suggested links between density regulation, tip growth, and intracellular osmotic pressure. Our results demonstrate that systematic density variations during the cell cycle are predominantly due to modulation of volume expansion, and reveal functional consequences of density gradients and cell-cycle arrests.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64412</link>
	<content:encoded>3D eukaryotic genome organization provides the structural basis for gene regulation. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;, genome folding is characterized by somatic homolog pairing, where homologous chromosomes are intimately paired from end to end; however, how homologs identify one another and pair has remained mysterious. Recently, this process has been proposed to be driven by specifically interacting 'buttons' encoded along chromosomes. Here, we turned this hypothesis into a quantitative biophysical model to demonstrate that a button-based mechanism can lead to chromosome-wide pairing. We tested our model using live-imaging measurements of chromosomal loci tagged with the MS2 and PP7 nascent RNA labeling systems. We show solid agreement between model predictions and experiments in the pairing dynamics of individual homologous loci. Our results strongly support a button-based mechanism of somatic homolog pairing in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; and provide a theoretical framework for revealing the molecular identity and regulation of buttons.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63355</link>
	<content:encoded>Many animals have large visual fields, and sensory circuits may sample those regions of visual space most relevant to behaviours such as gaze stabilisation and hunting. Despite this, relatively small displays are often used in vision neuroscience. To sample stimulus locations across most of the visual field, we built a spherical stimulus arena with 14,848 independently controllable LEDs. We measured the optokinetic response gain of immobilised zebrafish larvae to stimuli of different steradian size and visual field locations. We find that the two eyes are less yoked than previously thought and that spatial frequency tuning is similar across visual field positions. However, zebrafish react most strongly to lateral, nearly equatorial stimuli, consistent with previously reported spatial densities of red, green and blue photoreceptors. Upside-down experiments suggest further extra-retinal processing. Our results demonstrate that motion vision circuits in zebrafish are anisotropic, and preferentially monitor areas with putative behavioural relevance.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Dietary restriction (DR) extends healthy lifespan in diverse species. Age and nutrient-related changes in the abundance of microRNAs (miRNAs) and their processing factors have been linked to organismal longevity. However, the mechanisms by which they modulate lifespan and the tissue-specific role of miRNA-mediated networks in DR-dependent enhancement of lifespan remains largely unexplored. We show that two neuronally enriched and highly conserved microRNAs, &lt;i&gt;miR-125&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;let-7&lt;/i&gt; mediate the DR response in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;. Functional characterization of &lt;i&gt;miR-125&lt;/i&gt; demonstrates its role in neurons while its target &lt;i&gt;chinmo&lt;/i&gt; acts both in neurons and the fat body to modulate fat metabolism and longevity. Proteomic analysis revealed that Chinmo exerts its DR effects by regulating the expression of &lt;i&gt;FATP, CG2017, CG9577, CG17554, CG5009, CG8778, CG9527&lt;/i&gt;, and&lt;i&gt; FASN1&lt;/i&gt;. Our findings identify &lt;i&gt;miR-125&lt;/i&gt; as a conserved effector of the DR pathway and open the avenue for this small RNA molecule and its downstream effectors to be considered as potential drug candidates for the treatment of late-onset diseases and biomarkers for healthy aging in humans.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Alzheimer's Disease (AD) in elderly adds substantially to socio-economic burden necessitating early diagnosis. While recent studies in rodent models of AD have suggested diagnostic and therapeutic value for gamma rhythms in brain, the same has not been rigorously tested in humans. In this case-control study, we recruited a large population (N=244; 106 females) of elderly (&amp;gt;49 years) subjects from the community, who viewed large gratings that induced strong gamma oscillations in their electroencephalogram (EEG). These subjects were classified as healthy (N=227), mild-cognitively-impaired (MCI; N=12) or AD (N=5) based on clinical history and Clinical Dementia Rating scores. Surprisingly, stimulus-induced gamma rhythms, but not alpha or steady-state visually evoked responses, were significantly lower in MCI/AD subjects compared to their age and gender matched controls. This reduction was not due to differences in eye-movements or baseline power. Our results suggest that gamma could be used as potential screening tool for MCI/AD in humans.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60554</link>
	<content:encoded>Plexin-B2 deletion leads to aberrant lamination of cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) and Purkinje cells. Although in the cerebellum Plexin-B2 is only expressed by proliferating CGN precursors in the outer external granule layer (oEGL), its function in CGN development is still elusive. Here, we used 3D imaging, &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; electroporation and live-imaging techniques to study CGN development in novel cerebellum-specific &lt;i&gt;Plxnb2&lt;/i&gt; conditional knockout mice. We show that proliferating CGNs in &lt;i&gt;Plxnb2&lt;/i&gt; mutants not only escape the oEGL and mix with newborn postmitotic CGNs. Furthermore, motility of mitotic precursors and early postmitotic CGNs is altered. Together, this leads to the formation of ectopic patches of CGNs at the cerebellar surface and an intermingling of normally time-stamped parallel fibers in the molecular layer (ML), and aberrant arborization of Purkinje cell dendrites. There results suggest that Plexin-B2 restricts CGN motility and might have a function in cytokinesis.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: The push-to-open mechanism of the tethered mechanosensitive ion channel NompC</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58388</link>
	<content:encoded>NompC is a mechanosensitive ion channel responsible for the sensation of touch and balance in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;. Based on a resolved cryo-EM structure, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and electrophysiological experiments to study the atomistic details of NompC gating. Our results showed that NompC could be opened by compression of the intracellular ankyrin repeat domain but not by a stretch, and a number of hydrogen bonds along the force convey pathway are important for the mechanosensitivity. Under intracellular compression, the bundled ankyrin repeat region acts like a spring with a spring constant of ~13 pN nm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; by transferring forces at a rate of ~1.8 nm ps&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. The linker helix region acts as a bridge between the ankyrin repeats and the transient receptor potential (TRP) domain, which passes on the pushing force to the TRP domain to undergo a clockwise rotation, resulting in the opening of the channel. This could be the universal gating mechanism of similar tethered mechanosensitive TRP channels, which enable cells to feel compression and shrinkage.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Start codon disruption with CRISPR/Cas9 prevents murine Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55637</link>
	<content:encoded>A missense mutation of collagen type VIII alpha 2 chain (&lt;i&gt;COL8A2&lt;/i&gt;) gene leads to early onset Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD), which progressively impairs vision through loss of corneal endothelial cells. We demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9-based postnatal gene editing achieves structural and functional rescue in a mouse model of FECD. A single intraocular injection of an adenovirus encoding both the Cas9 gene and guide RNA (Ad-Cas9-Col8a2gRNA), efficiently knocked down mutant &lt;i&gt;COL8A2&lt;/i&gt; expression in corneal endothelial cells, prevented endothelial cell loss, and rescued corneal endothelium pumping function in adult &lt;i&gt;Col8a2&lt;/i&gt; mutant mice. There were no adverse sequelae on histology or electroretinography. &lt;i&gt;Col8a2&lt;/i&gt; start codon disruption represents a non-surgical strategy to prevent vision loss in early-onset FECD. As this demonstrates the ability of Ad-Cas9-gRNA to restore phenotype in adult post-mitotic cells, this method may be widely applicable to adult-onset diseases, even in tissues affected with disorders of non-reproducing cells.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.08.447565v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Usher syndrome type I (USH1) is characterized by congenital deafness, vestibular areflexia, and progressive retinal degeneration with age. The protein-truncating p.Arg245* founder variant of PCDH15 has an ~2% carrier frequency among Ashkenazi Jews, accounting for nearly 60% of their USH1 cases. Here, longitudinal ocular phenotyping in thirteen USH1F individuals harboring the p.Arg245* variant revealed progressive retinal degeneration, leading to severe loss of vision with macular atrophy by the sixth decade. Half of the affected individuals met either the visual acuity or visual field loss definition for legal blindness by the middle of their fifth decade of life. Mice homozygous for p.Arg250* (Pcdh15R250X; equivalent to human p.Arg245*) also have early visual deficits evaluated using electroretinography. Light-dependent translocation of phototransduction cascade proteins, arrestin and transducin, was found to be impaired in Pcdh15R250X mice. Retinal pigment epithelium-(RPE) specific visual retinoid cycle proteins, RPE65 which converts all-trans retinoids to 11-cis retinoids and CRALBP that transports retinoids, and key retinoid levels were also reduced in Pcdh15R250X mice, suggesting a dual role for protocadherin-15 in photoreceptors and RPE. Administration of exogenous 9-cis retinal, an analog of the naturally occurring 11-cis retinal, improved ERG amplitudes in these mutant mice, suggesting a basis for a clinical trial of exogenous FDA approved retinoids to preserve vision in USH1F patients.

SummaryIn a preclinical setting studying exogenous retinoids using a novel Usher syndrome mouse model, we describe a potential therapy to treat PCDH15-mediated visual dysfunction.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Circadian rhythms have natural relative variations among humans known as chronotype. Chronotype or being a morning or evening person, has a specific physiological, behavioural, and also genetic manifestation. Whether and how chronotype modulates human brain physiology and cognition is, however, not well understood. Here we examined how chronotype affects cortical excitability, neuroplasticity, and cognition in early and late chronotype individuals. We monitored motor cortical excitability, brain stimulation-induced neuroplasticity, and examined motor learning and cognitive functions at circadian-preferred and non-preferred times of day in 32 individuals. Motor learning and cognitive performance (working memory, and attention) along with their electrophysiological components were significantly enhanced at the circadian-preferred, compared to the non-preferred time. This outperformance was associated with enhanced cortical excitability (prominent cortical facilitation, diminished cortical inhibition), and long-term potentiation/depression-like plasticity. Our data show convergent findings of the impact of chronotype on human brain functions from basic physiological mechanisms to behaviour and higher cognitive functions.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.08.447507v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The striatums complex microcircuit is made by connections within and between its D1- and D2-receptor expressing projection neurons and at least five species of interneuron. Precise knowledge of this circuit is likely essential to understanding striatums functional roles and its dysfunction in a wide range of movement and cognitive disorders. We introduce here a Bayesian approach to mapping neuron connectivity using intracellular recording data, which lets us simultaneously evaluate the probability of connection between neuron types, the strength of evidence for it, and its dependence on distance. Using it to synthesise a complete map of the rodent striatum, we find strong evidence for two asymmetries: a selective asymmetry of projection neuron connections, with D2 neurons connecting twice as densely to other projection neurons than do D1 neurons, but neither subtype preferentially connecting to another; and a length-scale asymmetry, with interneuron connection probabilities remaining non-negligible at more than twice the distance of projection neuron connections. We further show our Bayesian approach can evaluate evidence for wiring changes, using data from the developing striatum and a mouse model of Huntingtons disease. By quantifying the uncertainty in our knowledge of the microcircuit, our approach reveals a wide range of potential striatal wiring diagrams consistent with current data.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.08.447497v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Stimulant use, including cocaine, often occurs in a social context whose influence is important to understand to decrease intake and reduce associated harms. Given the regulatory role of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) on cocaine intake and emotions, we investigate its role on such influence of social context on cocaine intake. We explored the influence of peer presence and familiarity on the frequency of self-administered cocaine and its neurobiological basis. We first compared cocaine intake in various conditions (alone or with peers with different characteristics: observing or self-administering, familiar or not, cocaine-naive or not, dominant or subordinate) in rats (n=90). The risk of drug consumption was reduced when a peer was present, observing or self-administering as well, and further diminished when the peer was unfamiliar (vs familiar). The presence of a cocaine-naive peer further decreased cocaine consumption. The presence of a non-familiar and drug-naive peer represents thus key conditions to diminish cocaine intake. We tested the effects of STN lesions in these various conditions and also conducted social experiments to validate the role of STN in social cognition. The STN lesion by itself reduced cocaine intake to the level reached in presence of a stranger naive peer and affected social cognition, positioning the STN as one neurobiological substrate of social influence on drug intake. Finally, with a translational research approach, we compared the drug intake in these conditions in human drug users (n=77). This human study confirmed the beneficial effect of social presence, especially of strangers. Our results indirectly support the use of social interventions and harm reduction strategies, in particular supervised consumption rooms for stimulant users.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.08.447402v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Dendritic spines are critical components of the neuronal synapse as they receive and transform the synaptic input into a succession of biochemical events regulated by calcium signaling. The spine apparatus (SA), an extension of smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER), regulates slow and fast calcium dynamics in spines. Calcium release events from SA result in a rapid depletion of calcium ion reservoir, yet the next cycle of signaling requires replenishment of SA calcium stores. How dendritic spines achieve this without triggering calcium release remains unclear. Using computational modeling, calcium and STED super-resolution imaging, we showed that the refilling of calcium-deprived SA involves store-operated calcium entry during spontaneous calcium transients in spine heads. We identified two main conditions that guarantee SA replenishment without depletion: (1) a small amplitude and slow timescale for calcium influx, and (2) a close proximity between SA and plasma membranes. Thereby, molecular nano-organization creates the conditions for a clear separation between SA replenishment and depletion. We further conclude that the nanoscale organization of SA receptors underlies the specificity of calcium dynamics patterns during the induction of long-term synaptic changes.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Mutations linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, such as intellectual disability (ID), are frequently found in genes that encode for proteins of the excitatory synapse. Transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs) are AMPA receptor auxiliary proteins that regulate crucial aspects of receptor function. Here, we investigate an ID-associated mutant form of the TARP family member stargazin. Molecular dynamics analyses showed that the stargazin V143L variant weakens the overall interface of the AMPAR:stargazin complex and hinders the stability of the complex. Knock-in mice for the V143L stargazin mutation manifest cognitive and social deficits and hippocampal synaptic transmission defects. In the hippocampus of stargazin V143L mice, CA1 neurons show impaired spine maturation in basal dendrites, and synaptic ultrastructural alterations. These data demonstrate a causal role for mutated stargazin in the pathogenesis of ID and highlight its role in the development and function of hippocampal synapses.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.07.447464v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In patch foraging tasks, animals must decide whether to remain with a depleting resource or to leave it in search of a potentially better source of reward. In such tasks, animals consistently follow the general predictions of optimal foraging theory (the Marginal Value Theorem; MVT): to leave a patch when the reward rate in the current patch depletes to the average reward rate across patches. Prior studies implicate an important role for the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in foraging decisions based on MVT: within single trials, ACC activity increases immediately preceding foraging decisions, and across trials, these dynamics are modulated as the value of staying in the patch depletes to the average reward rate. Here, we test whether these activity patterns reflect dynamic encoding of decision-variables and whether these signals are directly involved in decision-making or serve a more general function such as monitoring task performance or allocating cognitive control. We developed a leaky accumulator model based on the MVT that generates estimates of decision variables within and across trials, and tested model predictions against ACC activity recorded from rats performing a patch foraging task. Model predicted changes in MVT decision variables closely matched rat ACC activity. Next, we pharmacologically inactivated ACC to test the contribution of these signals to decision-making. Despite ACC inactivation, rats still followed the MVT decision rule, suggesting that foraging decision variables represented in the ACC are used for a more general function such as regulating cognitive control or motivation.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Learning and memory critically rely on long-lasting, synapse-specific modifications. While postsynaptic forms of plasticity typically require local protein synthesis, whether and how local protein synthesis contributes to presynaptic changes remains unclear. Here, we examined the hippocampal mossy fiber (MF)-CA3 synapse which expresses both structural and functional presynaptic plasticity. We report that MF boutons synthesize protein locally and contain ribosomes. Long-term potentiation of MF-CA3 synaptic transmission (MF-LTP) was associated with translation-dependent enlargement of MF boutons. Moreover, increasing in vitro and in vivo MF activity enhanced protein synthesis in MFs. Remarkably, deletion of presynaptic Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein expressed in MF boutons and previously implicated in local postsynaptic protein synthesis-dependent plasticity, blocked structural and functional MF-LTP, suggesting that FMRP is a critical regulator of presynaptic function. Thus, presynaptic FMRP and protein synthesis dynamically control presynaptic structure and function in the mature brain.

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.07.447452v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>It is widely thought that during early stages of motor learning, the dorsomedial striatum facilitates the learning of goal-directed actions, and at later stages, the learned actions are transferred to the dorsolateral striatum, which enables motor actions to become a skill or habit. It is however unknown if these striatal regions are simultaneously active as expertise is acquired during practice. To address this question, we developed a treadmill task to track changes in mouse locomotor coordination during practice running at a range of speeds. We analyzed body position and paw movement to evaluate changes in motor coordination over practice using DeepLabCut and custom-built code. By simultaneous evaluation of motor coordination improvements and fiber photometry recordings of neuronal calcium activity during training, we found that direct pathway dorsomedial striatum neurons exhibited reduced activity as the mouse became proficient at running on the treadmill. In contrast, direct pathway activity in dorsolateral striatum was similar throughout training and did not correlate with increased skill proficiency. These results provide new tools to measure changes in fine motor skills during simultaneous recordings of brain activity, revealing fundamental features of the neural substrates of motor learning.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.07.447429v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Reading creates accessibility to the outer world information and is an integral skill for academic achievement. It involves visual perception, reasoning at symbolic level (text reading) and phonological processing. But does perception, visuospatial processing at pre-symbolic level affect reading skill? To understand and untangle the mechanism fifty children with reading problem (developmental dyslexia, DDC) and twentyfive age-matched typical readers (healthy controls, HC) were studied. In DDC, the variable-performance of non-symbolic visual search (pictorial-level) was associated with bilateral brain activity (functional MRI) of ventral stream (inferior occipital and fusiform) and greater involvement of frontal-prefrontal regions, suggesting the modified dorsal route-gating for figure-ground filtering. Performance variability in picture-concept reasoning (71.9% and significant group mean difference) and visuospatial-organization (51.3%) of DDC children indicate attentional or executive differences at nonsymbolic level. In symbolic discrimination performance, no significant difference observed for single alphabet or number (digit) reading but significant differences at word level for visual and phonological performance (considering orthographic differences), attributes to distractor-inhibition problems. Nonsymbolic to symbolic coding/decoding speed and writing error (copying) differences are suggestive of execution variability rather than motor coordination in DDC. In HC, the top-down dorsal route gating and hypoactivity induced in right frontal-anterior cingulate cortices, play a major role in reading by allocating spatial attention and inhibiting distractors. It has been elaborated in the &quot;neurobiological model&quot;.

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Estimated connectivity networks outperform observed connectivity networks when classifying people with multiple sclerosis into disability groups</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.07.447376v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>BackgroundMultiple Sclerosis (MS), a neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory disease, causing lesions that disrupt the brains anatomical and physiological connectivity networks, resulting in cognitive, visual and/or motor disabilities. Advanced imaging techniques like diffusion and functional MRI allow measurement of the brains structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) networks, and can enable a better understanding of how their disruptions cause disability in people with MS (pwMS). However, advanced MRI techniques are used mainly for research purposes as they are expensive, time-consuming and require high-level expertise to acquire and process. As an alternative, the Network Modification (NeMo) Tool can be used to estimate SC and FC using lesion masks derived from pwMS and a reference set of controls connectivity networks.

ObjectiveHere, we test the hypothesis that estimated SC and FC (eSC and eFC) from the NeMo Tool, based only on an individuals lesion masks, can be used to classify pwMS into disability categories just as well as SC and FC extracted from advanced MRI directly in pwMS. We also aim to find the connections most important for differentiating between no disability vs evidence of disability groups.

Materials and MethodsOne hundred pwMS (age:45.5 {+/-} 11.4 years, 66% female, disease duration: 12.97 8.07 years) were included in this study. Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) was used to assess disability, 67 pwMS had no disability (EDSS &amp;lt; 2). Observed SC and FC were extracted from diffusion and functional MRI directly in pwMS, respectively. The NeMo Tool was used to estimate the remaining structural connectome (eSC), by removing streamlines in a reference set of tractograms that intersected the lesion mask. The NeMo Tools eSC was used then as input to a deep neural network to estimate the corresponding FC (eFC). Logistic regression with ridge regularization was used to classify pwMS into disability categories (no disability vs evidence of disability), based on demographics/clinical information (sex, age, race, disease duration, clinical phenotype, and spinal lesion burden) and either pairwise entries or regional summaries from one of the following matrices: SC, FC, eSC, and eFC. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used to assess the classification performance. Both univariate statistics and parameter coefficients from the classification models were used to identify features important to differentiating between the groups.

ResultsThe regional eSC and eFC models outperformed their observed FC and SC counterparts (p-value&amp;lt;0.05), while the pairwise eSC and SC performed similarly (p=0.10). Regional eSC and eFC models had higher AUC (0.66-0.68) than the pairwise models (0.60-0.65), with regional eFC having highest classification accuracy across all models. Ridge regression coefficients for the regional eFC and regional observed FC models were significantly correlated (Pearsons r = 0.52, p-value &amp;lt; 10e-7). Decreased estimated SC node strength in default mode and ventral attention networks and increased eFC node strength in visual networks was associated with evidence of disability.

DiscussionHere, for the first time, we use clinically-acquired lesion masks to estimate both structural and functional connectomes in patient populations to better understand brain lesion-dysfunction mapping in pwMS. Models based on the NeMo Tools estimates of SC and FC better classified pwMS by disability level than SC and FC observed directly in the individual using advanced MRI. This work provides a viable alternative to performing high-cost, advanced MRI in patient populations, bringing the connectome one step closer to the clinic.

HighlightsO_LIWe compared the accuracy of models based on observed functional connectivity (FC) and structural connectivity (SC) networks extracted from advanced MRI and estimated FC and SC networks derived using only lesion masks from conventional MRI in classifying people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) into disability groups.
C_LIO_LIEstimated SC and FC generally outperformed observed SC and FC in classifying pwMS into no disability vs evidence of disability groups, with regional estimated SC and FC having the best performance.

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Constitutive AP2gamma deficiency reduces postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis and induces behavioral deficits in juvenile mice that persist during adulthood</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.07.447328v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The transcription factor activating protein two gamma (AP2{gamma}) is an important regulator of neurogenesis both during embryonic development as well as in the postnatal brain, but its role for neurophysiology and behavior at distinct postnatal periods is still unclear. In this work, we explored the neurogenic, behavioral, and functional impact of a constitutive AP2{gamma} heterozygous deletion in mice from early postnatal development until adulthood. Constitutive AP2{gamma} heterozygous deletion in mice caused a reduction of hippocampal transient amplifying progenitors (TAPs) in the postnatal brain, inducing significant impairments on hippocampal-dependent emotional- and cognitive-behavioral tasks including anxiety-like behavior and cognitive deficits, typically associated with an intact neurogenic activity. Moreover, AP2{gamma} deficiency impairs dorsal hippocampus-to-prefrontal cortex functional connectivity.

We observed a progressive and cumulative impact of constitutive AP2{gamma} deficiency on the hippocampal glutamatergic neurogenic process, as well as alterations on limbic-cortical connectivity, together with impairments on emotional and cognitive behaviors from juvenile to adult periods. Collectively, the results herein presented demonstrate the importance of AP2{gamma} in the generation of glutamatergic neurons in the postnatal brain and its impact on behavioral performance.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Across-animal odor decoding by probabilistic manifold alignment</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.06.447279v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Identifying the common structure of neural dynamics across subjects is key for extracting unifying principles of brain computation and for many brain machine interface applications. Here, we propose a novel probabilistic approach for aligning stimulus-evoked responses from multiple animals in a common low dimensional manifold and use hierarchical inference to identify which stimulus drives neural activity in any given trial. Our probabilistic decoder is robust to a range of features of the neural responses and significantly outperforms existing neural alignment procedures. When applied to recordings from the mouse olfactory bulb, our approach reveals low-dimensional population dynamics that are odor specific and have consistent structure across animals. Thus, our decoder can be used for increasing the robustness and scalability of neural-based chemical detection.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Effect of cellular rearrangement time delays on the rheology of vertex models for confluent tissues</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/6fEXLvSFyso/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Gonca Erdemci-Tandogan, M. Lisa Manning&lt;/p&gt;

Large-scale tissue deformation during biological processes such as morphogenesis requires cellular rearrangements. The simplest rearrangement in confluent cellular monolayers involves neighbor exchanges among four cells, called a T1 transition, in analogy to foams. But unlike foams, cells must execute a sequence of molecular processes, such as endocytosis of adhesion molecules, to complete a T1 transition. Such processes could take a long time compared to other timescales in the tissue. In this work, we incorporate this idea by augmenting vertex models to require a fixed, finite time for T1 transitions, which we call the “T1 delay time”. We study how variations in T1 delay time affect tissue mechanics, by quantifying the relaxation time of tissues in the presence of T1 delays and comparing that to the cell-shape based timescale that characterizes fluidity in the absence of any T1 delays. We show that the molecular-scale T1 delay timescale dominates over the cell shape-scale collective response timescale when the T1 delay time is the larger of the two. We extend this analysis to tissues that become anisotropic under convergent extension, finding similar results. Moreover, we find that increasing the T1 delay time increases the percentage of higher-fold coordinated vertices and rosettes, and decreases the overall number of successful T1s, contributing to a more elastic-like—and less fluid-like—tissue response. Our work suggests that molecular mechanisms that act as a brake on T1 transitions could stiffen global tissue mechanics and enhance rosette formation during morphogenesis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6fEXLvSFyso&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Divisive normalization (DN) is a prominent computational building block in the brain that has been proposed as a canonical cortical operation. Numerous experimental studies have verified its importance for capturing nonlinear neural response properties to simple, artificial stimuli, and computational studies suggest that DN is also an important component for processing natural stimuli. However, we lack quantitative models of DN that are directly informed by measurements of spiking responses in the brain and applicable to arbitrary stimuli. Here, we propose a DN model that is applicable to arbitrary input images. We test its ability to predict how neurons in macaque primary visual cortex (V1) respond to natural images, with a focus on nonlinear response properties within the classical receptive field. Our model consists of one layer of subunits followed by learned orientation-specific DN. It outperforms linear-nonlinear and wavelet-based feature representations and makes a significant step towards the performance of state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) models. Unlike deep CNNs, our compact DN model offers a direct interpretation of the nature of normalization. By inspecting the learned normalization pool of our model, we gained insights into a long-standing question about the tuning properties of DN that update the current textbook description: we found that within the receptive field oriented features were normalized preferentially by features with similar orientation rather than non-specifically as currently assumed.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YVhoXxf95tQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Adaptive cognitive-control involves a hierarchical cortico-striatal gating system that supports selective updating, maintenance, and retrieval of useful cognitive and motor information. Here, we developed a task that independently manipulates selective gating operations into working-memory (input gating), from working-memory (output gating), and of responses (motor gating) and tested the neural dynamics and computational principles that support them. Increases in gating demands, captured by gate switches, were expressed by distinct EEG correlates at each gating level that evolved dynamically in partially overlapping time windows. Further, categorical representations of specific maintained items and of motor responses could be decoded from EEG when the corresponding gate was switching, thereby linking gating operations to prioritization. Finally, gate switching at all levels was related to increases in the motor decision threshold as quantified by the drift diffusion model. Together these results support the notion that cognitive gating operations scaffold on top of mechanisms involved in motor gating.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v7U_RTY-wRA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Humans identify properties (e.g., the length or weight) of objects through touch using somatosensory perceptions in the limbs. Humans identify these properties by manipulating an object to access its inertial qualities. However, there is little work evidencing a unifying pattern of movements humans use to access these inertial properties. The current study examined if participants’ wielding movements followed a systematic distribution—specifically, a Lévy-like distribution that is characterized by heavy-tails and is often seen in efficient foraging behavior. Participants wielded rods they could not see and were tasked to identify whether the rod they were wielding was the longer or shorter of two rods. While participants wielded the rod, the rod’s motion was captured. Results demonstrate that the sampling of angular accelerations produced heavy-tailed distributions. Since angular acceleration has a distinct physical–mathematical relationship with inertia, this finding is consistent with the interpretation that the haptic subsystems are sensitive to the inertial properties of an object. Angular acceleration from wielding motions appear to follow a similar distribution as optimal foraging strategies—perhaps it is the case that humans are foraging for information about the inertia of an object through changes in angular acceleration and wielding movements.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Behavioural tagging: Effect of novelty exploration on plasticity related molecular signatures</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00221-021-06099-4</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Learning and memory are one of those frontier areas of neurobiology which attract us to investigate the intricacy of this process. Here, we aimed to investigate the general mechanism of “Behavioural Tagging and Capture” in long term memory (LTM) formation and to find the key factors playing role in consolidation of LTM. In this study, we’ve shown that not only plasticity related proteins (PRPs) but neurotransmitters and immediate early genes (IEGs) also play an important role in memory formation process. It’s very well evident that memory traces can last longer if close in time novelty is introduced around memory encoding. Here our results point out that this novelty exploration acts as a modulator in memory consolidation by providing PRPs such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), enhancing neurotransmitters (Dopamine), IEGs (cFos) and some enzymes such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE), monoamine oxidase (MAO), sodium–potassium ATPase (Na&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase). Therefore, by using a Novel Object Recognition task (NOR) in combination with novel task exposure, we evaluated the role of molecular markers in memory consolidation employing a behavioural tagging model. The purpose of the current study was first to evaluate the effect of novelty exposure around a single trail of NOR task in a critical time window on memory consolidation in rats after 24 h and second to determine the expression of BDNF, CREB, c-fos, AChE, MAO, Na&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase as potential markers in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during memory formation. In the present study, to identify and validate the role of these molecular signatures in memory consolidation, infusion of the protein synthesis inhibitor Anisomycin (Ani) was done around the training session that causes a deficit in the formation of LTM when tested 24 h after weak encoding.

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: The P2X7 Receptor Is Involved in Diabetic Neuropathic Pain Hypersensitivity Mediated by TRPV1 in the Rat Dorsal Root Ganglion</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.663649</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The purinergic 2X&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; (P2X&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;) receptor expressed in satellite glial cells (SGCs) is involved in the inflammatory response, and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) participates in the process of neurogenic inflammation, such as that in diabetic neuropathic pain (DNP) and peripheral neuralgia. The main purpose of this study was to explore the role of the P2X&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; receptor in DNP hypersensitivity mediated by TRPV1 in the rat and its possible mechanism. A rat model of type 2 diabetes mellitus-related neuropathic pain (NPP) named the DNP rat model was established in this study. The mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT) and thermal withdrawal latency (TWL) of DNP rats were increased after intrathecal injection of the P2X&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonist A438079, and the mRNA and protein levels of TRPV1 in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) were decreased in DNP rats treated with A438079 compared to untreated DNP rats; in addition, A438079 also decreased the phosphorylation of p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in the DNP group. Based on these results, the P2X&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; receptor might be involved in DNP mediated by TRPV1.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.661856</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;With the arrival of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the challenges arising from Big Data, neuromorphic chip concepts are seen as key solutions for coping with the massive amount of unstructured data streams by moving the computation closer to the sensors, the so-called “edge computing.” Augmenting these chips with emerging memory technologies enables these edge devices with non-volatile and adaptive properties which are desirable for low power and online learning operations. However, an energy- and area-efficient realization of these systems requires disruptive hardware changes. Memristor-based solutions for these concepts are in the focus of research and industry due to their low-power and high-density online learning potential. Specifically, the filamentary-type valence change mechanism (VCM memories) have shown to be a promising candidate In consequence, physical models capturing a broad spectrum of experimentally observed features such as the pronounced cycle-to-cycle (c2c) and device-to-device (d2d) variability are required for accurate evaluation of the proposed concepts. In this study, we present an in-depth experimental analysis of d2d and c2c variability of filamentary-type bipolar switching HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/TiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; nano-sized crossbar devices and match the experimentally observed variabilities to our physically motivated JART VCM compact model. Based on this approach, we evaluate the concept of parallel operation of devices as a synapse both experimentally and theoretically. These parallel synapses form a synaptic array which is at the core of neuromorphic chips. We exploit the c2c variability of these devices for stochastic online learning which has shown to increase the effective bit precision of the devices. Finally, we demonstrate that stochastic switching features for a pattern classification task that can be employed in an online learning neural network.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.633988</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In patients with focal drug-resistant epilepsy, electrical stimulation from intracranial electrodes is frequently used for the localization of seizure onset zones and related pathological networks. The ability of electrically stimulated tissue to generate beta and gamma range oscillations, called rapid-discharges, is a frequent indication of an epileptogenic zone. However, a limit of intracranial stimulation is the fixed physical location and number of implanted electrodes, leaving numerous clinically and functionally relevant brain regions unexplored. Here, we demonstrate an alternative technique relying exclusively on non-penetrating surface electrodes, namely an orientation-tunable form of temporally interfering (TI) electric fields to target the CA3 of the mouse hippocampus which focally evokes seizure-like events (SLEs) having the characteristic frequencies of rapid-discharges, but without the necessity of the implanted electrodes. The orientation of the topical electrodes with respect to the orientation of the hippocampus is demonstrated to strongly control the threshold for evoking SLEs. Additionally, we demonstrate the use of Pulse-width-modulation of square waves as an alternative to sine waves for TI stimulation. An orientation-dependent analysis of classic implanted electrodes to evoke SLEs in the hippocampus is subsequently utilized to support the results of the minimally invasive temporally interfering fields. The principles of orientation-tunable TI stimulation seen here can be generally applicable in a wide range of other excitable tissues and brain regions, overcoming several limitations of fixed electrodes which penetrate tissue and overcoming several limitations of other non-invasive stimulation methods in epilepsy, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Brain-Computer Interface Coupled to a Robotic Hand Orthosis for Stroke Patients’ Neurorehabilitation: A Crossover Feasibility Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.656975</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) coupled to robotic assistive devices have shown promise for the rehabilitation of stroke patients. However, little has been reported that compares the clinical and physiological effects of a BCI intervention for upper limb stroke rehabilitation with those of conventional therapy. This study assesses the feasibility of an intervention with a BCI based on electroencephalography (EEG) coupled to a robotic hand orthosis for upper limb stroke rehabilitation and compares its outcomes to conventional therapy. Seven subacute and three chronic stroke patients (M = 59.9 ± 12.8) with severe upper limb impairment were recruited in a crossover feasibility study to receive 1 month of BCI therapy and 1 month of conventional therapy in random order. The outcome measures were comprised of: Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the Upper Extremity (FMA-UE), Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), motor evoked potentials elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), hand dynamometry, and EEG. Additionally, BCI performance and user experience were measured. All measurements were acquired before and after each intervention. FMA-UE and ARAT after BCI (23.1 ± 16; 8.4 ± 10) and after conventional therapy (21.9 ± 15; 8.7 ± 11) were significantly higher (p &amp;lt; 0.017) compared to baseline (17.5 ± 15; 4.3 ± 6) but were similar between therapies (p &amp;gt; 0.017). Via TMS, corticospinal tract integrity could be assessed in the affected hemisphere of three patients at baseline, in five after BCI, and four after conventional therapy. While no significant difference (p &amp;gt; 0.05) was found in patients’ affected hand strength, it was higher after the BCI therapy. EEG cortical activations were significantly higher over motor and non-motor regions after both therapies (p &amp;lt; 0.017). System performance increased across BCI sessions, from 54 (50, 70%) to 72% (56, 83%). Patients reported moderate mental workloads and excellent usability with the BCI. Outcome measurements implied that a BCI intervention using a robotic hand orthosis as feedback has the potential to elicit neuroplasticity-related mechanisms, similar to those observed during conventional therapy, even in a group of severely impaired stroke patients. Therefore, the proposed BCI system could be a suitable therapy option and will be further assessed in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.654381</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The presence of iron is an important factor for normal brain functions, whereas excessive deposition of iron may impair normal cognitive function in the brain and lead to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). MRI has been widely applied to characterize brain structural and functional changes caused by AD. However, the effectiveness of using susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) for the analysis of brain iron deposition is still unclear, especially within the context of early AD diagnosis. Thus, in this study, we aim to explore the relationship between brain iron deposition measured by SWI with the progression of AD using various feature selection and classification methods. The proposed model was evaluated on a 69-subject SWI imaging dataset consisting of 24 AD patients, 21 mild cognitive impairment patients, and 24 normal controls. The identified AD progression-related regions were then compared with the regions reported from previous genetic association studies, and we observed considerable overlap between these two. Further, we have identified a new potential AD-related gene (MEF2C) closely related to the interaction between iron deposition and AD progression in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Improving the Effect of Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS): A Systematic Review</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.652393</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;With the development of electrical stimulation technology, traditional transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) technology has been found to have the drawback of not targeting a specific area accurately. Studies have shown that optimizing the number and position of electrodes during electrical stimulation has a very good effect on enhancing brain stimulation accuracy. At present, an increasing number of laboratories have begun to optimize tACS. However, there has been no study summarizing the optimization methods of tACS. Determining whether different optimization methods are effective and the optimization approach could provide information that could guide future tACS research. We describe the results of recent research on tACS optimization and integrate the optimization approaches of tACS in recent research. Optimization approaches can be classified into two groups: high-definition electrical stimulation and interference modulation electrical stimulation. The optimization methods can be divided into five categories: high-definition tACS, phase-shifted tACS, amplitude-modulated tACS, the temporally interfering (TI) method, and the intersectional short pulse (ISP) method. Finally, we summarize the latest research on hardware useful for tACS improvement and outline future directions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Modal-Polar Representation of Evoked Response Potentials in Multiple Arousal States</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.642479</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An expansion of the corticothalamic transfer function into eigenmodes and resonant poles is used to derive a simple formula for evoked response potentials (ERPs) in various states of arousal. The transfer function corresponds to the cortical response to an external stimulus, which encodes all the information and properties of the linear system. This approach links experimental observations of resonances and characteristic timescales in brain activity with physically based neural field theory (NFT). The present work greatly simplifies the formula of the analytical ERP, and separates its spatial part (eigenmodes) from the temporal part (poles). Within this framework, calculations involve contour integrations that yield an explicit expression for ERPs. The dominant global mode is considered explicitly in more detail to study how the ERP varies with time in this mode and to illustrate the method. For each arousal state in sleep and wake, the resonances of the system are determined and it is found that five poles are sufficient to study the main dynamics of the system in waking eyes-open and eyes-closed states. Similarly, it is shown that six poles suffice to reproduce ERPs in rapid-eye movement sleep, sleep state 1, and sleep state 2 states, whereas just four poles suffice to reproduce the dynamics in slow wave sleep. Thus, six poles are sufficient to preserve the main global ERP dynamics of the system for all states of arousal. These six poles correspond to the dominant resonances of the system at slow-wave, alpha, and beta frequencies. These results provide the basis for simplified analytic treatment of brain dynamics and link observations more closely to theory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Contrast and Conflict in Dutch Vowels</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The nature of phonological representations has been extensively studied in phonology and psycholinguistics. While full specification is still the norm in psycholinguistic research, underspecified representations may better account for perceptual asymmetries. In this paper, we report on a mismatch negativity (MMN) study with Dutch listeners who took part in a passive oddball paradigm to investigate when the brain notices the difference between expected and observed vowels. In particular, we tested neural discrimination (indicating perceptual discrimination) of the tense mid vowel pairs /o/-/ø/ (place contrast), /e/-/ø/ (labiality or rounding contrast), and /e/-/o/ (place and labiality contrast). Our results show (a) a perceptual asymmetry for place in the /o/-/ø/ contrast, supporting underspecification of [CORONAL] and replicating earlier results for German, and (b) a perceptual asymmetry for labiality for the /e/-/ø/ contrast, which was not reported in the German study. A labial deviant [ø] (standard /e/) yielded a larger MMN than a deviant [e] (standard /ø/). No asymmetry was found for the two-feature contrast. This study partly replicates a similar MMN study on German vowels, and partly presents new findings indicating cross-linguistic differences. Although the vowel inventory of Dutch and German is to a large extent comparable, their (morpho)phonological systems are different, which is reflected in processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: An Online Data Visualization Feedback Protocol for Motor Imagery-Based BCI Training</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.625983</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain–computer interface (BCI) has developed rapidly over the past two decades, mainly due to advancements in machine learning. Subjects must learn to modulate their brain activities to ensure a successful BCI. Feedback training is a practical approach to this learning process; however, the commonly used classifier-dependent approaches have inherent limitations such as the need for calibration and a lack of continuous feedback over long periods of time. This paper proposes an online data visualization feedback protocol that intuitively reflects the EEG distribution in Riemannian geometry in real time. Rather than learning a hyperplane, the Riemannian geometry formulation allows iterative learning of prototypical covariance matrices that are translated into visualized feedback through diffusion map process. Ten subjects were recruited for MI-BCI (motor imagery-BCI) training experiments. The subjects learned to modulate their sensorimotor rhythm to centralize the points within one category and to separate points belonging to different categories. The results show favorable overall training effects in terms of the class distinctiveness and EEG feature discriminancy over a 3-day training with 30% learners. A steadily increased class distinctiveness in the last three sessions suggests that the advanced training protocol is effective. The optimal frequency band was consistent during the 3-day training, and the difference between subjects with good or low MI-BCI performance could be clearly observed. We believe that the proposed feedback protocol has promising application prospect.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We quantified the electroencephalogram signals associated with the selective attention processing of experienced simultaneous interpreters and calculated the phase-locked responses evoked by a 40-Hz auditory steady-state response (40-Hz ASSR) and the values of robust inter-trial coherence (ITC) for environmental changes. Since we assumed that an interpreter's attention ability improves with an increase in the number of years of experience of simultaneous interpretation, we divided the participants into two groups based on their simultaneous interpretation experience: experts with more than 15 years of experience (E group; n = 7) and beginners with &amp;lt;1 year (B group; n = 15). We also compared two conditions: simultaneous interpretation (SI) and shadowing (SH). We found a significant interaction in the ITC between years of SI experience (E and B groups) and tasks (SI and SH). This result demonstrates that the number of years of SI experience influences selective attention during interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.563807</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Our aim is to use neurophysiological sleep-related consolidation (SRC) phenomena to identify putative pathophysiological mechanisms in CECTS linked to diffuse neurocognitive deficits. We argue that there are numerous studies on the association between seizure aspects and neurocognitive functioning but not as many on interictal variables and neurocognitive deficits. We suggest two additional foci. First, the interictal presentation in CECTS and second, neuronal oscillations involved in SRC processes. Existing data on mechanisms through which interictal epileptiform spikes (IES) impact upon SRC indicate that they have the potential to: (a) perturb cross-regional coupling of neuronal oscillations, (b) mimic consolidation processes, (c) alter the precision of the spatiotemporal coupling of oscillations, and (d) variably impact upon SRC performance. Sleep spindles merit systematic study in CECTS in order to clarify: (a) the state of the slow oscillations (SOs) with which they coordinate, (b) the precision of slow oscillation-spindle coupling, and (c) whether their developmental trajectories differ from those of healthy children. We subsequently review studies on the associations between IES load during NREM sleep and SRC performance in childhood epilepsy. We then use sleep consolidation neurophysiological processes and their interplay with IES to help clarify the diffuse neurocognitive deficits that have been empirically documented in CECTS. We claim that studying SRC in CECTS will help to clarify pathophysiological mechanisms toward diverse neurocognitive deficits. Future developments could include close links between the fields of epilepsy and sleep, as well as new therapeutic neurostimulation targets. At the clinical level, children diagnosed with CECTS could benefit from close monitoring with respect to epilepsy, sleep and neurocognitive functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The apparent stochastic nature of neuronal activity significantly affects the reliability of neuronal coding. To quantify the encountered fluctuations, both in neural data and simulations, the notions of variability and randomness of inter-spike intervals have been proposed and studied. In this article we focus on the concept of the instantaneous firing rate, which is also based on the spike timing. We use several classical statistical models of neuronal activity and we study the corresponding probability distributions of the instantaneous firing rate. To characterize the firing rate variability and randomness under different spiking regimes, we use different indices of statistical dispersion. We find that the relationship between the variability of interspike intervals and the instantaneous firing rate is not straightforward in general. Counter-intuitively, an increase in the randomness (based on entropy) of spike times may either decrease or increase the randomness of instantaneous firing rate, in dependence on the neuronal firing model. Finally, we apply our methods to experimental data, establishing that instantaneous rate analysis can indeed provide additional information about the spiking activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.612937</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent research suggests that in vitro neural networks created from dissociated neurons may be used for computing and performing machine learning tasks. To develop a better artificial intelligent system, a hybrid bio-silicon computer is worth exploring, but its performance is still inferior to that of a silicon-based computer. One reason may be that a living neural network has many intrinsic properties, such as random network connectivity, high network sparsity, and large neural and synaptic variability. These properties may lead to new design considerations, and existing algorithms need to be adjusted for living neural network implementation. This work investigates the impact of neural variations and random connections on inference with learning algorithms. A two-layer hybrid bio-silicon platform is constructed and a five-step design method is proposed for the fast development of living neural network algorithms. Neural variations and dynamics are verified by fitting model parameters with biological experimental results. Random connections are generated under different connection probabilities to vary network sparsity. A multi-layer perceptron algorithm is tested with biological constraints on the MNIST dataset. The results show that a reasonable inference accuracy can be achieved despite the presence of neural variations and random network connections. A new adaptive pre-processing technique is proposed to ensure good learning accuracy with different living neural network sparsity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Visuomotor Adaptation Brain Changes During a Spaceflight Analog With Elevated Carbon Dioxide (CO2): A Pilot Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.659557</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Astronauts on board the International Space Station (ISS) must adapt to several environmental challenges including microgravity, elevated carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and isolation while performing highly controlled movements with complex equipment. Head down tilt bed rest (HDBR) is an analog used to study spaceflight factors including body unloading and headward fluid shifts. We recently reported how HDBR with elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (HDBR+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) affects visuomotor adaptation. Here we expand upon this work and examine the effects of HDBR+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on brain activity during visuomotor adaptation. Eleven participants (34 ± 8 years) completed six functional MRI (fMRI) sessions pre-, during, and post-HDBR+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. During fMRI, participants completed a visuomotor adaptation task, divided into baseline, early, late and de-adaptation. Additionally, we compare brain activity between this NASA campaign (30-day HDBR+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and a different campaign with a separate set of participants (60-day HDBR with normal atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels, n = 8; 34.25 ± 7.9 years) to characterize the specific effects of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Participants were included by convenience. During early adaptation across the HDBR+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intervention, participants showed decreasing activation in temporal and subcortical brain regions, followed by post- HDBR+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; recovery. During late adaptation, participants showed increasing activation in the right fusiform gyrus and right caudate nucleus during HDBR+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; this activation normalized to baseline levels after bed rest. There were no correlations between brain changes and adaptation performance changes from pre- to post HDBR+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Also, there were no statistically significant differences between the HDBR+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group and the HDBR controls, suggesting that changes in brain activity were due primarily to bed rest rather than elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Five HDBR+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; participants presented with optic disc edema, a sign of Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS). An exploratory analysis of HDBR+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; participants with and without signs of SANS revealed no group differences in brain activity during any phase of the adaptation task. Overall, these findings have implications for spaceflight missions and training, as ISS missions require individuals to adapt to altered sensory inputs over long periods in space. Further, this is the first study to verify the HDBR and elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; effects on the neural correlates of visuomotor adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Locus Coeruleus Norepinephrine in Learned Behavior: Anatomical Modularity and Spatiotemporal Integration in Targets</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.638007</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The locus coeruleus (LC), a small brainstem nucleus, is the primary source of the neuromodulator norepinephrine (NE) in the brain. The LC receives input from widespread brain regions, and projects throughout the forebrain, brainstem, cerebellum, and spinal cord. LC neurons release NE to control arousal, but also in the context of a variety of sensory-motor and behavioral functions. Despite its brain-wide effects, much about the role of LC-NE in behavior and the circuits controlling LC activity is unknown. New evidence suggests that the modular input-output organization of the LC could enable transient, task-specific modulation of distinct brain regions. Future work must further assess whether this spatial modularity coincides with functional differences in LC-NE subpopulations acting at specific times, and how such spatiotemporal specificity might influence learned behaviors. Here, we summarize the state of the field and present new ideas on the role of LC-NE in learned behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Potential and Realized Impact of Astroglia Ca2 + Dynamics on Circuit Function and Behavior</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.682888</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Astroglia display a wide range of spontaneous and behavioral state-dependent Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dynamics. During heightened vigilance, noradrenergic signaling leads to quasi-synchronous Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; elevations encompassing soma and processes across the brain-wide astroglia network. Distinct from this vigilance-associated global Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; rise are apparently spontaneous fluctuations within spatially restricted microdomains. Over the years, several strategies have been pursued to shed light on the physiological impact of these signals including deletion of endogenous ion channels or receptors and reduction of intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; through buffering, extrusion or inhibition of release. Some experiments that revealed the most compelling behavioral alterations employed chemogenetic and optogenetic manipulations to modify astroglia Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling. However, there is considerable contrast between these findings and the comparatively modest effects of inhibiting endogenous sources of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. In this review, we describe the underlying mechanisms of various forms of astroglia Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling as well as the functional consequences of their inhibition. We then discuss how the effects of exogenous astroglia Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; modification combined with our knowledge of physiological mechanisms of astroglia Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; activation could guide further refinement of behavioral paradigms that will help elucidate the natural Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent function of astroglia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.673433</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The glial cells astrocytes have long been recognized as important neuron-supporting elements in brain development, homeostasis, and metabolism. After the discovery that the reciprocal communication between astrocytes and neurons is a fundamental mechanism in the modulation of neuronal synaptic communication, over the last two decades astrocytes became a hot topic in neuroscience research. Crucial to their functional interactions with neurons are the cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; elevations that mediate gliotransmission. Large attention has been posed to the so-called Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;microdomains, dynamic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; changes spatially restricted to fine astrocytic processes including perisynaptic astrocytic processes (PAPs). With presynaptic terminals and postsynaptic neuronal membranes, PAPs compose the tripartite synapse. The distinct spatial-temporal features and functional roles of astrocyte microdomain Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; activity remain poorly defined. However, thanks to the development of genetically encoded Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; indicators (GECIs), advanced microscopy techniques, and innovative analytical approaches, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients in astrocyte microdomains were recently studied in unprecedented detail. These events have been observed to occur much more frequently (∼50–100-fold) and dynamically than somatic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; elevations with mechanisms that likely involve both IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-dependent and -independent pathways. Further progress aimed to clarify the complex, dynamic machinery responsible for astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; activity at microdomains is a crucial step in our understanding of the astrocyte role in brain function and may also reveal astrocytes as novel therapeutic targets for different brain diseases. Here, we review the most recent studies that improve our mechanistic understanding of the essential features of astrocyte Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; microdomains.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: The Ependymal Region Prevents Glioblastoma From Penetrating Into the Ventricle via a Nonmechanical Force</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.679405</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Intraventricular penetration is rare in glioblastoma (GBM). Whether the ependymal region including the ependyma and subventricular zone (SVZ) can prevent GBM invasion remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and haematoxylin–eosin (HE) staining were performed to evaluate the size and anatomical locations of GBM. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to assess the correlation between tumor-ependyma contact, ventricle penetration and clinical characteristics. Cell migration and invasion were assessed via Transwell assays and an orthotopic transplantation model.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Among 357 patients with GBM, the majority (66%) showed ependymal region contact, and 34 patients (10%) showed ventricle penetration of GBM. GBM cells were spread along the ependyma in the orthotopic transplantation model. The longest tumor diameter was an independent risk factor for GBM-ependymal region contact, as demonstrated by univariate (OR = 1.706, p &amp;lt; 0.0001) and multivariate logistic regression analyses (OR = 1.767, p &amp;lt; 0.0001), but was not associated with ventricle penetration. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) could significantly induce tumor cell migration (p &amp;lt; 0.0001), and GBM could grow in CSF. Compared with those from the cortex, cells from the ependymal region attenuated the invasion of C6 whether cocultured with C6 or mixed with Matrigel (p = 0.0054 and p = 0.0488). Immunofluorescence analysis shows a thin gap with GFAP expression delimiting the tumor and ependymal region.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The ependymal region might restrict GBM cells from entering the ventricle via a non-mechanical force. Further studies in this area may reveal mechanisms that occur in GBM patients and may enable the design of new therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Effects of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure on the Volumes of the Lateral and Medial Walls of the Intraparietal Sulcus</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.639800</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) continue to be the leading preventable cause of intellectual disability in the U.S., Europe, and in endemic areas, such as the Western Cape region of South Africa. Arithmetic is highly sensitive to prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). The intraparietal sulcus (IPS) is known to play a critical role in number processing. In this study, we investigate whether smaller IPS volumes play a role in the number-processing deficits observed in children with PAE. Participants were 52 9- to 14-year-old children from a historically disadvantaged community in Cape Town, who are participating in our ongoing studies on the effects of PAE on the brain. The IPS was manually parcellated into its medial (MIPS) and lateral (LIPS) walls on magnetic resonance images. The study aimed to examine: (1) the effects of PAE on IPS regional volumes and asymmetry, (2) whether IPS regional volumes are related to number processing performance and, if so, whether these relations are moderated by PAE and (3) potential mediation by regional IPS volumes of the relation between PAE and number processing performance. Total intracranial volume (TIV) was associated with volumes in all regions except the right LIPS. Both left MIPS and left LIPS volumes were significantly smaller in children in the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)/partial FAS (PFAS) group compared to controls. The finding in the left LIPS remained significant after controlling for potential confounders and after adjustment for the smaller overall brain size of the children in the FAS/PFAS group. Smaller left LIPS volumes in the FAS/PFAS group may account for the absence of left-right asymmetry in the LIPS in children with FAS/PFAS compared to controls and nonsyndromal heavily exposed (HE) children. Bilaterally, larger MIPS volumes were associated with better WISC IQ Arithmetic scores. These effects, however, were not moderated by the degree of PAE, and regional IPS volumes did not mediate the effect of PAE on WISC Arithmetic scores. Although we found that certain regions of the IPS were smaller in children with FAS and PFAS, these PAE-induced changes in IPS volume did not mediate the alcohol-related deficits in arithmetic.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Acute medical illnesses, surgical interventions, or admissions to hospital in older individuals are frequently associated with a delirium. In this cohort study, we investigated the impact of specific cognitive domains and depression before the occurrence of delirium symptoms in an 8-year observation of older non-hospitalized individuals.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;In total, we included 807 participants (48–83 years). Deficits in specific cognitive domains were measured using the CERAD test battery, and depressive symptoms were measured using Beck Depression Inventory and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) before the onset of a delirium. Delirium symptoms were retrospectively assessed by a questionnaire based on the established Nursing Delirium Screening Scale.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Fifty-eight of eight hundred seven participants (7.2%) reported delirium symptoms over the 8-year course of the study. Sixty-nine percent (n = 40) of reported delirium symptoms were related to surgeries. In multivariate regression analysis, impaired executive function was an independent risk factor (p = 0.034) for the occurrence of delirium symptoms. Furthermore, age (p = 0.014), comorbidities [captured by the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)] (p &amp;lt; 0.001), and depression (p = 0.012) were significantly associated with reported delirium symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Especially prior to elective surgery or medical interventions, screening for impaired executive function and depression could be helpful to identify patients who are at risk to develop delirium symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Dysfunction of the Glymphatic System as a Potential Mechanism of Perioperative Neurocognitive Disorders</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.659457</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Perioperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) frequently occurs in the elderly as a severe postoperative complication and is characterized by a decline in cognitive function that impairs memory, attention, and other cognitive domains. Currently, the exact pathogenic mechanism of PND is multifaceted and remains unclear. The glymphatic system is a newly discovered glial-dependent perivascular network that subserves a pseudo-lymphatic function in the brain. Recent studies have highlighted the significant role of the glymphatic system in the removal of harmful metabolites in the brain. Dysfunction of the glymphatic system can reduce metabolic waste removal, leading to neuroinflammation and neurological disorders. We speculate that there is a causal relationship between the glymphatic system and symptomatic progression in PND. This paper reviews the current literature on the glymphatic system and some perioperative factors to discuss the role of the glymphatic system in PND.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Significance of EEG Alpha Oscillation Spectral Power and Beta Oscillation Phase Synchronization for Diagnosing Probable Alzheimer Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.631587</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in geriatric population. At present, no effective treatments exist to reverse the progress of AD, however, early diagnosis and intervention might delay its progression. The search for biomarkers with good safety, repeatable detection, reliable sensitivity and community application is necessary for AD screening and early diagnosis and timely intervention. Electroencephalogram (EEG) examination is a non-invasive, quantitative, reproducible, and cost-effective technique which is suitable for screening large population for possible AD. The power spectrum, complexity and synchronization characteristics of EEG waveforms in AD patients have distinct deviation from normal elderly, indicating these EEG features can be a promising candidate biomarker of AD. However, current reported deviation results are inconsistent, possibly due to multiple factors such as diagnostic criteria, sample sizes and the use of different computational measures. In this study, we collected two neurological tests scores (MMSE and MoCA) and the resting-state EEG of 30 normal control elderly subjects (NC group) and 30 probable AD patients confirmed by Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography (PiB-PET) inspection (AD group). We calculated the power spectrum, spectral entropy and phase synchronization index features of these two groups’ EEG at left/right frontal, temporal, central and occipital brain regions in 4 frequency bands: δ oscillation (1–4 Hz), θ oscillation (4–8 Hz), α oscillation (8–13 Hz), and β oscillation (13–30 Hz). In most brain areas, we found that the AD group had significant differences compared to NC group: (1) decreased α oscillation power and increased θ oscillation power; (2) decreased spectral entropy in α oscillation and elevated spectral entropy in β oscillation; and (3) decrease phase synchronization index in δ, θ, and β oscillation. We also found that α oscillation spectral power and β oscillation phase synchronization index correlated well with the MMSE/MoCA test scores in AD groups. Our study suggests that these two EEG features might be useful metrics for population screening of probable AD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/68181</link>
	<content:encoded>Spatially distributed excitation and inhibition collectively shape a visual neuron's receptive field (RF) properties. In the direction-selective circuit of the mammalian retina, the role of strong null-direction inhibition of On-Off direction-selective ganglion cells (On-Off DSGCs) on their direction selectivity is well-studied. However, how excitatory inputs influence the On-Off DSGC's visual response is underexplored. Here, we report that On-Off DSGCs have a spatially displaced glutamatergic receptive field along their horizontal preferred-null motion axes. This displaced receptive field contributes to DSGC null-direction spiking during interrupted motion trajectories. Theoretical analyses indicate that population responses during interrupted motion may help populations of On-Off DSGCs signal the spatial location of moving objects in complex, naturalistic visual environments. Our study highlights that the direction-selective circuit exploits separate sets of mechanisms under different stimulus conditions, and these mechanisms may help encode multiple visual features.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66917</link>
	<content:encoded>There are rich structures in off-task neural activity which are hypothesised to reflect fundamental computations across a broad spectrum of cognitive functions. Here, we develop an analysis toolkit – Temporal Delayed Linear Modelling (TDLM) for analysing such activity. TDLM is a domain-general method for finding neural sequences that respect a pre-specified transition graph. It combines nonlinear classification and linear temporal modelling to test for statistical regularities in sequences of task-related reactivations. TDLM is developed on the non-invasive neuroimaging data and is designed to take care of confounds and maximize sequence detection ability. Notably, as a linear framework, TDLM can be easily extended, without loss of generality, to capture rodent replay in electrophysiology, including in continuous spaces, as well as addressing second-order inference questions, e.g., its temporal and spatial varying pattern. We hope TDLM will advance a deeper understanding of neural computation and promote a richer convergence between animal and human neuroscience.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Traditionally, research unraveling seasonal neuroplasticity in songbirds has focused on the male song control system and testosterone. We longitudinally monitored the song behavior and neuroplasticity in male and female starlings during multiple photoperiods using Diffusion Tensor and Fixel-Based techniques. These exploratory data-driven whole-brain methods resulted in a population-based tractogram confirming microstructural sexual dimorphisms in the song control system. Furthermore, male brains showed hemispheric asymmetries in the pallium, whereas females had higher interhemispheric connectivity, which could not be attributed to brain size differences. Only females with large brains sing but differ from males in their song behavior by showing involvement of the hippocampus. Both sexes experienced multisensory neuroplasticity in the song control, auditory and visual system, and cerebellum, mainly during the photosensitive period. This period with low gonadal hormone levels might represent a 'sensitive window' during which different sensory and motor systems in the cerebrum and cerebellum can be seasonally re-shaped in both sexes.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Recent pertussis resurgence in numerous countries may be driven by asymptomatic infections. Most pertussis surveillance studies are cross-sectional and cannot distinguish asymptomatic from pre-symptomatic infections. Longitudinal surveillance could overcome this barrier, providing more information about the true burden of pertussis at the population level. Here we analyze 17,442 nasopharyngeal samples from a longitudinal cohort of 1320 Zambian mother/infant pairs. Our analysis has two elements. First, we demonstrate that the full range of IS481 qPCR CT values provides insight into pertussis epidemiology, showing concordance of low and high CT results over time, within mother/infant pairs, and in relation to symptomatology. Second, we exploit these full-range qPCR data to demonstrate a high incidence of asymptomatic pertussis, including among infants. Our results demonstrate a wider burden of pertussis infection than we anticipated in this population, and expose key limitations of threshold-based interpretation of qPCR results in infectious disease surveillance.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63807</link>
	<content:encoded>RAS-like (RAL) GTPases function in Wnt signalling-dependent intestinal stem cell proliferation and regeneration. Whether RAL proteins work as canonical RAS effectors in the intestine, and the mechanisms of how they contribute to tumourigenesis remain unclear. Here, we show that RAL GTPases are necessary and sufficient to activate EGFR/MAPK signalling in the intestine, via induction of EGFR internalisation. Knocking down &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;RalA&lt;/i&gt; from intestinal stem and progenitor cells leads to increased levels of plasma membrane-associated EGFR and decreased MAPK pathway activation. Importantly, in addition to impacting stem cell proliferation during damage-induced intestinal regeneration, this role of RAL GTPases impacts on EGFR-dependent tumorigenic growth in the intestine and in human mammary epithelium. However, the effect of oncogenic RAS in the intestine is independent from RAL function. Altogether, our results reveal previously unrecognised cellular and molecular contexts where RAL GTPases become essential mediators of adult tissue homeostasis and malignant transformation.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Closed-loop neurostimulation is a promising therapy being tested and clinically implemented in a growing number of neurological and psychiatric indications. This therapy is enabled by chronically implanted, bidirectional devices including the Medtronic Summit RC+S system. In order to successfully optimize therapy for patients implanted with these devices, analyses must be conducted offline on the recorded neural data, in order to inform optimal sense and stimulation parameters. The file format, volume, and complexity of raw data from these device necessitate conversion, parsing, and time reconstruction ahead of time-frequency analyses and modeling common to standard neuroscientific analyses. Here, we provide an open-source toolbox written in Matlab which takes raw files from the Summit RC+S and transforms these data into a standardized format amenable to conventional analyses. Furthermore, we provide a plotting tool which can aid in the visualization of multiple data streams and sense, stimulation, and therapy settings. Finally, we describe an analysis module which replicates RC+S on-board power computations, functionality which can accelerate biomarker discovery. This toolbox aims to accelerate the research and clinical advances made possible by longitudinal neural recordings and adaptive neurostimulation in people with neurological and psychiatric illnesses.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.07.447409v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>High-frequency oscillatory events, termed ripples, represent synchrony of neural activity in the brain1. Experiments in animal models have characterized ripples during quiescent and sleep states1 and to a lesser degree during active behavior2-4. Converging evidence from these animal studies5,computational modeling6, and recent examinations in human participants support a link between hippocampal7-9 or medial temporal lobe (MTL)10,11 ripples and memory retrieval. Analyzing direct MTL recordings from 219 neurosurgical participants performing episodic recall tasks, we ask whether ripples specifically reflect the reinstatement of contextual information12-14, a defining property of episodic memory12,15, and are not just a recapitulation of recently-experienced stimuli7,10. Here we find that the rate of hippocampal ripples rises just prior to the free recall of recently-formed memories. This pre-recall ripple effect appears most strongly in the CA1 and dentate gyrus (DG) subfields of hippocampus--regions critical for episodic memory16-18. Neighboring entorhinal and parahippocampal cortices exhibit a significantly weaker effect. The pre-recall ripple effect is strongest prior to the retrieval of semantically- and/or temporally-related recalls, indicating the involvement of ripples in contextual reinstatement, thereby specifically linking ripples with retrieval of episodic memories.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Reducing susceptibility distortion related image blurring in diffusion MRI EPI data</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.07.447406v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an increasingly popular technique in basic and clinical neuroscience. One promising application is to combine diffusion MRI with myelin maps from complementary MRI techniques such as multi-parameter mapping (MPM) to produce g-ratio maps that represent the relative myelination of axons and predict their conduction velocity. Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) can process both diffusion data and MPMs, making SPM the only widely accessible software that contains all the processing steps required to perform group analyses of g-ratio data in a common space. However, limitations have been identified in its method for reducing susceptibility-related distortion in diffusion data. More generally, susceptibility-related image distortion is often corrected by combining oppositely phase-encoded images (blip-up and blip-down) using the arithmetic mean (AM), however, this can lead to blurred images. In this study we sought to (1) improve the susceptibility-related distortion correction for diffusion MRI data in SPM; (2) deploy an alternative approach to the AM to reduce image blurring in diffusion MRI data when combining blip-up and blip-down EPI data after susceptibility-related distortion correction; and (3) assess the benefits of these changes for g-ratio mapping. We found that the new processing pipeline, called consecutive HySCO, improved distortion correction when compared to the standard approach in the ACID toolbox for SPM. Moreover, using a weighted average (WA) method to combine the distortion corrected data from each phase-encoding polarity achieved greater overlap of diffusion and more anatomically faithful structural white matter probability maps derived from minimally distorted multi-parameter maps as compared to the AM. Third, we showed that the consecutive HySCO WA performed better than the AM method when combined with multi-parameter maps to perform g-ratio mapping. These improvements mean that researchers can conveniently access a wide range of diffusion-related analysis methods within one framework because they are now available within the open-source ACID toolbox as part of SPM, which can be easily combined with other SPM toolboxes, such as the hMRI toolbox, to facilitate computation of myelin biomarkers that are necessary for g-ratio mapping.</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The early detection of patients at risk of post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) may help planning subacute and long-term care. We aimed to determine the predictivity of two screening cognitive tests on the occurrence of mild cognitive impairment or dementia in acute stroke patients.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A cognitive assessment within a few days of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke was performed in patients consecutively admitted to a stroke unit over 14 months by means of the Clock Drawing Test (CDT) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Basic (MoCA-B).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Out of 191 stroke survivors who were non-demented at baseline, 168 attended at least one follow-up visit. At follow-up (mean duration ± SD 12.8 ± 8.7 months), 28 (18.9%) incident cases of MCI and 27 (18%) cases of dementia were recorded. In comparison with patients who remained cognitively stable at follow-up, these patients were older, less educated, had more comorbidities, a higher score on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at admission, more severe cerebral atrophy, and lower MoCA-B and CDT scores at baseline. In multi-adjusted (for age, education, comorbidities score, NIHSS at admission and atrophy score) model, a pathological score on baseline CDT (&amp;lt; 6.55) was associated with a higher risk of PSCI at follow-up (HR 2.022; 95% CI 1.025–3.989, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) with respect to non-pathological scores. A pathological baseline score on MoCA-B (&amp;lt; 24) did not predict increased risk of cognitive decline at follow-up nor increased predictivity of stand-alone CDT.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26134?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Blood–brain barrier (BBB) breakdown has been suggested to be an early biomarker in human cognitive impairment. However, the relationship between BBB breakdown and brain pathology, most commonly Alzheimer disease (AD) and vascular disease, is still poorly understood. The present study measured human BBB function in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients on 2 molecular scales, specifically BBB's permeability to water and albumin molecules.


Methods
Fifty‐five elderly participants were enrolled, including 33 MCI patients and 22 controls. BBB permeability to water was measured with a new magnetic resonance imaging technique, water extraction with phase contrast arterial spin tagging. BBB permeability to albumin was determined using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/serum albumin ratio. Cognitive performance was assessed by domain‐specific composite scores. AD pathology (including CSF Aβ and ptau) and vascular risk factors were examined.


Results
Compared to cognitively normal subjects, BBB in MCI patients manifested an increased permeability to small molecules such as water but was no more permeable to large molecules such as albumin. BBB permeability to water was found to be related to AD markers of CSF Aβ and ptau. On the other hand, BBB permeability to albumin was found to be related to vascular risk factors, especially hypercholesterolemia, but was not related to AD pathology. BBB permeability to small molecules, but not to large molecules, was found to be predictive of cognitive function.


Interpretation
These findings provide early evidence that BBB breakdown is related to both AD and vascular risks, but their effects can be differentiated by spatial scales. BBB permeability to small molecules has a greater impact on cognitive performance. ANN NEUROL 2021</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Mutations in HID1 Cause Syndromic Infantile Encephalopathy and Hypopituitarism</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26127?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Precursors of peptide hormones undergo posttranslational modifications within the trans‐Golgi network (TGN). Dysfunction of proteins involved at different steps of this process cause several complex syndromes affecting the central nervous system (CNS). We aimed to clarify the genetic cause in a group of patients characterized by hypopituitarism in combination with brain atrophy, thin corpus callosum, severe developmental delay, visual impairment, and epilepsy.


Methods
Whole exome sequencing was performed in seven individuals of six unrelated families with these features. Postmortem histopathological and HID1 expression analysis of brain tissue and pituitary gland were conducted in one patient. Functional consequences of the homozygous HID1 variant p.R433W were investigated by Seahorse XF Assay in fibroblasts of two patients.


Results
Bi‐allelic variants in the gene HID1 domain‐containing protein 1 (HID1) were identified in all patients. Postmortem examination confirmed cerebral atrophy with enlarged lateral ventricles. Markedly reduced expression of pituitary hormones was found in pituitary gland tissue. Colocalization of HID1 protein with the TGN was not altered in fibroblasts of patients compared to controls, while the extracellular acidification rate upon stimulation with potassium chloride was significantly reduced in patient fibroblasts compared to controls.


Interpretation
Our findings indicate that mutations in HID1 cause an early infantile encephalopathy with hypopituitarism as the leading presentation, and expand the list of syndromic CNS diseases caused by interference of TGN function. ANN NEUROL 2021</content:encoded>

	<title>The Cerebellum: PIGQ-Related Glycophosphatidylinositol Deficiency Associated with Nonprogressive Congenital Ataxia</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor pathway plays an essential role in posttranslational modification of proteins to facilitate proper membrane anchoring and trafficking to lipid rafts, which is critical for many cell functions, including embryogenesis and neurogenesis. GPI biosynthesis is a multi-step process requiring the activity of over 25 distinct genes, most of them belonging to the phosphatidylinositol glycan (PIG) family and associated with rare neurodevelopmental disorders. &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PIGQ&lt;/em&gt; encodes the phosphatidylinositol glycan class Q protein and is part of the GPI-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase complex that initiates GPI biosynthesis from phosphatidylinositol (PI) and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) on the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Pathogenic variants in the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PIGQ&lt;/em&gt; gene have been previously reported in 10 patients with congenital hypotonia, early-infantile epileptic encephalopathy, and premature death occurring in more than half cases. We detected a novel homozygous variant in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PIGQ&lt;/em&gt; (NM_004204.5: c.1631dupA; p.Tyr544fs*79) by WES trio-analysis of a male patient with a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by nonprogressive congenital ataxia, intellectual disability, generalized epilepsy, and cerebellar atrophy. Flow cytometry confirmed deficiency of several GPI-anchored proteins on leukocytes (CD14, FLAER). Clinical features of this case broaden the phenotypic spectrum of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PIGQ&lt;/em&gt;-related GPI deficiency, outlining the importance of glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor pathway in the pathogenesis of cerebellar ataxia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Linking minimal and detailed models of CA1 microcircuits reveals how theta rhythms emerge and their frequencies controlled</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23364?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
The wide variety of cell types and their biophysical complexities pose a challenge in our ability to understand oscillatory activities produced by cellular‐based computational network models. This challenge stems from their high‐dimensional and multiparametric natures. To overcome this, we implement a solution by linking minimal and detailed models of CA1 microcircuits that generate intrahippocampal (3–12 Hz) theta rhythms. We leverage insights from minimal models to guide explorations of more detailed models and obtain a cellular perspective of theta generation. Our findings distinguish the pyramidal cells as the theta rhythm initiators and reveal that their activity is regularized by the inhibitory cell populations, supporting a proposed hypothesis of an “inhibition‐based tuning” mechanism. We find a strong correlation between input current to the pyramidal cells and the resulting local field potential theta frequency, indicating that intrinsic pyramidal cell properties underpin network frequency characteristics. This work provides a cellular‐based foundation from which in vivo theta activities can be explored.</content:encoded>

G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are critical regulators of cellular function acting via heterotrimeric G proteins as their primary transducers with individual GPCRs capable of pleiotropic coupling to multiple G proteins. Structural features governing G protein selectivity and promiscuity are currently unclear. Here, we used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine structures of the cholecystokinin (CCK) type 1 receptor (CCK1R) bound to the CCK peptide agonist, CCK-8 and 2 distinct transducer proteins, its primary transducer Gq, and the more weakly coupled Gs. As seen with other Gq/11–GPCR complexes, the Gq–α5 helix (αH5) bound to a relatively narrow pocket in the CCK1R core. Surprisingly, the backbone of the CCK1R and volume of the G protein binding pocket were essentially equivalent when Gs was bound, with the Gs αH5 displaying a conformation that arises from “unwinding” of the far carboxyl-terminal residues, compared to canonically Gs coupled receptors. Thus, integrated changes in the conformations of both the receptor and G protein are likely to play critical roles in the promiscuous coupling of individual GPCRs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/pYiyanK0KHY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) complex are heterogeneous and vary in dendritic morphology, cell shape, spine and axon presence, soma size, and orientation to surrounding fibers. An example of 7, Golgi‐stained neurons with five primary dendrites and their location (inset) in this composite sagittal section illustrates a spectrum of dendritic arbors and these other features. Arrows point to the direction of fibers in the TRN. Greatest soma length (L) is indicated. Neurons in the inset, enlarged views of neurons, and enclosed boxes are coded with similar colors.







Abstract
The thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) is a critical structure influencing information transfer to the forebrain. In crocodilians, the TRN shares many features with its mammalian counterpart. One area that has not been explored is how individual neurons in the crocodilian TRN compare with those found in mammals. In mammals, TRN neurons are aligned parallel to the external border of the dorsal thalamus, have their dendrites oriented perpendicular to the fibers in the internal capsule, have fine, filamentous dendritic appendages, are either bipolar or multipolar, and are commonly considered to be a homogeneous morphological population of cells. To investigate the cellular morphology of the TRN complex, a Golgi analysis was undertaken in Alligator mississippiensis. This study examined features that have been used in mammals. In Alligator, the four TRN divisions are the dorsal peduncular nucleus, the perireticular nucleus, the interstitial nucleus, and the neurons in the medial forebrain bundle associated with the interstitial nucleus. In crocodilians, the dorsal peduncular nucleus is homologous to the TRN of mammals. From the 1787 drawn neuron profiles in the traditional three planes of section, the following were concluded. First, neurons in each part of the TRN complex in Alligator were similar in morphology. Second, each part of the TRN complex of Alligator contained a heterogenous population of cells. These variations between the cellular morphology of the dorsal peduncular nucleus of crocodilians and the TRN of mammals are speculated to partly result from differences in forebrain organization.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
Research innovation that leads to discovery in the battle against neurological disease and disorders requires diverse ideas. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, one of the National Institutes of Health's 27 institutes and centers, strives to reduce the burden of neurological disease and disorders. The National Institutes of Neurologic Disorders and Stroke is very interested in increasing the diversity of researchers by addressing the existing barriers responsible for the low numbers of underrepresented populations from traditionally minority‐serving institutions (MSIs) and non‐minority serving institutions (non‐MSIs). This commentary provides insight on the persistent underrepresentation of racial/ethnic minorities entering neuroscience research careers paths, focusing on multiples levels within the scientific academy and the supportive role that both MSIs and non‐MSIs play in increasing diversity in the biomedical research workforce.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Efficient extra‐mitochondrial aerobic ATP synthesis in neuronal membrane systems</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24865?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Comparison of mitochondrial and extramitochondrial activity in neuronal membrane systems. In the last years, literature reports that the oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) machinery is expressed not only on the inner mitochondrial membrane but also on other membranous structures. In order to highlight the similarities and differences between these two entities, in this work, we compared the activity of mitochondrial OxPhos with that expressed in isolated myelin and rod outer segments.

Abstract
The nervous system displays high energy consumption, apparently not fulfilled by mitochondria, which are underrepresented therein. The oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) activity, a mitochondrial process that aerobically provides ATP, has also been reported also in the myelin sheath and the rod outer segment (OS) disks. Thus, commonalities and differences between the extra‐mitochondrial and mitochondrial aerobic metabolism were evaluated in bovine isolated myelin (IM), rod OS, and mitochondria‐enriched fractions (MIT). The subcellular fraction quality and the absence of contamination fractions have been estimated by western blot analysis. Oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis were stimulated by conventional (pyruvate + malate or succinate) and unconventional (NADH) substrates, observing that oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis by IM and rod OS are more efficient than by MIT, in the presence of both kinds of respiratory substrates. Mitochondria did not utilize NADH as a respiring substrate. When ATP synthesis by either sample was assayed in the presence of 10–100 µM ATP in the assay medium, only in IM and OS it was not inhibited, suggesting that the ATP exportation by the mitochondria is limited by extravesicular ATP concentration. Interestingly, IM and OS but not mitochondria appear able to synthesize ATP at a later time with respect to exposure to respiratory substrates, supporting the hypothesis that the proton gradient produced by the electron transport chain is buffered by membrane phospholipids. The putative transfer mode of the OxPhos molecular machinery from mitochondria to the extra‐mitochondrial structures is also discussed, opening new perspectives in the field of neurophysiology.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Dynamically Optimizing Network Structure Based on Synaptic Pruning in the Brain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.620558</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Most neural networks need to predefine the network architecture empirically, which may cause over-fitting or under-fitting. Besides, a large number of parameters in a fully connected network leads to the prohibitively expensive computational cost and storage overhead, which makes the model hard to be deployed on mobile devices. Dynamically optimizing the network architecture by pruning unused synapses is a promising technique for solving this problem. Most existing pruning methods focus on reducing the redundancy of deep convolutional neural networks by pruning unimportant filters or weights, at the cost of accuracy drop. In this paper, we propose an effective brain-inspired synaptic pruning method to dynamically modulate the network architecture and simultaneously improve network performance. The proposed model is biologically inspired as it dynamically eliminates redundant connections based on the synaptic pruning rules used during the brain's development. Connections are pruned if they are not activated or less activated multiple times consecutively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on classification tasks of different complexity with the MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets. Experimental results reveal that even for a compact network, the proposed method can also remove up to 59–90% of the connections, with relative improvement in learning speed and accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Oxaliplatin Depolarizes the IB4– Dorsal Root Ganglion Neurons to Drive the Development of Neuropathic Pain Through TRPM8 in Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.690858</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Use of chemotherapy drug oxaliplatin is associated with painful peripheral neuropathy that is exacerbated by cold. Remodeling of ion channels including TRP channels in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons contribute to the sensory hypersensitivity following oxaliplatin treatment in animal models. However, it has not been studied if TRP channels and membrane depolarization of DRG neurons serve as the initial ionic/membrane drives (such as within an hour) that contribute to the development of oxaliplatin-induced neuropathic pain. In the current study, we studied in mice (1) in vitro acute effects of oxaliplatin on the membrane excitability of IB4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and IB4&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; subpopulations of DRG neurons using a perforated patch clamping, (2) the preventative effects of a membrane-hyperpolarizing drug retigabine on oxaliplatin-induced sensory hypersensitivity, and (3) the preventative effects of TRP channel antagonists on the oxaliplatin-induced membrane hyperexcitability and sensory hypersensitivity. We found (1) IB4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and IB4&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; subpopulations of small DRG neurons displayed previously undiscovered, substantially different membrane excitability, (2) oxaliplatin selectively depolarized IB4&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; DRG neurons, (3) pretreatment of retigabine largely prevented oxaliplatin-induced sensory hypersensitivity, (4) antagonists of TRPA1 and TRPM8 channels prevented oxaliplatin-induced membrane depolarization, and (5) the antagonist of TRPM8 largely prevented oxaliplatin-induced sensory hypersensitivity. These results suggest that oxaliplatin depolarizes IB4&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; neurons through TRPM8 channels to drive the development of neuropathic pain and targeting the initial drives of TRPM8 and/or membrane depolarization may prevent oxaliplatin-induce neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Indications for Inpatient Magnetoencephalography in Children – An Institution’s Experience</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.667777</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is recognized as a valuable non-invasive clinical method for localization of the epileptogenic zone and critical functional areas, as part of a pre-surgical evaluation for patients with pharmaco-resistant epilepsy. MEG is also useful in localizing functional areas as part of pre-surgical planning for tumor resection. MEG is usually performed in an outpatient setting, as one part of an evaluation that can include a variety of other testing modalities including 3-Tesla MRI and inpatient video-electroencephalography monitoring. In some clinical circumstances, however, completion of the MEG as an inpatient can provide crucial ictal or interictal localization data during an ongoing inpatient evaluation, in order to expedite medical or surgical planning. Despite well-established clinical indications for performing MEG in general, there are no current reports that discuss indications or considerations for completion of MEG on an inpatient basis. We conducted a retrospective institutional review of all pediatric MEGs performed between January 2012 and December 2020, and identified 34 cases where MEG was completed as an inpatient. We then reviewed all relevant medical records to determine clinical history, all associated diagnostic procedures, and subsequent treatment plans including epilepsy surgery and post-surgical outcomes. In doing so, we were able to identify five indications for completing the MEG on an inpatient basis: (1) super-refractory status epilepticus (SRSE), (2) intractable epilepsy with frequent electroclinical seizures, and/or frequent or repeated episodes of status epilepticus, (3) intractable epilepsy with infrequent epileptiform discharges on EEG or outpatient MEG, or other special circumstances necessitating inpatient monitoring for successful and safe MEG data acquisition, (4) MEG mapping of eloquent cortex or interictal spike localization in the setting of tumor resection or other urgent neurosurgical intervention, and (5) international or long-distance patients, where outpatient MEG is not possible or practical. MEG contributed to surgical decision-making in the majority of our cases (32 of 34). Our clinical experience suggests that MEG should be considered on an inpatient basis in certain clinical circumstances, where MEG data can provide essential information regarding the localization of epileptogenic activity or eloquent cortex, and be used to develop a treatment plan for surgical management of children with complicated or intractable epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Retinal Axon Interplay for Binocular Mapping</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.679440</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In most mammals, retinal ganglion cell axons from each retina project to both sides of the brain. The segregation of ipsi and contralateral projections into eye-specific territories in their main brain targets—the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus and the superior colliculus—is critical for the processing of visual information. The investigation of the developmental mechanisms contributing to the wiring of this binocular map in mammals identified competitive mechanisms between axons from each retina while interactions between axons from the same eye were challenging to explore. Studies in vertebrates lacking ipsilateral retinal projections demonstrated that competitive mechanisms also exist between axons from the same eye. The development of a genetic approach enabling the differential manipulation and labeling of neighboring retinal ganglion cells in a single mouse retina revealed that binocular map development does not only rely on axon competition but also involves a cooperative interplay between axons to stabilize their terminal branches. These recent insights into the developmental mechanisms shaping retinal axon connectivity in the brain will be discussed here.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Modulation of Septo-Hippocampal Neural Responses in Anesthetized and Behaving Rats by Septal AMPA Receptor Mechanisms</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.663633</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This study explored the effects of septal glutamatergic transmission on septal-hippocampal theta activity via intraseptal microinjection of antagonist at AMPA receptors (AMPAR). The current results showed that microinjection of AMPAR antagonist, NBQX (2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline-2,3-dione, 20 μg/μl, 0.5 μl), evoked a decrease in the frequency of theta activity evoked by various means in anesthetized and behaving rat. Theta wave activity was induced on: (a) intraseptal microinjection of carbachol, an agonist at cholinergic receptors, (b) reticular stimulation, (c) exploration in novel open field (OF), and (d) hind paw (HP) injection of the algogen, formalin. The effect on frequency in the formalin test was observed in an early period on injection of formalin, which was novel to the animal, but not in the later more sustained phase of the formalin test. The effect of NBQX, being seen in both anesthetized and behaving animals, suggests that the modulation of theta wave frequency, including in novelty, is a function of AMPAR in MS. The effect of the antagonist on theta power was less apparent, being observed only in anesthetized animals. In addition to theta power and frequency, intraseptal NBQX also attenuated suppression of CA1 population spike (PS) induced by intraseptal carbachol, thus suggesting that septal glutamate neurotransmission is involved in the spectrum of MS-mediated network responses. Indeed, in the context of behavior, formalin injection induced an increase in the level of septal glutamate, while NBQX attenuated nociceptive behaviors. Notably, MS is involved in the modulation of formalin nociception. These findings suggest that AMPA receptors are a key modulator of septal physiological function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Heterogeneity and Development of Fine Astrocyte Morphology Captured by Diffraction-Limited Microscopy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.669280</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The fine processes of single astrocytes can contact many thousands of synapses whose function they can modulate through bi-directional signaling. The spatial arrangement of astrocytic processes and neuronal structures is relevant for such interactions and for the support of neuronal signaling by astrocytes. At the same time, the geometry of perisynaptic astrocyte processes is variable and dynamically regulated. Studying these fine astrocyte processes represents a technical challenge, because many of them cannot be fully resolved by diffraction-limited microscopy. Therefore, we have established two indirect parameters of astrocyte morphology, which, while not fully resolving local geometry by design, provide statistical measures of astrocyte morphology: the fraction of tissue volume that astrocytes occupy and the density of resolvable astrocytic processes. Both are straightforward to obtain using widely available microscopy techniques. We here present the approach and demonstrate its robustness across various experimental conditions using mainly two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy in acute slices and in vivo as well as modeling. Using these indirect measures allowed us to analyze the morphology of relatively large populations of astrocytes. Doing so we captured the heterogeneity of astrocytes within and between the layers of the hippocampal CA1 region and the developmental profile of astrocyte morphology. This demonstrates that volume fraction (VF) and segment density are useful parameters for describing the structure of astrocytes. They are also suitable for online monitoring of astrocyte morphology with widely available microscopy techniques.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Supplementary Effect of Choline Alfoscerate on Speech Recognition in Patients With Age-Related Hearing Loss: A Prospective Study in 34 Patients (57 Ears)</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.684519</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;To investigate the effect of choline alfoscerate (CA) on hearing amplification in patients with age related hearing loss, we performed a prospective case-control observational study from March 2016 to September 2020. We assessed patients with bilateral word recognition score (WRS) &amp;lt;50% using monosyllabic words. The patients were 65–85 years old, without any history of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, parkinsonism, or depression. After enrollment, all patients started using hearing aids (HA). The CA group received a daily dose of 800 mg CA for 11 months. We performed between-group comparisons of audiological data, including pure tone audiometry, WRS, HA fitting data obtained using real-ear measurement (REM), and the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid benefit scores after treatment. After CA administration, the WRS improved significantly in the CA group (4.2 ± 8.3%), but deteriorated in the control group (−0.6 ± 8.1%, p = 0.035). However, there was no significant between-group difference in the change in pure tone thresholds and aided speech intelligibility index calculated from REM. These findings suggest that the difference in WRS was relevant to central speech understanding rather than peripheral audibility. Therefore, administering oral CA could effectively enrich listening comprehension in older HA users.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Changes in Metabolic Activity and Gait Function by Dual-Task Cognitive Game-Based Treadmill System in Parkinson’s Disease: Protocol of a Randomized Controlled Trial</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.680270</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Balance and gait impairments, and consequently, mobility restrictions and falls are common in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Various cognitive deficits are also common in PD and are associated with increased fall risk. These mobility and cognitive deficits are limiting factors in a person’s health, ability to perform activities of daily living, and overall quality of life. Community ambulation involves many dual-task (DT) conditions that require processing of several cognitive tasks while managing or reacting to sudden or unexpected balance challenges. DT training programs that can simultaneously target balance, gait, visuomotor, and cognitive functions are important to consider in rehabilitation and promotion of healthy active lives. In the proposed multi-center, randomized controlled trial (RCT), novel behavioral positron emission tomography (PET) brain imaging methods are used to evaluate the molecular basis and neural underpinnings of: (a) the decline of mobility function in PD, specifically, balance, gait, visuomotor, and cognitive function, and (b) the effects of an engaging, game-based DT treadmill walking program on mobility and cognitive functions. Both the interactive cognitive game tasks and treadmill walking require continuous visual attention, and share spatial processing functions, notably to minimize any balance disturbance or gait deviation/stumble. The ability to “walk and talk” normally includes activation of specific regions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the basal ganglia (site of degeneration in PD). The PET imaging analysis and comparison with healthy age-matched controls will allow us to identify areas of abnormal, reduced activity levels, as well as areas of excessive activity (increased attentional resources) during DT-walking. We will then be able to identify areas of brain plasticity associated with improvements in mobility functions (balance, gait, and cognition) after intervention. We expect the gait-cognitive training effect to involve re-organization of PFC activity among other, yet to be identified brain regions. The DT mobility-training platform and behavioral PET brain imaging methods are directly applicable to other diseases that affect gait and cognition, e.g., cognitive vascular impairment, Alzheimer’s disease, as well as in aging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.650679</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objectives: Amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition in the brain is the hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology. Hypertension is a risk factor for AD, but the effects of hypertension on Aβ deposition are not fully determined. Considering peripheral Aβ closely relates to Aβ deposition in the brain, we investigated the relationships between blood pressure (BP) level and plasma Aβ concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: One-thousand and sixty-nine participants (age above 45) from a village in the suburbs of Xi’an, China were enrolled. Questionnaires and validated Chinese versions of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were used to collect information about vascular risk factors and assess cognition function. The apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype was detected using PCR and sequencing. Plasma Aβ levels were measured using ELISA. The associations between BP and plasma Aβ levels were analyzed by using multivariate linear regression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Plasma Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–40&lt;/sub&gt; level was higher in high BP group than that in normal BP group (53.34 ± 8.50 pg/ml vs. 51.98 ± 8.96 pg/ml, P = 0.013), in high SBP group than that in normal SBP group (53.68 ± 8.69 pg/ml vs. 51.88 ± 8.80 pg/ml, P = 0.001) and in high MABP group than that in normal MABP group (54.05 ± 8.78 pg/ml vs. 52.04 ± 8.75 pg/ml, P = 0.001). After controlling for the confounding factors, SBP (b = 0.078, P &amp;lt; 0.001), DBP (b = 0.090, P = 0.008) and MABP (b = 0.104, P &amp;lt; 0.001) correlated with plasma Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–40&lt;/sub&gt; level positively in ApoE ε4 non-carriers, but not ApoE ε4 carriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Elevated BP levels were associated with increased plasma Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–40&lt;/sub&gt; levels in middle-aged and elderly ApoE ε4 non-carriers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Classic reinforcement learning (RL) theories cannot explain human behavior in the absence of external reward or when the environment changes. Here, we employ a deep sequential decision-making paradigm with sparse reward and abrupt environmental changes. To explain the behavior of human participants in these environments, we show that RL theories need to include surprise and novelty, each with a distinct role. While novelty drives exploration before the first encounter of a reward, surprise increases the rate of learning of a world-model as well as of model-free action-values. Even though the world-model is available for model-based RL, we find that human decisions are dominated by model-free action choices. The world-model is only marginally used for planning, but it is important to detect surprising events. Our theory predicts human action choices with high probability and allows us to dissociate surprise, novelty, and reward in EEG signals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XynWQ8GORzc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Recently, an increasing number of studies have demonstrated that miRNAs are involved in human diseases, indicating that miRNAs might be a potential pathogenic factor for various diseases. Therefore, figuring out the relationship between miRNAs and diseases plays a critical role in not only the development of new drugs, but also the formulation of individualized diagnosis and treatment. As the prediction of miRNA-disease association via biological experiments is expensive and time-consuming, computational methods have a positive effect on revealing the association. In this study, a novel prediction model integrating GCN, CNN and Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (GCSENet) was constructed for the identification of miRNA-disease association. The model first captured features by GCN based on a heterogeneous graph including diseases, genes and miRNAs. Then, considering the different effects of genes on each type of miRNA and disease, as well as the different effects of the miRNA-gene and disease-gene relationships on miRNA-disease association, a feature weight was set and a combination of miRNA-gene and disease-gene associations was added as feature input for the convolution operation in CNN. Furthermore, the squeeze and excitation blocks of SENet were applied to determine the importance of each feature channel and enhance useful features by means of the attention mechanism, thus achieving a satisfactory prediction of miRNA-disease association. The proposed method was compared against other state-of-the-art methods. It achieved an AUROC score of 95.02% and an AUPR score of 95.55% in a 10-fold cross-validation, which led to the finding that the proposed method is superior to these popular methods on most of the performance evaluation indexes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bSi9U-j4N0Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Histone tails cooperate to control the breathing of genomic nucleosomes</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/rBnNLN6ARqA/article</link>

Genomic DNA is packaged in chromatin, a dynamic fiber variable in size and compaction. In chromatin, repeating nucleosome units wrap 145–147 DNA basepairs around histone proteins. Genetic and epigenetic regulation of genes relies on structural transitions in chromatin which are driven by intra- and inter-nucleosome dynamics and modulated by chemical modifications of the unstructured terminal tails of histones. Here we demonstrate how the interplay between histone H3 and H2A tails control ample nucleosome breathing motions. We monitored large openings of two genomic nucleosomes, and only moderate breathing of an engineered nucleosome in atomistic molecular simulations amounting to 24 μs. Transitions between open and closed nucleosome conformations were mediated by the displacement and changes in compaction of the two histone tails. These motions involved changes in the DNA interaction profiles of clusters of epigenetic regulatory aminoacids in the tails. Removing the histone tails resulted in a large increase of the amplitude of nucleosome breathing but did not change the sequence dependent pattern of the motions. Histone tail modulated nucleosome breathing is a key mechanism of chromatin dynamics with important implications for epigenetic regulation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rBnNLN6ARqA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Beef is the most resource intensive of all commonly used food items. Disproportionate synthetic fertilizer use during beef production propels a vigorous one-way factory-to-ocean nutrient flux, which alternative agriculture models strive to rectify by enhancing in-farm biogeochemical cycling. Livestock, especially cattle, are central to these models, which advocates describe as the context most likely to overcome beef’s environmental liabilities. Yet the dietary potential of such models is currently poorly known. Here, I thus ask whether nitrogen-sparing agriculture (NSA) can offer a viable alternative to the current US food system. Focusing on the most common eutrophication-causing element, N, I devise a specific model of mixed-use NSA comprising numerous small farms producing human plant-based food and forage, the latter feeding a core intensive beef operation that forgoes synthetic fertilizer and relies only on locally produced manure and N fixers. Assuming the model is deployed throughout the high-quality, precipitation-rich US cropland (delimiting approximately 100 million ha, less than half of today’s agricultural land use) and neglecting potential macroeconomic obstacles to wide deployment, I find that NSA could produce a diverse, high-quality nationwide diet distinctly better than today’s mean US diet. The model also permits 70%–80% of today’s beef consumption, raises today’s protein delivery by 5%–40%, and averts approximately 60% of today’s fertilizer use and approximately 10% of today’s total greenhouse gas emissions. As defined here, NSA is thus potentially a viable, scalable environmentally superior alternative to the current US food system, but only when combined with the commitment to substantially enhance our reliance on plant food.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/YBfN0hYrX1E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Mechanisms of Ischemic Stroke in Patients with Cancer: A Prospective Study</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26129?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
The objective of this study was to examine the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke with cancer.


Methods
We conducted a prospective cross‐sectional study from 2016 to 2020 at 2 hospitals. We enrolled 3 groups of 50 adult participants each. The main group included patients with active solid tumor cancer and acute ischemic stroke. The control groups included patients with acute ischemic stroke only or active cancer only. The patients with stroke‐only and patients with cancer‐only were matched to the patients with cancer‐plus‐stroke by age, sex, and cancer type, if applicable. The outcomes were prespecified hematological biomarkers and transcranial Doppler microemboli detection. Hematological biomarkers included markers of coagulation (D‐dimer and thrombin‐antithrombin), platelet function (P‐selectin), and endothelial integrity (thrombomodulin, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule‐1 [sICAM‐1], and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule‐1 [sVCAM‐1]). Hematological biomarkers were compared between groups using the Kruskal‐Wallis and Wilcoxon Rank‐Sum tests. In multivariable linear regression models, we adjusted for race, number of stroke risk factors, smoking, stroke severity, and antithrombotic use. Transcranial Doppler microemboli presence was compared between groups using chi‐square tests.


Results
Levels of all study biomarkers were different between groups. In univariate between‐group comparisons, patients with cancer‐plus‐stroke had higher levels of D‐dimer, sICAM‐1, sVCAM‐1, and thrombomodulin than both control groups; higher levels of thrombin‐antithrombin than patients with cancer‐only; and higher levels of P‐selectin than patients with stroke‐only. Findings were similar in multivariable analyses. Transcranial Doppler microemboli were detected in 32% of patients with cancer‐plus‐stroke, 16% of patients with stroke‐only, and 6% of patients with cancer‐only (p = 0.005).


Interpretation
Patients with cancer‐related stroke have higher markers of coagulation, platelet, and endothelial dysfunction, and more circulating microemboli, than matched controls. ANN NEUROL 2021</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Pelvic Pain Alters Functional Connectivity Between Anterior Cingulate Cortex and Hippocampus in Both Humans and a Rat Model</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.642349</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and hippocampus (HIPP) are two key brain regions associated with pain and pain-related affective processing. However, whether and how pelvic pain alters the neural activity and connectivity of the ACC and HIPP under baseline and during social pain, and the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms, remain unclear. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) combined with electrophysiology and biochemistry, we show that pelvic pain, particularly, primary dysmenorrhea (PDM), causes an increase in the functional connectivity between ACC and HIPP in resting-state fMRI, and a smaller reduction in connectivity during social exclusion in PDM females with periovulatory phase. Similarly, model rats demonstrate significantly increased ACC-HIPP synchronization in the gamma band, associating with reduced modulation by ACC-theta on HIPP-gamma and increased levels of receptor proteins and excitation. This study brings together human fMRI and animal research and enables improved therapeutic strategies for ameliorating pain and pain-related affective processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Striatal Synapse Degeneration and Dysfunction Are Reversed by Reactivation of Wnt Signaling</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2021.670467</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Synapse degeneration in the striatum has been associated with the early stages of Parkinson’s and Huntington’s diseases (PD and HD). However, the molecular mechanisms that trigger synaptic dysfunction and loss are not fully understood. Increasing evidence suggests that deficiency in Wnt signaling triggers synapse degeneration in the adult brain and that this pathway is affected in neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we demonstrate that endogenous Wnt signaling is essential for the integrity of a subset of inhibitory synapses on striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs). We found that inducible expression of the specific Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1) in the adult striatum leads to the loss of inhibitory synapses on MSNs and affects the synaptic transmission of D2-MSNs. We also discovered that re-activation of the Wnt pathway by turning off Dkk1 expression after substantial loss of synapses resulted in the complete recovery of GABAergic and dopamine synapse number. Our results also show that re-activation of the Wnt pathway leads to a recovery of amphetamine response and motor function. Our studies identify the Wnt signaling pathway as a potential therapeutic target for restoring neuronal circuits after synapse degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Nitric Oxide Regulates GluA2-Lacking AMPAR Contribution to Synaptic Transmission of CA1 Apical but Not Basal Dendrites</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2021.656377</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The mechanisms of synaptic plasticity differ in distinct local circuits. In the CA1 region of the hippocampus, the mechanisms of long-term potentiation (LTP) at apical dendrites in stratum radiatum and basal dendrites in stratum oriens involve different molecular cascades. For instance, participation of nitric oxide in LTP induction was shown to be necessary only for apical dendrites. This phenomenon may play a key role in information processing in CA1, and one of the reasons for this difference may be differing synaptic characteristics in these regions. Here, we compared the synaptic responses to stimulation of apical and basal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons and found a difference in the current–voltage characteristics of these inputs, which is presumably due to a distinct contribution of GluA2-lacking AMPA receptors to synaptic transmission. In addition, we obtained data that indicate the presence of these receptors in pyramidal dendrites in both stratum radiatum and stratum oriens. We also demonstrated that inhibition of NO synthase reduced the contribution of GluA2-lacking AMPA receptors at apical but not basal dendrites, and inhibition of soluble guanylate cyclase did not affect this phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Epigenetic Impacts of Early Life Stress in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Shape the Neurodevelopmental Continuum</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.671891</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurodevelopment in humans is a long, elaborate, and highly coordinated process involving three trimesters of prenatal development followed by decades of postnatal development and maturation. Throughout this period, the brain is highly sensitive and responsive to the external environment, which may provide a range of inputs leading to positive or negative outcomes. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) result from prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). Although the molecular mechanisms of FASD are not fully characterized, they involve alterations to the regulation of gene expression via epigenetic marks. As in the prenatal stages, the postnatal period of neurodevelopment is also sensitive to environmental inputs. Often this sensitivity is reflected in children facing adverse conditions, such as maternal separation. This exposure to early life stress (ELS) is implicated in the manifestation of various behavioral abnormalities. Most FASD research has focused exclusively on the effect of prenatal ethanol exposure in isolation. Here, we review the research into the effect of prenatal ethanol exposure and ELS, with a focus on the continuum of epigenomic and transcriptomic alterations. Interestingly, a select few experiments have assessed the cumulative effect of prenatal alcohol and postnatal maternal separation stress. Regulatory regions of different sets of genes are affected by both treatments independently, and a unique set of genes are affected by the combination of treatments. Notably, epigenetic and gene expression changes converge at the clustered protocadherin locus and oxidative stress pathway. Functional studies using epigenetic editing may elucidate individual contributions of regulatory regions for hub genes and further profiling efforts may lead to the development of non-invasive methods to identify children at risk. Taken together, the results favor the potential to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes by epigenetic management of children born with FASD using favorable postnatal conditions with or without therapeutic interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Axotomy Induces Drp1-Dependent Fragmentation of Axonal Mitochondria</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.668670</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It is well established that CNS axons fail to regenerate, undergo retrograde dieback, and form dystrophic growth cones due to both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. We sought to investigate the role of axonal mitochondria in the axonal response to injury. A viral vector (AAV) containing a mitochondrially targeted fluorescent protein (mitoDsRed) as well as fluorescently tagged LC3 (GFP-LC3), an autophagosomal marker, was injected into the primary motor cortex, to label the corticospinal tract (CST), of adult rats. The axons of the CST were then injured by dorsal column lesion at C4-C5. We found that mitochondria in injured CST axons near the injury site are fragmented and fragmentation of mitochondria persists for 2 weeks before returning to pre-injury lengths. Fragmented mitochondria have consistently been shown to be dysfunctional and detrimental to cellular health. Inhibition of Drp1, the GTPase responsible for mitochondrial fission, using a specific pharmacological inhibitor (mDivi-1) blocked fragmentation. Additionally, it was determined that there is increased mitophagy in CST axons following Spinal cord injury (SCI) based on increased colocalization of mitochondria and LC3. In vitro models revealed that mitochondrial divalent ion uptake is necessary for injury-induced mitochondrial fission, as inhibiting the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) using RU360 prevented injury-induced fission. This phenomenon was also observed in vivo. These studies indicate that following the injury, both in vivo and in vitro, axonal mitochondria undergo increased fission, which may contribute to the lack of regeneration seen in CNS neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Amyloid-β Impairs Dendritic Trafficking of Golgi-Like Organelles in the Early Phase Preceding Neurite Atrophy: Rescue by Mirtazapine</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.661728</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurite atrophy with loss of neuronal polarity is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other neurological disorders. While there is substantial agreement that disruption of intracellular vesicle trafficking is associated with axonal pathology in AD, comparatively less is known regarding its role in dendritic atrophy. This is a significant gap of knowledge because, unlike axons, dendrites are endowed with the complete endomembrane system comprising endoplasmic reticulum (ER), ER–Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), Golgi apparatus, post-Golgi vesicles, and a recycling-degradative route. In this study, using live-imaging of pGOLT-expressing vesicles, indicative of Golgi outposts and satellites, we investigate how amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomers affect the trafficking of Golgi-like organelles in the different dendritic compartments of cultured rat hippocampal neurons. We found that short-term (4 h) treatment with Aβ led to a decrease in anterograde trafficking of Golgi vesicles in dendrites of both resting and stimulated (with 50 mM KCl) neurons. We also characterized the ability of mirtazapine, a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic tetracyclic antidepressant (NaSSA), to rescue Golgi dynamics in dendrites. Mirtazapine treatment (10 μM) increased the number and both anterograde and retrograde motility, reducing the percentage of static Golgi vesicles. Finally, mirtazapine reverted the neurite atrophy induced by 24 h treatment with Aβ oligomers, suggesting that this drug is able to counteract the effects of Aβ by improving the dendritic trafficking of Golgi-related vesicles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;SK, HCN, and M channels are medium afterhyperpolarization (mAHP)-mediating ion channels. The three channels co-express in various brain regions, and their collective action strongly influences cellular excitability. However, significant diversity exists in the expression of channel isoforms in distinct brain regions and various subcellular compartments, which contributes to an equally diverse set of specific neuronal functions. The current review emphasizes the collective behavior of the three classes of mAHP channels and discusses how these channels function together although they play specialized roles. We discuss the biophysical properties of these channels, signaling pathways that influence the activity of the three mAHP channels, various chemical modulators that alter channel activity and their therapeutic potential in treating various neurological anomalies. Additionally, we discuss the role of mAHP channels in the pathophysiology of various neurological diseases and how their modulation can alleviate some of the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Innate Signaling in the CNS Prevents Demyelination in a Focal EAE Model</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.682451</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The pathological hallmark of multiple sclerosis (MS) is the formation of multifocal demyelinating lesions in the central nervous system (CNS). Stimulation of innate receptors has been shown to suppress experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an MS-like disease in mice. Specifically, targeting Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) and NOD-like receptor 2 (NOD2) significantly reduced disease severity. In the present work we have developed a novel focal EAE model to further study the effect of innate signaling on demyelinating pathology. Focal lesions were induced by stereotactic needle insertion into the corpus callosum (CC) of mice previously immunized for EAE. This resulted in focal pathology characterized by infiltration and demyelination in the CC. We find that intrathecal delivery of MIS416, a TLR9 and NOD2 bispecific innate ligand, into the cerebrospinal fluid reduced focal lesions in the CC. This was associated with upregulation of type I and II interferons, interleukin-10, arginase-1, CCL-2 and CXCL-10. Analysis of draining cervical lymph nodes showed upregulation of type II interferons and interleukin 10. Moreover, intrathecal MIS416 altered the composition of early CNS infiltrates, increasing proportions of myeloid and NK cells and reducing T cells at the lesion site. This study contributes to an increased understanding of how innate immune responses can play a protective role, which in turn may lead to additional therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of demyelinating pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Classification of Schizophrenia by Combination of Brain Effective and Functional Connectivity</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.651439</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;At present, lots of studies have tried to apply machine learning to different electroencephalography (EEG) measures for diagnosing schizophrenia (SZ) patients. However, most EEG measures previously used are either a univariate measure or a single type of brain connectivity, which may not fully capture the abnormal brain changes of SZ patients. In this paper, event-related potentials were collected from 45 SZ patients and 30 healthy controls (HCs) during a learning task, and then a combination of partial directed coherence (PDC) effective and phase lag index (PLI) functional connectivity were used as features to train a support vector machine classifier with leave-one-out cross-validation for classification of SZ from HCs. Our results indicated that an excellent classification performance (accuracy = 95.16%, specificity = 94.44%, and sensitivity = 96.15%) was obtained when the combination of functional and effective connectivity features was used, and the corresponding optimal feature number was 15, which included 12 PDC and three PLI connectivity features. The selected effective connectivity features were mainly located between the frontal/temporal/central and visual/parietal lobes, and the selected functional connectivity features were mainly located between the frontal/temporal and visual cortexes of the right hemisphere. In addition, most of the selected effective connectivity abnormally enhanced in SZ patients compared with HCs, whereas all the selected functional connectivity features decreased in SZ patients. The above results showed that our proposed method has great potential to become a tool for the auxiliary diagnosis of SZ.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

These regions were analyzed to obtain texture features. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS (version 20.0), including the Shapiro–Wilk test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test, which were used to test significant differences in each feature between the tumor and healthy regions. T-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) was used to visualize the data distribution so as to avoid tumor selection bias. The Gini impurity index in random forests (RFs) was used to select the top five out of all features. Based on the five features, three classification models were built respectively with three machine learning classifiers: RF, support vector machine (SVM), and back propagation (BP) neural network.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Sixteen of the 25 features were significantly different between the tumor and healthy areas. Through the Gini impurity index in RFs, standard deviation, first-order moment, variance, third-order absolute moment, and third-order central moment were selected to build the classification model. The classification model trained using the SVM classifier achieved the best performance, with sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve of 94.04%, 92.3%, and 0.932, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Texture analysis with an SVM classifier can help differentiate between brain tumor and healthy areas with high speed and accuracy, which would facilitate its clinical application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Prediction of Neural Diameter From Morphology to Enable Accurate Simulation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.666695</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Accurate neuron morphologies are paramount for computational model simulations of realistic neural responses. Over the last decade, the online repository NeuroMorpho.Org has collected over 140,000 available neuron morphologies to understand brain function and promote interaction between experimental and computational research. Neuron morphologies describe spatial aspects of neural structure; however, many of the available morphologies do not contain accurate diameters that are essential for computational simulations of electrical activity. To best utilize available neuron morphologies, we present a set of equations that predict dendritic diameter from other morphological features. To derive the equations, we used a set of NeuroMorpho.org archives with realistic neuron diameters, representing hippocampal pyramidal, cerebellar Purkinje, and striatal spiny projection neurons. Each morphology is separated into initial, branching children, and continuing nodes. Our analysis reveals that the diameter of preceding nodes, Parent Diameter, is correlated to diameter of subsequent nodes for all cell types. Branching children and initial nodes each required additional morphological features to predict diameter, such as path length to soma, total dendritic length, and longest path to terminal end. Model simulations reveal that membrane potential response with predicted diameters is similar to the original response for several tested morphologies. We provide our open source software to extend the utility of available NeuroMorpho.org morphologies, and suggest predictive equations may supplement morphologies that lack dendritic diameter and improve model simulations with realistic dendritic diameter.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: On the Use of a Multimodal Optimizer for Fitting Neuron Models. Application to the Cerebellar Granule Cell</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.663797</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This article extends a recent methodological workflow for creating realistic and computationally efficient neuron models whilst capturing essential aspects of single-neuron dynamics. We overcome the intrinsic limitations of the extant optimization methods by proposing an alternative optimization component based on multimodal algorithms. This approach can natively explore a diverse population of neuron model configurations. In contrast to methods that focus on a single global optimum, the multimodal method allows directly obtaining a set of promising solutions for a single but complex multi-feature objective function. The final sparse population of candidate solutions has to be analyzed and evaluated according to the biological plausibility and their objective to the target features by the expert. In order to illustrate the value of this approach, we base our proposal on the optimization of cerebellar granule cell (GrC) models that replicate the essential properties of the biological cell. Our results show the emerging variability of plausible sets of values that this type of neuron can adopt underlying complex spiking characteristics. Also, the set of selected cerebellar GrC models captured spiking dynamics closer to the reference model than the single model obtained with off-the-shelf parameter optimization algorithms used in our previous article. The method hereby proposed represents a valuable strategy for adjusting a varied population of realistic and simplified neuron models. It can be applied to other kinds of neuron models and biological contexts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: White Matter Changes With Rehabilitation in Children With Developmental Coordination Disorder: A Randomized Controlled Trial</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.673003</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background and Objectives: Children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) have difficulty learning motor skills, which can affect their participation in activities of daily living and psychosocial well-being. Over 50% of children with DCD also have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which further exacerbates their motor problems and impact on quality of life. A rehabilitation approach known as Cognitive Orientation to Occupational Performance uses problem-solving strategies to help children learn motor skills they wish to achieve. While this cognitive approach has been effective for children with DCD, few studies have examined the effectiveness of this approach for children with co-occurring ADHD. Further, the underlying mechanism and neural basis of this intervention are largely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: In this randomized waitlist-controlled trial, we used MRI to examine white matter microstructure after intervention in 8–12-year-old children with DCD (n = 28) and with DCD and co-occurring ADHD (n = 25). Children in both groups were randomized to either a treatment group or waitlist group at their first MRI. The treatment group began the intervention after their MRI scan and returned for a post-treatment scan at 3 months, and follow-up scan at 6 months; the waitlist group waited 3 months before their second MRI, received the intervention, and then had a post-treatment scan. Each child received intervention once weekly for 10 weeks. Diffusion tensor imaging was used to acquire white matter diffusion parameters and was analyzed using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results and Conclusion: Children with DCD showed significant improvement in white matter microstructure in the bilateral anterior thalamic radiation, bilateral sensorimotor tract, bilateral cingulum, fornix, splenium and body of corpus callosum, right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and white matter pathways to bilateral inferior gyri, right middle frontal gyrus, frontal medial cortex, and left cuneus. We suggest that these rehabilitation-induced neural changes in children with DCD occurred in regions associated with attention, self-regulation, motor planning, and inter-hemispheric communication, which positively affected brain connectivity and motor function. In contrast, children with DCD and co-occurring ADHD did not show any brain changes following the intervention. Modifications to the treatment protocol might help address the attentional and self-regulatory needs of children with a dual diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02597751.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Acoustic Analysis of Phonation in Children With Smith–Magenis Syndrome</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.661392</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Complex simultaneous neuropsychophysiological mechanisms are responsible for the processing of the information to be transmitted and for the neuromotor planning of the articulatory organs involved in speech. The nature of this set of mechanisms is closely linked to the clinical state of the subject. Thus, for example, in populations with neurodevelopmental deficits, these underlying neuropsychophysiological procedures are deficient and determine their phonation. Most of these cases with neurodevelopmental deficits are due to a genetic abnormality, as is the case in the population with Smith–Magenis syndrome (SMS). SMS is associated with neurodevelopmental deficits, intellectual disability, and a cohort of characteristic phenotypic features, including voice quality, which does not seem to be in line with the gender, age, and complexion of the diagnosed subject. The phonatory profile and speech features in this syndrome are dysphonia, high f0, excess vocal muscle stiffness, fluency alterations, numerous syllabic simplifications, phoneme omissions, and unintelligibility of speech. This exploratory study investigates whether the neuromotor deficits in children with SMS adversely affect phonation as compared to typically developing children without neuromotor deficits, which has not been previously determined. The authors compare the phonatory performance of a group of children with SMS (N = 12) with a healthy control group of children (N = 12) matched in age, gender, and grouped into two age ranges. The first group ranges from 5 to 7 years old, and the second group goes from 8 to 12 years old. Group differences were determined for two forms of acoustic analysis performed on repeated recordings of the sustained vowel /a/ F1 and F2 extraction and cepstral peak prominence (CPP). It is expected that the results will enlighten the question of the underlying neuromotor aspects of phonation in SMS population. These findings could provide evidence of the susceptibility of phonation of speech to neuromotor disturbances, regardless of their origin.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: A Novel Technique to Reject Artifact Components for Surface EMG Signals Recorded During Walking With Transcutaneous Spinal Cord Stimulation: A Pilot Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.660583</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transcutaneous spinal cord electrical stimulation (tSCS) is an emerging technology that targets to restore functionally integrated neuromuscular control of gait. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate a novel filtering method, Artifact Component Specific Rejection (ACSR), for removing artifacts induced by tSCS from surface electromyogram (sEMG) data for investigation of muscle response during walking when applying spinal stimulation. Both simulated and real tSCS contaminated sEMG data from six stroke survivors were processed using ACSR and notch filtering, respectively. The performance of the filters was evaluated with data collected in various conditions (e.g., simulated artifacts contaminating sEMG in multiple degrees, various tSCS intensities in five lower-limb muscles of six participants). In the simulation test, after applying the ACSR filter, the contaminated-signal was well matched with the original signal, showing a high correlation (r = 0.959) and low amplitude difference (normalized root means square error = 0.266) between them. In the real tSCS contaminated data, the ACSR filter showed superior performance on reducing the artifacts (96% decrease) over the notch filter (25% decrease). These results indicate that ACSR filtering is capable of eliminating artifacts from sEMG collected during tSCS application, improving the precision of quantitative analysis of muscle activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Early Development of Locomotor Patterns and Motor Control in Very Young Children at High Risk of Cerebral Palsy, a Longitudinal Case Series</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.659415</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The first years of life might be critical for encouraging independent walking in children with cerebral palsy (CP). We sought to identify mechanisms that may underlie the impaired development of walking in three young children with early brain lesions, at high risk of CP, via comprehensive instrumented longitudinal assessments of locomotor patterns and muscle activation during walking. We followed three children (P1–P3) with early brain lesions, at high risk of CP, during five consecutive gait analysis sessions covering a period of 1 to 2 years, starting before the onset of independent walking, and including the session during the first independent steps. In the course of the study, P1 did not develop CP, P2 was diagnosed with unilateral and P3 with bilateral CP. We monitored the early development of locomotor patterns over time via spatiotemporal gait parameters, intersegmental coordination (estimated via principal component analysis), electromyography activity, and muscle synergies (determined from 11 bilateral muscles via nonnegative matrix factorization). P1 and P2 started to walk independently at the corrected age of 14 and 22 months, respectively. In both of them, spatiotemporal gait parameters, intersegmental coordination, muscle activation patterns, and muscle synergy structure changed from supported to independent walking, although to a lesser extent when unilateral CP was diagnosed (P2), especially for the most affected leg. The child with bilateral CP (P3) did not develop independent walking, and all the parameters did not change over time. Our exploratory longitudinal study revealed differences in maturation of locomotor patterns between children with divergent developmental trajectories. We succeeded in identifying mechanisms that may underlie impaired walking development in very young children at high risk of CP. When verified in larger sample sizes, our approach may be considered a means to improve prognosis and to pinpoint possible targets for early intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Migraine Is More Than Just Headache: Is the Link to Chronic Fatigue and Mood Disorders Simply Due to Shared Biological Systems?</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.646692</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Migraine is a symptomatically heterogeneous condition, of which headache is just one manifestation. Migraine is a disorder of altered sensory thresholding, with hypersensitivity among sufferers to sensory input. Advances in functional neuroimaging have highlighted that several brain areas are involved even prior to pain onset. Clinically, patients can experience symptoms hours to days prior to migraine pain, which can warn of impending headache. These symptoms can include mood and cognitive change, fatigue, and neck discomfort. Some epidemiological studies have suggested that migraine is associated in a bidirectional fashion with other disorders, such as mood disorders and chronic fatigue, as well as with other pain conditions such as fibromyalgia. This review will focus on the literature surrounding alterations in fatigue, mood, and cognition in particular, in association with migraine, and the suggested links to disorders such as chronic fatigue syndrome and depression. We hypothesize that migraine should be considered a neural disorder of brain function, in which alterations in aminergic networks integrating the limbic system with the sensory and homeostatic systems occur early and persist after headache resolution and perhaps interictally. The associations with some of these other disorders may allude to the inherent sensory sensitivity of the migraine brain and shared neurobiology and neurotransmitter systems rather than true co-morbidity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Misregulation of Drosophila Sidestep Leads to Uncontrolled Wiring of the Adult Neuromuscular System and Severe Locomotion Defects</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.658791</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Holometabolic organisms undergo extensive remodelling of their neuromuscular system during metamorphosis. Relatively, little is known whether or not the embryonic guidance of molecules and axonal growth mechanisms are re-activated for the innervation of a very different set of adult muscles. Here, we show that the axonal attractant Sidestep (Side) is re-expressed during Drosophila metamorphosis and is indispensable for neuromuscular wiring. Mutations in side cause severe innervation defects in all legs. Neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) show a reduced density or are completely absent at multi-fibre muscles. Misinnervation strongly impedes, but does not completely abolish motor behaviours, including walking, flying, or grooming. Overexpression of Side in developing muscles induces similar innervation defects; for example, at indirect flight muscles, it causes flightlessness. Since muscle-specific overexpression of Side is unlikely to affect the central circuits, the resulting phenotypes seem to correlate with faulty muscle wiring. We further show that mutations in beaten path Ia (beat), a receptor for Side, results in similar weaker adult innervation and locomotion phenotypes, indicating that embryonic guidance pathways seem to be reactivated during metamorphosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Neuronal Damage and Neuroinflammation, a Bridge Between Bacterial Meningitis and Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.680858</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Bacterial meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges which covers and protects the brain and the spinal cord. Such inflammation is mostly caused by blood-borne bacteria that cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and finally invade the brain parenchyma. Pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae are the main etiological causes of bacterial meningitis. After trafficking across the BBB, bacterial pathogens in the brain interact with neurons, the fundamental units of Central Nervous System, and other types of glial cells. Although the specific molecular mechanism behind the interaction between such pathogens with neurons is still under investigation, it is clear that bacterial interaction with neurons and neuroinflammatory responses within the brain leads to neuronal cell death. Furthermore, clinical studies have shown indications of meningitis-caused dementia; and a variety of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and Huntington’s disease are characterized by the loss of neurons, which, unlike many other eukaryotic cells, once dead or damaged, they are seldom replaced. The aim of this review article is to provide an overview of the knowledge on how bacterial pathogens in the brain damage neurons through direct and indirect interactions, and how the neuronal damage caused by bacterial pathogen can, in the long-term, influence the onset of neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Rare Opportunities for Insights Into Serotonergic Contributions to Brain and Bowel Disorders: Studies of the SERT Ala56 Mouse</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.677563</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Altered structure, expression, and regulation of the presynaptic serotonin (5-HT) transporter (SERT) have been associated with multiple neurobehavioral disorders, including mood disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Opportunities to investigate mechanistic links supporting these associations were spurred with the identification of multiple, rare human SERT coding variants in a study that established a male-specific linkage of ASD to a linkage marker on chromosome 17 which encompassed the location of the SERT gene (SLC6A4). We have explored the most common of these variants, SERT Ala56, in vitro and in vivo. Results support a tonic elevation of 5-HT transport activity in transfected cells and human lymphoblasts by the variant in vitro that leads to an increased 5-HT clearance rate in vivo when studied in the SERT Ala56 mouse model, along with altered sensitivity to SERT regulatory signaling pathways. Importantly, hyperserotonemia, or an elevated whole blood 5-HT, level, was found in SERT Ala56 mice, reproducing a well-replicated trait observed in a significant fraction of ASD subjects. Additionally, we found multiple biochemical, physiological, and behavioral alterations in the SERT Ala56 mice that can be analogized to those observed in ASD and its medical comorbidities. The similarity of the functional impact of the SERT Ala56 variant to the consequences of p38α MAPK activation, ascribed to the induction of a biased conformation of the transporter toward an outward-facing conformation, has resulted in successful efforts to restore normal behavioral and bowel function via pharmacological and genetic p38α MAPK targeting. Moreover, the ability of the inflammatory cytokine IL-1β to enhance SERT activity via a p38α MAPK-dependent pathway suggests that the SERT Ala56 conformation mimics that of a chronic inflammatory state, supporting findings in ASD of elevated inflammatory cytokine levels. In this report, we review studies of the SERT Ala56 variant, discussing opportunities for continued insight into how chronically altered synaptic 5-HT homeostasis can drive reversible, functional perturbations in 5-HT sensitive pathways in the brain and periphery, and how targeting the SERT regulome, particularly through activating pathways such as those involving IL-1β/p38α MAPK, may be of benefit for neurobehavioral disorders, including ASD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Multimodal Optical Imaging to Investigate Spatiotemporal Changes in Cerebrovascular Function in AUDA Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.655305</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Administration of 12-(3-adamantan-1-yl-ureido)-dodecanoic acid (AUDA) has been demonstrated to alleviate infarction following ischemic stroke. Reportedly, the main effect of AUDA is exerting anti-inflammation and neovascularization via the inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase. However, the major contribution of this anti-inflammation and neovascularization effect in the acute phase of stroke is not completely elucidated. To investigate the neuroprotective effects of AUDA in acute ischemic stroke, we combined laser speckle contrast imaging and optical intrinsic signal imaging techniques with the implantation of a lab-designed cranial window. Forepaw stimulation was applied to assess the functional changes via measuring cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) that accompany neural activity. The rats that received AUDA in the acute phase of photothrombotic ischemia stroke showed a 30.5 ± 8.1% reduction in the ischemic core, 42.3 ± 15.1% reduction in the ischemic penumbra (p &amp;lt; 0.05), and 42.1 ± 4.6% increase of CMRO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in response to forepaw stimulation at post-stroke day 1 (p &amp;lt; 0.05) compared with the control group (N = 10 for each group). Moreover, at post-stroke day 3, increased functional vascular density was observed in AUDA-treated rats (35.9 ± 1.9% higher than that in the control group, p &amp;lt; 0.05). At post-stroke day 7, a 105.4% ± 16.4% increase of astrocytes (p &amp;lt; 0.01), 30.0 ± 10.9% increase of neurons (p &amp;lt; 0.01), and 65.5 ± 15.0% decrease of microglia (p &amp;lt; 0.01) were observed in the penumbra region in AUDA-treated rats (N = 5 for each group). These results suggested that AUDA affects the anti-inflammation at the beginning of ischemic injury and restores neuronal metabolic rate of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and tissue viability. The neovascularization triggered by AUDA restored CBF and may contribute to ischemic infarction reduction at post-stroke day 3. Moreover, for long-term neuroprotection, astrocytes in the penumbra region may play an important role in protecting neurons from apoptotic injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.615372</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis is a unique regulated cell death defined by the intracellular iron overload and distinct biological features compared with other well-known programmed cell death. Ferroptosis can be triggered by many causes including decreased expression of glutathione (GSH), inhibition of the function of glutathione-dependent peroxidase 4 (GPX4), and system x&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;, all of which finally lead to the over-accumulation of lipid peroxides in the cell. Ferroptosis has been reported to play an important role in the pathophysiological process of various cancers. In recent years, much evidence also proved that ferroptosis is involved in the progress of cerebral stroke. In this review, we summarized the characteristics of ferroptosis and the potential relationship between ferroptosis and ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, to provide new targets and ideas for the therapy of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.691881</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder, and it is characterized by the selective loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), as well as the presence of intracellular inclusions with α-synuclein as the main component in surviving DA neurons. Emerging evidence suggests that the imbalance of proteostasis is a key pathogenic factor for PD. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy, two major pathways for maintaining proteostasis, play important roles in PD pathology and are considered as attractive therapeutic targets for PD treatment. However, although ER stress/UPR and autophagy appear to be independent cellular processes, they are closely related to each other. In this review, we focused on the roles and molecular cross-links between ER stress/UPR and autophagy in PD pathology. We systematically reviewed and summarized the most recent advances in regulation of ER stress/UPR and autophagy, and their cross-linking mechanisms. We also reviewed and discussed the mechanisms of the coexisting ER stress/UPR activation and dysregulated autophagy in the lesion regions of PD patients, and the underlying roles and molecular crosslinks between ER stress/UPR activation and the dysregulated autophagy in DA neurodegeneration induced by PD-associated genetic factors and PD-related neurotoxins. Finally, we indicate that the combined regulation of ER stress/UPR and autophagy would be a more effective treatment for PD rather than regulating one of these conditions alone.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.666851</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It has previously been demonstrated that short-term foreign language learning can lead to structural brain changes in younger adults. Experience-dependent brain plasticity is known to be possible also in older age, but the specific effect of foreign language learning on brain structure in language-and memory-relevant regions in the old brain remains unknown. In the present study, 160 older Swedish adults (65–75 years) were randomized to complete either an entry-level Italian course or a relaxation course, both with a total duration of 11 weeks. Structural MRI scans were conducted before and after the intervention in a subset of participants to test for differential change in gray matter in the two groups in the inferior frontal gyrus, the superior temporal gyrus, and the hippocampus, and in white matter microstructure in the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), fronto-occipital fasciculus, and the hippocampal (HC) section of the cingulum. The study found no evidence for differential structural change following language training, independent of achieved vocabulary proficiency. However, hippocampal volume and associative memory ability before the intervention were found to be robust predictors of vocabulary proficiency at the end of the language course. The results suggest that having greater hippocampal volume and better associative memory ability benefits vocabulary learning in old age but that the very initial stage of foreign language learning does not trigger detectable changes in brain morphometry in old age.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.662786</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The spectrum of health complications instigated by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has been diverse and complex. Besides the evident pulmonary and cardiovascular threats, accumulating clinical data points to several neurological complications, which are more common in elderly COVID-19 patients. Recent pieces of evidence have marked events of neuro infection and neuroinvasion, producing several neurological complications in COVID-19 patients; however, a systematic understanding of neuro-pathophysiology and manifested neurological complications, more specifically in elderly COVID-19 patients is largely elusive. Since the elderly population gradually develops neurological disorders with aging, COVID-19 inevitably poses a higher risk of neurological manifestations to the aged patients. In this report, we reviewed SARS-CoV-2 infection and its role in neurological manifestations with an emphasis on the elderly population. We reviewed neuropathological events including neuroinfection, neuroinvasion, and their underlying mechanisms affecting neuromuscular, central- and peripheral- nervous systems. We further assessed the imminent neurological challenges in the COVID-19 exposed population, post-SARS-CoV-2-infection. Given the present state of clinical preparedness, the emerging role of AI and machine learning was also discussed concerning COVID-19 diagnostics and its management. Taken together, the present review summarizes neurological outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated complications, specifically in elderly patients, and underlines the need for their clinical management in advance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Amyloid β and Amyloid Precursor Protein Synergistically Suppress Large-Conductance Calcium-Activated Potassium Channel in Cortical Neurons</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.660319</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Intracellular amyloid β (Aβ) injection suppresses the large-conductance calcium-dependent potassium (BK) channel in cortical pyramidal cells from wild-type (WT) mice. In 3xTg Alzheimer’s disease (AD) model mice, intraneuronal Aβ is genetically programed to accumulate, which suppresses the BK channel. However, the mode of BK channel suppression remained unclarified. The present report revealed that only one (11A1) of the three anti-Aβ-oligomer antibodies that we examined, but not anti-monomer-Aβ-antibodies, was effective in recovering BK channel activity in 3xTg neurons. Antibodies against amyloid precursor protein (APP) were also found to be effective, suggesting that APP plays an essential part in this Aβ-oligomer-induced BK channel suppression in 3xTg neurons. In WT neurons, by contrast, APP suppressed BK channels by itself, which suggests that either APP or Aβ is sufficient to block BK channels, thus pointing to a different co-operativity of Aβ and APP in WT and 3xTg neurons. To clarify this difference, we relied on our previous finding that the scaffold protein Homer1a reverses the BK channel blockade in both WT and 3xTg neurons. In cortical neurons from 3xTg mice that bear Homer1a knockout (4xTg mice), neither anti-APP antibodies nor 11A1, but only the 6E10 antibody that binds both APP and Aβ, rescued the BK channel suppression. Given that Homer1a expression is activity dependent and 3xTg neurons are hyperexcitable, Homer1a is likely to be expressed sufficiently in 3xTg neurons, thereby alleviating the suppressive influence of APP and Aβ on BK channel. A unique way that APP modifies Aβ toxicity is thus proposed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Heterogeneity in Regional Damage Detected by Neuroimaging and Neuropathological Studies in Older Adults With COVID-19: A Cognitive-Neuroscience Systematic Review to Inform the Long-Term Impact of the Virus on Neurocognitive Trajectories</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.646908</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Other than its direct impact on cardiopulmonary health, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection affects additional body systems, especially in older adults. Several studies have reported acute neurological symptoms that present at onset or develop during hospitalisation, with associated neural injuries. Whilst the acute neurological phase is widely documented, the long-term consequences of COVID-19 infection on neurocognitive functioning remain unknown. Although an evidence-based framework describing the disease chronic phase is premature, it is important to lay the foundations for future data-driven models. This systematic review aimed at summarising the literature on neuroimaging and neuropathological findings in older over-60 patients with COVID-19 following a cognitive neuroscientific perspective, to clarify the most vulnerable brain areas and speculate on the possible cognitive consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched to identify relevant manuscripts published between 1st March 2020 and 31th December 2020. Outputs were screened and selected by two assessors. Relevant studies not detected by literature search were added manually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Ninety studies, mainly single cases and case series, were included. Several neuroimaging and neuropathological findings in older patients with COVID-19 emerged from these studies, with cerebrovascular damage having a prominent role. Abnormalities (hyperintensities, hypoperfusion, inflammation, and cellular damage) were reported in most brain areas. The most consistent cross-aetiology findings were in white matter, brainstem and fronto-temporal areas. Viral DNA was detected mainly in olfactory, orbitofrontal and brainstem areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Studies on COVID-19 related neural damage are rich and diverse, but limited to description of hospitalised patients with fatal outcome (i.e., in neuropathological studies) or severe symptoms (i.e., in neuroimaging studies). The damage seen in this population indicates acute and largely irreversible dysfunction to neural regions involved in major functional networks that support normal cognitive and behavioural functioning. It is still unknown whether the long-term impact of the virus will be limited to chronic evolution of acute events, whether sub-clinical pathological processes will be exacerbated or whether novel mechanisms will emerge. Based on current literature, future theoretical frameworks describing the long-term impact of COVID-19 infection on mental abilities will have to factor in major trends of aetiological and topographic heterogeneity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As a severe neurological deficit, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is associated with overwhelming mortality. Subsequent oxidative stress and neurological dysfunction are likely to cause secondary brain injury. Therefore, this study sought to define the role of Krüppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) and underlying mechanism in oxidative stress and neurological dysfunction following ICH. An in vivo model of ICH was established in rats by injection of autologous blood, and an in vitro ICH cell model was developed in hippocampal neurons by oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb) exposure. Next, gain- and loss-of-function assays were performed in vivo and in vitro to clarify the effect of KLF6 on neurological dysfunction and oxidative stress in ICH rats and neuronal apoptosis and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species in OxyHb-induced hippocampal neurons. KLF6, nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2), and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) were highly expressed in hippocampal tissues of ICH rats, whereas sirtuin 5 (SIRT5) presented a poor expression. Mechanistically, KLF6 bound to the SIRT5 promoter and transcriptionally repressed SIRT5 to activate the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. KLF6 silencing alleviated neurological dysfunction and oxidative stress in ICH rats and diminished oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis in OxyHb-induced neurons, whereas SIRT5 overexpression negated its effect. To sum up, KLF6 silencing elevated SIRT5 expression to inactivate the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, thus attenuating oxidative stress and neurological dysfunction after ICH.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Sex Difference in Network Topology and Education Correlated With Sex Difference in Cognition During the Disease Process of Alzheimer</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.639529</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) manifests differently in males and females. However, the neuro-mechanism and influence factors are still unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: To explore sex differences in brain network topology during AD disease progression and its association with cognition and possible influencing factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data and cognitive scores were collected from 82 AD patients (50 females), 56 amnestic mildly cognitive impaired patients (29 females), and 63 healthy controls (38 females). Global and regional topological network metrics and modular architecture were calculated. Two-way ANOVA was performed to explore group and sex interactions and their main effects. Mediation analysis was used to explore the relationship among education, inter/intra-network connectivity, and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Lower levels of education, lower MMSE scores, and a positive correlation between the level of education and MMSE scores were found in female AD patients (p = 0.024, r = 0.319). Significantly lower connectivity strength within the sensorimotor network, dorsal attention network, ventral attention network (VAN), and between the sensorimotor and VAN were observed in male AD patients (p = 0.006, 0.028, 0.046, and 0.013, respectively). Group and sex interactions were also found in nodal properties, mainly in the frontal lobe, temporal lobe, middle cingulum, precuneus, and postcentral gyrus. Several of the altered brain network properties were associated with cognitive behavior in male AD patients. Education regulated the MMSE score through the mediation of connection strength between the default mode and limbic networks (LN) in the patient group (aMCI and AD combined).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that sex differences exist at the brain network level in AD. Sex differences in network topology and education are correlated with sex differences in cognition during AD progression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Disrupted Network Topology Contributed to Spatial Navigation Impairment in Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.630677</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Impairment in spatial navigation (SN) and structural network topology is not limited to patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) dementia and can be detected earlier in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We recruited 32 MCI patients (65.91 ± 11.33 years old) and 28 normal cognition patients (NC; 69.68 ± 10.79 years old), all of whom underwent a computer-based battery of SN tests evaluating egocentric, allocentric, and mixed SN strategies and diffusion-weighted and T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). To evaluate the topological features of the structural connectivity network, we calculated its measures such as the global efficiency, local efficiency, clustering coefficient, and shortest path length with GRETNA. We determined the correlation between SN accuracy and network topological properties. Compared to NC, MCI subjects demonstrated a lower egocentric navigation accuracy. Compared with NC, MCI subjects showed significantly decreased clustering coefficients in the left middle frontal gyrus, right rectus, right superior parietal gyrus, and right inferior parietal gyrus and decreased shortest path length in the left paracentral lobule. We observed significant positive correlations of the shortest path length in the left paracentral lobule with both the mixed allocentric–egocentric and the allocentric accuracy measured by the average total errors. A decreased clustering coefficient in the right inferior parietal gyrus was associated with a larger allocentric navigation error. White matter hyperintensities (WMH) did not affect the correlation between network properties and SN accuracy. This study demonstrated that structural connectivity network abnormalities, especially in the frontal and parietal gyri, are associated with a lower SN accuracy, independently of WMH, providing a new insight into the brain mechanisms associated with SN impairment in MCI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Technological advances have enabled us to profile multiple molecular layers at unprecedented single-cell resolution and the available datasets from multiple samples or domains are growing. These datasets, including scRNA-seq data, scATAC-seq data and sc-methylation data, usually have different powers in identifying the unknown cell types through clustering. So, methods that integrate multiple datasets can potentially lead to a better clustering performance. Here we propose &lt;i&gt;couple&lt;/i&gt;CoC+ for the integrative analysis of single-cell genomic data. &lt;i&gt;couple&lt;/i&gt;CoC+ is a transfer learning method based on the information-theoretic co-clustering framework. In &lt;i&gt;couple&lt;/i&gt;CoC+, we utilize the information in one dataset, the source data, to facilitate the analysis of another dataset, the target data. &lt;i&gt;couple&lt;/i&gt;CoC+ uses the linked features in the two datasets for effective knowledge transfer, and it also uses the information of the features in the target data that are unlinked with the source data. In addition, &lt;i&gt;couple&lt;/i&gt;CoC+ matches similar cell types across the source data and the target data. By applying &lt;i&gt;couple&lt;/i&gt;CoC+ to the integrative clustering of mouse cortex scATAC-seq data and scRNA-seq data, mouse and human scRNA-seq data, mouse cortex sc-methylation and scRNA-seq data, and human blood dendritic cells scRNA-seq data from two batches, we demonstrate that &lt;i&gt;couple&lt;/i&gt;CoC+ improves the overall clustering performance and matches the cell subpopulations across multimodal single-cell genomic datasets. &lt;i&gt;couple&lt;/i&gt;CoC+ has fast convergence and it is computationally efficient.

Modern analytical techniques enable researchers to collect data about cellular states, before and after perturbations. These states can be characterized using analytical techniques, but the inference of regulatory interactions that explain and predict changes in these states remains a challenge. Here we present a generalizable, unsupervised approach to generate parameter-free, logic-based models of cellular processes, described by multiple discrete states. Our algorithm employs a Hamming-distance based approach to formulate, test, and identify optimized logic rules that link two states. Our approach comprises two steps. First, a model with no prior knowledge except for the mapping between initial and attractor states is built. We then employ biological constraints to improve model fidelity. Our algorithm automatically recovers the relevant dynamics for the explored models and recapitulates key aspects of the biochemical species concentration dynamics in the original model. We present the advantages and limitations of our work and discuss how our approach could be used to infer logic-based mechanisms of signaling, gene-regulatory, or other input-output processes describable by the Boolean formalism.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/e0809wjDpgo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: The nonreceptor tyrosine kinase SRMS inhibits autophagy and promotes tumor growth by phosphorylating the scaffolding protein FKBP51</title>

Nutrient-responsive protein kinases control the balance between anabolic growth and catabolic processes such as autophagy. Aberrant regulation of these kinases is a major cause of human disease. We report here that the vertebrate nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Src-related kinase lacking C-terminal regulatory tyrosine and N-terminal myristylation sites (SRMS) inhibits autophagy and promotes growth in a nutrient-responsive manner. Under nutrient-replete conditions, SRMS phosphorylates the PHLPP scaffold FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51), disrupts the FKBP51-PHLPP complex, and promotes FKBP51 degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This prevents PHLPP-mediated dephosphorylation of AKT, causing sustained AKT activation that promotes growth and inhibits autophagy. SRMS is amplified and overexpressed in human cancers where it drives unrestrained AKT signaling in a kinase-dependent manner. SRMS kinase inhibition activates autophagy, inhibits cancer growth, and can be accomplished using the FDA-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib. This illuminates SRMS as a targetable vulnerability in human cancers and as a new target for pharmacological induction of autophagy in vertebrates.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/yxuJNnTVFxE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Episodic memory depends on interactions between the hippocampus and interconnected neocortical regions. Here, using data-driven analyses of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, we identified the networks that interact with the hippocampus—the default mode network (DMN) and a “medial temporal network” (MTN) that included regions in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and precuneus. We observed that the MTN plays a critical role in connecting the visual network to the DMN and hippocampus. The DMN could be further divided into 3 subnetworks: a “posterior medial” (PM) subnetwork comprised of posterior cingulate and lateral parietal cortices; an “anterior temporal” (AT) subnetwork comprised of regions in the temporopolar and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex; and a “medial prefrontal” (MP) subnetwork comprised of regions primarily in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). These networks vary in their functional connectivity (FC) along the hippocampal long axis and represent different kinds of information during memory-guided decision-making. Finally, a Neurosynth meta-analysis of fMRI studies suggests new hypotheses regarding the functions of the MTN and DMN subnetworks, providing a framework to guide future research on the neural architecture of episodic memory.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/KfoHmH-TZZg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Cytoarchitectural Characteristics Associated with Cognitive Flexibility in Raccoons</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25197?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
With rates of psychiatric illnesses such as depression continuing to rise, additional preclinical models are needed to facilitate translational neuroscience research. In the current study, the raccoon (Procyon lotor) was investigated due to its similarities with primate brains, including comparable proportional neuronal densities, cortical magnification of the forepaw area, and cortical gyrification. Specifically, we report on the cytoarchitectural characteristics of raccoons profiled as high, intermediate, or low solvers in a multi‐access problem‐solving task. Isotropic fractionation indicated that high‐solvers had significantly more cells in the hippocampus (HC) than the other solving groups; further, a nonsignificant trend suggested that this increase in cell profile density was due to increased non‐neuronal (e.g., glial) cells. Group differences were not observed in the cellular density of the somatosensory cortex. Thionin‐based staining confirmed the presence of von Economo neurons (VENs) in the frontoinsular (FI) cortex, although no impact of solving ability on VEN cell profile density levels was observed. Elongated fusiform cells were quantified in the hippocampus dentate gyrus where high‐solvers were observed to have higher levels of this cell type than the other solving groups. In sum, the current findings suggest that varying cytoarchitectural phenotypes contribute to cognitive flexibility. Additional research is necessary to determine the translational value of cytoarchitectural distribution patterns on adaptive behavioral outcomes associated with cognitive performance and mental health.

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Hippocampal correlates of episodic memory in Parkinson’s disease: A systematic review of magnetic resonance imaging studies</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24863?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
The present review asks whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies are able to define neural correlates of episodic memory within the hippocampus in Parkinson's disease (PD). Systematic searches were performed in PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, CINAHL, and EMBASE using search terms related to structural and functional MRI (fMRI), the hippocampus, episodic memory, and PD. Risk of bias was assessed for each study using the Newtown–Ottawa Scale. Thirty‐nine studies met inclusion criteria; eight fMRI, seven diffusion MRI (dMRI), and 24 structural MRI (14 exploring whole hippocampus and 10 exploring hippocampal subfields). Critical analysis of the literature revealed mixed evidence from functional and dMRI, but stronger evidence from sMRI of the hippocampus as a biomarker for episodic memory impairment in PD. Hippocampal subfield studies most often implicated CA1, CA3/4, and subiculum volume in episodic memory and cognitive decline in PD. Despite differences in imaging methodology, study design, and sample characteristics, MRI studies have helped elucidate an important neural correlate of episodic memory impairment in PD with both clinical and theoretical implications. Natural progression of this work encourages future research on hippocampal subfield function as a potential biomarker of, or therapeutic target for, episodic memory dysfunction in PD.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Spinal A3 adenosine receptor activation acutely restores morphine antinociception in opioid tolerant male rats</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24869?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Spinal A3 adenosine receptor (A3AR) activation by MRS5698 transiently restores morphine antinociception in opioid‐tolerant rats. Intrathecal injection of MRS5698 (“on”) on days 8, 9, 12, and 13 reinstates morphine antinociception. This response is blocked by A3AR antagonist MRS1523 and absent when intrathecal vehicle (“off”) is administered on days 10 and 11.

Abstract
Opioids are potent analgesics, but their pain‐relieving effects diminish with repeated use. The reduction in analgesic potency is a hallmark of opioid analgesic tolerance, which hampers opioid pain therapy. In the central nervous system, opioid analgesia is critically modulated by adenosine, a purine nucleoside implicated in the beneficial and detrimental actions of opioid medications. Here, we focus on the A3 adenosine receptor (A3AR) in opioid analgesic tolerance. Intrathecal administration of the A3AR agonist MRS5698 with daily systemic morphine in male rats attenuated the reduction in morphine antinociception over 7 days. In rats with established morphine tolerance, intrathecal MRS5698 partially restored the antinociceptive effects of morphine. However, when MRS5698 was discontinued, these animals displayed a reduced antinociceptive response to morphine. Our results suggest that MRS5698 acutely and transiently potentiates morphine antinociception in tolerant rats. By contrast, in morphine‐naïve rats MRS5698 treatment did not impact thermal nociceptive threshold or affect antinociceptive response to a single injection of morphine. Furthermore, we found that morphine‐induced adenosine release in cerebrospinal fluid was blunted in tolerant animals, but total spinal A3AR expression was not affected. Collectively, our findings indicate that spinal A3AR activation acutely potentiates morphine antinociception in the opioid tolerant state.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.675444</link>
	<content:encoded>Introduction&lt;p&gt;The brainstem is an important component in the pathology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Although neuroimaging studies have shown multiple structural changes in ALS patients, few studies have investigated structural alterations in the brainstem. Herein, we compared the brainstem structure between patients with ALS and healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A total of 33 patients with ALS and 33 healthy controls were recruited in this study. T1-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were acquired on a 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (3T MRI) scanner. Volumetric and vertex-wised approaches were implemented to assess the differences in the brainstem’s morphological features between the two groups. An atlas-based region of interest (ROI) analysis was performed to compare the white matter integrity of the brainstem between the two groups. Additionally, a correlation analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between ALS clinical characteristics and structural features.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Volumetric analyses showed no significant difference in the subregion volume of the brainstem between ALS patients and healthy controls. In the shape analyses, ALS patients had a local abnormal surface contraction in the ventral medulla oblongata and ventral pons. Compared with healthy controls, ALS patients showed significantly lower fractional anisotropy (FA) in the left corticospinal tract (CST) and bilateral frontopontine tracts (FPT) at the brainstem level, and higher radial diffusivity (RD) in bilateral CST and left FPT at the brainstem level by ROI analysis in DTI. Correlation analysis showed that disease severity was positively associated with FA in left CST and left FPT.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that the brainstem in ALS suffers atrophy, and degenerative processes in the brainstem may reflect disease severity in ALS. These findings may be helpful for further understanding of potential neural mechanisms in ALS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Scaling down technology demotes the parameters of AC-coupled neural amplifiers, such as increasing the low-cutoff frequency due to the short-channel effects. To improve the low-cutoff frequency, one solution is to increase the feedback capacitors' value. This solution is not desirable, as the input capacitors have to be increased to maintain the same gain, which increases the area and decreases the input impedance of the neural amplifier. We analytically analyze the small-signal behavior of the neural amplifier and prove that the main reason for the increase of the low-cutoff frequency in advanced CMOS technologies is the reduction of the input resistance of the operational transconductance amplifier (OTA). We also show that the reduction of the input resistance of the OTA is due to the increase in the gate oxide leakage in the input transistors. In this paper, we explore this fact and propose two solutions to reduce the low-cutoff frequency without increasing the value of the feedback capacitor. The first solution is performed by only simulation and is called cross-coupled positive feedback that uses pseudoresistors to provide a negative resistance to increase the input resistance of the OTA. As an advantage, only standard CMOS transistors are used in this method. Simulation results show that a low-cutoff frequency of 1.5 Hz is achieved while the midband gain is 30.4 dB at 1 V. In addition, the power consumption is 0.6 μW. In the second method, we utilize thick-oxide MOS transistors in the input differential pair of the OTA. We designed and fabricated the second method in the 65 nm TSMC CMOS process. Measured results are obtained by in vitro recordings on slices of mouse brainstem. The measurement results show that the bandwidth is between 2 Hz and 5.6 kHz. The neural amplifier has 34.3 dB voltage gain in midband and consumes 3.63 μW at 1 V power supply. The measurement results show an input-referred noise of 6.1 μV&lt;sub&gt;rms&lt;/sub&gt; and occupy 0.04 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; silicon area.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This article proposes a multimode medical image fusion with CNN and supervised learning, in order to solve the problem of practical medical diagnosis. It can implement different types of multimodal medical image fusion problems in batch processing mode and can effectively overcome the problem that traditional fusion problems that can only be solved by single and single image fusion. To a certain extent, it greatly improves the fusion effect, image detail clarity, and time efficiency in a new method. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method exhibits state-of-the-art fusion performance in terms of visual quality and a variety of quantitative evaluation criteria. Its medical diagnostic background is wide.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.600075</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Each neuron in the central nervous system has many dendrites, which provide input information through impulses. Assuming that a neuron's decision to continue or stop firing is made by rules applied to the dendrites' inputs, we associate neuron activity with a quantum like-cellular automaton (QLCA) concepts. Following a previous study that related the CA description with entangled states, we provide a quantum-like description of neuron activity. After reviewing and presenting the entanglement concept expressed by QLCA terminology, we propose a model that relates quantum-like measurement to consciousness. Then, we present a toy model that reviews the QLCA theory, which is adapted to our terminology. The study also focuses on implementing QLCA formalism to describe a single neuron activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Hippocampal Somatostatin Interneurons, Long-Term Synaptic Plasticity and Memory</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.687558</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A distinctive feature of the hippocampal structure is the diversity of inhibitory interneurons. These complex inhibitory interconnections largely contribute to the tight modulation of hippocampal circuitry, as well as to the formation and coordination of neuronal assemblies underlying learning and memory. Inhibitory interneurons provide more than a simple transitory inhibition of hippocampal principal cells (PCs). The synaptic plasticity of inhibitory neurons provides long-lasting changes in the hippocampal network and is a key component of memory formation. The dendrite targeting interneurons expressing the peptide somatostatin (SOM) are particularly interesting in this regard because they display unique long-lasting synaptic changes leading to metaplastic regulation of hippocampal networks. In this article, we examine the actions of the neuropeptide SOM on hippocampal cells, synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. We address the different subtypes of hippocampal SOM interneurons. We describe the long-term synaptic plasticity that takes place at the excitatory synapses of SOM interneurons, its singular induction and expression mechanisms, as well as the consequences of these changes on the hippocampal network, learning, and memory. We also review evidence that astrocytes provide cell-specific dynamic regulation of inhibition of PC dendrites by SOM interneurons. Finally, we cover how, in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), dysfunction of plasticity of SOM interneuron excitatory synapses may also contribute to cognitive impairments in brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Neurotrophic Factors in Parkinson’s Disease: Clinical Trials, Open Challenges and Nanoparticle-Mediated Delivery to the Brain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.682597</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurotrophic factors (NTFs) are small secreted proteins that support the development, maturation and survival of neurons. NTFs injected into the brain rescue and regenerate certain neuronal populations lost in neurodegenerative diseases, demonstrating the potential of NTFs to cure the diseases rather than simply alleviating the symptoms. NTFs (as the vast majority of molecules) do not pass through the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and therefore, are delivered directly into the brain of patients using costly and risky intracranial surgery. The delivery efficacy and poor diffusion of some NTFs inside the brain are considered the major problems behind their modest effects in clinical trials. Thus, there is a great need for NTFs to be delivered systemically thereby avoiding intracranial surgery. Nanoparticles (NPs), particles with the size dimensions of 1-100 nm, can be used to stabilize NTFs and facilitate their transport through the BBB. Several studies have shown that NTFs can be loaded into or attached onto NPs, administered systemically and transported to the brain. To improve the NP-mediated NTF delivery through the BBB, the surface of NPs can be functionalized with specific ligands such as transferrin, insulin, lactoferrin, apolipoproteins, antibodies or short peptides that will be recognized and internalized by the respective receptors on brain endothelial cells. In this review, we elaborate on the most suitable NTF delivery methods and envision “ideal” NTF for Parkinson’s disease (PD) and clinical trial thereof. We shortly summarize clinical trials of four NTFs, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), neurturin (NRTN), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB), and cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF), that were tested in PD patients, focusing mainly on GDNF and CDNF. We summarize current possibilities of NP-mediated delivery of NTFs to the brain and discuss whether NPs have impact in improving the properties of NTFs and delivery across the BBB. Emerging delivery approaches and future directions of NTF-based nanomedicine are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Mechanisms of Invasion in Glioblastoma: Extracellular Matrix, Ca2+ Signaling, and Glutamate</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.663092</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and malignant form of primary brain tumor with a median survival time of 14–16 months in GBM patients. Surgical treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy may help increase survival by removing GBM from the brain. However, complete surgical resection to eliminate GBM is almost impossible due to its high invasiveness. When GBM cells migrate to the brain, they interact with various cells, including astrocytes, neurons, endothelial cells, and the extracellular matrix (ECM). They can also make their cell body shrink to infiltrate into narrow spaces in the brain; thereby, they can invade regions of the brain and escape from surgery. Brain tumor cells create an appropriate microenvironment for migration and invasion by modifying and degrading the ECM. During those processes, the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling pathway and other signaling cascades mediated by various ion channels contribute mainly to gene expression, motility, and invasion of GBM cells. Furthermore, GBM cells release glutamate, affecting migration via activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors in an autocrine manner. This review focuses on the cellular mechanisms of glioblastoma invasion and motility related to ECM, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling, and glutamate. Finally, we discuss possible therapeutic interventions to inhibit invasion by GBM cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Preservation of Brain Activity in Unresponsive Patients Identifies MCS Star</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26095?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Brain‐injured patients who are unresponsive at the bedside (ie, vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome – VS/UWS) may present brain activity similar to patients in minimally conscious state (MCS). This peculiar condition has been termed “non‐behavioural MCS” or “MCS*”. In the present study we aimed to investigate the proportion and underlying brain characteristics of patients in MCS*.


Methods
Brain 18F‐fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG‐PET) was acquired on 135 brain‐injured patients diagnosed in prolonged VS/UWS (n = 48) or MCS (n = 87). From an existing database, relative metabolic preservation in the fronto‐parietal network (measured with standardized uptake value) was visually inspected by three experts. Patients with hypometabolism of the fronto‐parietal network were labelled “VS/UWS”, while its (partial) preservation either confirmed the behavioural diagnosis of “MCS” or, in absence of behavioural signs of consciousness, suggested a diagnosis of “MCS*”. Clinical outcome at 1‐year follow‐up, functional connectivity, grey matter atrophy, and regional brain metabolic patterns were investigated in the three groups (VS/UWS, MCS* and MCS).


Results
67% of behavioural VS/UWS presented a partial preservation of brain metabolism (ie, MCS*). Compared to VS/UWS patients, MCS* patients demonstrated a better outcome, global functional connectivity and grey matter preservation more compatible with the diagnosis of MCS. MCS* patients presented lower brain metabolism mostly in the posterior brain regions compared to MCS patients.


Interpretation
MCS* is a frequent phenomenon that is associated with better outcome and better brain preservation than the diagnosis of VS/UWS. Complementary exams should be provided to all unresponsive patients before taking medical decisions. ANN NEUROL 2021</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: The visual cortex produces gamma band echo in response to broadband visual flicker</title>

The aim of this study is to uncover the network dynamics of the human visual cortex by driving it with a broadband random visual flicker. We here applied a broadband flicker (1–720 Hz) while measuring the MEG and then estimated the temporal response function (TRF) between the visual input and the MEG response. This TRF revealed an early response in the 40–60 Hz gamma range as well as in the 8–12 Hz alpha band. While the gamma band response is novel, the latter has been termed the alpha band perceptual echo. The gamma echo preceded the alpha perceptual echo. The dominant frequency of the gamma echo was subject-specific thereby reflecting the individual dynamical properties of the early visual cortex. To understand the neuronal mechanisms generating the gamma echo, we implemented a pyramidal-interneuron gamma (PING) model that produces gamma oscillations in the presence of constant input currents. Applying a broadband input current mimicking the visual stimulation allowed us to estimate TRF between the input current and the population response (akin to the local field potentials). The TRF revealed a gamma echo that was similar to the one we observed in the MEG data. Our results suggest that the visual gamma echo can be explained by the dynamics of the PING model even in the absence of sustained gamma oscillations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/88rEjoc00IA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Existing studies have demonstrated that dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) is involved in the initiation and progression of cancer. Many efforts have been devoted to identify microRNAs as potential biomarkers for cancer diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic targets. With the rapid development of miRNA sequencing technology, a vast amount of miRNA expression data for multiple cancers has been collected. These invaluable data repositories provide new paradigms to explore the relationship between miRNAs and cancer. Thus, there is an urgent need to explore the complex cancer-related miRNA-gene patterns by integrating multi-omics data in a pan-cancer paradigm. In this study, we present a tensor sparse canonical correlation analysis (TSCCA) method for identifying cancer-related miRNA-gene modules across multiple cancers. TSCCA is able to overcome the drawbacks of existing solutions and capture both the cancer-shared and specific miRNA-gene co-expressed modules with better biological interpretations. We comprehensively evaluate the performance of TSCCA using a set of simulated data and matched miRNA/gene expression data across 33 cancer types from the TCGA database. We uncover several dysfunctional miRNA-gene modules with important biological functions and statistical significance. These modules can advance our understanding of miRNA regulatory mechanisms of cancer and provide insights into miRNA-based treatments for cancer.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KF6Pqt_AyoU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Increasing interest has emerged in new mathematical approaches that simplify the study of complex differentiation processes by formalizing Waddington’s landscape metaphor. However, a rational method to build these landscape models remains an open problem. Here we study vulval development in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; by developing a framework based on Catastrophe Theory (CT) and approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to build data-fitted landscape models. We first identify the candidate qualitative landscapes, and then use CT to build the simplest model consistent with the data, which we quantitatively fit using ABC. The resulting model suggests that the underlying mechanism is a quantifiable two-step decision controlled by EGF and Notch-Delta signals, where a non-vulval/vulval decision is followed by a bistable transition to the two vulval states. This new model fits a broad set of data and makes several novel predictions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UhG6hhJfAHw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Several homeostatic mechanisms enable the brain to maintain desired levels of neuronal activity. One of these, homeostatic structural plasticity, has been reported to restore activity in networks disrupted by peripheral lesions by altering their neuronal connectivity. While multiple lesion experiments have studied the changes in neurite morphology that underlie modifications of synapses in these networks, the underlying mechanisms that drive these changes are yet to be explained. Evidence suggests that neuronal activity modulates neurite morphology and may stimulate neurites to selective sprout or retract to restore network activity levels. We developed a new spiking network model of peripheral lesioning and accurately reproduced the characteristics of network repair after deafferentation that are reported in experiments to study the activity dependent growth regimes of neurites. To ensure that our simulations closely resemble the behaviour of networks in the brain, we model deafferentation in a biologically realistic balanced network model that exhibits low frequency Asynchronous Irregular (AI) activity as observed in cerebral cortex. Our simulation results indicate that the re-establishment of activity in neurons both within and outside the deprived region, the Lesion Projection Zone (LPZ), requires opposite activity dependent growth rules for excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic elements. Analysis of these growth regimes indicates that they also contribute to the maintenance of activity levels in individual neurons. Furthermore, in our model, the directional formation of synapses that is observed in experiments requires that pre-synaptic excitatory and inhibitory elements also follow opposite growth rules. Lastly, we observe that our proposed structural plasticity growth rules and the inhibitory synaptic plasticity mechanism that also balances our AI network both contribute to the restoration of the network to pre-deafferentation stable activity levels.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yR-Sq_AD2TE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Shape is a defining feature of objects, and human observers can effortlessly compare shapes to determine how similar they are. Yet, to date, no image-computable model can predict how visually similar or different shapes appear. Such a model would be an invaluable tool for neuroscientists and could provide insights into computations underlying human shape perception. To address this need, we developed a model (‘ShapeComp’), based on over 100 shape features (e.g., area, compactness, Fourier descriptors). When trained to capture the variance in a database of &amp;gt;25,000 animal silhouettes, ShapeComp accurately predicts human shape similarity judgments between pairs of shapes without fitting any parameters to human data. To test the model, we created carefully selected arrays of complex novel shapes using a Generative Adversarial Network trained on the animal silhouettes, which we presented to observers in a wide range of tasks. Our findings show that incorporating multiple ShapeComp dimensions facilitates the prediction of human shape similarity across a small number of shapes, and also captures much of the variance in the multiple arrangements of many shapes. ShapeComp outperforms both conventional pixel-based metrics and state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks, and can also be used to generate perceptually uniform stimulus sets, making it a powerful tool for investigating shape and object representations in the human brain.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Pi5uf5AhT7M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Categorical judgments can systematically bias the perceptual interpretation of stimulus features. However, it remained unclear whether categorical judgments directly modify working memory representations or, alternatively, generate these biases via an inference process down-stream from working memory. To address this question we ran two novel psychophysical experiments in which human subjects had to reverse their categorical judgments about a stimulus feature, if incorrect, before providing an estimate of the feature. If categorical judgments indeed directly altered sensory representations in working memory, subjects’ estimates should reflect some aspects of their initial (incorrect) categorical judgment in those trials. We found no traces of the initial categorical judgment. Rather, subjects seemed to be able to flexibly switch their categorical judgment if needed and use the correct corresponding categorical prior to properly perform feature inference. A cross-validated model comparison also revealed that feedback may lead to selective memory recall such that only memory samples that are consistent with the categorical judgment are accepted for the inference process. Our results suggest that categorical judgments do not modify sensory information in working memory but rather act as top-down expectations in the subsequent sensory recall and inference process.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ACl1Niq_GPM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Embedding optimization reveals long-lasting history dependence in neural spiking activity</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/lJdScf-37tM/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Lucas Rudelt, Daniel González Marx, Michael Wibral, Viola Priesemann&lt;/p&gt;

Information processing can leave distinct footprints on the statistics of neural spiking. For example, efficient coding minimizes the statistical dependencies on the spiking history, while temporal integration of information may require the maintenance of information over different timescales. To investigate these footprints, we developed a novel approach to quantify history dependence within the spiking of a single neuron, using the mutual information between the entire past and current spiking. This measure captures how much past information is necessary to predict current spiking. In contrast, classical time-lagged measures of temporal dependence like the autocorrelation capture how long—potentially redundant—past information can still be read out. Strikingly, we find for model neurons that our method disentangles the &lt;i&gt;strength&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;timescale&lt;/i&gt; of history dependence, whereas the two are mixed in classical approaches. When applying the method to experimental data, which are necessarily of limited size, a reliable estimation of mutual information is only possible for a coarse temporal binning of past spiking, a so-called past embedding. To still account for the vastly different spiking statistics and potentially long history dependence of living neurons, we developed an embedding-optimization approach that does not only vary the number and size, but also an exponential stretching of past bins. For extra-cellular spike recordings, we found that the strength and timescale of history dependence indeed can vary independently across experimental preparations. While hippocampus indicated strong and long history dependence, in visual cortex it was weak and short, while in vitro the history dependence was strong but short. This work enables an information-theoretic characterization of history dependence in recorded spike trains, which captures a footprint of information processing that is beyond time-lagged measures of temporal dependence. To facilitate the application of the method, we provide practical guidelines and a toolbox.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lJdScf-37tM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Implications of diffusion and time-varying morphogen gradients for the dynamic positioning and precision of bistable gene expression boundaries</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Melinda Liu Perkins&lt;/p&gt;

The earliest models for how morphogen gradients guide embryonic patterning failed to account for experimental observations of temporal refinement in gene expression domains. Following theoretical and experimental work in this area, dynamic positional information has emerged as a conceptual framework to discuss how cells process spatiotemporal inputs into downstream patterns. Here, we show that diffusion determines the mathematical means by which bistable gene expression boundaries shift over time, and therefore how cells interpret positional information conferred from morphogen concentration. First, we introduce a metric for assessing reproducibility in boundary placement or precision in systems where gene products do not diffuse, but where morphogen concentrations are permitted to change in time. We show that the dynamics of the gradient affect the sensitivity of the final pattern to variation in initial conditions, with slower gradients reducing the sensitivity. Second, we allow gene products to diffuse and consider gene expression boundaries as propagating wavefronts with velocity modulated by local morphogen concentration. We harness this perspective to approximate a PDE model as an ODE that captures the position of the boundary in time, and demonstrate the approach with a preexisting model for Hunchback patterning in fruit fly embryos. We then propose a design that employs antiparallel morphogen gradients to achieve accurate boundary placement that is robust to scaling. Throughout our work we draw attention to tradeoffs among initial conditions, boundary positioning, and the relative timescales of network and gradient evolution. We conclude by suggesting that mathematical theory should serve to clarify not just our quantitative, but also our intuitive understanding of patterning processes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mEXsX8U--kQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;i&gt;Aspergillus fumigatus&lt;/i&gt; is a human fungal pathogen that can cause devastating pulmonary infections, termed “aspergilloses,” in individuals suffering immune imbalances or underlying lung conditions. As rapid adaptation to stress is crucial for the outcome of the host–pathogen interplay, here we investigated the role of the versatile posttranslational modification (PTM) persulfidation for both fungal virulence and antifungal host defense. We show that an &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;fumigatus&lt;/i&gt; mutant with low persulfidation levels is more susceptible to host-mediated killing and displays reduced virulence in murine models of infection. Additionally, we found that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the human gene encoding cystathionine γ-lyase (CTH) causes a reduction in cellular persulfidation and correlates with a predisposition of hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients to invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), as correct levels of persulfidation are required for optimal antifungal activity of recipients’ lung resident host cells. Importantly, the levels of host persulfidation determine the levels of fungal persulfidation, ultimately reflecting a host–pathogen functional correlation and highlighting a potential new therapeutic target for the treatment of aspergillosis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/OZifpfaWVlg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The glymphatic system plays an important role in clearing the amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau proteins that are closely linked to Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology. Glymphatic clearance, as well as Aβ accumulation, is highly dependent on sleep, but the sleep-dependent driving forces behind cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) movements essential to the glymphatic flux remain largely unclear. Recent studies have reported that widespread, high-amplitude spontaneous brain activations in the drowsy state and during sleep, which are shown as large global signal peaks in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI), are coupled with CSF movements, suggesting their potential link to glymphatic flux and metabolite clearance. By analyzing multimodal data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) project, here we showed that the coupling between the global fMRI signal and CSF influx is correlated with AD-related pathology, including various risk factors for AD, the severity of AD-related diseases, the cortical Aβ level, and cognitive decline over a 2-year follow-up. These results provide critical initial evidence for involvement of sleep-dependent global brain activity, as well as the associated physiological modulations, in the clearance of AD-related brain waste.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/lySWRRRKryk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Global biodiversity loss is a profound consequence of human activity. Disturbingly, biodiversity loss is greater than realized because of the unknown number of undocumented species. Conservation fundamentally relies on taxonomic recognition of species, but only a fraction of biodiversity is described. Here, we provide a new quantitative approach for prioritizing rigorous taxonomic research for conservation. We implement this approach in a highly diverse vertebrate group—Australian lizards and snakes. Of 870 species assessed, we identified 282 (32.4%) with taxonomic uncertainty, of which 17.6% likely comprise undescribed species of conservation concern. We identify 24 species in need of immediate taxonomic attention to facilitate conservation. Using a broadly applicable return-on-investment framework, we demonstrate the importance of prioritizing the fundamental work of identifying species before they are lost.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/y9QlVuTXNHI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: An in vitro model of tumor heterogeneity resolves genetic, epigenetic, and stochastic sources of cell state variability</title>

Tumor heterogeneity is a primary cause of treatment failure and acquired resistance in cancer patients. Even in cancers driven by a single mutated oncogene, variability in response to targeted therapies is well known. The existence of additional genomic alterations among tumor cells can only partially explain this variability. As such, nongenetic factors are increasingly seen as critical contributors to tumor relapse and acquired resistance in cancer. Here, we show that both genetic and nongenetic factors contribute to targeted drug response variability in an experimental model of tumor heterogeneity. We observe significant variability to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibition among and within multiple versions and clonal sublines of PC9, a commonly used EGFR mutant nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line. We resolve genetic, epigenetic, and stochastic components of this variability using a theoretical framework in which distinct genetic states give rise to multiple epigenetic “basins of attraction,” across which cells can transition driven by stochastic noise. Using mutational impact analysis, single-cell differential gene expression, and correlations among Gene Ontology (GO) terms to connect genomics to transcriptomics, we establish a baseline for genetic differences driving drug response variability among PC9 cell line versions. Applying the same approach to clonal sublines, we conclude that drug response variability in all but one of the sublines is due to epigenetic differences; in the other, it is due to genetic alterations. Finally, using a clonal drug response assay together with stochastic simulations, we attribute subclonal drug response variability within sublines to stochastic cell fate decisions and confirm that one subline likely contains genetic resistance mutations that emerged in the absence of drug treatment.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/-3GnOPaF4YY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24853?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Portacaval anastomosis (PCA) promoted spongiform degeneration at the cerebellar molecular layer. There was loss of Purkinje cells, microglia activation and increase expression of NLRP3 and aquaporin‐4. By NMR spectroscopy, there was reduction in osmolytes that can be cause the cellular edema. PCA rats showed a motor deficiency in rotarod test.

Abstract
The episodes of cerebral dysfunction, known as encephalopathy, are usually coincident with liver failure. The primary metabolic marker of liver diseases is the increase in blood ammonium, which promotes neuronal damage. In the present project, we used an experimental model of hepatic encephalopathy in male rats by portacaval anastomosis (PCA) surgery. Sham rats had a false operation. After 13 weeks of surgery, the most distinctive finding was vacuolar/spongiform neurodegeneration exclusively in the molecular layer of the cerebellum. This cerebellar damage was further characterized by metabolic, histopathological, and behavioral approaches. The results were as follows: (a) Cellular alterations, namely loss of Purkinje cells, morphological changes, such as swelling of astrocytes and Bergmann glia, and activation of microglia; (b) Cytotoxic edema, shown by an increase in aquaporin‐4 and N‐acetylaspartate and a reduction in taurine and choline‐derivate osmolytes; (c) Metabolic adjustments, noted by the elevation of circulating ammonium, enhanced presence of glutamine synthetase, and increase in glutamine and creatine/phosphocreatine; (d) Inflammasome activation, detected by the elevation of the marker NLRP3 and microglial activation; (e) Locomotor deficits in PCA rats as assessed by the Rotarod and open field tests. These results lead us to suggest that metabolic disturbances associated with PCA can generate the cerebellar damage that is similar to morphophysiological modifications observed in amyloidogenic disorders. In conclusion, we have characterized a distinctive cerebellar multi‐disruption accompanied by high levels of ammonium and associated with spongiform neurodegeneration in a model of hepatic hypofunctioning.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: ACSA‐2 and GLAST classify subpopulations of multipotent and glial‐restricted cerebellar precursors</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24842?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Glial cells of the cerebellum are still insufficiently classified. In this study we describe the subclassification of GLAST+ precursors in the prospective white matter using immunophenotyping, transcriptomics, and transplantation assays. A subclass of GLAST+ cells, which co‐express astrocyte cell surface antigen‐2 (ACSA‐2), generates only parenchymal astrocytes—as revealed by protein expression, their genetic signature and transplantation. The absence of the astrocyte marker (ACSA‐2) reveals GLAST+ cells to maintain a multipotent potential, giving rise to interneurons, glia, and Bergmann glia.

Abstract
The formation of the cerebellum is highly coordinated to obtain its characteristic morphology and all cerebellar cell types. During mouse postnatal development, cerebellar progenitors with astroglial‐like characteristics generate mainly astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. However, a subset of astroglial‐like progenitors found in the prospective white matter (PWM) produces astroglia and interneurons. Characterizing these cerebellar astroglia‐like progenitors and distinguishing their developmental fates is still elusive. Here, we reveal that astrocyte cell surface antigen‐2 (ACSA‐2), lately identified as ATPase, Na+/K+ transporting, beta 2 polypeptide, is expressed by glial precursors throughout postnatal cerebellar development. In contrast to common astrocyte markers, ACSA‐2 appears on PWM cells but is absent on Bergmann glia (BG) precursors. In the adult cerebellum, ACSA‐2 is broadly expressed extending to velate astrocytes in the granular layer, white matter astrocytes, and to a lesser extent to BG. Cell transplantation and transcriptomic analysis revealed that marker staining discriminates two postnatal progenitor pools. One subset is defined by the co‐expression of ACSA‐2 and GLAST and the expression of markers typical of parenchymal astrocytes. These are PWM precursors that are exclusively gliogenic. They produce predominantly white matter and granular layer astrocytes. Another subset is constituted by GLAST positive/ACSA‐2 negative precursors that express neurogenic and BG‐like progenitor genes. This population displays multipotency and gives rise to interneurons besides all glial types, including BG. In conclusion, this work reports about ACSA‐2, a marker that in combination with GLAST enables for the discrimination and isolation of multipotent and glia‐committed progenitors, which generate different types of cerebellar astrocytes.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.673684</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Golgi defects including Golgi fragmentation are pathological features of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). As a pathogenic factor in AD, amyloid precursor protein (APP) induces Golgi fragmentation in the soma. However, how APP regulates Golgi outposts (GOs) in dendrites remains unclear. Given that APP resides in and affects the movements of GOs, and in particular, reverses the distribution of multi-compartment GOs (mcGOs), we investigated the regulatory mechanism of mcGO movements in the Drosophila larvae. Knockdown experiments showed that the bidirectional mcGO movements were cooperatively controlled by the dynein heavy chain (Dhc) and kinesin heavy chain subunits. Notably, only Dhc mediated APP’s regulation of mcGO movements. Furthermore, by loss-of-function screening, the adaptor protein Sunday driver (Syd) was identified to mediate the APP-induced alteration of the direction of mcGO movements and dendritic defects. Collectively, by elucidating a model of bidirectional mcGO movements, we revealed the mechanism by which APP regulates the direction of mcGO movements. Our study therefore provides new insights into AD pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.660693</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a complex neurodegenerative disease caused by degeneration of motor neurons (MNs). ALS pathogenic features include accumulation of misfolded proteins, glutamate excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction at distal axon terminals, and neuronal cytoskeleton changes. Synergies between loss of C9orf72 functions and gain of function by toxic effects of repeat expansions also contribute to C9orf72-mediated pathogenesis. However, the impact of haploinsufficiency of C9orf72 on neurons and in synaptic functions requires further examination. As the motor neurons degenerate, the disease symptoms will lead to neurotransmission deficiencies in the brain, spinal cord, and neuromuscular junction. Altered neuronal excitability, synaptic morphological changes, and C9orf72 protein and DPR localization at the synapses, suggest a potential involvement of C9orf72 at synapses. In this review article, we provide a conceptual framework for assessing the putative involvement of C9orf72 as a synaptopathy, and we explore the underlying and common disease mechanisms with other neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, we reflect on the major challenges of understanding C9orf72-ALS as a synaptopathy focusing on integrating mitochondrial and neuronal cytoskeleton degeneration as biomarkers and potential targets to treat ALS neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.658662</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Noise exposure is the most important external factor causing acquired hearing loss in humans, and it is strongly associated with the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cochlea. Several studies reported that the administration of various compounds with antioxidant effects can treat oxidative stress-induced hearing loss. However, traditional systemic drug administration to the human inner ear is problematic and has not been successful in a clinical setting. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop rescue treatment for patients with acute acoustic injuries. Hydrogen gas has antioxidant effects, rapid distribution, and distributes systemically after inhalation.The purpose of this study was to determine the protective efficacy of a single dose of molecular hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) on cochlear structures. Guinea pigs were divided into six groups and sacrificed immediately after or at 1 or 2 weeks. The animals were exposed to broadband noise for 2 h directly followed by 1-h inhalation of 2% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or room air. Electrophysiological hearing thresholds using frequency-specific auditory brainstem response (ABR) were measured prior to noise exposure and before sacrifice. ABR thresholds were significantly lower in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-treated animals at 2 weeks after exposure, with significant preservation of outer hair cells in the entire cochlea. Quantification of synaptophysin immunoreactivity revealed that H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; inhalation protected the cochlear inner hair cell synaptic structures containing synaptophysin. The inflammatory response was greater in the stria vascularis, showing increased Iba1 due to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; inhalation.Repeated administration of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; inhalation may further improve the therapeutic effect. This animal model does not reproduce conditions in humans, highlighting the need for additional real-life studies in humans.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.655050</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Age-related decline in cognitive control and general slowing are prominent phenomena in aging research. These declines in cognitive functions have been shown to also involve age-related decline in brain structure. However, most evidence in support of these associations is based on cross-sectional data. Therefore, the aim of this study is to contrast cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses to re-examine if the relationship between age-related brain structure and cognitive function are similar between the two approaches. One hundred and two participants completed two sessions with an average interval of 2 years. All participants were assessed by questionnaires, a series of cognitive tasks, and they all underwent neuroimaging acquisition. The main results of this study show that the majority of the conclusions regarding age effect in cognitive control function and processing speed in the literature can be replicated based on the cross-sectional data. Conversely, when we followed up individuals over an average interval of 2 years, then we found much fewer significant relationships between age-related change in gray matter structure of the cognitive control network and age-related change in cognitive control function. Furthermore, there was no “initial age” effect in the relationships between age-related changes in brain structure and cognitive function. This finding suggests that the “aging” relationship between brain structure and cognitive function over a short period of time are independent of “initial age” difference at time point 1. The result of this study warrants the importance of longitudinal research for aging studies to elucidate actual aging processes on cognitive control function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Reconstruction of nitrergic neurons (NNs) found in one section of the representation of the forepaw of the rat in different cortical compartments in somatosensory area S1 and motor area M1. NNs are more densely packed in the upper layers (I–III) and more sparsely distributed in Layer V. Scale bar: 100 μm.







Abstract
Nitrergic neurons (NNs) are inhibitory neurons capable of releasing nitric oxide (NO) that are labeled with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase histochemistry. The rat primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortices are a favorable model to investigate NN populations by comparing their morphology, since these areas share the border of forepaw representation. The distribution of the Type I NN of the forepaw representation in the S1 and M1 cortices of the rat in different laminar compartments and the morphological parameters related to the cell body and dendritic arborization were measured and compared. We observed that the neuronal density in the S1 (130 NN/mm3) was higher than the neuronal density in the M1 (119 NN/mm3). Most NN neurons were multipolar (S1 with 58%; M1 with 69%), and a minority of the NN neurons were horizontal (S1 with 6%; M1 with 12%). NN found in S1 had a higher verticality index than NN found in M1, and no significant differences were observed for the other morphological parameters. We also demonstrated significant differences in most of the morphological parameters of the NN between different cortical compartments of S1 and M1. Our results indicate that the NN of the forepaw in S1 and M1 corresponds to a neuronal population, where the functionality is independent of the different types of sensory and motor processing. However, the morphological differences found between the cortical compartments of S1 and M1, as well as the higher density of NNs found in S1, indicate that the release of NO varies between the areas.</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Intrathecal Immunoglobulin M synthesis is an independent biomarker for higher disease activity and severity in multiple sclerosis</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26137?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
We aimed to determine whether in relapsing multiple sclerosis intrathecal IgM and IgG synthesis are associated with outcomes reflecting inflammatory activity and chronic worsening.


Methods
We compared CSF analysis, clinical and MRI data, and serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) levels at baseline and follow‐up in 530 patients with relapsing MS. Patients were categorized by presence of oligoclonal IgG bands (OCGB) and intrathecal synthesis of IgG and IgM (IgGIntrathecal Fraction (IF), IgMIF). Relations to time to first relapse, sNfL concentrations, T2w lesions, MS Severity Score (MSSS), and time to initiation of high efficacy therapy were analyzed in covariate adjusted statistical models.


Results
By categorical analysis, in patients with IgMIF median time to first relapse was 28 months shorter and MSSS was on average higher by 1.11 steps compared to those without intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis. Moreover, patients with IgMIF had higher sNfL concentrations, more new/enlarging T2w lesions and higher total T2w lesion counts (all p&amp;lt;/= 0.01). These associations were absent, or equally smaller in patients who were only positive for OCGB or OCGB/IgGIF.
Furthermore, quantitative analyses revealed that in patients with IgMIF ≥ median, time to first relapse and to initiation of high efficacy therapy was shorter by 32 and by 203 months (both p &amp;lt; 0.01), as compared to patients with IgMIF &amp;lt; median; dose‐dependent associations were also found for IgMIF but not for IgGIF with MRI defined disease activity and sNfL.


Interpretation
This large study supports the value of intrathecal IgM synthesis as an independent biomarker of disease activity and severity in relapsing MS.

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: A causal role for the pulvinar in coordinating task‐independent cortico–cortical interactions</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25193?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
The pulvinar is the largest nucleus in the primate thalamus and has topographically organized connections with multiple cortical areas, thereby forming extensive cortico‐pulvino‐cortical input–output loops. Neurophysiological studies have suggested a role for these transthalamic pathways in regulating information transmission between cortical areas. However, evidence for a causal role of the pulvinar in regulating cortico–cortical interactions is sparse and it is not known whether pulvinar's influences on cortical networks are task‐dependent or, alternatively, reflect more basic large‐scale network properties that maintain functional connectivity across networks regardless of active task demands. In the current study, under passive viewing conditions, we conducted simultaneous electrophysiological recordings from ventral (area V4) and dorsal (lateral intraparietal area [LIP]) nodes of macaque visual system, while reversibly inactivating the dorsal part of the lateral pulvinar (dPL), which shares common anatomical connectivity with V4 and LIP, to probe a causal role of the pulvinar. Our results show a significant reduction in local field potential phase coherence between LIP and V4 in low frequencies (4–15 Hz) following muscimol injection into dPL. At the local level, no significant changes in firing rates or LFP power were observed in LIP or in V4 following dPL inactivation. Synchronization between pulvinar spikes and cortical LFP phase decreased in low frequencies (4–15 Hz) both in LIP and V4, while the low frequency synchronization between LIP spikes and pulvinar phase increased. These results indicate a causal role for pulvinar in synchronizing neural activity between interconnected cortical nodes of a large‐scale network, even in the absence of an active task state.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.655886</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Beta oscillations have been predominantly observed in sensorimotor cortices and basal ganglia structures and they are thought to be involved in somatosensory processing and motor control. Although beta activity is a distinct feature of healthy and pathological sensorimotor processing, the role of this rhythm is still under debate. Here we review recent findings about the role of beta oscillations during experimental manipulations (i.e., drugs and brain stimulation) and their alteration in aging and pathology. We show how beta changes when learning new motor skills and its potential to integrate sensory input with prior contextual knowledge. We conclude by discussing a novel methodological approach analyzing beta oscillations as a series of transient bursting events.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.673740</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging are emerging as powerful tools to study brain structures and functions. The skull introduces significant distortion and attenuation of the ultrasound signals deteriorating image quality. For biological studies employing rodents, craniotomy is often times performed to enhance image qualities. However, craniotomy is unsuitable for longitudinal studies, where a long-term cranial window is needed to prevent repeated surgeries. Here, we propose a mouse model to eliminate sound blockage by the top portion of the skull, while minimum physiological perturbation to the imaged object is incurred. With the new mouse model, no craniotomy is needed before each imaging experiment. The effectiveness of our method was confirmed by three imaging systems: photoacoustic computed tomography, ultrasound imaging, and photoacoustic mesoscopy. Functional photoacoustic imaging of the mouse brain hemodynamics was also conducted. We expect new applications to be enabled by the new mouse model for photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Miniaturized implantable devices play a crucial role in neural interfaces by monitoring and modulating neural activities on the peripheral and central nervous systems. Research efforts toward a compact wireless closed-loop system stimulating the nerve automatically according to the user's condition have been maintained. These systems have several advantages over open-loop stimulation systems such as reduction in both power consumption and side effects of continuous stimulation. Furthermore, a compact and wireless device consuming low energy alleviates foreign body reactions and risk of frequent surgical operations. Unfortunately, however, the miniaturized closed-loop neural interface system induces several hardware design challenges such as neural activity recording with severe stimulation artifact, real-time stimulation artifact removal, and energy-efficient wireless power delivery. Here, we will review recent approaches toward the miniaturized closed-loop neural interface system with integrated circuit (IC) techniques.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Substantia Nigra Radiomics Feature Extraction of Parkinson’s Disease Based on Magnitude Images of Susceptibility-Weighted Imaging</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.646617</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;It is reported that radiomic features extracted from quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) had promising clinical value for the diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). We aimed to explore the usefulness of radiomics features based on magnitude images to distinguish PD from non-PD controls.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We retrospectively recruited PD patients and controls who underwent brain 3.0T MR including susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI). A total of 396 radiomics features were extracted from the SN of 95 PD patients and 95 non-PD controls based on SWI. Intra-/inter-observer correlation coefficients (ICCs) were applied to measure the observer agreement for the radiomic feature extraction. Then the patients were randomly grouped into training and validation sets in a ratio of 7:3. In the training set, the maximum correlation minimum redundancy algorithm (mRMR) and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) were conducted to filter and choose the optimized subset of features, and a radiomics signature was constructed. Moreover, radiomics signatures were constructed by different machine learning models. Area under the ROC curves (AUCs) were applied to evaluate the predictive performance of the models. Then correlation analysis was performed to evaluate the correlation between the optimized features and clinical factors.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The intro-observer CC ranged from 0.82 to 1.0, and the inter-observer CC ranged from 0.77 to 0.99. The LASSO logistic regression model showed good prediction efficacy in the training set [AUC = 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI, 0.74–0.88)] and the validation set [AUC = 0.81, 95% CI (0.68–0.91)]. One radiomic feature showed a moderate negative correlation with Hoehn-Yahr stage (r = −0.49, P = 0.012).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Radiomic predictive features based on SWI magnitude images could reflect the Hoehn-Yahr stage of PD to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Developmental Changes in Pyramidal Cell Morphology in Multiple Visual Cortical Areas Using Cluster Analysis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.667696</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal morphology is characterized by salient features such as complex axonal and dendritic arbors. In the mammalian brain, variations in dendritic morphology among cell classes, brain regions, and animal species are thought to underlie known differences in neuronal function. In this work, we obtained a large dataset from http://neuromorpho.org/ comprising layer III pyramidal cells in different cortical areas of the ventral visual pathway (V1, V2, V4, TEO, and TE) of the macaque monkey at different developmental stages. We performed an in depth quantitative analysis of pyramidal cell morphology throughout development in an effort to determine which aspects mature early in development and which features require a protracted period of maturation. We were also interested in establishing if developmental changes in morphological features occur simultaneously or hierarchically in multiple visual cortical areas. We addressed these questions by performing principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis on relevant morphological features. Our analysis indicates that the maturation of pyramidal cell morphology is largely based on early development of topological features in most visual cortical areas. Moreover, the maturation of pyramidal cell morphology in V1, V2, V4, TEO, and TE is characterized by unique developmental trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Event-Based Sensing and Signal Processing in the Visual, Auditory, and Olfactory Domain: A Review</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.610446</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The nervous systems converts the physical quantities sensed by its primary receptors into trains of events that are then processed in the brain. The unmatched efficiency in information processing has long inspired engineers to seek brain-like approaches to sensing and signal processing. The key principle pursued in neuromorphic sensing is to shed the traditional approach of periodic sampling in favor of an event-driven scheme that mimicks sampling as it occurs in the nervous system, where events are preferably emitted upon the change of the sensed stimulus. In this paper we highlight the advantages and challenges of event-based sensing and signal processing in the visual, auditory and olfactory domains. We also provide a survey of the literature covering neuromorphic sensing and signal processing in all three modalities. Our aim is to facilitate research in event-based sensing and signal processing by providing a comprehensive overview of the research performed previously as well as highlighting conceptual advantages, current progress and future challenges in the field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Transparent Touch: Insights From Model Systems on Epidermal Control of Somatosensory Innervation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.680345</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Somatosensory neurons (SSNs) densely innervate our largest organ, the skin, and shape our experience of the world, mediating responses to sensory stimuli including touch, pressure, and temperature. Historically, epidermal contributions to somatosensation, including roles in shaping innervation patterns and responses to sensory stimuli, have been understudied. However, recent work demonstrates that epidermal signals dictate patterns of SSN skin innervation through a variety of mechanisms including targeting afferents to the epidermis, providing instructive cues for branching morphogenesis, growth control and structural stability of neurites, and facilitating neurite-neurite interactions. Here, we focus onstudies conducted in worms (Caenorhabditis elegans), fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster), and zebrafish (Danio rerio): prominent model systems in which anatomical and genetic analyses have defined fundamental principles by which epidermal cells govern SSN development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Deciphering in silico the Role of Mutated NaV1.1 Sodium Channels in Enhancing Trigeminal Nociception in Familial Hemiplegic Migraine Type 3</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.644047</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Familial hemiplegic migraine type 3 (FHM3) is caused by gain-of-function mutations in the SCN1A gene that encodes the α1 subunit of voltage-gated Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.1 sodium channels. The high level of expression of Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.1 channels in peripheral trigeminal neurons may lead to abnormal nociceptive signaling thus contributing to migraine pain. Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.1 dysfunction is relevant also for other neurological disorders, foremost epilepsy and stroke that are comorbid with migraine. Here we used computer modeling to test the functional role of FHM3-mutated Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.1 channels in mechanisms of trigeminal pain. The activation of Aδ-fibers was studied for two algogens, ATP and 5-HT, operating through P2X3 and 5-HT3 receptors, respectively, at trigeminal nerve terminals. In WT Aδ-fibers of meningeal afferents, Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.1 channels efficiently participate in spike generation induced by ATP and 5-HT supported by Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.6 channels. Of the various FHM3 mutations tested, the L263V missense mutation, with a longer activation state and lower activation voltage, resulted in the most pronounced spiking activity. In contrast, mutations that result in a loss of Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.1 function largely reduced firing of trigeminal nerve fibers. The combined activation of P2X3 and 5-HT3 receptors and branching of nerve fibers resulted in very prolonged and high-frequency spiking activity in the mutants compared to WT. We identified, in silico, key determinants of long-lasting nociceptive activity in FHM3-mutated Aδ-fibers that naturally express P2X3 and 5-HT3 receptors and suggest mutant-specific correction options. Modeled trigeminal nerve firing was significantly higher for FHM3 mutations, compared to WT, suggesting that pronounced nociceptive signaling may contribute to migraine pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Towards a Bio-Inspired Real-Time Neuromorphic Cerebellum</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.622870</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This work presents the first simulation of a large-scale, bio-physically constrained cerebellum model performed on neuromorphic hardware. A model containing 97,000 neurons and 4.2 million synapses is simulated on the SpiNNaker neuromorphic system. Results are validated against a baseline simulation of the same model executed with NEST, a popular spiking neural network simulator using generic computational resources and double precision floating point arithmetic. Individual cell and network-level spiking activity is validated in terms of average spike rates, relative lead or lag of spike times, and membrane potential dynamics of individual neurons, and SpiNNaker is shown to produce results in agreement with NEST. Once validated, the model is used to investigate how to accelerate the simulation speed of the network on the SpiNNaker system, with the future goal of creating a real-time neuromorphic cerebellum. Through detailed communication profiling, peak network activity is identified as one of the main challenges for simulation speed-up. Propagation of spiking activity through the network is measured, and will inform the future development of accelerated execution strategies for cerebellum models on neuromorphic hardware. The large ratio of granule cells to other cell types in the model results in high levels of activity converging onto few cells, with those cells having relatively larger time costs associated with the processing of communication. Organizing cells on SpiNNaker in accordance with their spatial position is shown to reduce the peak communication load by 41%. It is hoped that these insights, together with alternative parallelization strategies, will pave the way for real-time execution of large-scale, bio-physically constrained cerebellum models on SpiNNaker. This in turn will enable exploration of cerebellum-inspired controllers for neurorobotic applications, and execution of extended duration simulations over timescales that would currently be prohibitive using conventional computational platforms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Developmental Differences in Neocortex Neurogenesis and Maturation Between the Altricial Dwarf Rabbit and Precocial Guinea Pig</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.678385</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mammals are born on a precocial–altricial continuum. Altricial species produce helpless neonates with closed distant organs incapable of locomotion, whereas precocial species give birth to well-developed young that possess sophisticated sensory and locomotor capabilities. Previous studies suggest that distinct patterns of cortex development differ between precocial and altricial species. This study compares patterns of neocortex neurogenesis and maturation in the precocial guinea pig and altricial dwarf rabbit, both belonging to the taxon of Glires. We show that the principal order of neurodevelopmental events is preserved in the neocortex of both species. Moreover, we show that neurogenesis starts at a later postconceptional day and takes longer in absolute gestational days in the precocial than the altricial neocortex. Intriguingly, our data indicate that the dwarf rabbit neocortex contains a higher abundance of highly proliferative basal progenitors than the guinea pig, which might underlie its higher encephalization quotient, demonstrating that the amount of neuron production is determined by complex regulation of multiple factors. Furthermore, we show that the guinea pig neocortex exhibits a higher maturation status at birth, thus providing evidence for the notions that precocial species might have acquired the morphological machinery required to attain their high functional state at birth and that brain expansion in the precocial newborn is mainly due to prenatally initiating processes of gliogenesis and neuron differentiation instead of increased neurogenesis. Together, this study reveals important insights into the timing and cellular differences that regulate mammalian brain growth and maturation and provides a better understanding of the evolution of mammalian altriciality and presociality.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Three-Dimensional Structure of Dendritic Spines Revealed by Volume Electron Microscopy Techniques</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.627368</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electron microscopy (EM)-based synaptology is a fundamental discipline for achieving a complex wiring diagram of the brain. A quantitative understanding of synaptic ultrastructure also serves as a basis to estimate the relative magnitude of synaptic transmission across individual circuits in the brain. Although conventional light microscopic techniques have substantially contributed to our ever-increasing understanding of the morphological characteristics of the putative synaptic junctions, EM is the gold standard for systematic visualization of the synaptic morphology. Furthermore, a complete three-dimensional reconstruction of an individual synaptic profile is required for the precise quantitation of different parameters that shape synaptic transmission. While volumetric imaging of synapses can be routinely obtained from the transmission EM (TEM) imaging of ultrathin sections, it requires an unimaginable amount of effort and time to reconstruct very long segments of dendrites and their spines from the serial section TEM images. The challenges of low throughput EM imaging have been addressed to an appreciable degree by the development of automated EM imaging tools that allow imaging and reconstruction of dendritic segments in a realistic time frame. Here, we review studies that have been instrumental in determining the three-dimensional ultrastructure of synapses. With a particular focus on dendritic spine synapses in the rodent brain, we discuss various key studies that have highlighted the structural diversity of spines, the principles of their organization in the dendrites, their presynaptic wiring patterns, and their activity-dependent structural remodeling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Different Modulatory Effects of Cognitive Training and Aerobic Exercise on Resting State Functional Connectivity of Entorhinal Cortex in Community-Dwelling Older Adults</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.655245</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The entorhinal cortex (EC) plays an essential role in age-related cognitive decline. However, the effect of functional connectivity (FC) changes between EC and other cerebral cortices on cognitive function remains unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the modulation of two interventions (cognitive training and aerobic exercise) on EC-FC in community-dwelling older adults. In total, 94 healthy older adults aged between 65 and 75 years were assigned to either the cognitive training or aerobic exercise group to receive 24 sessions over 12 weeks, or to a control group. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed at both baseline and 12-month follow-up. Compared to the cognitive training group, the aerobic exercise group showed greater EC-FC in the bilateral middle temporal gyrus, right supramarginal gyrus, left angular gyrus, and right postcentral gyrus. Compared to the control group, the cognitive training group had a decreased EC-FC in the right hippocampus, right middle temporal gyrus, left angular gyrus, and right postcentral gyrus and an increased EC-FC in the bilateral pallidum, while the aerobic exercise group showed increased EC-FC between the right medial prefrontal cortex(mPFC), bilateral pallidum, and right precuneus. Baseline EC-FC in the mPFC was positively correlated with the visuospatial/constructional index score of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status. In the cognitive training group, EC-FC value changes in the right hippocampus were negatively correlated with changes in the RBANS delayed memory index score, while in the aerobic exercise group, EC-FC value changes in the left angular gyrus were positively correlated with changes in the RBANS attention index score. These findings support the hypothesis that both cognitive training and aerobic exercise can modulate EC-FC in aging populations but through different neural pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.650371</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many clinical symptoms of sporadic Parkinson’s disease (sPD) cannot be completely explained by a lesion of the simple typical extrapyramidal circuit between the striatum and substantia nigra. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the new potential damaged pathogenesis of other brain regions associated with the multiple and complex clinical symptoms of sPD through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A total of 65 patients with mid-stage sPD and 35 healthy controls were recruited in this study. Cortical structural connectivity was assessed by seed-based analysis using the vertex-based morphology of MRI. Seven different clusters in the brain regions of cortical thickness thinning derived from the regression analysis using brain size as covariates between sPD and control were selected as seeds. Results showed that the significant alteration of cortical structural connectivity mainly occurred in the bilateral frontal orbital, opercular, triangular, precentral, rectus, supplementary-motor, temporal pole, angular, Heschl, parietal, supramarginal, postcentral, precuneus, occipital, lingual, cuneus, Rolandic-opercular, cingulum, parahippocampal, calcarine, olfactory, insula, paracentral-lobule, and fusiform regions at the mid-stage of sPD. These findings suggested that the extensive alteration of cortical structural connectivity is one of possible pathogenesis resulting in the multiple and complex clinical symptoms in sPD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Association Between Postoperative Long-Term Heart Rate Variability and Postoperative Delirium in Elderly Patients Undergoing Orthopedic Surgery: A Prospective Cohort Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.646253</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common complication after orthopedic surgery in elderly patients. The elderly may experience drastic changes in autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity and circadian rhythm disorders after surgery. Therefore, we intend to explore the relationship between postoperative long-term heart rate (HR) variability (HRV), as a measure of ANS activity and circadian rhythm, and occurrence of POD in elderly patients.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The study population of this cohort was elderly patients over 60 years of age who scheduled for orthopedic surgery under spinal anesthesia. Patients were screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria before surgery. Then, participants were invited to wear a Holter monitor on the first postoperative day to collect 24-h electrocardiographic (ECG) data. Parameters in the time domain [the standard deviation of the normal-to-normal (NN) intervals (SDNN), mean of the standard deviations of all the NN intervals for each 5-min segment of a 24-h HRV recording (SDNNI), and the root mean square of successive differences of the NN intervals (RMSSD)] and frequency domain [heart rate (HR), high frequency (HF), low frequency (LF), very low frequency (VLF), ultra low frequency (ULF), and total power (TP)] were calculated. Assessment of delirium was performed daily up to the seventh postoperative day using the Chinese version of the 3-Min Diagnostic Interview for CAM-defined Delirium (3D-CAM). The relationship between HRV and POD, as well as the association between HRV and duration of POD, was assessed.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Of the 294 cases that finally completed the follow-up, 60 cases developed POD. Among the HRV parameters, SDNNI, VLF, and ULF were related to the occurrence of POD. After adjustment for potential confounders, the correlation between HRV indices and POD disappeared. Through stratified analysis, two significant negative correlations emerged: ULF in young-old participants and SDNNI, VLF, and ULF in male patients.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The lower HRV parameters may be related to the occurrence of POD, and this correlation is more significant in young-old and male patients. ANS disorders and rhythm abnormalities reflected by HRV changes may represent a possible mechanism that promotes POD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: A common genetic variant in fatty acid amide hydrolase is linked to alterations in fear extinction neural circuitry in a racially diverse, nonclinical sample of adults</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24860?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Genetic variation in a key neuromodulatory enzyme of the endocannabinoid system is linked to alterations in fear extinction neural circuitry. Variation in this system may help identify individuals who are at risk of developing a trauma‐related disorder or may benefit from exposure‐based therapies.

Abstract
Poor fear extinction learning and recall are linked to the development of fear‐based disorders, like posttraumatic stress disorder, and are associated with aberrant activation of fear‐related neural circuitry. This includes greater amygdala activation during extinction learning and lesser hippocampal and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activation during recall. Emerging data indicate that genetic variation in fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH C385A; rs324420) is associated with increased peripheral endocannabinoid (eCB) levels and lesser threat‐related amygdala reactivity. Preclinical studies link increased eCB signaling to better extinction learning and recall, thus FAAH C385A may protect against the development of trauma‐related psychopathology by facilitating extinction learning. However, how this FAAH variant affects fear extinction neural circuitry remains unknown. In the present study, we used a novel, immersive‐reality fear extinction paradigm paired with functional neuroimaging to assess FAAH C385A effects on fear‐related neural circuitry and conditioned fear responding (US expectancy ratings, subjective units of distress, and skin conductance responding) in healthy adults from an urban area (Detroit, MI; N = 59; C/C = 35, A‐carrier = 24). We found lesser amygdala activation in A‐allele carriers, compared to C/C homozygotes, during early extinction recall. Likewise, we found lesser dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and greater hippocampus activation in early extinction learning in A‐carriers compared to C/C homozygotes. We found no effects of FAAH C385A on vmPFC activation or behavioral fear indices. These data support and extend previous findings that FAAH genetic variation, associated with increased eCB signaling and subsequent enhanced fear extinction, may predict individual differences in successful fear learning.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24856?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) sense glutamate released at synapses via direct synaptic contacts and through volume transmission, which regulates the OPC stem cell like property of self‐renewal. In this study, we show that blocking synaptic transmission using botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A) significantly decreased OPC numbers and resulted in cellular atrophy in vivo in the adult mouse hippocampus. Adult OPCs are responsible for life‐long generation of myelinating oligodendrocytes and dysregulation of OPC function would potentially decrease their capacity for repair in pathological scenarios characterized by decreased synaptic activity, such as Multiple Sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease.
​

Abstract
Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) are responsible for generating oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells of the CNS. Life‐long myelination is promoted by neuronal activity and is essential for neural network plasticity and learning. OPCs are known to contact synapses and it is proposed that neuronal synaptic activity in turn regulates their behavior. To examine this in the adult, we performed unilateral injection of the synaptic blocker botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A) into the hippocampus of adult mice. We confirm BoNT/A cleaves SNAP‐25 in the CA1 are of the hippocampus, which has been proven to block neurotransmission. Notably, BoNT/A significantly decreased OPC density and caused their shrinkage, as determined by immunolabeling for the OPC marker NG2. Furthermore, BoNT/A resulted in an overall decrease in the number of OPC processes, as well as a decrease in their lengths and branching frequency. These data indicate that synaptic activity is important for maintaining adult OPC numbers and cellular integrity, which is relevant to pathophysiological scenarios characterized by dysregulation of synaptic activity, such as age‐related cognitive decline, Multiple Sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Upregulation of eIF4E, but not other translation initiation factors, in dendritic spines during memory formation</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25158?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Memory formation requires initiation of new protein synthesis as well as protein synthesis in dendrites, but it is unknown whether initiation can happen within dendritic spines. We combined immunolabeling with serial section 3D electron microscopy to examine the distribution of three initiation factors, eIF4E, eIF4G1, and eIF2α in dendritic spines of the lateral amygdala during formation of a Pavlovian conditioning memory. Top row: Electron micrographs showing labeled spines (arrows) with synapses (arrowheads). Bottom left: Segment of dendrite reconstructed from serial sections with synapses shown in red. Bottom right: The percentage of spines containing labeling for eIF4E was higher after training, but there were no differences for eIF4G1 or eIF2α labeling.







Abstract
Local translation can provide a rapid, spatially targeted supply of new proteins in distal dendrites to support synaptic changes that underlie learning. Learning and memory are especially sensitive to manipulations of translational control mechanisms, particularly those that target the initiation step, and translation initiation at synapses could be a means of maintaining synapse specificity during plasticity. Initiation predominantly occurs via recruitment of ribosomes to the 5′ mRNA cap by complexes of eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs), and the interaction between eIF4E and eIF4G1 is a particularly important target of translational control pathways. Pharmacological inhibition of eIF4E–eIF4G1 binding impairs formation of memory for aversive Pavlovian conditioning as well as the accompanying increase in polyribosomes in the heads of dendritic spines in the lateral amygdala (LA). This is consistent with a role for initiation at synapses in memory formation, but whether eIFs are even present near synapses is unknown. To determine whether dendritic spines contain eIFs and whether eIF distribution is affected by learning, we combined immunolabeling with serial section transmission electron microscopy (ssTEM) volume reconstructions of LA dendrites after Pavlovian conditioning. Labeling for eIF4E, eIF4G1, and eIF2α—another key target of regulation—occurred in roughly half of dendritic spines, but learning effects were only found for eIF4E, which was upregulated in the heads of dendritic spines. Our results support the possibility of regulated translation initiation as a means of synapse‐specific protein targeting during learning and are consistent with the model of eIF4E availability as a central point of control.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Synaptic inputs to broad thorny ganglion cells in macaque retina</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25156?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>These are the identified wide‐field and medium‐field amacrine cells that made synapses onto a broad thorny ganglion cell (purple) in central macaque retina. The wide field amacrine cells included three wiry amacrine cells (green), a semilunar cell (aqua), and a stellate wavy cell (yellow). The medium‐field cells included a starburst amacrine cell (red) and a spiny amacrine cell (orange). These amacrine cell inputs are expected to mediate the responses of the broad thorny ganglion cells to stimuli outside their classical receptive fields.







Abstract
In primates, broad thorny retinal ganglion cells are highly sensitive to small, moving stimuli. They have tortuous, fine dendrites with many short, spine‐like branches that occupy three contiguous strata in the middle of the inner plexiform layer. The neural circuits that generate their responses to moving stimuli are not well‐understood, and that was the goal of this study. A connectome from central macaque retina was generated by serial block‐face scanning electron microscopy, a broad thorny cell was reconstructed, and its synaptic inputs were analyzed. It received fewer than 2% of its inputs from both ON and OFF types of bipolar cells; the vast majority of its inputs were from amacrine cells. The presynaptic amacrine cells were reconstructed, and seven types were identified based on their characteristic morphology. Two types of narrow‐field cells, knotty bistratified Type 1 and wavy multistratified Type 2, were identified. Two types of medium‐field amacrine cells, ON starburst and spiny, were also presynaptic to the broad thorny cell. Three types of wide‐field amacrine cells, wiry Type 2, stellate wavy, and semilunar Type 2, also made synapses onto the broad thorny cell. Physiological experiments using a macaque retinal preparation in vitro confirmed that broad thorny cells received robust excitatory input from both the ON and the OFF pathways. Given the paucity of bipolar cell inputs, it is likely that amacrine cells provided much of the excitatory input, in addition to inhibitory input.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: CX3CR1 mutation alters synaptic and astrocytic protein expression, topographic gradients, and response latencies in the auditory brainstem</title>

	<content:encoded>Mice lacking the microglial receptor CX3CR1 display several phenotypes in the auditory brainstem. They have normal pruning in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) and increased expression of mature astrocyte markers. They have normal auditory brainstem recording (ABR) thresholds, but the ABR latencies are decreased. They show increased expression of inhibitory presynaptic terminal markers, possibly reflecting impaired inhibitory pruning. Finally, CX3CR1−/− mice lack the tonotopic gradients seen for cell body size and calyx of Held size in the MNTB.







Abstract
The precise and specialized circuitry in the auditory brainstem develops through adaptations of cellular and molecular signaling. We previously showed that elimination of microglia during development impairs synaptic pruning that leads to maturation of the calyx of Held, a large encapsulating synapse that terminates on neurons of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB). Microglia depletion also led to a decrease in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker for mature astrocytes. Here, we investigated the role of signaling through the fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1), which is expressed by microglia and mediates communication with neurons. CX3CR1−/− and wild‐type mice were studied before and after hearing onset and at 9 weeks of age. Levels of GFAP were significantly increased in the MNTB in mutants at 9 weeks. Pruning was unaffected at the calyx of Held, but we found an increase in expression of glycinergic synaptic marker in mutant mice at P14, suggesting an effect on maturation of inhibitory inputs. We observed disrupted tonotopic gradients of neuron and calyx size in MNTB in mutant mice. Auditory brainstem recording (ABR) revealed that CX3CR1−/− mice had normal thresholds and amplitudes but decreased latencies and interpeak latencies, particularly for the highest frequencies. These results demonstrate that disruption of fractalkine signaling has a significant effect on auditory brainstem development. Our findings highlight the importance of neuron–microglia–astrocyte communication in pruning of inhibitory synapses and establishment of tonotopic gradients early in postnatal development.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Brain‐wide mapping of presynaptic inputs to basolateral amygdala neurons</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25149?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Using monosynaptic rabies virus tracing, we have identified the distribution of input cells to basolateral amygdala (BLA) neuronal subtypes defined by axonal projection patterns. Overall, central nucleus of amygdala‐, nucleus accumbens‐, ventral hippocampus‐projecting BLA neurons receive similar monosynaptic input from various brain regions. However, there are some preferential input patterns among the subtypes, which are likely to be attributed to the differential localization of the starter cells.







Abstract
The basolateral amygdala (BLA), a region critical for emotional processing, is the limbic hub that is connected with various brain regions. BLA neurons are classified into different subtypes that exhibit differential projection patterns and mediate distinct emotional behaviors; however, little is known about their presynaptic input patterns. In this study, we employed projection‐specific monosynaptic rabies virus tracing to identify the direct monosynaptic inputs to BLA subtypes. We found that each neuronal subtype receives long‐range projection input from specific brain regions. In contrast to their specific axonal projection patterns, all BLA neuronal subtypes exhibited relatively similar input patterns. This anatomical organization supports the idea that the BLA is a central integrator that associates sensory information in different modalities with valence and sends associative information to behaviorally relevant brain regions.</content:encoded>
